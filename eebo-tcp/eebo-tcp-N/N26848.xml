            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Obligation to love and obey GOD which ari≈øes from the perpetual depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of men, <hi>as intelligent creatures,</hi> upon GOD, con≈øidered as their CREATOR, is the religion of nature. The relation formed by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence obliges them to be devoted to the ≈øervice and glory of him who made, pre≈øerves and governs them. In this religion GOD the CREATOR is all and in all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:035738_0004_10064F41D04901A0"/>Revealed religion is that obligation to love and obey GOD, which re≈øults from the total dependence of men, <hi>as ≈øinners,</hi> upon GOD con≈øidered as their REDEEMER. The rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produced by this dependence obliges them to be devoted to the ≈øervice and glory of him who has atoned for their ≈øins, and is become the LORD their Righteou≈øne≈øs. In this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion GOD the REDEEMER is all and in all.</p>
            <p>The Apo≈øtle adopts this very principle, and confirms it in the text by terms the mo≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øive and unequivocal.‚Äî"There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Greek nor Jew, circumci≈øion nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumci≈øion, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but CHRIST is all and in all."</p>
            <p>Believers are ri≈øen with CHRIST. They are therefore to place their affections upon things above‚Äîto mortify their members which are upon earth‚Äîto put off the old man‚Äîand put on the new.‚ÄîFrom the≈øe duties, no exemption can be pleaded; for the omi≈ø≈øion of them, no excu≈øe admitted. The learned and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the civilized and the ≈øavage, the Greek and the Jew, all who believe, without di≈øtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nation, name or condition, are brought into the ≈øame relation to GOD, renewed into the ≈øame in age, and bound to univer≈øal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> by the ≈øame principle‚Äîfor CHRIST is all and in all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:035738_0005_10064F435A433C70"/>The phra≈øe expre≈ø≈øes in a ≈øummary manner every thing that can be predicated of the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. It is applied in the pa≈ø≈øage before us and in Ephe≈ø. i. 23, to the divine REDEEMER, and in 1 Cor. xv. 28, to GOD in the mo≈øt exten≈øive view, comprehending every relation he ≈øu≈øtains to his intelligent creatures.</p>
            <p>CHRIST <hi>is all,</hi> he is every thing e≈ø≈øential in the ≈øalvation of ≈øinners; he is this to all and <hi>in all,</hi> the happy objects of his love. There are no local or per≈øonal di≈øcriminations. No exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive privileges or monopoly of benefits. "Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there ≈øalvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we mu≈øt be ≈øaved." He is the ≈øame LORD, and his power and grace the ≈øame for all, and to all who call upon him.</p>
            <p>The fulne≈øs of the REDEEMER is frequently inculcated, in ≈øimilar comprehen≈øive ≈øentences. David ≈øays of him, "all my ≈øprings are in thee"<note n="*" place="bottom">P≈øal. lxxxvii. 7.</note>‚Äî"the LORD is my rock, and my fortre≈øs, and my deliverer, my GOD, my ≈øtrength"<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">P≈øal. xviii. 2.</note>"the LORD is my light and my ≈øalvation‚Äîthe LORD is the ≈øtrength of my life."<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">P≈øal. xxvii. 1.</note> Paul calls him "the captain of ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion"<note n="¬ß" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 10.</note>‚Äî"the author and fini≈øher of our faith."<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 2.</note>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:035738_0006_10064F44F648ED48"/>
And the ble≈ø≈øed Saviour declares concerning him≈øelf, "I am Alpha and Omega‚Äîthe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the ending‚Äîthe fir≈øt and the la≈øt."<note n="¬∂" place="bottom">Rev. i. 8, 17.</note> The≈øe, and innumerable pa≈ø≈øages which a≈øcribe to him the glory of pardon and peace, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent comfort and future happine≈øs, are ≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in the emphatical words of the text, CHRIST IS ALL AND IN ALL.</p>
            <p>CHRIST is an official name. It re≈øpects the exalted offices the REDEEMER ≈øu≈øtained, and the va≈øt work, which as GOD and man in one per≈øon he accompli≈øhed.</p>
            <p>He mu≈øt be man, a perfect man, that the law may be obeyed and ≈øatisfied, in the ≈øame nature which had ≈øinned. He mu≈øt be GOD, the true GOD, becau≈øe no mere creature po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øes a right to lay down his life and a≈ø≈øign his merits to others‚Äîbecau≈øe, it requires infinite wi≈ødom, love and power, to procure for and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ≈øalvation to the guilty and depraved‚Äîand becau≈øe, redemption con≈øtitutes a new claim to an exclu≈øive property in, and dominion over the redeemed. But the LORD will not give his glory or alienate his claim to another.

            </p>
            <p>So much of the my≈øterious manner of the divine exi≈øtence is revealed; ≈øo much of GOD the Father, of GOD the Son, and of GOD the Holy Gho≈øt, the one, the only living and true GOD, as ≈øuffices, not to gratify un≈øanctified curio≈øity, but to inform believers in what manner JEHOVAH can become their RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER.</p>
            <p>In con≈øequence of the union between the divine nature of the Son of GOD and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature which he a≈ø≈øumed, his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon as GOD manife≈øted in the fle≈øh, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignated by the name of CHRIST. The Apo≈øtle therefore, in the words before us, adopts and confirms the principle, that in revealed religion, GOD the REDEEMER is all and in all.</p>
            <p>No ≈øubject can be more acceptable to tho≈øe who love the LORD JESUS CHRIST. None more ≈øea≈øonable when adver≈øaries openly bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme that ≈øacred name.

            <p>CHRIST is all and in all. Every thing great, intere≈øting and nece≈ø≈øary in ≈øalvation is ju≈øtly predicated of him.‚ÄîOf a propo≈øition ≈øo general, which comprehends the whole ≈øy≈øtem, ≈øpreads over all the doctrines, and blends with every article of our creed, the details cannot po≈ø≈øibly be con≈øidered in the pre≈øent hour. As a ≈øummary of fir≈øt principles, it mu≈øt ≈øuffice to ≈øhew, that CHRIST is all and in all,‚Äîin the ≈øacred ≈øcriptures‚Äîin the religion of ≈øinners‚Äî and in providence.</p>

            <p>The DOCTRINES in Scripture, like ≈øo many bright lines within the ≈øame circle, unite in one glorious point.

            <p>There are detached facts, individual doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, moral precepts, which, in them≈øelves, are excellent, and independently on CHRIST or his glorious go≈øpel, cannot fail of claiming approbation and applau≈øe.‚ÄîBut it will be found, when viewed in their connection, that the≈øe facts are all combined with others which have an immediate re≈øpect to the Saviour‚Äî that the≈øe doctrines either appertain to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of nature and are adopted of cour≈øe into the Chri≈øtian ≈øy≈øtem, or they form a part of other doctrines which directly relate to CHRIST.

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035738_0014_10064F54F012A018"/>The religion of nature is far from an≈øwering the≈øe exalted purpo≈øes.‚ÄîFrom the definitions with which this di≈øcour≈øe was introduced, and ≈øome ob≈øervations that have tran≈øiently occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you may perhaps already anticipate what appertains to this part of the ≈øubject. It is however of too great importance to be ≈ølightly treated. It draws a line of di≈øtinction, with which many are evidently unacquainted. And it ≈øugge≈øts a principle, of all others the mo≈øt e≈ø≈øential, in refuting the fal≈øe philo≈øophy of infidelity.</p>
            <p>No obligation, and con≈øequently no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, can exi≈øt without ≈øome RELATION to con≈øtitute a ba≈øis or foundation upon which it re≈øts. The foundation of the religion of nature is the <hi>relation</hi> which ari≈øes from the depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of men con≈øidered as intelligent creatures, upon GOD as their CREATOR. This relation will not ≈øuffice for ≈øinners.</p>
            <p>The religion of nature is univer≈øal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. It pre≈øcribes perfect and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obedience, as its only po≈ø≈øible condition; and it en≈øures happine≈øs as long as a per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in ≈øuch obedience is uninterruptedly maintained.

nature. A Saviour is a gift infinitely beyond its province or prerogative.</p>
            <p>Sin con≈øtitutes a new character. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces e≈ø≈øential embarra≈ø≈øments. It requires help which nothing in the relation between creatures and their CREATOR, as ≈øuch, can ≈øugge≈øt or ≈øupply. The new character renders a <hi>new relation</hi> nece≈ø≈øary. There mu≈øt be a REDEEMER, or the evils produced by ≈øin can never be removed. He alone who made them can redeem them, form the relation, and bring them into it.</p>
            <p>The religion of nature is nece≈ø≈øarily and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever binding upon all men as intelligent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The original obligation can never cea≈øe or abate. Nothing can infringe, nothing can de≈øtroy it. The religion of nature, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect, is as much the religion of men, after they become ≈øinners, as it would have been had they continued holy and perfect; and yet by not providing happine≈øs, is e≈ø≈øentially deficient in a mo≈øt important article.‚ÄîIf it obliges the ≈øinner to obedience, while it condemns, and leaves him to all the direful con≈øequences of his tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion‚Äîif the <hi>relation</hi> upon which it is founded does not reach the new character‚Äî if the only <hi>condition</hi> it pre≈øcribes, of <hi>do this and live,</hi> cannot po≈ø≈øibly be complied with, and if the <hi>principle</hi> that inve≈øtigates this obligation,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035738_0016_10064F5D17F70E38"/>
is not competent to the di≈øcovery of any other, that will obviate the complicated mi≈øeries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ≈øin, then the religion of nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ≈øave, then it is not, and cannot be, the religion that will ≈øuffice for ≈øinners.</p>
            <p>Two obligations, each demanding the whole heart, ari≈øing from two di≈øtinct relations, would interfere and prove incon≈øi≈øtent, were they due to di≈øtinct Beings. No man can ≈øerve two ma≈øters.‚ÄîBut if both relations originate from the ≈øame ≈øource, and terminate in the ≈øame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; if he who is the CREATOR, be al≈øo the REDEEMER, no different intere≈øts, no cla≈øhing of authority, no incon≈øi≈øtency can ari≈øe from the additional obligation.

            <p>All the≈øe defects are compen≈øated, all the≈øe important ends obtained in revealed religion. This fully recognizes and cordially embraces, as of nece≈ø≈øity it ought, the religion of nature. But it does much more. It meets the new charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

repentance. The whole need not a phy≈øician, but the ≈øick. This is the religion which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øedly provides a remedy again≈øt ≈øin.

            <p>MY de≈øign from the≈øe words is, to take a view of that prophetic vi≈øion, of which they are a part, in it≈øelf and in its applications.</p>
            <p>The Prophet tells us, that being carried out, in the Spirit of the LORD, he was ≈øet down in the mid≈øt of a valley full of bones. Having
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035738_0050_10064FAAC98AA850"/>
pa≈ø≈øed by them round about, and taken a particular ≈øurvey of them, <hi>behold there were very many, in the open valley, and lo, they were very dry.</hi> In the≈øe circum≈øtances was the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the text propo≈øed to him, <hi>Son of man can the≈øe bones live?</hi> In≈øtead of returning a direct an≈øwer to this query, the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolves the po≈ø≈øibility of their living into the purpo≈øe, and power of GOD; <hi>O</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>thou knowe≈øt.</hi> Upon this he was commanded to prophe≈øy upon them, and to ≈øay unto them, <hi>O ye dry bones, hear the word of the</hi> LORD. <hi>Thus ≈øaith the</hi> LORD GOD <hi>unto the≈øe bones, Behold, I will cau≈øe breath to enter into you; and ye ≈øhall live. And I will lay ≈øinews upon you, and will bring up fle≈øh upon you, and cover you with ≈økin, and put breath in you, and ye ≈øhall live; and ye ≈øhall know that I am the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>The Prophet did as he was commanded. And what was the con≈øequence? <hi>As I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øied,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>there was a noi≈øe, and behold a ≈øhaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And when I beheld, lo, the ≈øinews and the fle≈øh came up upon them, and the ≈økin covered them above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As yet, however, they were but dead bodies: for he adds, <hi>there was no breath in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:035738_0051_10064FAE17C45DA8"/>He then receives a ≈øecond commi≈ø≈øion. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øy unto the wind, prophe≈øy, ≈øon of man, and ≈øay to the wind, Thus ≈øaith the</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon the≈øe ≈ølain, that they may live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He did ≈øo. <hi>I prophe≈øied,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and ≈øtood upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What an a≈øtoni≈øhing ≈øight was this! A great multitude of dry bones, lying di≈øper≈øed in an open valley, fir≈øt, put into motion; then, coming together, bone to his bone; the ≈øinews and the fle≈øh afterwards coming up upon them; and the ≈økin covering them above; and, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becoming animated, ari≈øing, and ≈øtanding upon their feet an exceeding great army.</p>
            <p>The primary object, to which this prophetic vi≈øion referred, was, the recovery of the Jews from their captivity, in Babylon, and their re≈øtoration to their own land. This is evident from the application, in the eleventh ver≈øe. <hi>Son of man, the≈øe bones are the whole hou≈øe of I≈ørael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They had been now ≈øeventy years in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Their pre≈øent circum≈øtances were very unpromi≈øing for a re≈øtoration. Like the bones,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035738_0052_10064FAFA15DCB38"/>
in the valley of vi≈øion, they were di≈øper≈øed over the whole face of the country; and, like dry bones, they were hopele≈øs, heartle≈øs, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of none of the means of their recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Therefore, they ≈øaid, <hi>Our bones are dried, and our hope is lo≈øt, we are cut off for our part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the time de≈øtined in the divine purpo≈øe, and which had been predicted by the prophets, as the period of their captivity, was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhed. The time of their deliverance was come. And by this prophetic repre≈øentation GOD would revive and ≈øtrengthen the faith and hope of his people. He would ≈øhew them that though their ≈øituation was as unpromi≈øing for a re≈øtoration, as that a multitude of dry bones, di≈øper≈øed in a valley, ≈øhould live; yet, it ≈øhould be effected: <hi>not by might, nor by power, but by my ≈øpirit, ≈øaith the</hi> LORD. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prophe≈øy upon the≈øe dry bones, and ≈øay unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>What is here predicted, and emblematically repre≈øented to the prophet was realized and accompli≈øhed when, upon the proclamation of Cyrus, who had been prophe≈øied of, by name, for this expre≈øs purpo≈øe, upwards of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years before, the Jews returned
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035738_0053_10064FB2468674B8"/>
to their own land, and rebuilt their city and temple.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides the primary intent of this prophetic repre≈øentation there are ≈øeveral other objects to which it may be ju≈øtly referred. Permit me now to direct your attention to the≈øe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. This vi≈øion may be con≈øidered as an emblematical repre≈øentation of the recovery of the ≈øinner from a ≈øtate of ≈øpiritual death, to ≈øpiritual life and happine≈øs, by the means of grace, and through the effectual operations of the Holy Spirit of GOD.</p>
            <p>However ≈øome may boa≈øt of the dignity and powers of human nature; or, whatever its natural, intellectual, political or moral abilities may be; yet, how to perform ≈øpiritual actions, in a holy and ≈øpiritual manner, whil≈øt in his natural ≈øtate, man findeth not.

Univer≈øal experience confirms the truth of tho≈øe ≈øcripture declarations; that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is only evil continually; that he is a≈øleep in ≈øecurity, and dead in tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes and ≈øins; that the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of GOD, for they are fooli≈øhne≈øs unto him, neither

can he know them becau≈øe they are ≈øpiritually di≈øcerned; that the carnal mind is enmity again≈øt GOD: for it is not ≈øubject to the law of GOD, neither indeed can be; and that the exertion of the ≈øame Almighty Power which created the world, at fir≈øt, out of nothing, by which JESUS CHRIST was rai≈øed from the dead, and by which our bodies ≈øhall be rai≈øed at the la≈øt day, is nece≈ø≈øary to quicken the ≈øinner to a ≈øpiritual life, and to make him alive unto GOD.</p>
            <p>If there are any of you who have not found this to be the ca≈øe, be a≈ø≈øured, you are yet ≈øtrangers to your condition. You know not the plagues of your own hearts; you are ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the glorious perfections and character of GOD, and to the holine≈øs, ≈øpirituality, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and power of his law; you are yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out GOD, without CHRIST, and without hope in the world.</p>
            <p>When, therefore, we preach the go≈øpel to ≈øinners, and call upon them to repent, to be converted and to believe, we are in preci≈øely ≈øimilar circum≈øtances with the prophet when he prophe≈øied, ≈øaying, <hi>O ye dry bones, hear the word of the</hi> LORD. Did our ≈øucce≈øs depend on human probabilities, or the natural efficacy of even in≈øtituted means, never, until time

≈øhould give place to eternity, would we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert one ≈øoul.</p>
            <p>But we know that it is the will of GOD the go≈øpel ≈øhould be preached to every creature; and that we ≈øhould per≈øuade men by all the terror of the LORD, and by all the allurements of his mercy and grace to be reconciled unto him. We know, that by the preaching of the word, and other gracious in≈øtitutions GOD is, from time to time, adding to the Church ≈øuch as ≈øhall be ≈øaved. We know that his power has been illu≈øtriou≈øly di≈øplayed in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of thou≈øands and tens of thou≈øands alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; that it is ≈øtill equally competent for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhing the de≈øigns of his grace; and that his word ≈øhall not return unto him void, but ≈øhall accompli≈øh that which he plea≈øes, and pro≈øper in the thing whereto he ≈øends it. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unpromi≈øing appearances may be, even though ≈øinners ≈øhould increa≈øe unto more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godline≈øs under our mini≈øtrations, ≈øtill there is ground of encouragement. <hi>Behold, the</hi> LORD's <hi>hand is not ≈øhortened, that it cannot ≈øave: neither is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.

            <p n="2">II. Another object to which this prophetic vi≈øion may be referred is, the recovery of the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035738_0056_10064FB94B437410"/>
Church and people of GOD from a ≈øtate of deadne≈øs, degeneracy and declen≈øion, to a ≈øtate of liveline≈øs, vigour, and ≈øpiritual pro≈øperity. Happy would it be, for the children and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD, were they always progre≈ø≈øive in the divine life: going from ≈øtrength to ≈øtrength, reaching forth unto tho≈øe things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and pre≈ø≈øing towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of GOD in CHRIST JESUS. What high attainments in grace might they not reach! What abundant peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation might they not enjoy! This, however, is not the ca≈øe. Through the influence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining corruption, and the numerous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to which they are expo≈øed; by negligence in duty, and not duly improving that provi≈øion of grace and ≈øtrength which is made for them in their glorious covenant head, they are liable to awful back≈ølidings and declen≈øions. In the≈øe circum≈øtances, however, GOD will not leave his children. He has betrothed them unto him≈øelf in faithfulne≈øs and forever. They ≈øhall not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther totally or finally depart from him; nor will he turn away from them to do them good. He will reclaim them by tender mercies, or the rod. Hence the commi≈ø≈øion to the prophet, <hi>Go and proclaim the≈øe words towards the north, and ≈øay, Return thou back≈øliding I≈ørael. Turn, O back≈øliding children, ≈øaith the</hi> LORD, <hi>for I am married unto you.</hi> Hence al≈øo tho≈øe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious declarations and promi≈øes, <hi>I will not cau≈øe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035738_0057_10064FBAD2822CA8"/>
mine anger to fall upon you. I will heal their back≈øliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. Though ye have lain among the pots, yet ≈øhall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with ≈øilver, and her feathers with yellow gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the people of GOD are liable to, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually, may, and often doth befal them in a collective capacity. The Church of GOD has often been confined to a comparatively ≈ømall number. Through the abounding of iniquity, the love of the righteous may wax cold. There are times when the wi≈øe virgins ≈ølumber and ≈øleep with the fooli≈øh. There are ≈øea≈øons al≈øo, when the powers of earth and hell are ≈øo let loo≈øe and combined together again≈øt the Church as to threaten its entire de≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>But to whatever difficulties or dangers the cau≈øe and intere≈øt of the REDEEMER may be expo≈øed in the world, they ≈øhall ≈øucceed. <hi>Though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the mid≈øt of the ≈øea; Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains ≈øhake with the ≈øwelling thereof.</hi> GOD <hi>is in the mid≈øt of her: ≈øhe ≈øhall not be moved:</hi> GOD <hi>≈øhall help her, and that right early.</hi> GOD has founded his Church upon the Rock of ages, and the gates of hell ≈øhall not prevail again≈øt it. <hi>When the enemy
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035738_0058_10064FBC5E2EAF40"/>
≈øhall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the</hi> LORD <hi>≈øhall lift up a ≈øtandard again≈øt him.</hi> The time, yea, the ≈øet time to favour Zion will come. GOD will ha≈øten it in his own good time. Though it tarry, wait for it. He will ari≈øe: his enemies ≈øhall be ≈øcattered; and he will have mercy upon Zion. He will appear in his glory, and build her up. He will beautify her with ≈øalvation. He will cau≈øe her to look forth as the morning: fair as the moon, clear as the ≈øun, and terrible as an army with ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The righteou≈øne≈øs thereof ≈øhall go forth as brightne≈øs, and the ≈øalvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</p>
            <p>The Jews were once the peculiar people of GOD. He had cho≈øen them for him≈øelf, from among all the families of the earth. He had redeemed them from their Egyptian bondage. He had borne them as on the wings of an eagle, and guarded them as the apple of the eye. He had nouri≈øhed and brought them up as children. He had di≈øtingui≈øhed them by ble≈ø≈øings, both temporal and ≈øpiritual, above all the nations of the earth. But having been always a ≈øtiff-necked and rebellious people; having often provoked the LORD to anger; and having, at length, completed the mea≈øure of their iniquity by the crucifixion of the Son of GOD, the Prince of life and the Lord of glory, and the rejection of his go≈øpel, GOD ca≈øt them
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035738_0059_10064FBE5B304420"/>
off. They were given over to a ≈øpirit of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, impenitency, and unbelief. Their city and temple were de≈øtroyed. They were di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øed over the face of the whole earth; and remain to the pre≈øent day a per≈øecuted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpi≈øed people.</p>
            <p>As, however, the rejection of the Jews was not total; ≈øo, neither will it be final. GOD will yet remember them with covenant mercy. Though it is now near eighteen hundred years ≈øince their rejection and di≈øper≈øion, they ≈øtill remain a di≈øtinct people, and ≈øeparated from all others: an in≈øtance the like to which has never been known in the world; and a ≈øtrong pre≈øumptive evidence of GOD's ≈øpecial gracious purpo≈øes re≈øpecting them. GOD has mercy in ≈øtore for them, which ≈øhall, in due time, be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played towards them, in rich abundance.</p>
            <p>This prophetic vi≈øion then may be ju≈øtly con≈øidered as emblematical, and predictive of their recovery. To me it appears probable, from the tenor of ≈øcripture prophecy, that they will be re≈øtored again to their own land; and that, even in a literal ≈øen≈øe, Jeru≈øalem ≈øhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a peaceable habitation.</p>
            <p>Be this, however, as it may, certain it is, that the time is coming when that vail of ignorance and prejudice which has for ≈øo many centuries
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035738_0060_10064FC3CAD75848"/>
been upon their minds, ≈øhall be rent; and when, as a people, they ≈øhall be brought to know, and to confe≈øs that this JESUS, whom we wor≈øhip, whom they took, and with wicked hands crucified and ≈ølew, on Mount Calvary, without the gates of Jeru≈øalem, is, indeed, the true and promi≈øed MESSIAH: that in him there is a full accompli≈øhment of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and promi≈øes re≈øpecting the ≈øeed of the woman, contained in the Old Te≈øtament, and that he is the truth and ≈øub≈øtance of the whole ceremonial law. And if, as the Apo≈øtle argues, in the eleventh chapter of his epi≈øtle to the Romans, through their fall ≈øalvation came to the Gentiles, and the diminution of them be the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulne≈øs? <hi>For if the ca≈øting away of them be the reconciling of the world; what ≈øhall the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of them be, but life from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. This prophetic exhibition ju≈øtly admits of a particular application to the immediate oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion of our pre≈øent meeting. We are engaged in an attempt to propagate the go≈øpel among the Indian tribes upon our frontiers. Realize, for a moment, their ≈øituation, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and di≈øcouragements with which we have to contend. You will find them as unfit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, for the object contemplated, as the dry bones in the valley of vi≈øion to con≈øtitute an army of living men. Be≈øides that depravity
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035738_0061_10064FC556721BE8"/>
which is common to human nature; ignorant, uncivilized and ≈øavage. Roaming abroad in que≈øt of their prey like the wild bea≈øts of the fore≈øt. And, alas! that there is rea≈øon to add, corrupted, and their prejudices ≈øtrongly excited again≈øt Chri≈øtianity, by the ≈øtill greater depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and wickedne≈øs of a large proportion of tho≈øe, from among our≈øelves, with whom they have had intercour≈øe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Can the≈øe dry bones live?</hi> Can the≈øe ≈øavages of the wilderne≈øs become Chri≈øtians? How ≈øhall their roving minds be fixed? How ≈øhall they be brought to realize and lay to heart their mi≈øery and danger? How ≈øhall they be brought to apprehend, and embrace the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>thou knowe≈øt.</hi> We believe it our duty to make the attempt. We believe, and are fully per≈øuaded that thou art able to render it ≈øucce≈øsful. Whether thou wilt, or not, belongs not to us to determine. In the name of our GOD would we ≈øet up our ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Confiding in thy purpo≈øes, power, and grace, would we pro≈øecute this important un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. Ha≈øt thou not promi≈øed to give unto JESUS, thy Son, the heathen for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the uttermo≈øt parts of the earth for his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.

            </p>
            <p>Nor, my brethren, are we without con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds of encouragement in our pre≈øent undertaking. Several concurring circum≈øtances tend to excite our exertions, and to animate our hopes. Has not GOD promi≈øed, <hi>The wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈øs, and the ≈øolitary places ≈øhall be glad for them: and the de≈øert ≈øhall rejoice, and blo≈ø≈øom as the ro≈øe. It ≈øhall blo≈ø≈øom abundantly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice even with joy and ≈øinging; the glory of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon ≈øhall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they ≈øhall ≈øee the glory of the</hi> LORD, <hi>and the excellency of our</hi> GOD. <hi>The kings of Tar≈øhi≈øh and the I≈øles ≈øhall bring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents; the kings of Sheba and Seba ≈øhall offer gifts. Princes ≈øhall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia ≈øhall ≈øoon ≈øtretch out her hands unto</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>The≈øe promi≈øes are in them≈øelves, a ≈øufficient foundation for faith and hope, and for the mo≈øt vigorous exertions. But the providences of GOD, at pre≈øent, in a particular manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with his promi≈øes, and afford ground to hope that their accompli≈øhment draws nigh. Amid≈øt the tumults and confu≈øions of war, a mi≈ø≈øionary ≈øpirit has been poured out in the European world, e≈øpecially in Great-Britain.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035738_0063_10064FC88C751258"/>
Regardle≈øs of party names and di≈øtinctions, the friends to the great doctrines of grace have united, as with one heart, and formed ≈øocieties, in various parts, for propagating the go≈øpel among the heathen. Nine and twenty mi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, ≈øent out by the ≈øociety in London, in a ve≈ø≈øel of their own, procured for the purpo≈øe, have arrived ≈øafe in the I≈ølands of the South Sea. Six others, namely, two from the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, two from the Edinburgh, and two from the Gla≈øgow ≈øocieties have been ≈øent to Sierra Leone, in Africa. Be≈øides tho≈øe which have been ≈øent, or are about to be ≈øent to the Ea≈øt and We≈øt Indies, and to other parts. Add to this that whil≈øt a general and vigorous exertion has been made for evangelizing the heathen, a remarkable zeal has di≈øcovered it≈øelf, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary mea≈øures have been adopted for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the intere≈øts of religion at home<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> by the e≈øtabli≈øhment of ≈øchools, and ≈øending out itinerant preachers to tho≈øe parts which were de≈øtitute of the go≈øpel.</p>
            <p>Societies in≈øtituted upon the ≈øame principles, and with the ≈øame objects in view, have been formed in America. The ≈øociety, e≈øtabli≈øhed in this city, has procured, and ≈øent out one mi≈ø≈øionary. His de≈øtination is to the Chicka≈øaw Indians on the we≈øtern parts of the ≈øtate of Georgia. Probably by this time he has nearly arrived at the end of his journey. He has gone

forth under the mo≈øt promi≈øing au≈øpices. Chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian liberality has hitherto furni≈øhed us with pecuniary re≈øources adequate to our exigencies; and ≈øhould the undertaking ≈øucceed, we have no rea≈øon to doubt but that we ≈øhall ≈øtill obtain a ≈øufficiency to ≈øerve our purpo≈øes. Our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt pre≈øent want is, at lea≈øt, another mi≈ø≈øionary. May the LORD put it into the hearts of ≈øome to offer them≈øelves, who ≈øhall be found quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the work, and who≈øe labours he will crown with abundant ≈øucce≈øs.</p>
            <p>In the IVth and la≈øt place. This prophetic vi≈øion may be con≈øidered as a lively emblema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical repre≈øentation of the re≈øurrection of the dead at the la≈øt day. The doctrine of a re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was denied by the Sadducees, and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed by the heathen philo≈øophers. But it has always been an object of faith and hope to the church and people of God. The difficulties which ≈øtand in the way of a re≈øurrection are, in the eye of ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon, in≈øuperable. Hence, though the heathen philo≈øophers had ≈øome apprehen≈øions of the immortality of the ≈øoul, yet they had no idea of the re≈øurrection of the body. Accordingly, when the apo≈øtle Paul, in his ≈øpeech at Athens, made mention of a re≈øurrection, <hi>≈øome mocked, others ≈øaid, we will hear thee again of this matter.</hi>

the dead. Are they not very many, and very dry? Survey the number of Adam's family who, ≈øince the fir≈øt commencement of time, have fallen under the ≈øtroke of the King of terrors, and become the prey of corruption and worms. What mu≈øt be the condition of tho≈øe who have now been in this ≈øituation for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, nay, for thou≈øands of years? What is become of the con≈øtituent parts of tho≈øe bodies which have, ≈øo long ≈øince, returned to their native du≈øt? Some have been depo≈øited in ≈øepulchres, and become incorporated with their mother earth. Some have been con≈øumed by fire, and their a≈øhes ≈øcattered by the winds to the four corners of the earth. Some have been ca≈øt into the ≈øea, and devoured by the fi≈øhes, or ≈øunk down into the depths of the ocean, under the load of mighty waters. And ≈øome have become the prey of the fowls of the air, and of the bea≈øts of the field. The rich and the poor, the honoured and the de≈øpi≈øed, the learned and the illiterate, the ma≈øter and the ≈øervant, the tyrant and the ≈ølave, the king and the beggar, have, long ≈øince, been blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one promi≈øcuous heap. <hi>Can the≈øe bones live?</hi> How ≈øhall the≈øe particles be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and again formed into tho≈øe bodies of which they were once con≈øtituent parts?</p>

the animal and vegetable world, would ≈øeem to afford ≈øome pre≈øumptive evidence of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection of the human body. Any conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, however, which could be drawn from the≈øe, would be extremely vague and uncertain. Ble≈ø≈øed be GOD we have a more ≈øure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which our faith and hope of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant article re≈øts. Life and immortality have been brought to light by the go≈øpel. The certainty of a re≈øurrection re≈øts upon two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, namely, the purpo≈øe, and the power of GOD. To the≈øe two is it referred by our LORD in his reply to the Sadducees. <hi>Ye do err, not knowing the ≈øcriptures, nor the power of</hi> GOD; <hi>the ≈øcriptures,</hi> which declare that there ≈øhall be a re≈øurrection; and <hi>the power of</hi> GOD, which is able to effect it.</p>
            <p>That GOD is able to rai≈øe the dead cannot be que≈øtioned: for what cannot Omnipotence do? <hi>He calls tho≈øe things which are not, as though they were.</hi> He made all things, at fir≈øt, out of nothing. He is the former of the bodies, and the father of the ≈øpirits of all fle≈øh. If then GOD made the human body out of the du≈øt of the earth, and breathed into it the breath of life, ≈øo that man became a living ≈øoul; tell me, ye infidels, is he not able to rai≈øe this body again from the du≈øt of the earth, and to re-e≈øtabli≈øh that union between it and the ≈øoul which had been de≈øtroyed by death?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:035738_0067_10064FD18AEA8288"/>That GOD will rai≈øe the dead is evident from ≈øcripture te≈øtimony. I ≈øhall re≈øt this on the three following pa≈ø≈øages.

            <p n="3">3. What has been ≈øaid affords encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diligence in the u≈øe of tho≈øe means which GOD has in≈øtituted for the conver≈øion and ≈øalvation of ≈øinners. When we con≈øider the utterly ruined and helple≈øs ≈øtate of the ≈øinner in him≈øelf, and our in≈øufficiency to do any thing effectual for his recovery, our hearts are ready to ≈øink under di≈øcouragements, and our hands to hang down. And when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider the many fruitle≈øs attempts which have been made, we are ready to de≈øpond, and to de≈øi≈øt from any farther endeavours. But when we realize that GOD who has appointed the≈øe means both can, and will render them effectual for accompli≈øhing the de≈øigns of his grace we take hope, and are encouraged to renew our exertions. It becomes not us to cavil; but with the Prophet to obey. He knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the dry bones, to which he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prophe≈øy, ≈øhould live or not. This he knew depended entirely upon the purpo≈øe and power of GOD. But, in obedience to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine command, he prophe≈øied upon them, and called upon them to hear the word of the LORD. And as he prophe≈øied, behold, there
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035738_0071_10064FDADEB4CF30"/>
was a noi≈øe and a ≈øhaking; and as he prophe≈øied they lived and ≈øtood up. GOD has bound us to the u≈øe of the means; and, ble≈ø≈øed be his name, he will put an honour on his own in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. What was the me≈ø≈øage which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was to deliver to the≈øe dry bones? It was, <hi>Behold, I will cau≈øe breath to enter into you, and ye ≈øhall live.</hi> Let us never de≈øpair then, nor be di≈øcouraged in the u≈øe of the means whil≈øt GOD is mighty to ≈øave.</p>
            <p>Suffer me then, in the 4th place, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the power and grace of GOD, to render what may be ≈øaid effectual, to call upon every ≈øinner in this a≈ø≈øembly to hear and obey the go≈øpel me≈ø≈øage. <hi>Awake, thou that ≈øleepe≈øt, and ari≈øe from the dead, and</hi> CHRIST <hi>≈øhall give thee light. What meane≈øt thou, O ≈øleeper, ari≈øe, call upon thy</hi> GOD, <hi>if ≈øo be that</hi> GOD <hi>will think upon</hi> thee <hi>that</hi> thou <hi>peri≈øh not. Repent, and be converted that your ≈øins may be blotted out. Believe in the</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and thou ≈øhalt be ≈øaved. Make you a new heart, and a new ≈øpirit, for why will ye die.</hi> Let no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties nor di≈øcouragements deter you from making the attempt, and per≈øi≈øting in your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions until you ≈øucceed. Unle≈øs you ≈øucceed you are undone for ever. He who called La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus from the tomb, can equally call you from the death of ≈øin to a life of holine≈øs. Behold! the grace of the REDEEMER is infinite, and
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035738_0072_10064FDEB8998850"/>
it is freely tendered unto you. Behold! all the horrors of eternal death, on the one hand, to alarm and drive; and all the glory and joys of heaven, on the other, to allure and draw you. Up then, and be doing. Who knows what mercy and grace may be in ≈øtore for you. <hi>Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øician there?</hi> Yes; there is a Phy≈øician, who is perfectly acquainted with every ca≈øe; and a Balm that is a ≈øovereign remedy for every di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe. <hi>Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people re≈øtored?</hi> It is not owing to any want of power or grace, in the glorious RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER, that any pine away, and die with their tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes and their ≈øins upon them. <hi>As I live, ≈øaith the</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.</hi> But it is owing to their own perver≈øene≈øs and wilful ob≈øtinacy. They hold fa≈øt their iniquities and will not let them go. <hi>And ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</hi> Perhaps the poor ≈øavage of the wilderne≈øs may welcome tho≈øe me≈ø≈øages of grace which you reject and de≈øpi≈øe. Perhaps, alarming and di≈øtre≈ø≈øing thought! perhaps, the di≈øtingui≈øhing ble≈ø≈øings and privileges of the go≈øpel may be taken away from tho≈øe who ≈øo greatly undervalue, and mi≈øimprove them, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</p>

               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:035738_0073_10064FE046CAB560"/>In the 5th and la≈øt place. I would improve what has been ≈øaid by exhorting all to the mo≈øt vigorous exertions in promoting the cau≈øe and intere≈øt of the REDEEMER in the world. It is a glorious cau≈øe, and ≈øhall finally prevail and triumph over all oppo≈øition. Mo≈øt of you may contribute to its promotion in various ways: by your in≈øtructions, by your advice, by your contributions, and by your example. But there is one mo≈øt effectual way in which all may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute: I mean, by their prayers. Let all then be excited to frequency, fervency and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in this duty. Ye that fear the LORD, give him no re≈øt until he e≈øtabli≈øh Jeru≈øalem, and make her a name and a prai≈øe in the earth. Our LORD ≈øpake the parable of the unju≈øt judge and the importunate widow to teach us that we ought always to pray, and not to faint. <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man, availeth much.</hi> GOD has promi≈øed to do mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous things in righteou≈øne≈øs for his Church and people: But he has declared, I will yet be inquired of, by the hou≈øe of I≈ørael to do it for them. Were there many ≈øtirred up to wre≈øtle with GOD in prayer, in behalf of his Church, there would be ground to hope that the ≈øet time to favour Zion was come, and our eyes might yet ≈øee glorious days of the Son of man.</p>

            <p>THE character in which you ≈øtand before this a≈ø≈øembly is highly important, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly intere≈øting, to all who regard the ≈øouls of men, and the pro≈øperity of the Redeemer's kingdom.‚ÄîYou ≈øtand here as the fir≈øt me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger employed by the New-York Mi≈ø≈øionary Society, to carry the glad tidings of ≈øalvation to the heathen on our borders, who are <hi>peri≈øhing for lack of knowledge.</hi>

               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:035738_0076_10064FE80D224630"/>You have the honour to be the fir≈øt in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon tho≈øe labours which the liberality of our Chri≈øtian brethren has enabled us to commence, and to which we hope others, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the great Lord of the harve≈øt, will ≈øoon follow you. Every pious heart within the≈øe walls feels a tender intere≈øt in your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and beats high with anxious hope for the re≈øult of your mi≈ø≈øion!</p>
            <p>You are entering upon a new and untried ≈øcene of labour. Though you have been for ≈øome years clothed with the honourable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an amba≈ø≈øador of Chri≈øt, you cannot but be ≈øen≈øible, that the field of mini≈øterial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion to which you are ha≈øtening, is widely different from that to which you have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto accu≈øtomed. You are going to a region which the joyful ≈øound of the go≈øpel has never yet reached‚Äîto a howling wilderne≈øs, where the arts of civilized life are almo≈øt unknown‚Äî to a people covered with the gloom of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ≈øuper≈øtition and barbari≈øm. You are about to take upon your≈øelf the mighty ta≈øk of proclaiming the good news of ≈øalvation through a crucified Saviour, to tho≈øe who never heard of his name, and of carrying the light of the Sun of Righteou≈øne≈øs to tho≈øe who are ≈øitting in the region and ≈øhadow of death. Who can tell the con≈øequences of this ≈øolemn undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! Who can calculate how deeply the glory
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035738_0077_10064FE995401810"/>
of God‚Äîthe intere≈øt of the Redeemer's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom‚Äîand the ≈øalvation of millions yet unborn, may be involved in this mi≈ø≈øion!</p>
            <p>Permit me, therefore, my dear brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we bid you adieu, permit me with all plainne≈øs and affection, in the name of the ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to which you are engaged, to offer you a few words of parting coun≈øel, and to commend you by prayer to the great Head of the Church.</p>
            <p>And in the fir≈øt place, Let me entreat you to maintain an holy jealou≈øy, and an unremitted watchfulne≈øs over your own heart. This is of the utmo≈øt importance, whether you regard your comfort or your u≈øefulne≈øs. Irk≈øome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed will the labours of the wilderne≈øs be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs you have grace in lively exerci≈øe‚Äîunle≈øs you are habitually animated by ardent love to Chri≈øt, and by a tender concern for precious and immortal ≈øouls. Nor can it be rea≈øonably expected, that the duties of your mi≈ø≈øion will be di≈øcharged with ≈øuch diligence and zeal, as to promi≈øe much ≈øucce≈øs, unle≈øs you are careful to keep alive in your own brea≈øt, a deep ≈øen≈øe of the importance of the tru≈øt committed to you; and unle≈øs an holy ambition to advance your Ma≈øter's kingdom, fire your bo≈øom, and daily ≈øtir up the energies of your ≈øoul. And here, let me remind you, dear Sir, that the circum≈øtance of your being far removed from your brethren
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035738_0087_10065001D7F0D860"/>
in the mini≈øtry, and from the Chri≈øtian ≈øociety which you have hitherto enjoyed, will render peculiar attention to this point nece≈ø≈øary. You have been accu≈øtomed to the animating conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation, and the con≈øoling intercour≈øe, of Chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian friends: But in the di≈øtant region to which you are going, you will be in a great mea≈øure cut off from the≈øe ≈øources of improvement and con≈øolation. The mo≈øt you can expect from the objects of your mi≈ø≈øion, will be the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of ≈øavage barbari≈øm, and occa≈øional mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrations to the wants of your body; you can expect to find no ≈øpiritual helpers among them ‚Äîno gracious hearts that will an≈øwer to your own, as <hi>face an≈øwereth to face in a gla≈øs.</hi> In this ≈øituation it will be your intere≈øt and your duty to be more than ordinarily engaged in communing with God, and with your own heart‚ÄîSee that proper motives animate all your exertions, and direct all your labours ‚ÄîGuard equally again≈øt that ≈øelfi≈øh ambition which may lead you a≈øtray, and that criminal ≈øloth which will tempt you to ≈øhrink from the toils of your important emba≈ø≈øy. Make it your daily ≈øtudy to live near to God, and to <hi>endure as ≈øeeing him who is invi≈øible. Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation.</hi> Seek after a continual increa≈øe of that <hi>precious faith</hi> which rai≈øes the ≈øoul more and more above the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the difficulties of this world‚ÄîStudy to grow in that holy love which <hi>hopeth all things,

believeth all things, and</hi> ENDURETH <hi>all things. Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of your Lord and Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Thus may you expect to perform your arduous labours with comfort to your≈øelf, and with u≈øefulne≈øs to the ≈øouls of men.</p>
            <p>In the ≈øecond place, While you exerci≈øe a ≈øolicitous care over your own heart, ≈øtudy to deliver to the poor heathen the plain, genuine and unadorned go≈øpel of Chri≈øt. We charge you before God, that you <hi>know nothing among them, ≈øave Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and him crucified.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øuffer your≈øelf to ≈øub≈øtitute human devices for the ≈øimplicity of evangelical truth. Believe it, my brother, if ever you ≈øucceed in convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heathen from ≈øin to holine≈øs, and from Satan to the living God, it mu≈øt be by the <hi>pure go≈øpel of the Saviour.</hi> This is the <hi>≈øharp two-edged ≈øword, which pierceth even to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a≈øunder of ≈øoul and ≈øpirit, and of the joints and marrow; and which di≈øcerneth the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> This is <hi>the weapon which is mighty through God to the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of ≈øtrong holds, and which bringeth every thought into captivity to the obedience of Chri≈øt.</hi> Diligently endeavour, then, in your public preaching, and in your private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, to impre≈øs upon their rude minds, that <hi>all have ≈øinned and come ≈øhort of the glory of God‚Äîthat by the works of the law no fle≈øh living
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035738_0080_10064FF1C371C660"/>
can be ju≈øtified‚Äîthat ≈øinners are ju≈øtified, freely by God's grace, through the redemption that is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus</hi>‚Äîand that <hi>his blood clean≈øeth from all ≈øin.</hi> Do not wa≈øte your time <hi>in doting about que≈øtions and ≈øtrifes of words;</hi> or in di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈ø≈øing the ≈øubtilties of polemic divinity. Do not imagine that you will be able to remove all the objections which the carnal mind may make to evangelical truth; and therefore do not dwell on the≈øe, but rather imitate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the apo≈øtles, who in≈øi≈øt much on the fall and depravity of man; on the incarnation, the humiliation, the atonement, and the glory of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Endeavour often to give ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and affecting recitals of his love, his ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, his death, his re≈øurrection and his a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen≈øion to glory; and the obligations we are under to the un≈øearchable riches of his grace. ‚ÄîTake every opportunity of impre≈ø≈øing the≈øe truths on their minds; deliver them with plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, with pungency and with affection‚Äî<hi>not in the enticing words of man's wi≈ødom, but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtration of the ≈øpirit and of power.</hi>‚ÄîAnd for this purpo≈øe, let the ≈øcriptures of truth be your daily ≈øtudy, and the great ≈øtandard of your preaching. This ≈øacred volume contains at once your commi≈ø≈øion and your in≈øtructions‚Äî Keeping clo≈øe to this, as the rule of your mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtry, and living near to the Lord Je≈øus, as the Captain of your ≈øalvation, you may ≈øafely tru≈øt him for the fruits of all your labours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:035738_0081_10064FF3501E6378"/>Once more, Let your example among the heathen corre≈øpond with your preaching‚Äîlet your conver≈øation be a living comment on the pure go≈øpel, which you recommend to them‚Äî te≈øtify to them every day, that the religion which you preach has its proper effect on your own heart and life‚Äîand that you are by grace your≈øelf what you would per≈øuade them to be. If they ≈øee you violating tho≈øe precepts of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightne≈øs, temperance, purity and univer≈øal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, which you will of cour≈øe deliver to them, it will di≈øgrace your character and de≈øtroy your u≈øefulne≈øs. An immoral mini≈øter of the go≈øpel is every where an odious and a mi≈øchievous character; but an immoral <hi>mi≈ø≈øionary,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy me≈ø≈øenger of ≈øalvation to the benighted heathen, is peculiarly odious, and is likely to be an hundred fold more mi≈øchievous: For while the uncultivated ≈øavage is oftentimes ≈øhrewd and di≈øcerning, and is ≈øoon ≈øhocked with the incon≈øi≈øtency of ≈øuch a character, he is deprived of tho≈øe advantages, which, if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, might take away in ≈øome mea≈øure the force of ≈øuch fatal example‚Äîand thus he is left to all its de≈øtructive influence‚Äîand is hereby tempted to loathe and ≈øhun a religion which has ≈øuch profe≈ø≈øors. Be careful, then, to walk worthy of your high calling, in all lowline≈øs and meekne≈øs‚Äîletting <hi>your light ≈øo ≈øhine before the heathen, that they may ≈øee your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</hi>

               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:035738_0082_10064FF4F4A4F590"/>And here I would, in an e≈øpecial manner, enjoin it upon you, to exhibit to the ≈øavage tribes among whom you may labour, upon all occa≈øions, that frank, open and di≈øintere≈øted character, that is always impre≈ø≈øive, even on the minds of barbarians. Never give them cau≈øe to ≈øu≈øpect you of mercenary motives, or of hidden and di≈øingenuous de≈øigns. All expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience proves that the moment any thing of this kind is di≈øcovered, your influence will be at an end.

Accommodate your≈øelf, as far as the purity of the go≈øpel will admit, to their cu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and their prejudices‚Äîand let your apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic zeal be tempered with that apo≈øtolic pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which <hi>became all things to all men, that he might gain ≈øome.

            <p>In a word, my dear brother, you have every rea≈øon to expect that you will meet with many trials, and even formidable difficulties.

            <head>INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE DIRECTORS OF THE NEW-YORK MISSIONARY SOCIETY, TO THEIR MISSIONARIES among the INDIANS.</head>
            <p>IN this early ≈øtage of the mi≈ø≈øion, very particular in≈øtructions cannot be expected. You will be furni≈øhed with them from time to time, according to the circum≈øtances which ari≈øe; and ≈øomething mu≈øt ever be left to your own prudence. There are, however, certain in≈øtructions which will apply at all times and in all circum≈øtances, and by which you are, invariably, to guide your≈øelves. The≈øe re≈øpect chiefly, I. Your per≈øonal religion. II. The matter and manner of your teaching. III. Your outward deportment. IV. The formation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious a≈ø≈øemblies, and the admini≈øtration of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. V. The e≈øtabli≈øhment of ≈øchools for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. VI. Ob≈øervations on the language and cu≈øtoms of the Indians; and on the pro≈øpects of making ≈øettlements, and extending the go≈øpel among them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Your per≈øonal religion.</hi> No words can expre≈øs the importance of this, and urge it with ≈øufficient warmth. Your comfort and ≈øucce≈øs in your work depend upon it. Without it, the fine≈øt genius,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035738_0086_10064FFE495747F8"/>
the highe≈øt literary acquirements and the greate≈øt eloquence will be unavailing. By this we mean not only that your hope of an intere≈øt in the Saviour be well founded, but that you con≈øtantly ≈øtrive to maintain the power of religion in your hearts; that you live near to God; giving your≈øelves much to ≈øolemn meditation and prayer. As you need in your difficult and perilous ≈øituation, uncommon love to God, zeal for his glory, and communications of divine wi≈ødom and ≈øtrength, ≈øo you ≈øhould habitual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øeek the≈øe, in the full a≈ø≈øurance of faith that they will be afforded. Though what is called o≈øtentation in religion is to be avoided as vile, yet endeavour to live in ≈øuch a manner as that tho≈øe who ob≈øerve you may believe you to be holy men, denied to your≈øelves, crucified to this world, and who≈øe conver≈øation is in heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The matter and manner of your teaching.</hi> As to the <hi>matter,</hi> let it be the great and peculiar doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of divine revelation; ≈øuch as the ≈øin and mi≈øery of man by the fall; the eternal coun≈øel of God, revealed in time, to ≈øave ≈øinners by the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of his own Son; the incarnation, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ≈øufferings and death of the Son of God, in the room of ≈øinners; his re≈øurrection, a≈øcen≈øion, interce≈ø≈øion in heaven, and the final judgment; the application of the redemption of Chri≈øt by the Holy Spirit, and the ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of his agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to change the hearts of men, and bring them to holine≈øs and happine≈øs. The confe≈ø≈øion of faith contained in the con≈øtitution of the Society, is to be the confe≈ø≈øion of your faith, and your teaching is to be conformable thereto. We believe that the≈øe doctrines are appointed by God, and found in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to be the only and effectual means of ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035738_0078_10064FEB20E9B478"/>
impre≈ø≈øing the minds of men, reforming their lives, and turning them to holine≈øs.</p>
            <p>We warn, yea, we charge you, our beloved brethren, again≈øt ≈øetting up your own wi≈ødom; again≈øt preaching natural religion di≈øtinct from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; again≈øt founding moral conduct on any other principle than the grace of God. We enjoin you to declare, as your hearers are prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, <hi>the whole coun≈øel of God;</hi> and to remember in all your mini≈øtrations, that <hi>Chri≈øt crucified is unto them which are called, the power of God, and the wi≈ødom of God.</hi> We would enforce what we ≈øay on this particular by quoting part of the in≈øtructions given to the Mi≈ø≈øionaries to the I≈ølands of the South-Sea.<note n="*" place="bottom">Coun≈øels and in≈øtructions for the regulation of the Mi≈ø≈øion, by the Directors of the London Mi≈ø≈øionary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</note> "The bible, and the experience of the mo≈øt ≈øucce≈øsful mi≈ø≈øions, a≈ø≈øure us, that the great doctrine of the Atonement mu≈øt be the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ≈øtone. The glory and the humiliation of Je≈øus, and every thing relative to the deliverance from ≈øin and death by him mu≈øt make the ground-work. A ≈øimple recital of his love, the de≈øign of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, death, and re≈øurrection; the≈øe mu≈øt be the points, chiefly, repeatedly dwelt upon. The obligations of love and duty which we owe him, naturally connect them≈øelves with the≈øe views; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with promi≈øes of his grace, through the agency of his own ≈øpirit, to enable us to follow him in the regeneration. Affect not ≈øubtilties and deep points of controver≈øy, either among your≈øelves or with the natives. Wave as much as po≈ø≈øible what would lead to que≈øtions, rather than godly edifying.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035738_0088_1006500363B046B8"/>
Attempt not by arguments on the rea≈øonablene≈øs, or evidences of the Chri≈øtian religion, to di≈øplay your own wi≈ødom; or ≈øuppo≈øe you can an≈øwer and ≈øilence all their objections. Adhere to the ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity which is in Chri≈øt, tru≈øting to the power of the Holy Gho≈øt to take the things of Chri≈øt, and ≈øhew them to their con≈øciences with divine convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and effectual energy."</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>manner</hi> of your teaching, let it be ≈øuch as is be≈øt adapted to the comprehen≈øion of your hearers. It mu≈øt needs be, when to the untutored Indian, and when by an interpreter, very plain, in ≈øhort ≈øentences, and frequently interrupted; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking more of the nature of conver≈øation, than of formal and continued di≈øcour≈øe. This will demand of you much conde≈øcen≈øion, patience, and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. You mu≈øt become children to adapt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to childi≈øh under≈øtandings, and patience mu≈øt have her perfect work, in bearing with ignorance, petulance, and ≈ølowne≈øs of apprehen≈øion. Do not de≈øpond when you ≈øee no immediate fruits of your labours, but wait in humble dependence on the Spirit of God to give efficacy to his word. As the reading of written di≈øcour≈øes will not be nece≈ø≈øary, ≈øo we would advi≈øe again≈øt it. Great attention will be required in finding proper interpreters, and it will be de≈øirable, if practicable, that only tho≈øe be employed who are converts to the Chri≈øtian faith. You will take pains to acquire as ≈øoon and as much as you can, a knowledge of the Indian language, that ≈øo you may not be ≈øubjected to the inconvenience, and, perhaps to the un≈økilfulne≈øs or unfaithfulne≈øs of interpreters.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:035738_0089_1006500607F76208"/>III. <hi>Your outward deportment.</hi> This is a matter to which we wi≈øh you carefully to attend. You mu≈øt be grave, ≈øober, hone≈øt, cha≈øte, meek, and faithful to your word. The Indians are grave in tran≈øacting all their bu≈øine≈øs, and they expect the ≈øame in others. They neither admire nor tru≈øt a light and trifling character. They are ≈øaid to pay a ≈øtrict regard to truth. Be not you ha≈øty in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring your intentions, and in making promi≈øes; but when made, let them be faithfully and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fulfilled. They exhibit on many occa≈øions acutene≈øs and ≈øagacity. They di≈øcern deviations from that natural law which is written in their hearts, and, if they find you defective, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy their confidence, and prejudice them again≈øt the go≈øpel. The ≈øtricte≈øt attention to the≈øe things is the more nece≈ø≈øary, on account of the intercour≈øe which has ≈øub≈øi≈øted between the nations of Indians and ≈øome white people, in which the latter have gro≈øsly deceived and cheated the former, committed crimes not even named among the heathen, and brought an unju≈øt reproach upon the Chri≈øtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion. If you can make the Indians ≈øen≈øible of the difference between nominal and real Chri≈øtians, and the impropriety of judging of Chri≈øtianity by the conduct of ≈øome who never felt its influence, who violate all its precepts, and who are ca≈øt out by real Chri≈øtians as unworthy of communion, a great point would be gained.</p>
            <p>We farther in≈øtruct you to ab≈øtain from all traffic, all buying and ≈øelling of lands, all political di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈ø≈øions, and in one word, from every thing which might excite a ≈øu≈øpicion that your errand is for any other purpo≈øe, or that you have any other object in view, than, ≈øingly, their ≈øpiritual and eternal
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035738_0090_10065007A2102760"/>
welfare. It is of the utmo≈øt importance that you adhere to this line of conduct, and thus impre≈øs the Indians with a conviction of your love to them being great, and not influenced by ≈øelfi≈øh con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Impo≈øed upon in times pa≈øt, and awakened by the novelty of your mi≈ø≈øion, they will pry into your motives, and diligently mark your actions. <hi>Put no ≈øtumbling-block, or an occa≈øion to fall in their way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By denying your≈øelves to ≈øtrong liquors, you may ≈øave your≈øelves both trouble and blame. It is well known how fond the Indians are of rum, and how pernicious it is to them. Should they ≈øee you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in the u≈øe, it will whet their de≈øires, and they will plead your example.</p>
            <p>The Mi≈ø≈øionaries of the United Brethren, u≈øually called Moravians, have never been in the practice of making pre≈øents to the Indians to gain their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and protection; nor are they to be encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to expect any from you. Be≈øide that pre≈øents would open the door for an expence which the funds of the Society will not admit, we had rather you ≈øhould gain their favor by more ≈øub≈øtantial acts of kindne≈øs; and teach them that they owe di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intere≈øtedne≈øs for your own, in foregoing every earthly advantage and comfort to bring them <hi>the un≈øearchable riches of Chri≈øt.</hi> The Society will make every exertion in their power to promote their knowledge of, and attention to agriculture and the arts of civilized life; but nothing is to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for gewgaws and tin≈øel ornaments.</p>
            <p>On whatever regards your external accommodation, we can only ≈øay, that it may be nece≈ø≈øary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035738_0091_1006500940A8AF98"/>
to the habits of living among the Indians, ≈øo far as is lawful and decent; and, e≈øpecially, that you ≈øubmit to the coar≈øe≈øt fare and the harde≈øt lodging without di≈ø≈øatisfaction and complaint. To expect the conveniences of civilized life, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray a want of the mi≈ø≈øionary ≈øpirit. The great Apo≈øtle of the Gentiles knew, <hi>both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ≈øuffer need;</hi> and his divine Ma≈øter, the Lord and Saviour of us all, when he dwelt upon this earth, <hi>had not where to lay his head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing of great moment in your conduct may be mentioned here, which is, that you ≈øhun di≈ø≈øen≈øions among your≈øelves. While you are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to ≈øpeak of the divi≈øions which ≈øo ≈øhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prevail in the Chri≈øtian world, you ≈øhould exhibit in your own ≈øociety true love and concord. Never differ about particular modes and ceremonies of wor≈øhip, or things not e≈ø≈øential; con≈øidering that your work is to win men to Chri≈øt, and not to make pro≈øelytes to any ≈øect or denomination whatever. In ca≈øe of your meeting with Mi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries from other denominations, and of a different faith, you are to ≈øhun public di≈øputation with them, and to pur≈øue, with mildne≈øs, firmne≈øs, and ≈øteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, your own ≈øy≈øtem. The Mi≈ø≈øionaries of the United Brethren, particularly, are entitled to your e≈øteem and confidence, the Lord having honored them in their long and indefatigable labours. We think that a mutual confidence and corre≈øpondence might ≈øub≈øi≈øt; and that, without interfering, you ≈øhould provoke each other <hi>unto love, and to good works</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> We cannot better advi≈øe you on the ≈øubject of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> in the words of the excellent charge
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035738_0092_1006500D99471D78"/>
addre≈ø≈øed to the Mi≈ø≈øionaries already mentioned.* "Let me advi≈øe you not only to guard again≈øt falling out by the way, (which God prevent!) and to love one another out of a pure heart fervently, but even let the poor ignorant natives <hi>take knowledge</hi> of you, that you do ≈øo love one another, and that with the love of benevolence you are affectionately attached to <hi>them.</hi> Let them be con≈øtrained to ≈øay, 'Behold how the≈øe new-comers love one another!' And again, in the words of the In≈øtructions; "Bear and forbear: holding the unity of the ≈øpirit in the bond of peace. Satan's chief device will be to divide you. Form no parties, nor cabals; ever remember the words of the Lord: <hi>He</hi> is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt in his kingdom, who is the <hi>≈øervant of all.</hi> We reque≈øt it ≈øolemnly, we adjure you in the Great Ma≈øter's name, <hi>Love one another out of a pure heart fervently.</hi> Your examples mu≈øt preach as powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as your words. But if ever bitter envyings and ≈øtrife ari≈øe, you will put an effectual bar to your own u≈øefulne≈øs, and defeat the great purpo≈øe of your mi≈ø≈øion. Let all your zeal, therefore, be re≈øerved for your work, and let no ≈øelfi≈øh pa≈ø≈øions mingle with it, to corrupt the ≈øimplicity which is in Chri≈øt."</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>The formation of religious a≈ø≈øemblies, and the admini≈øtration of ordinances.</hi> It will be proper to have ≈øixed places in the villages or mo≈øt populous di≈øtricts where to a≈ø≈øemble, with the Indians who may attend, on the Lord's day, and occa≈øionally on other days, for public wor≈øhip; and when circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances admit, to con≈øtitute regular congregations.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035738_0093_100646DBF165E790"/>
This ≈øhould not, however prevent the itinerating from place to place, where acce≈øs can be had for preaching the go≈øpel.</p>
            <p>As ≈øoon as a few Indians are brought to embrace the faith, are in≈øtructed in the great truths of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and give good hope of ≈øtedfa≈øtne≈øs in their profe≈ø≈øion, they are to be publicly initiated the church by bapti≈øm, and afterwards their children. As ≈øoon al≈øo, as it appears to be for edification, the holy ≈øupper of our Lord is to be admini≈øtered to all the baptized adults. We enjoin, at the ≈øame time, that none be admitted to the≈øe ≈øeals of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, without frequent conver≈øation, and ≈øufficient ≈øpace for trial. A ha≈øty admi≈ø≈øion is injurious to the per≈øons them≈øelves, and they may, by their apo≈øtacy, deeply wound the cau≈øe of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>When Indian women ≈øeek in≈øtruction in private, let one of the women of the mi≈ø≈øion be their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; or, let the conver≈øation be held in the pre≈øence of their hu≈øbands, fathers, or others, ≈øo as to avoid temptation, and the ≈ømalle≈øt cau≈øe of ≈øu≈øpicion to the Indians. We enjoin the utmo≈øt circum≈øpection in this matter.</p>
            <p>Happy con≈øequences will en≈øue from teaching the Indians the u≈øefulne≈øs and ≈øacredne≈øs of the Lord's day, from teaching them the nature and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the married ≈øtate, and, as frequently as po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ≈øolemnizing it with exhortation and prayer.</p>
            <p>As the ≈øinging of p≈øalms is a nece≈ø≈øary and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of divine wor≈øhip, we recommend that it be introduced as ≈øoon as convenient. It will be acceptable to the Indians, and as ≈øuch you ≈øhould
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035738_0094_100650122895DCB0"/>
practice it in your private and public devotion, and teach it to them. The tunes which are adopted ≈øhould be of the ≈øimple≈øt, ea≈øie≈øt, and grave≈øt kind.</p>
            <p>Some of the Indians who give rea≈øonable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their conver≈øion, and are otherwi≈øe the be≈øt qualified, may be profitably employed as interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in≈øtructors, or exhorters. Their knowledge of the language, di≈øpo≈øitions and manners of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, will give them a powerful advantage, and they will be an un≈øpeakable ≈øecurity, ≈øupport and comfort to you.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>The e≈øtabli≈øhment of ≈øchools for children.</hi> This will require your early and unintermitted attention. By in≈øtructing children, or rather <hi>youth,</hi> in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh language, the way will be prepared for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the go≈øpel hereafter with ≈øucce≈øs, and there will be an opportunity of in≈øtilling ≈øound principles, and gradually gaining them over to civilization and religion. Were no other pre≈øent advantage to offer than this, the next generation might ≈øee the mo≈øt exten≈øive and beneficial effects. Wherever a ≈øchool or ≈øchools can be e≈øtabli≈øhed, it will be the duty of the per≈øons employed to teach, diligently to attend to this bu≈øine≈øs; and while the children are taught the mo≈øt common branches of learning, to teach them the principles of the Chri≈øtian religion, and to lead them, morning and evening, in prayer and ≈øinging prai≈øes to God.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Ob≈øervations on the language and cu≈øtoms of the Indians, and on the pro≈øpects of making ≈øettlements, and extending the go≈øpel among them.</hi> Every thing which relates to the Indians, is an object not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of curio≈øity, but of real utility. By their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035738_0095_10065013B31B38B0"/>
and cu≈øtoms we are mo≈øt likely to arrive at their origin. A vocabulary of Engli≈øh words, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and already ≈øent out by a Gentleman engaged in inquiries of this kind, will be put into your hands, and you are de≈øired to mark the Indian names for the≈øe things, that ≈øo the number of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages and the different dialects may be a≈øcertained. The Directors will make inquiry as to the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance which is to be expected from the tran≈ølations which have been made into ≈øome Indian languages of parts of the holy ≈øcriptures, and, if found ≈øerviceable, means will be taken to ≈øupply you with them.</p>
            <p>On the ≈øubject of obtaining land, and forming a ≈øettlement among them, you are to be extremely cautious, as they di≈øcover jealou≈øy and oppo≈øition. We advi≈øe that you do not ≈øolicit it, but wait for the propo≈øal to come from them; and that you ≈øhow them that you are not actuated by ambition or ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and de≈øire no farther footing or property among them than is nece≈ø≈øary in order to your ≈øerving them in their mo≈øt valuable intere≈øts.

               </gap> you, that no grant of land is to be accepted by any mi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for his per≈øonal emolument; that if any offer be made by the Indians, it ≈øhall be ≈øent by you to the Directors of the Society, and accepted by them, if judged proper, for the general benefit of the mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion. Whenever a ≈øettlement is formed, it will be your duty to attend, at proper ≈øea≈øons, to the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of the land, and to the practice of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic arts, in order to benefit the Indians, and a≈ø≈øi≈øt in your own maintenance.

               <pb n="96" facs="unknown:035738_0096_1006501544BB78B8"/>You are carefully to remark what pro≈øpects ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of propagating the go≈øpel among the nation you fir≈øt vi≈øit, and other nations around; what Mi≈ø≈øionaries are needed and might be u≈øefully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; and what things are nece≈ø≈øary to give ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs and permanency to mi≈ø≈øions. The≈øe and every thing proper for the information of the Society, together with the copy of an exact journal which you mu≈øt keep of all your proceedings, you are to tran≈ømit to the Secretary once every ≈øix months, and oftener if occa≈øion requires. We recommend that every per≈øon in the mi≈ø≈øion keep a particular diary of his own; that you unre≈øervedly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to one another every material occurrence; and that you appoint one of your number to arrange a general diary of the whole, a copy of which is to be tran≈ømitted, and to conduct your corre≈øpondence.</p>
            <p>Finally, be a≈ø≈øured, our beloved brethren in the Lord, that nothing in our power ≈øhall be wanting to contribute to your ≈øupport, your comfort, and your ≈øucce≈øs. Do not faint, or be di≈øcouraged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the difficulties with which you may have to ≈øtruggle. <hi>Endure hardne≈øs as good ≈øoldiers of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Count not your lives dear unto your≈ølves, ≈øo that you might fini≈øh your cour≈øe with joy, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtry which you have recieved of the Lord Je≈øus, to te≈øtify the go≈øpel of the grace of God.</hi> Your work is mo≈øt honorable.

            <head>THE REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS.</head>
            <p>SOON after the la≈øt report, the Directors adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a plan for ≈øocial prayer which has been carried into execution, and it is believed, has been attended with beneficial effects. The ≈øecond wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øday in every month, meetings are held for this purpo≈øe in rotation, in all the churches of which the Mini≈øters are members of the Society; and, though no contributions are urged, yet whatever are made, are applied for the benefit of the Society.</p>
            <p>The Directors judged it to be their duty to begin a Mi≈ø≈øion as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible, and accordingly they early appointed a committee to obtain Mi≈ø≈øionaries, and arrange what appeared nece≈ø≈øary on this head. The committee adverti≈øed time after time with little apparent ≈øucce≈øs. Receiving, however, intimation
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035738_0098_10065019C1A7D7E8"/>
from the Rev. Mr. Jo≈øeph Bullen, of Vermont, that he would be willing to accept an appointment as a Mi≈ø≈øionary, and being a≈øcertained as to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and qualifications, they recommended him; and the Directors agreed to employ him at the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ≈øalary of three hundred and ≈øeventy-five dollars, and to defray his expences in travelling to the place of his de≈øtination. They agreed, at the ≈øame time, that it would be mo≈øt eligible to attempt the e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhment of a Mi≈ø≈øion fir≈øt among the Chicka≈øaw Indians, a nation on the we≈øtern borders of the ≈øtate of Georgia; and Mr. Bullen was reque≈øted to come on without delay. They al≈øo advanced him part of his ≈øalary to a≈ø≈øi≈øt in his preparation, and reque≈øted him to preach on a certain evening in one of the churches, on which occa≈øion the Pre≈øident of the Society was appointed to give him a charge as to the duties of his mi≈ø≈øion. The above reque≈øt was complied with on the 21≈øt of la≈øt month, when he preached, received a charge, and was ≈øet apart to his work by ≈øolemn prayer. The Directors ≈øupplied him with a few books and articles which were deemed proper, and advanced him two hundred and fifty dollars to defray the expences incidental to his journey and mi≈ø≈øion. He left this city on the 26th of la≈øt month, accompanied by his ≈øon, a lad of about ≈øeventeen years of age, and who, it is ≈øuppo≈øed, will readily acquire the Indian language, and may be u≈øeful in teaching the Indian children; but he is not, at pre≈øent, in the employ of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors. Certain documents from the Government of the United States were cheerfully granted at Philadelphia to Mr. Bullen, and private directions and letters were given him by Gentlemen who kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and warmly intere≈øted them≈øelves in the bu≈øine≈øs. The la≈øt account of him is from Lanca≈øter in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania

on the fir≈øt of this month, when he wrote that his journey had been ≈øo far pro≈øperous, and that he had not been without evident tokens of the divine pre≈øence.<note n="*" place="bottom">Since this report was made, a letter has been received from Mr. Bullen, dated Knoxville, in the ≈øtate of Tene≈ø≈øee, April 24th. He had arrived, through the goodne≈øs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, thus far ≈øafe; and he mentions that, according to his be≈øt information, he had to travel five hundred miles farther by land before he could reach the Chicka≈øaw towns. He mentions al≈øo, that the Cherokees who re≈øide in the vicinity of the Tene≈ø≈øee are de≈øirous of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>The Directors farther report, that on the petition referred by the Society to them, from the Rev. Mr. John Sergeant, a Mi≈ø≈øionary to the Stockbridge In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, they have ≈øent for his relief one hundred dollars, and they have been happy to learn that the relief was uncommonly ≈øea≈øonable. They have al≈øo granted ≈øixty dollars for one year to Paul an Indian preacher who labours among the remains of the Shinnecock, Montack, and Poo≈øpettuck tribes in Su≈ø≈øolk county, Long-I≈øland.</p>
            <p>Letters have been received by the Secretary from the Gla≈øgow Mi≈ø≈øionary Society, and from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Bapti≈øt Mi≈ø≈øionary Society in England, in an≈øwer to letters written to them.</p>
            <p>The general In≈øtructions to Mi≈ø≈øionaries, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈øs to the Chiefs and Indians of the Chicka≈øaw nations, and the Charge given to the fir≈øt Mi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, accompany this report.</p>

The Society and its benevolent ≈øupporters will ≈øee that the Directors have not been inattentive to the important tru≈øt repo≈øed in them; but that they have pro≈øecuted it, under the ≈ømiles of heaven, to a degree of ≈øucce≈øs. If the pro≈øpects of the Mi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary already ≈øent ≈øhould prove encouraging, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ≈øtrengthen him by others; nor are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øources to be de≈øpaired of, in this glorious undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Incon≈øiderable as the beginnings may ≈øeem, no one can calculate their probable increa≈øe, and tendency to promote the kingdom of the divine Redeemer. He is King on the holy hill of Zion, and it is the irrever≈øible decree of God the Father, to give to his Son <hi>the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermo≈øt parts of the earth for his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</hi>
