            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the <hi>YOUTH</hi> of the <hi>ACADEMY,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEING adviſed that the Publication of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe might be of ſome Uſe, I believe the Propriety of this Addreſs to you will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledged. The Reflections contained in it poured themſelves upon my Mind on the Death of One, who but a few Days ago bore a Part in all your Studies and Diverſions, and enjoyed a Share of Health, Strength and Spirits inferior to none of you. As you all knew and loved him;—as I beheld many of you weeping over his Grave, I am inclined to think the MORAL of his <hi>Death</hi> will be acceptable to you at leaſt, however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favorably grave and ſerious Subjects are generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by People of your Years.</p>
            <p>YOUR own Experience now convinces you that you hold your Lives on a very uncertain Tenure, and that no Period of your Age is exempted from the common Lot of Mortality. Hence every wiſe Perſon, young or old, muſt think it his grand Concern to be always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to meet Death. As for you, who are yet under the Direction of others, if you behave ſo as to merit the Eſteem of your Parents, Inſtructors, and good Men that you are converſant with, you need not doubt of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo the Love of <hi>God in Chriſt.</hi> Thus, however early your Summons from Life may be, you ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unprepared nor unlamented.</p>
            <p>THO' perhaps there is not a more affecting Incident in this World than the Death of a hopeful Youth, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally educated, and juſt ſtepping into a Life of <hi>honeſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> yet thoſe can never be ſaid to have died untimely, or to have lived in vain, who leave ſuch an amiable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter behind them, as your deceaſed School-fellow did.</p>
            <p>THAT he truly deſerved the Eſteem he enjoyed I can vouch from Experience. He grew up under me. With Pleaſure I marked his gradual Improvements. My high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hopes were fixed upon him. To me he never was
<pb facs="unknown:007318_0003_102B577A9D6DE3C8"/>
once wanting in Duty or Affection, and I returned him my warmeſt Regard. By a like Conduct you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a like Eſteem from your Inſtructors, tho' I hope, none of us ſhall ever be called to give a like public Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of it towards any of you.</p>
            <p>AS ſuch a Teſtimony of Love to the Deceaſed, a Good-natur'd Reader will candidly receive the following Sermon. If there is any Merit in it, I would aſcribe it wholly to the Influence of the Subject; for ſuch was my Indiſpoſition in Body as well as Spirits, during the very ſhort Time I had to prepare it in, that if it had not been to eaſe a full Heart, I was incapable of writing at all. I do not, however, offer want of Time as any Apology for the Performance. It is my Opinion that much Correction, or indeed any Change that I could make, either in the Language or Method, would be for the worſe. I followed the Train of Reaſoning which the Text pointed out, and which naturally offered itſelf to my Mind; and were I to ſee a Diſcourſe artfully ranged into <hi>Heads,</hi> divided and ſubdivided, I ſhould hardly be perſuaded that it had been dictated or inſpired by real Grief.</p>
            <p>I AM obliged to ſome among you for the affectionate Verſes ſent me on this Occaſion. I thought the greateſt Honor I could do, either to them or myſelf, was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix them, together with your Names; conſcious that ſo much Tenderneſs and Goodneſs of Heart, manifeſted by Perſons ſo young as you are, might attone for far greater Faults than any of you can well fall into. With Regard to the <hi>Critics,</hi> if we have any ſuch, I wiſh them ſomething better worthy of their Animadverſions than this pious Collection of our Tears. The Man who can refrain from publiſhing his Grief, till he can do it in all the Elegance of Language and Sentiment, may be juſtly ſuſpected to have felt no real Grief. To loſe a fair Opportunity of Action, thro' too ſcrupulous a Regard to Reputation, is mean and ſelfiſh; and therefore whatever Merit we may claim as Writers, I hope we ſhall always, as at preſent, have the ſuperior Merit of ſhewing ourſelves warm for our Friends, tender in our Natures, and ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace every Opportunity of doing Good.</p>

               <hi>PSALM xlii. 6.</hi> O my God! my Soul is caſt down within me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I remember Thee—</head>
            <p>IT is elegantly ſaid by the Author of the Book of <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Job</hi> v. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Job,</hi> who ſeems to have experienced all the dire Viciſſitudes of Fortune,—"That Man is born to Troubles, as the Sparks fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards."—Theſe Troubles, however, as he further obſerves, ſerve the wiſeſt Purpoſes, inaſmuch as they are not the Effects of what is called blind <hi>Chance,</hi> but of that unerring <hi>Providence,</hi> which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly conducts all Events to the general Good of the Creature, and the final Completion of Virtue and Happineſs.—"Affliction comes not forth from the Duſt, neither does Trouble ſpring out of the Ground."—Very far from it. At that great Day, when the whole Council of <hi>God</hi> ſhall be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſplay'd to us, we ſhall be intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that all His Diſpenſations are wiſe, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and gracious; and that, "Tho' no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening for the preſent ſeems joyous, but grievous, nevertheleſs it afterwards yields the peaceable Fruit of Righteouſneſs to them that are exerciſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 11.</note>."</p>
            <p>OF the Truth of this we might ſoon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced at preſent, were we but wiſe, and ſuffered ourſelves to reflect on what we daily ſee. It is
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007318_0009_102B5788F220B7C8"/>
with the greateſt Injuſtice, as well as Perverſeneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Men aſcribe their Sins altogether to worldly Temptation, and inveigh upon all Occaſions againſt this Life upon Account of its Vanities. Theſe, if well attended to, would perhaps put us on our Guard againſt Sin; and, upon Enquiry, it will be found that the great Source and moſt prevailing Cauſe of all Iniquity, is a ſtupid Liſtleſſneſs, and want of Conſideration. The Luſts and Pleaſures of Life are only the Means by which our great Adverſary lulls us into Security or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, which, like ſome vaſt Weight, oppreſſes the more generous Efforts of the Soul, and bears all ſilently down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, unleſs check'd by the powerful Hand of Affliction.</p>
            <p>HENCE then, were I capable of wiſhing Evil to any Perſon, I could not wiſh a greater to my greateſt Enemies, than a long and uninterrupted Proſperity. A flattering Calm portends a gathering Storm; and, when the Stream glides ſmooth, deep and ſilent on, we juſtly ſuſpect that the Sea, or ſome Declivity, is near; and that it is ſoon to be loſt in the vaſt Ocean, or tumble down ſome dreadful Fall or craggy Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice. I ſincerely pity thoſe, who were never viſited with Adverſity, and who never took Time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whence they came, where they are, or whither they are bound. If I loved them I could not but be apprehenſive leſt, being drunk with Proſperity, they ſhould ſwim ſmoothly from Joy to Joy along Life's ſhort Current, till down they drop, thro' the Pit of Death, into the vaſt Ocean of Eternity! In ſuch a Caſe, what more charitable Wiſh could be indulged toward ſuch Perſons, than that the chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand of Heaven might fall heavy upon them, arreſt them in their thoughtleſs Career, and teach them to pauſe, ponder and weigh the Moment—
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007318_0010_102B578A77D99B80"/>
the eternal Moment—"of the Things that belong to their Peace, before they be hid from their Eyes."</p>
            <p>THAT there ſhould be any Perſons, endowed with Reaſon and Underſtanding, who never found Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this World ſeriouſly to reflect, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for what End they were ſent into it, would ſeem incredible, did not Experience aſſure us of it. There are really ſo many affecting Incidents in Life (perhaps graciouſly intended to awaken Reflection) that their Hearts muſt be petrify'd indeed, one would think, and harder than Adamant, or the nether Millſtone, who can live in this World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſometimes affected, if not with their own, at leaſt with the human Lot.</p>
            <p>I HOPE it is far from being my Character that I am of a gloomy Temper, or one that delights to dwell unſeaſonably on the dark Side of human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Our Cup here is bitter enough, and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes too thick ſown, for any One who loves his Species, to ſeek to embitter the Draught, by Evils of his own Creation. But there is a Time for all Things; and, on ſome Occaſions, not to feel, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize and mourn, would argue the moſt ſavage Nature.</p>
            <p>THE Sun has lately riſen dark upon me; and this Day, every Thing that comes from my Mouth will, in ſpite of me, be tinctur'd with Melancholy. It is, however, a virtuous Melancholy, which it would be impious to check; and therefore, if it is publickly indulg'd on this Occaſion, I hope it will be thought excuſable. You know it is natural for thoſe who are ſincerely afflicted to believe that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſon is obliged to ſympathize with them, and attend patiently to the Story of their Woe. But
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007318_0011_102B578CD1595860"/>
whether this be your preſent Diſpoſition or not, I ſhall ſay nothing which you are not as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to receive deeply into your Hearts, as I am deſirous to pour it from mine.</p>
            <p>I WOULD only ſtrive to perſuade you, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Feaſt was never intended for us here; and that it is the good Will of your Father, that you ſhould be frequently rouſed by what happens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round you, to cheriſh ſerious Reflection and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Mourning, which may be recompenced with eternal Joy. That you ſhould do ſo is highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in itſelf; for, next to the immediate Praiſes of the Deity, there is not an Exerciſe that tends more to ennoble the Soul, than frequently to caſt an Eye upon human Affairs, and expatiate upon the various Scene, till we lead on the ſacred Power of <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>religious Melancholy</hi> here recommended, is far from being that gloomy Deſpondency into which ſome People fall. No; it is <hi>virtuous Reflection,</hi> and that <hi>philoſophic Penſiveneſs</hi> and Tenderneſs of <hi>Soul,</hi> which ſo much become the Dignity of our Nature, and our Situation in this Life.</note> 
               <hi>religious Melancholy,</hi> and feel the <hi>virtuous</hi> Purpoſe gently riſing in our ſympathiſing Boſoms, thrilling through our inmoſt Frame, and ſtarting into the ſocial Eye in generous Tears.</p>
            <p>SCORN'D be the Man whoſe proud <hi>Soul</hi> pretends never to be <hi>caſt down</hi> from the lofty Throne of <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic</hi> Inſenſibility. He may arrogantly boaſt that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can move him, while the World goes well with him; but let Heaven ſtrip him of his gaudy Plumes, and throw him back naked and deſpicable into that World, where he had fixed his Heart, he will find to his Coſt that, tho' he never had the Virtue to be caſt down and feel for <hi>Others,</hi> yet he will have the Weakneſs to be caſt down to the very
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007318_0012_102B578F17621968"/>
loweſt Pitch, and become the moſt abject deſpondent Thing alive, for <hi>Himſelf.</hi> When his tranſient Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors are thus fled, his haughty Looks will be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. He will then begin to contemn his paſt Folly, and enter deeply into his own Boſom. He will no more rely on the Smiles of Fortune, or the Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Men; but acknowledge, from dear-bought Experience, that in this Life there is no ſure Refuge but God, nothing permanent but Virtue, nothing great but a humble Heart; and that the only Way to be happy <hi>Men,</hi> is to remember always that we are but <hi>Men,</hi>—poor dependent mortal Men.</p>
            <p>BUT, beſides perſonal Affliction (which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a laſt Reſource, and ſometimes dangerous, as it plunges ſome into invincible Deſpair) the All-gracious Governor of the World, ſtill watchful to turn every Event to the Good of his Creatures, without violating their moral Liberty, has many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ways of leading them to the Remembrance of him. Whether we look within or around us, we ſhall find enough in the Proſpect to humble our Souls, and convince us that, not truſting to any Thing in a World where all Enjoyments are fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſhall then only be ſafe in it, "when we have put on the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, and arm'd ourſelves with the Sword of the Spirit<note n="*" place="bottom">

God never intended this World as a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Habitation for us; and Evil is ſo blended with Good, that we cannot reaſonably ſet our Affections upon it. Wailing, weak and defenceleſs, we are uſhered into it. Our Childhood is trifled away in rov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Toy to Toy. Our Youth is a Scene of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Danger; our Manhood of Care, Sollicitude,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007318_0013_102B5792F8D3E1D0"/>
Toil and Diſappointment. Our Old Age—if haply we reach Old Age—is a ſecond Childhood. Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wan, and bow'd beneath our Infirmities, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as it were, a living Hoſpital of Woes; a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to ourſelves, and perhaps a Nuſance to others.</p>
            <p>IN each of theſe Stages, the Number of Evils is greatly encreaſed, partly by our own Miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and partly by our neceſſary Connexions with others; for the equitable Judgments of God are often general. "All Things come alike to all Men; and there is but one Event to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the Wicked <note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> ix. 2.</note>." Moreover, many of thoſe Evils are of ſuch a Nature, that no Prudence of ours can either foreſee or prevent them. All the Stages of Life neceſſarily ſubject us to Pains and Diſeaſes of Body, and many of them to the acuter Pains of an anxious Mind. Upon the whole it appears that our <hi>Life is but a Vapor, which is ſeen a little While, and then vaniſheth away, as a Tale that is told, and remember'd no more; or as a Wind that paſſes over, and cometh not again.</hi>

            <p>THE Man muſt be thoughtleſs, indeed, who is not humbled with theſe Reflections. But ſuppoſe his own Life ſhould paſs over as happily as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and he ſhould feel but few of theſe Evils; yet, unleſs he ſhuts his Eyes and his Ears from the World, he muſt ſtill find ſomething in it, which ought to move the tender Heart to Sorrow and Remembrance of God.</p>
            <p>OUR bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, tho' more than human, and conſcious of no perſonal Ill, caſt his Eye upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and wept over it, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its impending Fate. Juſt ſo, if we calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007318_0014_102B5794B7BB74C0"/>
caſt an Eye upon the World, we ſhall drop a Tear over it on Account of the unavoidable Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes that prevail in it.</p>
            <p>DON'T we often ſee Tyranny ſucceſsful, ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Oppreſſion and Perſecution ravaging the Globe, the beſt of Men made Slaves to the worſt, and the lovely Image of the <hi>Deity</hi> ſpurn'd, diſhonor'd, disfigur'd! How many Men, of genuine Worth, are caſt out by Fortune to mourn in ſolitary Places, ſhivering with pale Diſtreſs, unſeen, unpitied, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn and helpleſs! How many pine in the Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dungeons, without enjoying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Air, or the Common Uſe of their own Limbs! How many are chain'd down, for Offences not their own, to the Gallies for Life! How many bleed beneath the Sword, and bite the Ground in all the ſad Variety of Anguiſh, to ſate the cruel Ambition of contending Tyrants! How many are deprived of their Eſtates, and diſappointed in their moſt ſanguine Expectations, by the Malice of ſecret and open Enemies, or, which is far more piercing, the Treachery of pretended Friends! How many boil with all the Tortures of a guilty Mind, and the bittereſt Remorſe for irreparable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries! How many purſue each other with the moſt implacable Malice and Reſentment! How many bring the acuteſt Miſery upon themſelves by their own Intemperance! How many condemn their Souls to a kind of Hell, even in their own Bodies, by an unhappy Temper, and the violent Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of diſorder'd Blood! How many are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely wretched in their Families, and conſtantly gall'd by the unavoidable Misfortunes of their deareſt Friends! On one Side the Diſtreſs of the <hi>Needy,</hi> the Injuries of the Oppreſſed, the Cries of the Widow and Orphan, pierce our ears. On
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007318_0015_102B579641930BB0"/>
the other Side, we hear the <hi>Voice of Lamentation and Mourning;</hi> our Friends and Neighbours weeping for dear Relations ſuddenly ſnatch'd away, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be comforted becauſe they</hi> ARE NOT. Here one's Heart is torn aſunder by having a beloved Wife or Child ſnatch'd from his Side! There ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wails with the Loſs of an affectionate Parent or Brother! Here ſturdy Manhood drops inſtantly beneath the ſudden Stroke! There <hi>blooming Youth</hi> —be ſtill now my bleeding Heart, wring me not thus with ſtreaming Anguiſh—there <hi>blooming Youth</hi> falls a premature Victim to a Doom ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too ſevere! Beneath the cold Hand of Death, the Roſes are blaſted; reſtleſs Agility and Vigor are become the tameſt Things; and Beauty, Elegance and Strength, one putrid Lump!</p>
            <p>SURELY, if we would think on theſe, and ſuch Things, which ought not to be the leſs ſtriking for being common, and which render this Life a Scene of Suffering, a Valley of Tears, we could not ſet our Hearts much upon it, but ſhould be arreſted even in the Mid-career of Vice, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling learn to weigh the Moment of Things, and ſecure <hi>the one Thing needful.</hi> All the tender Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions would be waken'd in our Boſoms. Our ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing Souls would be caſt down within us, and alarm'd at their own Danger, would rave round from Stay to Stay, calling inceſſantly for Help, till they could find a ſure and never-failing Refuge.</p>
            <p>BUT where is this never-failing Refuge to be found? It becomes me now to point out ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-flowing Spring of Comfort, ſome eternal Rock of Salvation, for the Soul, after having thus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd up ſuch a baleful Catalogue of unavoidable Miſeries, to alarm and humble her,—Now, as I
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007318_0016_102B57995692E288"/>
have hinted before, this eternal Refuge is pointed out in the <hi>Text.</hi> In ſuch Circumſtances, we ſhall never find Reſt, but in reſolving with holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>—"O my God! my Soul is caſt down within me, therefore will I remember thee."</p>
            <p>WITHOUT remembering that there is a <hi>God,</hi> that overrules all Events, what Hope or Comfort could we have, when we reflect on all the aforeſaid unavoidable Miſeries of Life, and many more that might be named? Did we, with the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to ſpring up from the Duſt, or to be the blind Effects of unintelligible Chance, and of undirected Matter and Motion, what a poor Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould we think ourſelves in <hi>here?</hi> Would not all appear as "a Land of Darkneſs, as Darkneſs itſelf, under the Shadow of Death, without any <hi>Order,</hi> where the Light is as Darkneſs <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Job</hi> x. 22,</note>?" Surely we could not wiſh to live in this World upon ſuch a precarious Footing; and yet we ſhould not know whither to fly from it, unleſs into the darker State of dreary Annihilation, at the Thoughts of which the aſtoniſhed Soul ſhudders and recoils. Upon ſuch a Scheme, all our Hopes would be thin as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Web, and lighter than Chaft that is diſperſed thro' the Air. Our <hi>Adverſity</hi> would hurry us into the moſt invincible Deſpair, and our <hi>Proſperity</hi> would be as a Bubble burſting at every Breath. Philoſophy would be a Dream, and our boaſted Fortitude meer unmeaning Rant.</p>
            <p>BUT on the other Hand, if, <hi>when our Souls are caſt down within us, we will remember that there is</hi> a <hi>God,</hi> whoſe great View in <hi>creating</hi> was to make us happy, whoſe Deſign in <hi>afflicting</hi> is to reclaim us, and who <hi>governs</hi> the World by his Providence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007318_0017_102B579C819FAE10"/>
only to conduct all to the greateſt general Good— then, and then only, have we ſure Footing. We ſhall neither raiſe our Hopes too high, nor ſink them too low. If Fortune is kind, we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her Smiles without forgetting the Hand that guides her. If ſhe frowns, we ſhall feel our Woes as <hi>Men,</hi> but ſhall robly bear them as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> For if we are really Chriſtians, our holy Religion teaches us that this <hi>Scene</hi> of Things is but a very ſmall Part of the mighty <hi>Scheme</hi> of Heaven; —that our preſent Life is only the dim <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of our Exiſtence;—that we ſhall ſhortly put off this Load of Infirmities, and be tranſlated to a State, where no Temptations can aſſail, no Fears diſtreſs us; but where "every Tear ſhall be wip'd from our Eyes, and where there ſhall be no more Death, nor Sorrow, nor Crying, nor Pain, becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Things are paſſed away <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 4.</note>."</p>
            <p>IF we are thus intimately convinced that unerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Wiſdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> hold the Reins of the Univerſe, and are at Peace in our own Conſciences, the Storm of the World may beat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; but, tho' it may ſhake, it can never overthrow us.</p>
            <p>"ALTHOUGH the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall Fruit be on the Vines; tho' the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of the Olive ſhall fail, and the Fields ſhall yield no Meat; tho' the Flock ſhall be cut off from the Fold, and there ſhall be no Herd in the Stall; yet will we rejoice in the <hi>Lord,</hi> and we will Joy in the God of our Salvation<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Habbak.</hi> iii, 17, 18.</note>."—Although Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes ſhould beſiege us round and round; tho' Woes ſhould cluſter upon Woes, treading on the Heels of each other in black Succeſſion, yet when we remember God, and fly to him as our Refuge,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007318_0018_102B579E22A95250"/>
we ſhall ſtand collected and unſhaken, as the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Mountains, amid the general Storm.</p>
            <p>WITH our Eye thus fixt upon Heaven, truſting in the Mercies of a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and animated by the Goſpel Promiſes, we ſhall urge our glorious Courſe along the Tract of Virtue, bravely withſtanding the Billows of Adverſity on either Side, and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every Diſpenſation of Providence, Tho' Death ſhould ſtalk around us in all his grim Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;—tho' Famine, Peſtilence and ſell War ſhould tear our beſt Friends from our Side;—tho' the laſt Trump ſhould found from Pole to Pole, and the whole World ſhould tremble to its Center;— tho' we ſhould ſee the Heavens open'd, our <hi>Judge</hi> coming forth with Thouſands and ten Thouſands, his Eyes flaming Fire, the planetary Heavens and this our Earth wrapt up in one general Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—tho' we ſhould hear the Groans of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring World, and behold Nature tumbling into univerſal Ruin;—Yet then, even then, we can look up with Joy, and think ourſelves ſecure. Our holy Religion tells us, that this now glorify'd <hi>Judge</hi> was once our humbled <hi>Redeemer;</hi>—that he has been our never-failing Friend, and can ſhield us in the Hollow of his Hand. The ſame Religion alſo aſſures us, that Virtue is the peculiar Care of that <hi>Being,</hi> at whoſe Footſtool all Nature hangs; and that, far from dying or receiving Injury amid the Flux of Things, the fair Plant, under his wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſhall ſurvive the laſt Gaſp of Time, and bloom on thro' eternal Ages!</p>
            <p>AND now, my reſpected Audience, I think it is evident that if we ſearch all Nature thro', we ſhall find no ſure Refuge but in keeping a clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and remembering God. If we conſtantly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007318_0019_102B57A08F5811F0"/>
exert ourſelves to do our Duty, and remember that there is an all perfect Being at the Head of Affairs, the worſt that can happen to us can never make us altogether miſerable; and without this, the beſt Things could never make us in any Degree happy.</p>
            <p>IF therefore, it is one great Deſign of all Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to bring us to ſuch a Remembrance, and make us examine into the State of our own Souls, I thick I may be permitted to beſeech you, by your own Hopes of immortal Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not to be blind and deaf to the repeated Warnings given you by your kind <hi>Parent God.</hi> Tho' the Afflictions do not happen immediately <hi>to</hi> you, they happen <hi>for</hi> you. And tho' all ſeems well at preſent, which of you knows how ſoon the Lord may viſit you in his fierce Anger? Which of you, young or old, can ſay your Souls will not next, perhaps this very Night, be required of you? And think, O think, if you have never been led to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member God,</hi> by the repeated Warnings given you in this World, how unfit a Time it will be to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Him,</hi> when you are juſt ſtepping into the next;—when (as you have ſeen lately in the Caſe of many younger and ſtronger than moſt of you, here preſent) you ſhall be ſtruck ſenſeleſs on a Death-bed at once, and know not the Father that begat you, nor are conſcious of the Tears of her that gave you Suck?</p>
            <p>IF you can but think on theſe Things,—the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this World, and the Eternity or the next; —if you can but think on the Value of thoſe Souls, for which a <hi>God incarnate</hi> died, and ſealed a Covenant of Grace with his Blood, into which you have ſolemnly ſworn yourſelves;—ſurely if you weigh theſe Things, you will ſtop your Ears againſt
<pb facs="unknown:007318_0020_102B57A3C286AEC8"/>
the Arts of the <hi>Charmer, charm be ever ſo wiſely.</hi> In vain ſhall the World pour her Syren Song in your Ears, ſaying—"Behold here the true Path to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Why will you, O Man, beſtow your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor and Toil for that which you are never ſure to attain? Why will you refuſe the Pleaſures I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly offer you? See all the reſt of Nature this Moment happy without Toil or Care! You alore, who are Lords of this World, are miſerable by your own Folly! Come on, then! enjoy the good Things that were made for you. Fill yourſelves with coſtly Wines and Ointment. Crown your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Roſe-buds before it be too late, and bring every Flower and Fragrance of the Spring under Contribution to their Maſter."</p>
            <p>In vain, I ſay, ſhall the World tempt you thus. The Reflections which I have indulged above will ſufficiently convince us that this Life has no ſuch unmixt Pleaſures as theſe for us; and that what alone can either alleviate the Evils of this World, or make its Goods give us any ſubſtantial Joy, is to <hi>remember</hi> and draw near to God.</p>
            <p>BEHOLD then, once more, this very God himſelf invites you to draw near to him; and commemorary him at <note n="*" place="bottom">Preach'd on a Sacrament Day</note> his holy Table. Let him not, therefore, invite you in vain. Do not ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully renounce your moſt exalted Privilege, and voluntarily out yourſelves off from the Society of GOD'S <hi>univerſal Church.</hi> You all know what is required to make you worthy of this exalted Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege. It is a ſtedfaſt Faith in the Goſpel-promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the Mercies of <hi>God;</hi> a ſincere Repentance for paſt Offences; an unfeigned Purpoſe of future Amendment, and an unbounded Charity and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity
<pb facs="unknown:007318_0021_102B57A6D77FDE80"/>
of Heart towards our Fellow-mortals, however ſeemingly different in Sentiment and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from us. If we have theſe Diſpoſitions, either begun now, or continued down to this Day from ſome earlier Period of our Life, we can never come unworthily.</p>
            <p>"Up! eſcape for thy Life! look not behind thee; ſtay not in all the Plain! eſcape to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, leſt thou be conſum'd<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> xix. 17.</note>—" was the Alarm rung in the Ears of <hi>Lot</hi> by his good Angels. Juſt ſo permit me to alarm you; and O were my Voice like Thunder, that it might be heard thro' every Corner of this City, while I warn you to eſcape from the Deſtruction that hangs over you! Up! fly for your Lives to <note n="†" place="bottom">The Communion Table.</note> yonder Mountain of your God! Let not your Souls find any Reſt in all the Plain of this Life, till you have fix'd on the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Rock of your Salvation. Let no Excuſes detain you, nor linger while the Danger is at hand. Haſte ye, this precious Moment, leſt it ſhould be the laſt, haſte ye to ſecure your Intereſt in the Blood of Chriſt, and renew your Covenant with him. By theſe Means, whatever may happen hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, you ſhall be ſafe—eternally ſafe from every Thing that can really hurt you.</p>
            <p>I HOPE you will excuſe my Warmth and Fears for you on this Occaſion. I wiſh I had no Ground for it. But you cannot but miſs ſeveral whom you ſaw here laſt Sacrament-day, and ſome of them younger than moſt of you, particularly the dear Youth, whoſe much-lamented Death forced this Train of Reflection from my Heart. But one Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath has interven'd ſince twice I had the Honor to preach from this Place, and twice that Day he was
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007318_0022_102B57A85B30A5C8"/>
of the Audience. At that Time I believe none of you dream'd he was ſo ſoon to be the Subject of Grief to many. You all ſaw him; and who once ſaw, muſt have lov'd him. If glowing Health, Strength, Beauty and Gracefulneſs of Perſon;—if a Genius excellent by Nature, and carefully adorn'd by all the Aids of a liberal Education; —if the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of his Inſtructors, and mine in particular, in whoſe Boſom he had long grown up;—if the Tears of his Fellow-ſtudents, and eſpecially of affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Brothers, with whom he liv'd in conſtant Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;—if the Love of the fondeſt Parents, who perhaps the very Moment of his Diſſolution were concerting Schemes for his future Honor in Life, but are now ſadly bewailing his preſent Lowneſs in Death;—if theſe Circumſtances—and perhaps none were ever more moving—if theſe Circumſtances, I ſay, could have arreſted the inexorable Hand of Death, and ſav'd ſuch a riſing Hope of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, late, very late, had he received the fatal Blow! He bid fair to have been the longeſt Liver among us, and my Eyes would have been for ever cloſed before any One had dropt that Tear to his Memory, which is this Moment forced from me. But the fell Diſeaſe was of the moſt invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Kind. All the Power of Medicine, and all the Love we bore to him, could not gain one ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary Gaſp. He fell, his Age almoſt Sixteen; and as I long lov'd, ſo muſt I long remember him with pious Regard.</p>
            <p>TO the Will of Heaven, however, I hope mine ſhall always be wholly reſign'd. "Shall we receive Good at the Hands of God, and ſhall we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Evil alſo."—"The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord!" I ſincerely believe my dear Pupil is in a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007318_0023_102B57AA1598DEA0"/>
Far better State than this. He has happily eſcaped from a World of Troubles. He has but juſt gone a little before us, and perhaps never could have gone, in any Period of his Life, more beloved, more lamented, or more prepared for Happineſs, if unſullied Innocence and Purity of Manners be the Means of Happineſs.—Strangers tended his Sick-bed with paternal Care. Strangers cloſed his Eyes, while their own trickled down with Sorrow. Strangers followed him to the Grave in mournful Silence; and, when his Duſt was committed to Duſt, Strangers paid the laſt tributary Drop— Yet after all to have a Son ſo beloved and ſo honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even by Strangers, and to be ſurprized with the News of his Death, before they heard of his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—what a ſevere Blow to the diſtant Parents! —This Thought unmans me—again my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſtruggle with Reaſon—<hi>Nature!</hi> thou art Conqueror—I can add no more—I have now done the laſt Duty of Love—let ſilent Tears and Grief unutterable ſpeak the reſt!—</p>
