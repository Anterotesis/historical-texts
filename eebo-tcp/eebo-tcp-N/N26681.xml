            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>JOB,</hi> III.17, 18, 19.</bibl>
               <q>THERE THE WICKED CEASE FROM TROUBLING, THERE THE WEARY ARE AT REST. THERE THE PRISONERS BEST TOGETHER, THEY HEAR NOT THE VOICE OF THE OPPRESSOR, THE SMALL AND THE GREAT IS THERE, AND THE SERVANT IS FREE FROM HIS MASTER.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE rivers and firearms which run along the ſurface of our globe, are all equal in their original; whither we conſider them in themſelves, or. In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, cauſes from whence they all ariſe. Some puny fountain, or contiguous mountain taught them at firſt to flow: but in their courſes along, the earth, they ſoon become diſtinguiſed by ten thouſand accidents.</p>
            <p>SOME ſcarce iſſued from their parent ſpringſ, are ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſnows, and augmented bv the continual acceſſion of numberleſs ſtreams, until at length aſſembled together from all quarters, in mighty bodies, they roll over the world with ſuperior majeſty. Others, unaided by theſe accidental cauſes, admit but of ſmall increaſe, and run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the ſame humble channel. But this ſtate of things, however, is not of long duration. They are all to meet finally in one place. After having run their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed courſes, and diſplayed for ſome little time, their different forces, they fall all into the ſea, their common receptacle: there their waters are blended, their courles luſt and even their names unknown: thus, as they were equal in their original, they are again equal in their end.</p>
            <p>THIS is a juſt repreſentation of human life—men as: they ſtand in nature are equal; they are equal when they firſt enter into life, in every material circumſtance: but as they advance, this equality is gradually diminiſhed, and at length, ſeemingly altogether deſtroyed. Some in the courſe of their progreſs, are augmented with birth, with riches, honors, titles and ſame: others are endewed with
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035491_0005_1004DEB3D249C340"/>
none of all theſe acquiſitions, but continue in their firſt humble obſcurity. Some are happy, are fortunate, live in the midſt of eaſe, of health, of mirth; and jovial plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; others are unhappy, unfortunate, preſſed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny calamitieſ, have their health impaired, and their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits broken: but neither does this ſtate of things conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long; a few years of this ſcenery elapſed, and death reſtores the equality again, and renders the appearane of human affairs once more uniform.</p>
            <p>THIS view of the event, is truly intereſting to two of polite ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of men, to them who are ſufferers by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent inequality which prevails in life, the proſpect of its abolition muſt be a favourite ſubject of contemplation. It muſt be ſo in a ſtill higher degree, when theſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are brought upon them by the oppreſſive exertions of human power, and when they conſider it as not only deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them from their troubles by placing them beyond the reach of their oppreſſors; but as diſarming their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors themſelves of that power, which they ſo greatly abuſed, and reducing them to a level with theſe over whom they tyranized. How infinitely pathetic and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful is this meditation of Job in the text, how deeply foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the original feelings of our nature.</p>
            <p>WHILST overwhelmed with miſerv and extreme deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, he is repreſented as looking forward to the grave as his laſt reſource; conſidering it as a place where the long loſt equality of nature ſhall be again reſtored, where the wicked ſhall ceaſe from troubling, where the weary ſhall reſt from their toils, where the long confined priſoner ſhall be ſet at liberty, and where tyranny ſhall oppreſs no more. To the oppoſite claſs of men again, to thoſe who are gainers by the preſent inequality which prevails in life, the proſpect muſt appear in a different light, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a different effect upon their ſentiments.</p>
            <p>BUT in this diſcourſe, I ſhall confine myſeIf to the firſt claſs; and conſider the grave in the ſingle light of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the opreſſed; and in doing this I ſhall follow the order of the text, and obſerve the following method.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I SHALL conſider the grave as a place where the wicked ceaſe from troubling.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:035491_0006_1004DEB557BEFEA8"/>II. I SHALL conſider it as a place where the weary are at reſt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I SHALL conſider it as a place where the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life are leveled, where nature reſumes her rights, and where all men are again replaced in their original e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I AM to conſider the grave as a place where the wicked ceaſe from troubling. I mean not at preſent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the diſſipated and the gay, unacquainted by their own experience with the troubles of life, they can know them only by the information of others; and this information ſhould any one be particular enough to offer it, they may liſten to or not, as they are diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>THE troubles of the world are heard at a diſtance and affect not their repoſe; they may ceaſe or continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbing their ſyſtem, or producing any material ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon their ſentiments. It is you, my brethren, who like myſelf have been tried and troubled, whom I now mean to addreſs—Come then let us deſcend into the grave, and view the ſilent manſions where the wicked on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can deſpair.</p>
            <p>AND in the firſt place, in viewing the realmſ of the dead, obſerve the profound quiet which reigns there. —More ſtill than the unruffled ſurface of the deep, the face of this mighty empire is tranquil, and all is ſolitude and ſilence.</p>
            <p>HERE is no invaſion of property, or a diſpute about the limits which divides one man's territory from another. But every one poſſeſſes his own narrow houſe, nor feels a wiſh, nor can make a motion to tranſplant himſelf into that of another.</p>
            <p>Is ſtrife then ceaſed? is diſcord no more? can the wicked no longer trouble? No, my friends, they can troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le no more:, like them your oppreſſors ſhall alſo be laid low; like them they ſhall ceaſe from troubling, and you ſhall be delivered.—That voice which founds to dreadful in your ears, ſhall fail nor be able to awake the ſaint echo of the tomb. Where ye wicked is now your power? Ye oppreſſor, is your rage diſarmed? Can you ceaſe to inſult
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035491_0007_1004DEB6DD9228F0"/>
thoſe, over whom fortune has given you the advantage? No, but death hath interpoſed, &amp; his ſtern orders muſt be complied with; whether you incline or not, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign your power and ceaſe from your oppreſſion. Of all the appearances which this world exhibits there is none which affords a larger fund of mortifying ſpeculation, than to ſee one man presuming to oppreſs another. In a mind mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly philoſophical, it raiſes curioſity; in a mind ſenſible and honeſt, it excites ſurpriſe; in mind capable of the noble reſentment of virtue, it rouſes indignation. Aſk that man who ſqueezes the hard wrought labourer, what right he has to oppreſs his brethren? Aſk him what the unhappy creature has done to forfeit his favour? O! he will tell you he is idle and unworthy of favour. This I grant may be true in ſome inſtances; but I fear that it is rather an apology for oppreſſion; the lurking motive more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is, that few favours are done in this world but from ſelfiſh motives, and when your benefactor receives not the return which he expected, he is diſappointed and chagrined — This is not benevolence on the part of the beſtower, it is an abſolute bargain for value to be received, it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a man at an advantage, and making your own terms with him; it is a racit compact, but of which you have not ſo much as a ſuſpicion of the motive. A diſintereſted benefactor is never diſappointed. I maintain that ſetting gratitude, good offices reward themſelves, and if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not forced, every return which is in the power of a grateful heart will be made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>BUT if theſe motives affect you not, let me ſuggeſt one which you muſt feel. In a life ſo ſhort as this, why would you oppreſs? you will not long enjoy the pleaſure, if you think it one of hearing the widow mourn; before you can tear his garments from the orphan, before he is reduced to ſuch a ſtate, as to render your enjoyment complete, the deluſion flies. You yourſelves are low and need that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which you now refuſe to others. Yes! my affected friends, the period of their oppreſſion is ſhort, and the more violently they drive, the more rapidly they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the end of their courſe; there they will ceaſe from troubling, their inexorable hearts will beat no more. Free among the dead, you will enjoy that repoſe you are deprived of here, nor ever more be ſubject to their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. For,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:035491_0008_1004DEB8910C49D0"/>II. THE grave is a place where the weary are at reſt—The weary are at reſt! How ſoothing is the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? There is ſomething in the expreſſion which affectſ the heart with uncommon ſenſations, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a ſpecies of delight, where tranquility is the only ingredient! To be delivered from trouble, to be relieved from oppreſſion, to be freed from care and pain, from ſickneſs and diſtreſs, to lie down in a bed of ſecurity, in long oblivion of our woes! how ſoothing is the ſentiment, how full of conſolation! The ocean may roll its waves, the warring winds may join their forces, the thunders may ſhake the ſkies, the lightnings paſs ſwiftly from cloud to cloud; but not the force of winds combined, nor the ſound of thunder, nor the rage of many ſeas though united in one peal, and directed to one point, can ſhake the firm ſecurity of the tomb! The dead hear nothing of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult; conducted to ſilent manſions, they cannot be awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the fierceſt thunders or the loudeſt clamours. The unfortunate, the oppreſſed and broken hearted, reſt here together, every ſorrow is huſhed and every pang ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. Hence in all nations, a ſet of names have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen to convey the idea of death congenial with theſe ſentiments. It is called the harbour of reſt, where the diſtreſſed mariner wearied out by winds and ſtorms, at length moors his ſhattered veſſel, never more to return to the toſſing of the waſteful ocean. It is called the land of peace, where the friendleſs exile retire beyond the reach of malice and envy, and the crueleſt arrows of misfortune. It is called the hoſpitable houſe, where the weatherbeaten traveller, ſaint with traverling pathleſſ defarts, finds a welcome and ſecure repoſe. But this brings me to the third thing propoſed, which was to conſider the grave as a place where the diſtinctions of life are leveled, where ſociety returns to itſ firſt principleſ, where nature reſumes her rights and where all men are replaced in their original equality.</p>
            <p>NEXT to the influence of our paſſions, the moſt of the calamities which man inflicts on man, ariſe from the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual though neceſſary diſtribution of property and power. Dazzled with riches and diſtinctions, we are apt to conſider ourſelves when we obtain poſſeſſion, not as men appointed to collect and preſide over the common ſtores of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but as undoubted heirs of excluſive advantages and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035491_0009_1004DEBB6322DF80"/>
ſuperior in the very nature of things to the common maſs of mankind. Than this, there cannot be an error more fatal either in theory or in life. This vaſt globe on which we stand, is inhabited by millions of rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who have all an equal right to her productions; but as it is impoſſible that we can all poſſeſs and as a greater ſum total of happineſs reſults from the preſent arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it hath pleaſed the policy of providence to put this earth, with her inhabitants and productions, under the government of a few, who manage, under God, for the greater good of the whole. This is the original of all property and power, and the final ends which providence propoſes to accompliſh from the preſent inequality which prevails in life, and conſidered in this view, the policy is benevolent as well as profound. The diſtinction of ranks, the ſubordination among men, and the reverence for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when confined within their proper limits, and the ends of their inſtitution, kept in view, are all neceſſary in our ſyſtem; but the amazement of a contemplative man proceeds from this, that theſe lords of the earth, who know themſelves to be but men, and whoſe hearts are conſequently in the ſecret, ſhould from this circurmſtance, take occaſion to become tyrannical; that forgeting the ends of their preeminence, they ſhould miſtake poſſeſſion for right, and act as if this world with its inhabitants, and productions, were created for their private advantage; that miſtaking property for power, they ſhould erect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into taſk-maſters, and make imperious war upon the freedom of the ſpecies.—The advantages of ſociety, though numerous, make perhaps, but poor amends, when her principles are thus corrupted, when the ſelfiſh &amp; tyrannical diſpoſitions, find themſelves protected by power, and when the original equality of men is forgotten and diſclaimed. Hence that inſolence of office, the ſenſleſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of birth, the mean language of flattery, and the groans of the oppreſſed, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a general but morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying remark, that no man or ſet of men, were ever yet endowed with unlimited privileges, which they did not wanton with, or abuſe. This is a general remark upon the human character. Today we ſuffer, tomorrow we

oppreſs. Vain man, how ſoon, and by what ſlight acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, is his reaſon overturned. He firſt by many a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtep, and by many an anxious prayer to heaven for ſucceſs, purſues ſome favorite ſcheme of happineſs. What vows does he nor make, that if heaven will but favor his undertakings, he will ſtill retain a grateful remembrance of the benefit; but he has no ſooner obtained the ends of his pre-eminence, than forgetting all his prayers and vows of gratitude, he preſumptuouſly aſcribes the whole to his own merit; boldly arrogates the partial indulgence of heaven to himſelf, as his right, and proceeding from one ſtep of pride, oppreſſion, and ſolly, to another; he ſhakes aloſt the rod of power, makes himſelf a god in his own imagination, and forgets that men are his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures.</p>
            <p>FROM a review of the miſeries of human life, as well thoſe which are the conſequences of power among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as thoſe which are unavoidable, men of warm fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and generous diſpoſitions, have been led to imagine, that human affairs were not always in this ſituation. They have imagined, that a ſcene ſuch as the preſent exhibits, could not come originally from the hands of an all benevolent God. They have imagined a golden age wherein men lived as they came from the hands of their Creator, free, fearleſs, innocent, virtuous &amp; independent.</p>
            <p>THEN ſay they, were there no wars to deſolate the world, no frauds put in practice among brethren. The ſeeds of animoſity were not yet ſown, nor was the ſoil prepared to receive them. No deceit lurked in the heart, no cloud darkened the brow; but man met man with erect countenances, the conſequences of freedom, of mutual confidence and independency; nor had luxury as yet invented her fatal arts, to enervate the mind or rack the body with acute diſeaſes Men lived ſimply, recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at their eaſe, beneath ſhady trees, or by the ſides of brooks or ſtreams the firſt inhabitants of the earth led lives devoted to love, to joy, and to innocency. And as all the paſſions were atuned to harmony within, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ements without, were in perfect concord, with theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful movements. No cloud had as yet deformed the face of heaven; no ſtorm had collected over the affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mariner, no thunders had been heard to roll, the ſun

ſtrone ſerenelv, the gales blew ſoftly, the face of the deep was calm; there was an eternal ſpring, every heart beat with joy, and all nature was filled with hippineſs. Such they imagined, was the felicity of the firſt ſet of men.</p>
            <p>BUT whilſt we ſoothe ourſelveſ by looking back to a happineſs, which (if ever it exiſted) is now no more; it will afford us a higher conſolation, to look forward to a ſtate which really lies before us. Before us lies a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful empire, where all the miſeries of life are buſhed, and where all the cauſes which agitate this upper world are deſtroyed. In the grave all the diſtinctions of life ceaſe; nature reſumes her rights, and all things are brought back once more, to their original level. Theſe the wicked ceaſe from troubling, there the weary reſt from their toils. There no paſſions diſtract, and no enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame, their agonizing pain, and wounding inſamy and ruthleſs revenge are no more; but profound peace and calm paſſions and ſecurity, which is immoveable.</p>
            <p>THUS, My Brethren, I have exhibited to your view, one of the most intereſting ſubjects which can occupy the mind of man. In whatever light we view this awful ſubject, it preſents us with a ſolemn ſcene.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER left the precincts of mortality without caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wiſhful look on what he had left behind, and a trembling eye on the, dreadful ſcene before him? How affecting muſt it be to disſſolve at once, all the connections of life, and to part with all that is dear below the ſun? How mortifying to think of that fair form, and theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive limbs, in which we perhaps, too much boaſted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming pale and ghaſtly, and ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ffening like the clay, and ready to moulder into duſt; but how much more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtill is it, for a foul rouled to a conſciouſneſs of guilt, during every moment of its paſt exiſtence, to burſt into the regions of eternity, there to appear before an awful judge, and to receive ſentence according to the deeds done in the body; a ſentence in exact proportion to the degrees of its guilt.</p>
            <p>I COME now to the fourth thing propoſed, which was, to draw ſome uſeful reflections from what has been ſaid. And,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:035491_0012_1004DEC31007F548"/>I. You who are ſinking under the burden of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and oppreſſion be comforted: the day of your deliverance draweth nigh; the morning of your ſalvation which you are ſo ardently ſoliciting. There is only one thing that can diſappoint your hopes, and that is, vice and irreligion; a glorious redemption awaits you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the grave; render not yourſelves unworthy of it All your afflictions and fiery trials which are but for a moment, will work out for you an high degree of felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through all the ages of eternity.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, you who enjoy the ſunſhine of proſperity, he not intoxicated; vain is that pre-eminence on which your ſtate is founded; time is faſt carrying you to the end of your enjoyments, and nothing can avail you but religion and virtue. In your life, your health, your comforts, your connections, the principles of deſtruction work; you are ſtanding upon a precipice, and the ground is faſt ſlipping from beneath your feet; your own life is alſo fleeting and tranſitory; every thought, every word, every action of your lives, is attended with eternal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; it is either filling up the meaſure of your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery; do not then ſuffer the ſhadowy ſeene here below, to rob you of your ſupreme felicity.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, thirdly, Let us learn from the whole of what has been ſaid, not to value ourſelves by our ſituations in life. Theſe ſituations; are neceſſary; and it is neceſſary that ſome ſhould fill them. It would ſeem that God hath varied our circumſtances, that we might have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of acting a part in different ſituations; to be flav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh in adverſity is improper, to be inſolent in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ridiculous. The only thing that we ought to be ſolicitous about, is our conduct. This will ſurvive when diſtinctions of every other nature are done away, when we ourſelves ſhall depart, and when all nature ſhall ſink in one common deſolation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THE tranquility which death affords to the mind of a good man, ariſes from the joyful hope, which Chriſt Jeſuſ, by his death and reſurrection, hath opened up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond death and the grave.</p>

It is hope whch make us face difficulties, wreſtle with miſfortunes, and riſe unconquered from calamities, which would otherwiſe cruſh us to the duſt, and make us cry out in the deſpair of our hearts, it is better for us to die than to live. The ſame principle which accompanies us in every diſtreſsful ſcene of life, and even prevents us from throwing away life itſelf, as an intolerable burden, carries our views into a future ſtate, and diſpoſes us irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtably to look for that happineſs there, which we have labored after here in vain.</p>
            <p>THE happineſs which we purſue in this ſtate, is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>gacious, it glitters before us like a falſe fire, which embarraſſes the benighted traveller. In vain we double our ſpeed and reach after what is not. The vain deluſion ſtill mocks our toil, and eludes our graſp. At length having ſuffciently ſported with our credulity, it vaniſhes at once, and leaves us a prey to perplexity and deſpair.</p>
            <p>NOT ſo the happineſſ of a future ſtate. Like a light hung out on ſtormy coaſt, to direct the diſtreſſed mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we ſteer to it thro' millions of ſurrounding waves. In vain the tempeſt beſets us, and night falls with all its ſhades, we keep it ſteady in our eye through the gloom, and braves the oppoſition of the elements; ſecure that if we can but reach the deſired haven, we ſhall find a ſhelter from the ſtorm, and an agreeable and ſafe retreat from the perils of a diſaſtrous voyage. This is the point, my brethren, which we ought to have always in our eye. This will keep us ſteady and uniform, amidſt all the fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations of this preſent life; and it will at length land us in that happy country, where harmony, love and joy ſhall ever reign.</p>
            <p>To encourage you ſtill farther to perſevere in one u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform courſe of religion and virtue, I ſhall exhibit to your view, ſome features of the leading characters of your nation.</p>
            <p>AND the firſt conſpicuous character which I ought to mention, is one who ſtands high on the records of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ame, and I am perſuaded high alſo, in the affections and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem of every good man. Like an healthy plant, beſide ſome nutritious ſtream, he grew up ſilently, and perhaps
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035491_0014_1004DECB05FFCFF8"/>
imperceived by the vulgar eye. However unobſerved by others, he was fat and full of ſap; the rough winds of adverſity only made him ſtrike the deeper root; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the winters blaſts often withered his leaves, yet the general ſpring made him ſwell and riſe. From ſtorms he was a ſhelter, and from heat a ſhade. To the birds of the air he afforded a ſecure and ſafe retreat; and every living thing rejoiced under his protection. The little hills rejoiced on every ſide, and the mountains were refreſhed with his ſhade. The Lion and the Wolf, ſoothed with his fragrance, laid aſide their fierceneſs. Under his chequered ſhade, herbs, trees, plants, fruits, and flowers with pleaſant ſmiles, reared their joyful heads. His head towered to the ſkies, and his leaves ſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſilver dews.</p>

            <p>THIS is the man, Gentlemen, who was at the helm of your affairs; who ſteadily conducted the veſſel of ſtate amidſt the ſtorms and tempeſts of tedious war. Although ſhe was much toſſed on the ſurface of the waſteful ocean, yet by his care and diligence, ſhe was at length conducted into a ſafe harbour. That reſt, which (through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God) you now enjoy, is in a great meaſure owing to his ſtrenuous efforts. He was your Joſhua, who, although Jordan was overflowing his banks, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up a ſafe paſſage for your people. Tell me, you who know, whither his prudence, his fortitude, his juſtice, or his temperance, were the moſt conſpicuous features of his character? Whilſt theſe virtues ſhone in his life and converſation, they were conſtantly brightened by a graceful piety and an ardent devotion.</p>
            <p>SHALL I mention in the ſecond place, or ſhall I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, or rather equal with him, the great man, on whom you have now conferred the moſt burden ſome toils, and the higheſt office of ſtate. Like him, he has grown old amongſt you, and has exerted all his powers in hiſ coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſervice.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035491_0015_1004DECDB436F950"/>WHILST the one was ſteering the veſſel of ſtate, the other was ſhaping her courſe; whilſt the one brought liberty to your country, the other was providing a ſafe reception for her continuance. The one was the moſt active hand for preſerving your country from a foreign invaſion, the other has preſerved her from a diabolical ſcheme of foreign intrigue. The one was a bleſſing to you in time of war; the other is a bleſſing in time of peace. The one has now laid aſide the burden of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic toil; and is enjoying a calm, a delicious &amp; ſafe retreat; the other is ſtill ſtooping under the cares of an extenſive government. In both, prudence, juſtice, temperance, and fortitude, ſeem to reign. Your time would ſail me but to mention mauy others, who are highly deſerving of the gratitude of their country. May their deathleſs names ſtill live in the hearts and lives of their children, their friends, and in the hearts of the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>THERE is only one character which I ſhall beg leave to mention; and that is of one who has been gradually drawn into my view, by the excellent ſentiments which flow in his ſpeeches and proclamations, by the glowing warmth of affection, expreſſed by his friends and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents, and the high encomiums of thoſe who differ from him in political ſentiments. Theſe rays increaſed and brightened the nearer I approached the luminous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. "Bleſſed be the Lord thy God, who delighteth in thee, to ſet thee as the head of this people, becauſe the Lord hath not caſt off this people, therefore made he thee ruler, to do juſtice and judgment."</p>
            <p>I WILL not life flattering titles—No. Native excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency needs not the foreign aid of ornament, but is when unadorned, adorned the moſt. One of the higheſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man characters given in the ſcriptures, is comprehended in three words: "Enoch walked with God." Your ſtation, your character, your perſon, your abilities, call loudly for the higheſt gratitude and praiſe to heaven. You live in the hearts of all thoſe who know you; culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate true religion und you ſhall live alſo in the hearts of 1a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt poſterity, and ſhine as the ſun in the kingdom of your father; many children will be born unto God by your influence, and will ſhine as ſtars to adorn you in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions above.</p>

            <p>I WOULD alſo beg leave to preſent reſpectful addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and congratulations, on this pleaſing occaſion. In proportion to your elevation, you are drawing the eyes of the world upon you. What might have paſſed unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a private ſituaſion, will be deeply ſcrutinized in you, who are called to act in a public capacity. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the intereſts of the ſtate, their virtues, and their vices, will be very much influenced by your actions and behaviour. Nay, your influence will perhaps flow to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt poſterity. The enemies of your government, your religion, and your happineſs, have been of late increaſing in all countries. In ſchools, in colleges, and in ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of learning, they have been endeavouring to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves and to ſubvert every ſteady principle of human life. Would you wiſh them to inſpire life and vigor into your infant ſtate; would you wiſh her to be rendered a bleſſing in the midſt of the earth; begin then in your ſeveral departments, to cultivate true religion. Let it not be the vain rant of enthuſiaſts or the maſk of hypocrites to deceive and betray. No. Let it be that ſteady maſculine piety, which actuates the whole foul, and ſhines out iu the life and converſation. Let your families, your connections, your conſtituents, all bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to your devotion, your juſtice, your charity, your humility, your candor and truth. Truſting in God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and in Jeſus Chriſt the ſurety of loſt man, ſteady to abound in every chriſtian grace and virtue. This is the life of the ſoul, this is the life of ſociety, and this will ſave your country from ruin.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now conclude this diſcourſe, with AN ADDRESS TO THS WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE.</p>
            <p>MY BRETHREN,</p>
            <p>You proſeſs yourſelves to be the ſource of power: that all power is derived from the tree and voluntary ſuffrages of the people. See then that this fountain be pure; otherwiſe, all the ſtreams which iſſue from it will be fainted with the corruptions which iſſue from the ſource. If I were an enemy to your government and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035491_0017_1004DED301D6A460"/>
to your felicity, I would encourage you in keeping reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from your houſes, from your ſchools, and from your churches; I would adviſe ſpeculators to ſtrike in with the leading vices of the youth, and ſhow them how they may act the madman more genteelly. I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage youth to deſpiſe theſe unwildly and clumſy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom they call Prieſts, as only an interruption and hindrance in the pleaſures of life. I would adviſe them to reject with diſdain, the ſordid parſimeny of their parents, as unbecoming their rank and ſtation. I would encourage them to turn their minds to external pomp and ſhow, and glitter in the firſt ranks of ſocieiy. I would adviſe them to ſtrain every nerve to outſhine their companions, though at the expence of their parents, their friends, their honeſty, their veracity, and every thing virtuous and ſacred. I would ſay, rejoice, O young man in thy youth; let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth; walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes; eat, drink, and be merry. I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the leaders of the people to ſtep before them into the ſcenes of vice, where they may throw away their virtue, their religion, and their fortune at once. But what ſays the wisdom of Solomon? "Know thou, that for all theſe things, God will bring thee into judgment." There thou muſt give an account of the deeds done in the body, whither they be good or bad.</p>
            <p>GOD, My Brethren, has given you a large and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious country; a country of mountains and vallies, of hills and dales, of rivers, woods, and plains; a country loudly calling for the induſtry of the huſbandman; a country teeming with natural wealth, producing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, all the ſimple neceſſaries of life; a country where the pious man may worſhip God without fear, and feaſt abundantly upon the fruits of his induſtry. What temptation then can there be to tranſgreſs the bounds of virtue? What need of ſpeculation, of cheating, of deceit, and accumulating wealth upon the ruin of our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures? In proportion to theſe high natural advent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which you enjoy, ſuch is the aggravation of all theſe crimes which prevail among you. I could eaſily trace theſe crimes to their ſource, and ſhew you how the mind is warped by early habit, by the deceit which appears in the lives of parents, and theſe with whom we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035491_0018_1004DED6C7E685A0"/>
in our infancy; from the too ardent deſire of pomp and ſhow, and from the overflowings of vice in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, countries finding a reſervoir in this.</p>
            <p>BUT I have no pleaſure in wounding your feelings. I ſhall leave theſe topics to your own meditation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to lay aſide all guile, all hypocriſy, and evil ſpeaking, and as new born babes to deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby.</p>
            <p>WOULD you, My Brethren, trace all theſe ſtreams of vice to their ſources, and ſincerely repent of your ſins; would you adopt the reſolution of Zaccheus, the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, "Shew mercy to the poor, and if you have taken any thing from any man by falſe acculation, reſtore it to him four fold," you would be the happieſt people upon earth. But do not think that you can become religious whilſt you retain the gains of diſhoneſty. No: Do not deceive your yourſelves; ſooner can the rivers and ſtreams reaſcend the lofty mountains, ſooner can the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theopian change his ſkin, or the Leopard his ſpots, than you can enjoy true communion with God, whilſt you pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute your hands, by holding of bribes. "Cleanſe your hands, ye ſinners, and purify your hearts ye double mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then draw high unto God and he will draw high unto you." Let that grace and truth which ſhone in your Saviour, as its native ſource, alſo adorn your characters. Thus your affections will be expanded, and will diffuſe themſelves without reſtraint, upon all around you. That mutual truſt, which is the baſis of all other ſocial enjoyments, will be more and more ſtrengthened. You will become a bleſſing to yourſelves, a bleſſing to your parents, a bleſſing to your children, a bleſſing to your ſtate, a bleſſing to your country. You will be bleſſed in your baſket, bleſſed in your ſtore, bleſſed in your life, bleſſed in your death, and bleſſed through all the ages of eternity.</p>
            <p>As I am a ſtranger, and without political views or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt at ſtake, I hope you will liſten to me with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced ear.</p>
            <p>FLY from all enthuſiaſtic rants, and freaks of enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm; let your manners be ſimple and plain; let ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and truth ſhine more in your actions than in your
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035491_0019_1004DED84E1D8E50"/>
words; let the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind, the orphan and the fatherleſs, feel that you are Chriſt's Repreſentatives upon earth. Religion does not conſiſt in "bowing down the head as a bulruſh, and ſpreading ſackcloth and aſhes order us." No, it conſiſts in "looſing the bands of wickedneſs, in undoing the heavy burdens, in letting the opprſſed go free, and in breaking every yoke. It is to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor who are caſt out to thy houſe; when thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou cover them, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from ſhine own fleſh. If theſe actions flow from true chriſtian prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples "then ſhall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily; and thy righteouſneſs ſhall go before thee; the glory of the Lord ſhall be thy rearward." Do not, my Brethren, think that by theſe exhortations I deſpiſe the doctrines of grace, no, God forbid; but I would not carry that doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what is written; the grace of God is as necceſſary as the warming ſun, and the genial influences of ſpring are to the ſwelling year; but remember that it acts as imperceptibly, as theſe latent influences.</p>
