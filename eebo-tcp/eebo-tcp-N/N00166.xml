            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>IN seventy five the <hi>Critick</hi> of our years</l>
                  <l>Commenc'd our war with <hi>Phillip</hi> and his peers.</l>
                  <l>Whither the sun in <hi>Leo</hi> had inspired</l>
                  <l>A feav'rish heat, and <hi>Pagan</hi> spirits fir'd?</l>
                  <l>Whither some Romish Agent hatcht the plot?</l>
                  <l>Or whither they themselves? appeareth not.</l>
                  <l>Whither our infant thrivings did invite?</l>
                  <l>Or whither to our lands pretended right?</l>
                  <l>Is hard to say; but <hi>Indian spirits</hi> need</l>
                  <l>No grounds but lust to make a Christian bleed.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And here methinks I see this greazy <hi>Lout</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>With all his pagan slaves coil'd round about,</l>
                  <l>Assuming all the majesty his throne</l>
                  <l>Of rotten stump, or of the rugged stone</l>
                  <l>Could yield; casting some bacon rine-like looks,</l>
                  <l>Enough to fright a Student from his books,</l>
                  <l>Thus treat his peers, &amp; next to them his Commons,</l>
                  <l>Kennel'd together all without a summons.</l>

My friends, our Fathers were not half so wise</l>

                  <l>Of all our countrey they enjoy the best,</l>

                  <l>These english make and we must keep them too,</l>
                  <l>Which is too hard for them or us to doe,</l>
                  <l>We drink we so big whipt, but english they</l>

                  <l>Justice did at greatest offenders wink</l>

                  <l>Houses with substance feel uplifting wings,</l>
                  <l>The earth remains, the last of humane things:</l>

            <head>ON A FORTIFICATION At Boston begun by Women. Dux Foemina Facti.</head>
            <l>A Grand attempt some Amazonian Dames</l>
            <l>Contrive whereby to glorify their names,</l>
            <l>A Ruff for <hi>Boston</hi> Neck of mud and turfe,</l>

            <l>Their nimble hands spin up like Christmas pyes,</l>
            <l>Their pastry by degrees on high doth rise.</l>
            <l>The wheel at home counts it an holiday,</l>
            <l>Since while the Mistris worketh it may play.</l>
            <l>A tribe of female hands, but manly hearts</l>
            <l>Forsake at home their pasty-crust and tarts.</l>
            <l>To knead the dirt, the samplers down they hurle,</l>
            <l>Their undulating silks they closely furle.</l>
            <l>The pick-axe one as a Commandress holds,</l>
            <l>While t'other at her awkness gently scolds.</l>
            <l>One puffs and sweats, the other mutters why</l>
            <l>Cant you promove your work so fast as I?</l>
            <l>Some dig, some delve, and others hands do feel</l>

And least some fainting fits the weak surprize,</l>
            <l>They want no sack nor cakes, they are more wise.</l>
            <l>These brave essayes draw forth Male stronger hands</l>
            <l>More like to Dawbers then to Martial bands:</l>
            <l>These do the work, and sturdy bulwarks raise,</l>
            <l>But the beginners well deserve the praise.</l>
