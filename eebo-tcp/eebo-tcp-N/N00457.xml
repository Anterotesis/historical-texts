            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN a real and deep sence of my Heavenly Fathers Love and tender Mercy, revealed through his most dear Son, our ever blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which I am (with many more) livingly made a partaker of, doth my Life and Spirit very dearly and tenderly salute you, as truly and most heartily wishing and praying, that divine Grace, Mercy and Peace, with all Spiritual Blessings and Divine Favours in Christ Jesus, may be encreased and multiplyed among you, and unto you, to your great Consolation, Peace and Prosperity in the Love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> I finding for some time of late a living and holy constraint and pressure of Spirit to communicate some things of weight and concern unto you, respecting your Safety, Peace and Prosperity in the blessed unchangeable Truth, am opened and encouraged by the precious Life and Spirit of our God, to be clear and free therein towards you all, and that in discharge of my tender Conscience in the sight and presence of the God of my Life, whom I serve with my Spirit in the Gospel of his dear Son, as I have sincerely done from my Youth upward, blessed be his pure Name forever. And having had these many Years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the weighty Servce of the Lord our God, through manifold Exercises, Burthens, Spiritual Travels and Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I may not hide my Talent, nor conceal those things my Lord and Master requires me to divulge for the Safety and Good of his People in their several Conditions, States and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ha<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

You therefore (my <hi>dear Friends</hi>) who have livingly felt, and tasted of the Lord's Power and Goodness, and known his Work in your Hearts, in order to your Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Redemption out of the Evil World, and the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, prize his tender Mercies and Goodness, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them not: Let the holy fear of the Lord God be your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and true Wisdom, and Understanding, the Stability of your times in Righteousness: Let your sincere Love to the pure Name and Truth of the Lord, and one unto another be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that unchangeable Truth and Power of an Endless Life, whereunto the Lord hath called us; and I pray God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease your Love and Zeal for his Glorious Name and Christian Tenderness, and Brotherly Affection one towards another, that Life for evermore may be your Blessing and Portion, as it will be to all them who dwell in Amity, true Love, &amp; Unity of Spirit in our Lord Jesus Christ, which is a most joyful, comfortable and blessed state, which too many Professors of Truth are short of, for want of keeping near to the Lord, in his holy fear &amp; Love of his blessed Name and Truth, whose negligence and unfaithfulness to Truth in themselves hath caused a decay of Love, &amp; want of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards others; and then instead of humbly waiting &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the Lord, some have exalted themselves in a Self-will, Self-conceit &amp; Affection to preheminence in Judgment over others, until thereby Divisions and Self-separations have been caused and stirred up by them, to the great grief of the Spirits of the upright, who have kept their Integrity to the Lord, his Truth and People. And this Self-Exaltation, slighting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning others, have been, and are the great Evils, Snares and Engines wherewith the Adversary catches <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>My <hi>dear Friends,</hi> the Lord our God has been good to us, a tender Father through all our Trials, Sufferings and Exercises, in upholding us by his free Spirit, accompanying us with his presence, comforting us in our Afflictions, with his renewed Mercies and multiplied Favours, in preserving us a living people to his praise until this day, and affording us this present <hi>Liberty</hi> we have of late enjoyed, and do pertake of the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereof, in our publick, peaceable and Religious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, for the Exaltation of the glorious Name, holy Truth, and divine Power of the Lord our God.

            <p>And <hi>dear Friends, Brethren</hi> and <hi>Sisters,</hi> whom I truly love in the Lord, who retain your Integrity and Love in the blessed unchangeable Truth, you cannot be unsensible how that the Lords Harvest is great, and what need of faithful Labourers there now is, an effectual Door being open in this time of Liberty, the Lord in Mercy has granted for the good of many poor Souls, that they may come and receive the Truth in the love of it; and that they who have been or are of a fearful Heart, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive strength, and know the Lord to be their Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, in this his Evangelical Day, and free and blessed op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he has afforded. And yet though this Harvest be great, the diligent and faithful Labourers are but few now rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Comparison of the greatness of the Harvest, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Work, many of our antient Brethren, and faithful

fellow-Labourers and Helpers in Christ, being taken away, and gone to their everlasting Rest, having faithfully served out their Day and Generation, fulfilled and finished their Testimony with Joy and Peace, and obtained a Crown of Glory, that shall never fade away.</p>
            <p>And this very matter has been often seriously upon my Thoughts, and weighty Considerations, What should be the Cause or Reason why so few faithful Labourers, and clear Gospel Ministers have been of late raised up, or now brought forth? (tho' some be in a good lively Testimony, blessed be the Lord) and it clearly appears to me; <hi>First,</hi> That few are given up in their Spirits for this weighty Service (as we were in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) who are in some measure gifted and qualified.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Few sincerely seek the Lord, or have waited upon him with fervent Desires, Prayer and Supplication, that they may be gi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Very few have their Minds and Spirits really and inwardly exercised in frequent Prayer, and daily Supplication to God, or in heavenly Meditation, or Spiritual Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Gods pure and spiritual Laws, Wayes, Judgments and Works, or in holy Scriptures, by the holy Spirit, which opens them, but too many have their Minds, Hearts and Affections taken up with these fading Objects, and Things below, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Earthly Things, or over-charged with the love of Riches, Cares and Cumbers of this Life, to compass the Earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many a good Talent has been hid, and poor Soul buried in Captivity: Whereas it requires an inward and serious Exercise of Spirit toward God, frequent and fervent Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to him, an inward and diligent Attention upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>It is both a great Grief and Scandal also to see many of the Younger sort, who frequent our Meetings, and even of Friends Children also, degenerating into Pride, and height of Spirit, and Apparel, so nearly to imitate and border upon the World, as too to many do, contrary to the Gravity, Modesty, Sobriety, Plainness, Simplicity, Innocency and Humility, which Truth requires in Example, as well as in Spirit, and which Truth at first led many into, and as still it doth lead and order them that truly love and obey it: In which I pray God to settle and order his People, and that no plea nor excuse may be made to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pride, Va<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And its they who are inclining and getting into the Spirit of the World, and Liberty out of the Truth, who live not in Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, nor in the fear of God, that give secret strength to an Apostate Turbulent Spirit, which has been the Churches Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of late Years, and that are mo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

to degenerate, and their Minds to be exalted and alienated from the the Fear of God, from the Cross of Christ, from Humility and Lowliness of Mind, from True and Conscientious Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, from Love to the Brethren, from Innocency, Plainness, and Simplicity that's in Christ, both in their Spirits, Language and Habits, who therefore ought to be faithfully admonished, and tenderly instructed, by which means (together with a meek and gentle Behaviour) many have been gained, and many may yet be recovered out of the Snares of Satan, who have been taken Captive at Unawares; <hi>Having Compassion of some, making a Difference,</hi> has often reached the tender part in them; and in relation to others more deeply prejudiced, I remember a cautious Saying of an Antient and Faithful Brother deceased, viz. <hi>Where we cannot make them Better, we must take heed we do not make them Worse.</hi> The Lord keep his People in his holy Fear, watchful and humble before him, in true Love and tender Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, that they may receive Wisdom from him to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to minister suitable to all Conditions.</p>
            <p>And all <hi>Dear</hi> and <hi>Tenderly Beloved Friends,</hi> with all who are effectually convinced of Gods holy Truth and Name, and do profess the same: In the holy Fear of God, in his Light Watch and Pray constantly (without fainting) against your Souls subtil Adversary, in all his Attempts, to beget into Self-exaltation and Prejudice, to smite fellow-Servants, and cause Divisions or Offences; for that's the Enemy's Work.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Friends,</hi> have not the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of Persons: This was Antient and Christian Counsel. So let not the Rich and High contemn the Low and Mean; let not uncertain Riches puff any up, or exalt them above their Brethren: Nor any Brother of high Degree (in Earthly Enjoyments) slight or contemn their Brethren of low Degree; some sincere hearted and serviceable Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have enjoyed plenty of the World's Goods, and yet through Losses, Sufferings, Disappointments, or other's Unjust Dealings by them, are brought low in the World, and they were esteemed when in Prosperity. It would be very Unchristian and Sinful, to slight or dis-esteem them in their Adversity,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000580_0012_0FA7109A43CC9C48"/>
which is their Tryal: The Poor of this World, who are rich in Faith, whom God hath chosen, are near unto him, their Faith is the more tryed by their Poverty and Lownes; and how soon That may be the Tryal of many that are Rich, they know not; therefore 'tis very unsafe for any to trust in <hi>Vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Riches,</hi> or to be exalted or lifted up because of them, but rather humbly to depend upon the living God, and trust in him, and love and esteem their Brethren in Truth, how mean and low soever in this World, knowing that with God there is no Respect of Persons, nor with them that truly bear his Image.</p>
            <p>And pray, <hi>Friends,</hi> keep out all Disputes and Controversies which some busie Spirits in the World are incident unto, as about outward <hi>Revolutions, Governments, State-Affairs,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms of this World:</hi> Let not their Divisions divide you, nor their Strife and Contentions about the outward Court and forms of Religion, earthly Kingdoms and Crowns (that will fade) influence any among you, to contend, or become Parties about them, but quietly serve and wait upon God in your Places and Stations, where he hath set you, and submissively leave all to his over-ruling Power, Wisdom and Providence, to do or suffer things to come to pass, as he pleaseth; for none may say to him, <hi>What doest thou?</hi> (Tho' <hi>Men,</hi> by men may be warned, as God shall require) and he knows what's best for his People, and will cause all things to work together for good to them that love him; his Kingdom come more and more, his blessed Will be done in Heaven and Earth, who is Judge of all, and sees all Hearts, Intents and Designs of Men throughout the whole World.
