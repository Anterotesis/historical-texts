            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIR, I hear that our General Court is to ſit the next Wedneſday, and am very much concern'd about what the Reſult of this Seſſions will be. For the whole Province ſeems to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Parties; one of them is continually exclaiming with a grievous and bitter Cry, <hi>Our Paper Money! Our Paper money</hi>! it is this that has brought upon us the direful Retinue of fatal Evils that we are ſtooping under, and a ſucceſſion of it, (if emitted) will not fail to draw a ſable Curtain over the laſt Appearance of our Happineſs, and ſhut up every Glade of light and Proſperity, to this already miſerable Province. The other is alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly mourning, with a Cry no leſs audible and bitter, <hi>Our want of a Medium of Trade, it is this that will ruin us</hi>; The Silver and Gold is irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably gone; and Bills of Credit are grievouſly ſcanty; and unleſs our Government will ſupply us with more of theſe, the Want of them will open to us the darkeſt Scene, that ever this Province ſaw; will cut off from us every thing that may ſeem proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and without fail finiſh our deſtruction, by bringing us under a ſeries of inextricable ſtraits and Adverſities.</p>

hurt or advanced by the emitting or witholding more Bills, any further than a publick Good or evil affects private Perſons, and this will help you to believe that what is here attempted by me has no private View at all.</p>
            <p>And now in debating the Queſtion propoſed, that I may ſhew you my mind <hi>in Plain,</hi> I will lead you by perſpicuous and eaſy ſteps, as well as may be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to gain my Point.</p>
            <p>Here then I premiſe, that as one Member of the Body cannot, ſo neither can one Perſon, Family, State or Country, ſay to another, <hi>I have no need of thee</hi>; But Trade, or the Exchange of one Commodity for another (which cannot be carried on without ſome ſuitable Medium of Exchange) is needful to the well being of every People. Theſe things, I ſuppoſe will be granted by a general Suffrage.</p>
            <p>And now I ſuppoſe</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Produce of a Country, or its moveables, ſuch as may be ſpared for Exportation, (and not it's Lands or real Eſtate) are to procure and ſupply the Country with this medium of Exchange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Foundation of Trade is laid in this, That one Country ſeldom or never produces every individual) commodity (or a ſufficiency thereof) which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or at leaſt, convenient for it's ſubſiſtence, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily (ſuch is the goodneſs of Providence) what is wanting in one Country is abundant in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And the very notion of a medium of Exchange is, that it be ſomething of a certain and known value, and eaſy of Tranſportation, ſuitable to be given to make up the Ballance, where one Species to be exchanged exceeds the other; or to be given as a full price for the Commodity we want. Now if our Medium be Gold, Silver, Copper, &amp;c. it carries the foundation of its own Credit in it ſelf; inaſmuch as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all people is, that it is intrinſically valuable But if it be <hi>Bank-Notes</hi> &amp;c. then it has no value in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002283_0009_0FDAE3EC388B3C28"/>
but the Foundation of its Credit, is the Bank it is raiſed upon; and every one who receives it doth ſo, not for its own ſake, but for the ſake of the <hi>Fund.</hi> And if the <hi>Fund</hi> or <hi>Bank</hi> be Moveables, ſuch as Gold, Silver, &amp;c. then this kind of Medium is the moſt valuable, as being not of a waſtful nature, and moſt ſafe and eaſy of Carriage; and then if all the <hi>Notes</hi> of a Country be gone, and they cannot redeem them, the worſt that can be is, he that has them muſt take the Fund they were raiſed upon, and the Country begin anew. But if the Lands, the real Eſtates of a Country, be the Fund to ſupport the Credit of its <hi>Notes</hi> (as is the Caſe of this Province reſpecting our paper Money) it is then a moſt dangerous Medium. For if their <hi>Notes</hi> be gone, and they cannot redeem them, then the beſt that can be is, they who have the Notes or Bills muſt take the Land to make good their Credit; and upon what Bottom will the Country ſtand then?</p>
            <p>This thought ſeems enough to ſtrike through the Soul of every generous Freeholder.</p>
            <p>And from theſe Conſiderations I conclude,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Plentifulneſs or Scarcity of the</hi> Medium of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change <hi>in a Country, depends upon the Induſtry &amp; Prudence, or Idleneſs and Illhusbandry of its Inhabitants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the prudence and Induſtry of a People, be ſuch, that they will conſtantly prepare, either of the produce of, or Manufactures performed in their own Country, for Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſuch Plenty, as that the value of them may be more than ſufficient, to purchaſe every thing that they want from abroad, to conſume among themſelves; then the Overplus of their value, will be conſtantly drawing that which is uſed by the Traders for a Medium of Exchange, and make it plenty among them. And the contrary Qualifications in any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſc. Idleneſs and Illhusbandry, will always bring forth the contrary effect, ſcil. a ſcarcity of the Medium of Exchange among them.</p>
            <p>For if the Import of a Country be more than the Export, (it is as plain as that two and two will make four,) that the Medium of Exchange, muſt go to make up the Ballance.</p>
            <p>And here I am obliged to diſſent from the wonderful Doctrine ſcattered forth by <hi>Amicus Patriae,</hi> "That the Merchants hold the Helm, and are principle Steerſmen in

               </gap>dle. pag. 1. And that the advancement of a Country's Wealth &amp;c wholly depends upon Trading, as he ſeems to urge, p. 18. where alſo to prove his Doctrine by an undeniable Evidence, he tells us that "Tyrus was but a naked Rock ſpread out into the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wonderful Miſrepreſentation! Doth he think that no body knows <hi>Tyre</hi> but himſelf?

Yea ſo noted through the whole world, were the <hi>Tyrians</hi> for the Induſtrious improvement of that moſt profitable Trade, that the ſame Latin Word [<hi>Tyrius</hi> the Adjective of <hi>Tyrus</hi> is uſed to ſignify purple, and an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of <hi>Tyre.</hi> This the little School-boy may teach us. And I remember Dr. <hi>Hylen,</hi> whoſe Authority every one will allow to be great, deſcribing the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> gives this as the reaſon of its Riches and Grandure. "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Holland</hi> is alſo mentioned by him for the ſame purpoſe, pag. 19. as "naturally not affording any one Commodity of uſe; yet by Merchandize, &amp;c. It is ſtrange if any Man ſhould pretend to deſcribe Countrys, who is not ſo far verſed in Hiſtory, as to know that the World has noted <hi>Holland</hi> for its exemplary, its marvellous Induſtry in <hi>Manufactures,</hi> ſo that it is known to Hiſtorians by this Name, <hi>The Bee-hive of Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, whatever is pretended to the contrary by <hi>Amicus Patriae</hi> notwithſtanding, I lay this down as a principle,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Opulency and Grandure of a Country depends upon the Induſtry and Prudence of its Inhabitants</hi>; This is the formal Cauſe of it, for even Trade and Commerce (which I allow to be the grand, the neceſſary Inſtruments of promoting theſe) do depend upon it. And then I add,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That when once the Produce of a Country will not afford it a ſufficient Medium of Exchange, it will immediately be thrown headlong upon this dreadful Dilemma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Either it's Trade muſt be carried on by Barter; or its Lands uſed to ſupply it with a Medium of Exchange.</hi> The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, I think, can't be deny'd; for if the Moveables of a Country will not ſupply it with a Medium, ſome other way muſt be found out, or Trade will utterly ſink: But there can be no other way ſuppoſed than either,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002283_0011_0FDAE3EF45EF4D68"/>1. <hi>To carry it on by Barter,</hi> (which I ſuppoſe to be always attended with many very burthenſome Circumſtances in every Place, and for many reaſons wholly impracticable in this Province.) Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the real Eſtates or Lands of a Country be uſed to ſupply it with a Medium of Exchange</hi>; i. e. <hi>by being made a</hi> Fund <hi>for a Bank of Credit.</hi> Every Medium of Exchange muſt carry ſo much with it, as is ſufficient to ſatisfy the Receiver, that what he receives is as valuable as that which he parts with, and if the <hi>Medium</hi> be a Bill of Credit, there muſt be ſome <hi>Foundation</hi> of it's Credit, to ſatisfy him that he ſhall certainly have, as the appointed time, that which is thereby engaged. And hence,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When a Country overtrades it ſelf, its Medium of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change belongs to its Creditors abroad; and therefore it is a moſt dangerous thing to improve the Lands of any Country to ſupply it with a Medium of Exchange. It is a means never to be uſed but in the laſt Extremity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems very clear, that when a Country whoſe Medium is Bills of Credit, raiſed on their Lands, (as our Province Bills are) has overtraded itſelf; ſo that the Bills are got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Creditors Hands, and cannot be redeemed, then the Lands, which are a Fund to ſupport their Credit, doth of Right belong, and muſt be delivered to thoſe that do poſſeſs the Bills: and when this happens, then the way is fair and plain for the Lands to be reduced into <hi>Lordſhips</hi>; an Effect very much deſired and ſought after by many People.</p>
            <p>And now, who wont be brought into my Concluſſon, and ſay, <hi>That it is indeeed a moſt dangerous thing to improve the Lands of a Country to ſupply it with a Medium of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change? A Means never to be uſed but in the laſt Extremity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſays <hi>Amicus Patriae,</hi> pag. 18. <q>It is whimſical to talk of Merchants overtrading, among the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and skilful; there can be no ſuch thing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What doth he think, when a Country has imported more Goods than it can poſſibly make Returns for, ſo that its Lands are forced to become bound over to the Creditors for Security? Hath not ſuch a Country overtraded itſelf? Or doth the World miſtake about <hi>Terms?</hi> And has he never heard of ſuch an Inſtance as this? Are there no <hi>Wiſe</hi> skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Merchants in the Province that have done ſo?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> But why cannot we in this <hi>Provinoe,</hi> notwithſtanding our low Ebb, emit Bills on ſuch a Foundation as that they may be equal with Money, as <hi>Amicus Patriae</hi> tells us the Bills are at <hi>Venice, Holland,</hi> and <hi>New York,</hi> in all which Places the <hi>Bank Bills</hi> are kept in Credit, as he ſays, pag. 50, 51, only by their being prudently managed by the Merchants; and then all the buſineſs in our Province, which is now almoſt dead, might be carryed on in a very lively manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002283_0012_0FDAE3FD80D91250"/>
               <hi>Gent.</hi> It is a piece of grand Folly or Sophiſtry, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our Bills of Credit to thoſe of <hi>Venice, Holland,</hi> or any other place, where they have a Bank of Gold, Silver, &amp;c. to ſupport the Credit of them, when we have nothing but our real Eſtates to give Credit and Currency to ours.</p>
            <p>As to the Bills of <hi>Venice, Amicus Patriae</hi> hiſelf tells us pag. 42. <q>That when the Bank was erected, there was the ſame Quantity of Money brought into the Treaſury, as there were Bills given out, ſc. <hi>Six Hundred Thouſand Pounds.</hi>
               </q> And hence the <hi>Wiſe</hi> Author ſhows much of his <hi>tranſcendent Logick,</hi> in bringing this to parallel the Caſe of our Province, where we can ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k of nothing but making our Lands a Fund to ſupport the Credit of our Bills.</p>
            <p>There are theſe things conſiderable about the Bank of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There was a Fund of Money brought and lodged in the Treaſury equal to the Notes emitted; and therefore every one that had, a Note, might when he pleaſed have brought it into the Treaſury, and taken out Silver and Gold Money for it.</hi> This might well give them a good Credit and Currency. And if we grant that in proceſs of Time, when the Credit of the Bills was very high, the Bankers took all the Money out of the Treaſury, and made uſe of it at pleaſure, as <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Patriae</hi> ſuggeſts, (tho' I have only his bare Word to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on for the truth of this; however, ſuppoſe it ſo,) yet they are ſtill obliged as firmly as ever, to change any Note than ſhall be brought, and every one knows, that they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to do ſo, but that they can do it with the greateſt Eaſe, if it be required of them; becauſe,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The current Medium of Exchange in Venice is Silver Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which may be procured at any time to exchange for Bank Bills.</hi> (This I have atteſted by an Eye-Witneſs of the Fact.) And hence no body deſires to have them chang'd.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Conſiderations truly valuable, ſufficient to build and maintain the Credit of any Bank whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Again as to the Bank of <hi>Holland,</hi> every one that is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Circumſtances of it, knows, that there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways maſty Heaps of <hi>Silver and Gold</hi> in the Treaſury, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to exchange every Bank Note that ſhall be brought to them at any time. And now, are theſe two Inſtances fairly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to us?</p>
            <p>And for the Bank of <hi>New York,</hi> I have no particular Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, but believe what I commonly hear, that all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who know their Affairs will teſtify, that their Bills are not one Jot better than ours were when of the ſame Age; and if they continue as long as ours have done, by their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, will be no better than ours now are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> However dangerous you ſhow it to be, <hi>for a Country to make uſe of its Lands to ſupply itſelf with a Medium of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002283_0013_0FDAE3F0B6CF9208"/>
Exchange,</hi> yet I perceive you allow that it may be done in a Caſe of Extremity. I think the Caſe of this Province is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream difficult, vaſt N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mbers have their Lands under Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages for Money taken out of the laſt Banks, who cannot get Money to redeem them. The Cry of People in the Country is, How ſhall we pay our Rates if there be no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? And the Merchants conſtantly importune us for a fuller Supply of a <hi>Medium of Trade.</hi> We have not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of <hi>Moveables</hi> ſuitable to put in as a Fund, on which to erect a Bank of Credit; for our Silver Money is gone, and if I may believe Reports ſeemingly well aſcertain'd, our <hi>Plate</hi> is going after, on the ſame melancholly Errand; and all inſufficient too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gent.</hi> It ſeems very reaſonable that a Country in Extremity ſhould make uſe of its Credit to ſupport itſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king its Lands a Fund, on which to emit Bills of Credit. But in ſuch Caſes I think it ſtands them in hand to be very careful,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not to emit too many of them</hi>; for this will ſuddenly depreſs their Credit. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Punctually to call them in at the time appointed,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Poſſeſſor will think himſelf wrong'd; for I know no Difference between theſe <hi>Bills,</hi> and a <hi>Bill</hi> or <hi>Bond</hi> given by a private Perſon. And it ſeems as if the poſtponing of half our Province Tax had a great Hand in cruſhing the Credit of our Bills.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Sir, I think almoſt every one is ready to reflect upon <hi>Amicus Patriae,</hi> for making a great <hi>Buſtle of Words</hi> and bringing forth no Projections for our ſafely emitting more Money, retorting his own proverb, <q>Parturiunt Montes, naſcitur ridiculus Mus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now let me know, which way you think we may moſt ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emit a Quantity of Bills of Credit, for unleſs you do this, you do juſt nothing, for I think there will certainly be ſome made this Seſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gent.</hi> Sir, I will freely give you my mind here, as I have already done in the Premiſes.</p>
            <p>But I will firſt enter a Caveat, <hi>If you emit more Paper Money, you muſt very carefully provide for the ſupport of its Credit.</hi> I know <hi>Amicus Patriae</hi> will laugh at this, and tell us that their Credit may be kept up by the <hi>power of a</hi> Wiſe <hi>Imagination,</hi> pag 44. (Juſt like the Popiſh Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation; Crede quod edes, et edes,</hi> ſay they.) And we may with the ſame reaſon ſay of any other of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, <hi>Believe that they are well, and they are and ſhall be ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let <hi>Amicus Patriae</hi> ſay what he pleaſe about the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſupporting the Credit of our Bills, by willingly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and highly commending them; it is a Truth too plain to be palliated, by Fancy, That the Merchants always raiſe upon
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002283_0014_0FDAE3FEFAAEFEB8"/>
their Goods more in proportion, than other Commodities are raiſed by the plenty or meaneſs of Money. I am credibly eno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> informed, that at the laſt Seſſions of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he General Court, when the Bill had paſſed in the Lower Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe for emitting a Sum of Paper Money, the Merchants immediately raiſed 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon their Goods, and the Shopkeepers had begun, on the ſame foundation to bid high for them. Now for the obtaining this end, the ſupporting of their Credit, I propoſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That you put out but little at a time.</hi> Don't let us have a Glut of it, for that will plainly depretiate it. The contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Charge of this Provi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e is about 10 or 12 Thouſand <hi>l.</hi> a Year, which muſt be made Yearly; and this Year it is about 15 or 16 Thouſand, to which If you add about 15 or 16 Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more, it ſeems to me, that will be enough for the preſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That you be conſtant and ſteady in putting out a ſuitable Quantity.</hi> The making much one Year and little or none ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath and always will hurt the Credit of our Bills, by toſſing the Prizes of every thing, ſo that no one can make a Judgment where to fix, to the great Damage of this Province in all its Affairs. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That you be punctual to call in the Bills at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</hi> I can ſee no difference as I ſaid before, between our Pr. Bills, &amp; the Bills or Bonds of private Men; &amp; if there be none, we may fairly argue, that they ought to be anſwer'd, <hi>i.e.</hi> called in punctually at the time appointed. Having thus finiſhed my Caution, I come now to anſwer your Requeſt, by ſaying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Method</hi> wherein Bills of Credit may be emitted for the greateſt Safety and Service of our Province at this Juncture. And here my thoughts are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not by</hi> any <hi>private Bank</hi>: Unleſs the <hi>Bankers</hi> could bring in Silver or Gold Money for a Fund to ſupport the Credit of their Bills (as I believe all private <hi>Bankers</hi> in the World do.) I fear that that Circumſtance which brings this Province into a <hi>private Bank,</hi> will hedge up our Way with Thorns; for you know, that the Publick is much more merciful to its Members, being Debtors, than private Men are, or can be thought to be to thoſe who are indebted to them: And how grievous is the Cry of Oppreſſion among our people, who have mortgaged their Lands to the publick Banks? Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Not as the two former Banks were emitted.</hi> It is a general Cry that theſe Meaſures do and will too much intangle the prudent, and lay too great a Temptation before thoſe that want Guardians. And further,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Not to be paid in</hi> Lumber, <hi>&amp;c. to the publick.</hi> This would create ſuch a numerous ſet of Officers, as that the Stock muſt go in a great Meaſure to pay Charges. Once more,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Not as was projected in the Houſe of Repreſentatives at their laſt Seſſions,</hi> ſc. That he who took 100 <hi>l.</hi> ſhould pay 10 <hi>l.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002283_0015_0FDAE3F468EB7AA8"/>

               </gap> that I (being on a Journey when the News of it came abroad, and ſeeing with what Spirit people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received it) have reaſon to think that (at leaſt in many places) the longeſt Sword would have determined who ſhould have the Money And now I come in the laſt place to give you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. That the General Court order the making a certain Quantity, at their diſcretion, of Bil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
