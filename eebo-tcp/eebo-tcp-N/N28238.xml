            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>UNHAPPY the nation, deſtined to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo great a calamity! Unhappy our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for ſuch, alas, is its own deſtiny! The characters, drawn by the prophet, if diſtributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many members of a community, conſtitute its glory and defence: but if, what rarely occurs, they are concentrated in ONE MAN, who can eſtimate his importance? By his might, by his military ſkill and bravery, by his prudence, by his age and experience, by the weight of his character, and by his counſels; his influence toward the ſecurity and happineſs of a nation is incalculable. To be deprived, then, of ſuch a man—how great the judgment! how affecting the calamity!</p>
            <p>No event, leſs melancholy than this, could have cauſed the ſolemn ſtillneſs, and the ſorrowful aſpect, of this aſſembly. Yes: <hi>This day is this ſcripture fulfilled in your ears:—for, behold!</hi> in the removal of

WASHINGTON, <hi>the</hi> LORD, <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>of hoſts, doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war—the prudent, and the ancient—the honourable man, and the counſellor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will it be ſuperfluous, on this affecting occaſion, to exhibit the union of all theſe characters in the great and beloved Man, whoſe loſs we are now call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deplore? New information, indeed, cannot be given you concerning him; for not a few of you have perſonally witneſſed his talents and his virtues; and thoſe, whoſe years admit not this teſtimony, have been taught from the cradle to liſp his name, and to revere his character. Nor can the panegyric of the Preacher add aught to his tranſcendent fame. A ſummary review of his character, however, and of the ſervices which he has rendered to his country, is what Gratitude demands; and it may be happily conducive to our moral and religious improvement.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was <hi>the mighty man.</hi> Lofty in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, robuſt and vigorous in conſtitution, he was formed for active enterpriſes, and heroic achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. At the preſent day, indeed, corporeal ſtrength and agility are far leſs material to the warrior, than they were in ancient times, when the battle was fought in perſonal combats, and when the chief wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in uſe were the javelin and the ſpear. They have always, however, their importance; nor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, could the American Hero have been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly energetic for action, or have ſuſtained the complicated cares, and oppreſſive fatigues, of the camp.</p>

               </gap>re, with ſingular capacities for the formation of a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary character, he became, by the aids of art and experience, a warrior of the firſt diſtinction. At the early age of twenty two years, he ſo highly ſignalized himſelf,<note n="*" place="bottom">At Fort du Queſne, in 1754; and at Braddock's defeat, 1755.</note> at a very critical juncture, for his military ſkill and bravery, as to excite great expectations of his future eminence; and it was, even then, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,<note n="†" place="bottom">By the Rev. Mr. <hi>Davies,</hi> then in Virginia, afterwards Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Princeton College.</note> that he was raiſed up to be the Saviour of his country. At length, the important criſis arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the prediction received its accompliſhment. When, in the conteſt with the Parent State, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary to <hi>reſiſt unto blood;</hi> an army of citizen ſoldiers ſpontaneouſly ſprung into exiſtence, and ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the field, in defence of their invaded liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Collected, however, from the various colonies; diverſe in their habits and manners; unaccuſtomed to diſcipline; unſkilled in war; and unſupplied with arms and ammunition; they compoſed a body, which ſeemed to promiſe nothing more propitious than early diſquietude, obſtinate inſubordination, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent deſertion, and ſpeedy diſſolution. At this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and hazardous moment, the eyes of the people were directed to GEORGE WASHINGTON, at Mount Vernon, in the diſtant colony of Virginia. No ſooner did he receive a commiſſion from the American Congreſs, to take the command of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

Though he accepted his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with unaffected diffidence, he commenced its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution with the ſteady zeal of enlightened patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm. Believing the American cauſe to be juſt, he relied on the concurrent ſupport of his fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and committed himſelf to the auſpicious gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and benediction of ALMIGHTY GOD.

Every avenue to danger ſeemed diſcloſed to his piercing eye; and no one of thoſe avenues was left unguarded.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Waſhington's Letters.</note> Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly attentive to ſeize an advantage, or to ward off an evil, he ſeaſonably ſecured every attainable benefit, and cautiouſly guarded againſt the ſurpriſe of his enemy. Though never reluctant, when juſtified by the occaſion, to jeopard his own life and the lives of his brave ſoldiers, on the high places of the field; yet, as became a prudent general, he ſtudiouſly ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unneceſſary danger, and was more anxious for the ſafety of his country, than ambitious for the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of a victory. Like the Roman Fabius, he choſe rather to exhauſt the enemy, by ſtudied delays, than to put the liberties of a whole nation to the hazard of a ſingle battle. In the peculiar ſituation of our infant country, the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of WASHINGTON was <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than weapons of war.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When called to a political ſtation, he diſcovered the ſame prudence in the cabinet, for which he had ſignalized himſelf in the field. Juſtly appreciating thoſe invaluable bleſſings, which had been earned with blood, he watched over them with paternal vigilance,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037641_0010_100F29B88745E870"/>
and adopted the wiſeſt methods to inſure their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity. What ruler could have more prudently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted his authority to prevent the evils of foreign influence, and of domeſtic faction; and to maintain inviolably the Peace and Independence of America?</p>
            <p>Both in the civil and military departments, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived great advantages from age and experience; for he was <hi>the ancient.</hi> Employed for nearly fifty years<note n="*" place="bottom">To the years of public ſervice, mentioned in his Valedictory Addreſs, it is incumbent on us to annex that portion of time, which, in the very evening of his days, he magnanimouſly held pledged to the call of his country. Having been appointed, by the PRESIDENT, "Lieutenant General and Commander in Chief of all the armies raiſed or to be raiſed for the ſervice of the United States;" he accepted the appointment July 13, 1798, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his commiſſion till his death.</note> in public offices; poſſeſſing, at the ſame time, a capacious mind; and habituated to an attentive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of men and things, of cauſes and effects; great were his improvements in uſeful knowledge, and eminent his qualifications for <hi>guiding the affairs</hi> of our infant Republic <hi>with diſcretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was, alſo, <hi>the honourable man.</hi> If the union of diſtinguiſhed perſonal virtues with great military and political talents, and a long ſeries of patriotic ſervices, entitle a man to honour; let honour be affixed to the name of WASHINGTON. Habituated to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of his appetites, he was exemplary for his temperance; and equally habituated to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his paſſions, he ſet a noble example of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity. Accuſtomed to order and method, he did
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037641_0011_100F29BA179AB980"/>
every thing by rule, without the pedantry of exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, by his nice arrangements and preciſion, he found time for the accompliſhment of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting purpoſe, however complex in its nature, however laborious in its execution. He united be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence with juſtice, and piety with morality.—Unlike the impious philoſophiſts of the preſent day, he aimed not to ſeparate the duties which man owes to GOD, from thoſe which he owes to Society. He was not too wiſe, to be above the inſtructions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom; nor too unconſcious of guilt, to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the redemption of the croſs. He received the Holy Scriptures as the oracles of God; and treated with reverence the inſtitutions of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>But who will attempt a complete delineation of his many virtues? Like ſtars, compoſing a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation, they reflected a mild and ſteady radiance, on which the eye delighted to dwell, and from which its ſteadfaſt gaze could not, without regret, be averted.</p>
            <p>Whatever were his virtues, whatever were his tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, they were conſecrated to God, and to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. His patriotiſm was too diſintereſted, to admit impeachment, or ſuſpicion.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is well known, that he refuſed to receive any pecuniary compenſation for his public ſervices.</note> In relinquiſhing his calm and favourite abode, for the tempeſtuous ſea of public life, he uniformly ſacrificed his perſonal eaſe and intereſt, comfort and tranquillity. What more was needful to give him the faireſt claim to the title of <hi>the honourable man?</hi>—Nor were his fellow-citizens
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037641_0012_100F29BD9AF31028"/>
inſenſible to his claims on their gratitude and praiſe. He was THE MAN <hi>whom</hi> they <hi>delighted to honour.</hi>—Greater proofs, than thoſe which they gave, of their juſt eſtimation of his merits and ſervices, could not have been exhibited. The deep and affecting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, taken by all claſſes of citizens in the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly tidings of his death, does infinitely more hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to his name than the ſtoried urn, or the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umental marble.—"Illuſtrious Man! deriving hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our leſs from the ſplendor of his ſituation, than from the dignity of his mind; before whom all borrowed greatneſs ſinks into inſignificance." So ſaid an illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Member of the Britiſh Houſe of Commons,<note n="*" place="bottom">Charles J. Fox.</note> when ſpeaking of our great and beloved WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON. Yes: His praiſes have reſounded through the empire of Britain; they have been echoed through the world.</p>
            <p>It need only be added, that he was <hi>the counſellor.</hi> In critical emergencies, he was often called to aſſiſt his fellow-countrymen with his counſels, as well as by his arms. What reliance was placed on his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appears from the uniform deference paid to it, both in the cabinet and in the field. During the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutionary war, how greatly were the meaſures of the American Congreſs influenced by his ſeaſonable advices! When that war was cloſed, and it became expedient to deviſe a new and improved form of government for the United States; we behold him placed in the preſidential Chair of the National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,<note n="†" place="bottom">In 1787.</note> and eſſentially aiding, by his advice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037641_0013_100F29C05E230EB0"/>
the formation of that admirable Conſtitution, which is the grand palladium of our liberty.</p>
            <p>Here, again, his counſels and authority were deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſſential to the union, to the intereſts and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of America. By the unanimous ſuffrages of the people, he was invited to take a part in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of that government, which he had aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to form; and ſolicited to accept the Preſidency of the United States. With his uſual diffidence he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the important truſt. Twice four years did he continue to act in the Preſidential office.<note n="‡" place="bottom">He was elected Preſident in 1789; re-elected in 1793; and left the Preſidency in 1797.</note> How much, in that intereſting period, he contributed, by his judicious and enlightened Adminiſtration, to the peace, to the proſperity, to the glory, of our Nation, the public Records will ſhew, and a grateful People will carefully tranſmit to generations yet unborn.</p>
            <p>While his fellow-citizens could perceive no dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of his corporeal or mental energies, the "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing weight of years admoniſhing him to retire," and his love of rural and domeſtic retirement, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the contraſted cares of public life, alluring him back to the ſhades of Mount Vernon; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be conſidered as a candidate for the future ſuffrages of his countrymen. But he reſigns not his charge, before he has given the American People his laſt and beſt advice. Here <hi>the Counſellor</hi> appears in his greateſt glory. The <hi>Addreſs,</hi> which he delivered on this occaſion, contains the reſult of much obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037641_0014_100F29C1EC74B8D8"/>
and deep experience; and admirably points out the true intereſts of United America. It is the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of a father to his children, while deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with an apprehenſion of their dangers; and tenderly ſolicitous to guide them to ſecurity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>America was loud in the applauſes of his Adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration. His own remarks, on a retroſpective view of it, are worthy of a mind ſuperior to the inflations of vanity; and they furniſh a model of humility and philanthropy, which it would be the glory of kings to reſemble: "Though in reviewing the incidents of my adminiſtration I am unconſcious of intentional error; I am, nevertheleſs, too ſenſible of my defects, not to think it probable, that I have committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I ſhall alſo carry with me the hope that my country will never ceaſe to view them with indulgence; and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its ſervice, with an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be conſigned to oblivion, as myſelf muſt ſoon be to the manſions of reſt."</p>
            <p>Words, alas, too prophetic! To thoſe manſions, revered and beloved Man! art thou already conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>For, behold! the Lord, the Lord of hoſts, doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war—the prudent, and the ancient—the honourable man, and the counſellor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

WASHINGTON is no more!<note n="*" place="bottom">On Friday night, December 13, he was ſeized with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory ſore throat, <hi>[Cynache Trachealis]</hi> which terminated his life at half after eleven on Saturday night, after an illneſs of about twenty-four hours. He retained, to the laſt, a full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his reaſon, and expreſſed an entire reſignation to the event, which, from the very commencement of the diſorder, he fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. "He cloſed his mouth and eyes with his own hands, and expired without a ſigh or a groan." "During the ſhort period of his illneſs, he economized his time in the arrangement of ſuch few concerns, as required his attention, with the utmoſt ſerenity; and anticipated his approaching diſſolution with every demonſtration of that equanimity, for which his whole life was uniformly and ſingularly conſpicuous."—He was born in Weſt-moreland county, in Virginia, February 22, 1732, and died De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 14, 1799, AEtat. LXVIII.</note> We are reminded, by the prophet, of the divine AGENT, by whom his removal is effected. It is JEHOVAH. <hi>The great, the mighty GOD, the Lord of hoſts is his name. He doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doſt thou. He changeth the countenance of the</hi> MAN GREATLY BELOVED, <hi>and ſendeth him away.</hi> Strength and agility, military ſkill and fortitude, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and penetration, avail him nothing. <hi>There is no wiſdom, nor underſtanding, nor counſel, againſt the</hi> LORD. To his control the moſt potent and formidable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of armies are equally ſubjected with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoldiery under their command. His orders are abſolute, and muſt be inſtantly and univerſally obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for <hi>there is no diſcharge in that war.—What man is he that liveth</hi>—whatever are his talents and his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, however he is endeared to Society, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

ever important his life and ſervices to the world—<hi>what man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death? ſhall he deliver his ſoul from the hand of the grave?</hi> No: let no man expect it; for WASHINGTON is dead.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON is dead! Here, then, let us unite in paying that tribute to his memory, which his eminent talents, virtues, and ſervices, demand. <hi>Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man ſallen, this day, in Iſrael?</hi> Yes: Theſe ſable hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that awful ſilence, thoſe tributary tears, teſtify that ye know too well the ſad event, which has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed our nation with unutterable ſorrows. Well may ye, who have witneſſed the military ſkill, the patriotiſm, and the many virtues, of WASHINGTON, during his reſidence in this very place, unite, this day, to lament his fall. Well may ye, who once worſhipped with him in this houſe of prayer, pour forth your tears at the recollection of that exemplary piety, which ſhone conſpicuouſly amidſt the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of war, and the vices of the camp. Well may this Temple, which has often witneſſed the ſincerity and the ſolemnity of his devotions, appear clothed in ſackcloth. What object around us can forbear to aſſume a ſober ſadneſs, and to participate in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal gloom? Ye circumjacent hills, that witneſſed the mighty operations of this great Commander, whoſe ſummits ſtill ſhew the veſtiges of war, and whoſe ſoil has been wet with the blood of our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens! <hi>let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you.</hi>

Where, now, are thoſe veteran Generals, who, on yonder heights, accompanied <hi>the man of war,</hi> and aided him in the glorious conteſt? Come, mingle your tears with our's. Alas!

            </p>
            <p>But let not the deluge of our grief obliterate our gratitude to GOD, for raiſing up ſuch a Man to be the Saviour of his country. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>of hoſts,</hi> who
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037641_0018_100F29CAE894FE08"/>
hath now taken him away, originally formed him for the high purpoſe of our national ſalvation. He endowed him with thoſe great talents, which quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him to command in our armies, and to preſide in our councils, with ſuch wiſdom and ſkill, and with ſuch admirable ſucceſs. <hi>The inſpiration of the Almighty gave him underſtanding. The</hi> LORD <hi>of hoſts</hi> himſelf <hi>taught his hands to war, and his fingers to fight. If it had not been the</hi> LORD <hi>who was on our ſide,</hi> vain had been his wiſdom, and impotent his ſtrength, <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>of hoſts was with him;</hi> therefore he was <hi>valiant in fight,</hi> prudent in council, and ſucceſsful in the defence of our liberties. With our tears, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let us intermingle our grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Almighty GOD, for ſo rich and invaluable a bleſſing.

            <p>Humble, however, it becomes us to be, under the chaſtiſement of Heaven. <hi>The ſtay and the ſtaff,</hi> the pride and the glory, of our Nation are removed.—<hi>My father! my father! the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof!</hi> In the death of One, whoſe life was ſo intereſting to America, and to the world, and whoſe fame reſounded through both hemiſpheres, we ſee the inſignificancy of human power, and the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of earthly greatneſs. <hi>The Lord of hoſts hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

For, behold! the Lord, the Lord of hoſts doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war—the prudent, and the ancient—the honourable man, and the counſellor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Transferring, then, our confidence from mortal man to the living GOD, who is <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and forever,</hi> let us ſeek from Him that aid, which He only can furniſh; and that ſolace, which He only can beſtow.
