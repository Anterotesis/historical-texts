            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>TO A Medical Society in</hi> Boſton.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Piece of Medical Hiſtory does natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally addreſs it ſelf to you, conſidering that I have the pleaſure of being one of your number, that you have been fellow labourers in the management of this diſtemper, and therefore competent judges of this performance, and that where difficult or extraordinary Caſes have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in any of your private practice, I was favoured to viſit the Patients in order to make a minute clinical enquiry: in ſhort, without your aſſiſtance this piece would have been leſs perfect, and not ſo well vouched.</p>
            <p>As this diſtemper continues to ſpread and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in ſeveral Towns of this and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provinces, I thought it might prove a piece of humanity and benevolence, if after many months diligent obſervations made in moſt of the varieties which occur in this Illneſs, I did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reduce them to ſome eaſy diſtinct Hiſtorical and Practical Method. The vanity of appearing as an Author or writer was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, becauſe we all know that in a planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion life neither honour nor credit are to be acquired by writing. It is not publiſhed by way
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004012_0004_10036506CF03EAF8"/>of a Quack bill to procure Patients and their money, as has been the practice of ſome void of modeſty and truth; becauſe the Diſtemper is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt over in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and while it prevailed here I could not well have attended more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents than what I had from time to time under my care, and make with attention the proper obſervations at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>A ſecondary reaſon for my writing is, to induce ſome Gentlemen of the profeſſion in our other Provinces and Colonies, where this diſtemper does or may prevail; to give ſome account of its appearance with them, in order to diſcover what influence, progreſs of time, varieties of climate and Soil may have in the phoenomina of this diſeaſe. This method, of taking things originally that is from the life, if purſued (but by abler hands) in the Epidemical Diſtempers which may from time to time happen amongſt us, may be of conſiderable advantage in Phyſick.</p>
            <p>A Speculation that is a novelle might have been compoſed ſooner, but not a real Hiſtory: for as amongſt Naturaliſts, many repeated obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and experiments are requiſite to form eſtabliſhed truths or concluſions; ſo it ought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be in the practice of Medicine, where no affair of Speculation or curioſity, but the life and death of a fellow Citizen is the object of our enquiry.</p>

            <head>The Practical Hiſtory of a new Epidemical <hi>Miliary Fever</hi> with an <hi>Angina <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcuſculoſa.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THIS Diſtemper did emerge 20th. <hi>May,</hi> 1735. in <hi>Kingſton</hi> Townſhip 50 Miles Eaſtward from <hi>Boſton;</hi> it was no foreign importation, <hi>Kingſton</hi> being an inland place, of no Trade or conſiderable communication. The firſt ſeized was a <hi>child who died in three Days Illneſs;</hi> about a Week thereafter in another Family at four Miles diſtance, three Children were ſeized ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and died alſo the third Day; it continues ſpreading gradually in that Townſhip, ſeizing here and there particular Families with that degree of violence, that <hi>of the firſt circiter forty decumbents none recovered</hi> as we were informed. It was vulgarly called the <hi>Throat Illneſs,</hi> or <hi>a Plague in the Throat,</hi> and alarmed the Provinces of <hi>New-England</hi> very much. Some died of a ſudden or acute <hi>Necroſis;</hi> but moſt of them by a <hi>Symptomatick affiction of the Fauces or Neck;</hi> that is by <hi>Sphacelations</hi> or corroſive <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcerations</hi> in the <hi>Fauces,</hi> or by <hi>an infiltration and tumefaction</hi> in the Chops and fore part of the Neck, ſo turged, as to bring all upon a level between the <hi>chin</hi> and <hi>ſternum,</hi> occaſioning a <hi>ſtrangulation</hi> of the Patient in a very ſhort time.</p>
            <p>After a few Weeks it ſpreads into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Townſhips, but with more mildneſs. The
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004012_0006_1003650D80396F20"/>firſt <hi>appearance</hi> that we can recollect of it in <hi>Boſton,</hi> was 20th <hi>Auguſt</hi> on a Child of Capt. <hi>Stannys</hi> at the North End; having <hi>white ſpecks</hi> in the Throat, and a <hi>cutaneous effloreſcence:</hi> A few more in the ſame Neighbourhood were ſeized in like manner, about the ſame time. Towards the end of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> it appeared in ſeveral parts of the Town, with a complaint of <hi>ſoreneſs in the Throat, Tonſils, ſwelled and ſpeckt, Uvula relaxed, ſlight Fever, fluſh in the Face, and an Eryſipelas like effloreſcence on the neck, cheſt and extremities;</hi> but being of no fatal or bad conſequence, nothing more than a common cold was ſuſpected. Our firſt alarm was from a young Man <hi>How</hi> Aet. 20. in the beginning of <hi>October:</hi> His <hi>Hiſtory</hi> runs thus; He was lately arrived from <hi>Exeter</hi> to the Eaſtward, where his Brother died of this Illneſs; his <hi>Symptoms</hi> were great proſtration of Strength, a ſpeck in one of the <hi>Tonſils,</hi> colliquative <hi>Sweats, Pulſe</hi> not high and full, but low, hard, ſtringy, unequal and more frequent than natural, <hi>deglutition</hi> good to the laſt, no <hi>Sphacelation</hi> in the Throat, no eruption; from a raſh inconſiderate opinion of forcibly quelling the <hi>Malignity,</hi> he was thrice let Blood, had ſome Emeticks and Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks adminſtred, and <hi>by profuſe evacuations was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually reduced, ſo as to die of a gentle decay of natural Strength,</hi> the 6th Day of Illneſs.</p>
            <p>Beginning of <hi>November</hi> it ſpread conſiderably in <hi>Boſton,</hi> eſpecially amongſt <hi>Children,</hi> with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Symptoms, and ſeverals die of it in various Periods: it ſeemed to be at the hight, as to Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ailing and quantity of Deaths, the ſecond Week of <hi>March;</hi> that Week there were 24 Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, whereas <hi>communibus annis</hi> in that Seaſon they are only 9 or 10 <hi>per</hi> Week.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004012_0007_100386AA58729B20"/>
It is generally in ſo conſiderable a Degree <hi>more favourable in Boſton,</hi> than in the Townſhips where it firſt prevailed; that many can ſcarce be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of its being the ſame Diſtemper: It is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs eſſentially the ſame, there is no Symptom, even the moſt malignant that has appeared in <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> but what the like has occured in <hi>Boſton.</hi> Perhaps <hi>Boſton</hi> dry healthy air, good feeding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions leſs <hi>Pſorick,</hi> and the better management of the Sick, favoured us; the reaſons for its proving more mortal in the other Towns, may be, the Country woodland and freſh water damps, (the <hi>Sheep</hi> in fenny lands are moſt ſuſceptible of and ſuffer moſt by the <hi>Rot)</hi> their coarſe Food, ſalt Pork diet, <hi>Pſorick</hi> Conſtitutions, (which is one of the principal <hi>Endemial diſtemperatures in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> bad Lodgings, and that <hi>miſchievous Practice</hi> of uſing this Diſtemper with profuſe evacuations, whereby the laudable and ſalutary <hi>cuticular</hi> erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been ſo perverted as to be noticeable only in a few, and in theſe it was called a <hi>Scarlet Fever;</hi> the great proſtration of Strength eſſential to this Diſtemper is ſo much increaſed, as to render <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> an under match for the aſſaults of this Illneſs and its conſequences. In fact to the Eaſtward in ſome Country Towns, at certain times have died 1 in 3 of the Sick, in others 1 in 4, in ſcarce any fewer than 1 in 6, whereas in <hi>Boſton</hi> not above 1 in 35 have died.</p>
            <p>As in moſt <hi>Epidemical</hi> acute Illneſſes, eſpecially <hi>eruptive Fevers,</hi> (witneſs the <hi>Small Pox</hi>) ſo in this, are very many varities or degrees, from the moſt gentle and <hi>benign</hi> to the moſt <hi>malignant. Symptoms</hi> did vary chiefly from ſomething inſcrutable in the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of Families and Perſons; the <hi>Scropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Pſorick</hi> were the moſt ſuſceptible of it, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004012_0008_10036515645836E8"/>did ſuffer moſt by it; the <hi>Regimen</hi> had a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable influence, here ſome who might have ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>natural Symptoms</hi> did ſuccumb by profuſe U. S. and other evacuations, one of the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Symptoms of this Diſtemper (as before hinted) being <hi>great proſtration of Strength.</hi> In ſo great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety it is not poſſible to give any conciſe <hi>ſcholaſtick</hi> deſcription, which may comprehend all: We ſhall therefore, as a <hi>Standard</hi> firſt deſcribe the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſort, as it appeared in good conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>A previous <hi>liſtleſneſs</hi> and languiſhing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for a Day or two, or ſome other <hi>praenuncia</hi> as u. g. wet Nurſes looſing their Milk. The firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack is ſomewhat of a <hi>chill</hi> or ſhivering; ſoon after follows <hi>Head ake</hi> or ſome other verſatile <hi>ſpaſmodick pains,</hi> as pain in the back, joints, ſide, <hi/> a vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or <hi>nauſea,</hi> or in ſome conſtitutions which are not eaſily provoked to vomit, only a certain unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs or ſickneſs at Stomach; at the ſame time the <hi>Vvula</hi> but chiefly the <hi>Tonſils</hi> were tumified, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eded and painful, with ſome white <hi>ſpecks;</hi> then follows a fluſh in the Face and ſome <hi>miliary erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> there, with a benign <hi>mild Fever,</hi> the ſame eſfloreſcence ſoon after appears on the neck, cheſt and extremities; the 3d or 4th Day, Eruption is at the hight and well defined with fair intervals; the fluſhing goes off gradually, with a general <hi>itching;</hi> and in a Day or two more the <hi>cuticle</hi> ſcales or peels off, eſpecially in the extremities: At the ſame time the cream coloured ſloughs or ſpecks in the <hi>Fauces</hi> become looſe and caſt off, and tumefactions there do ſubſide. The Tongue from the beginning is fur'd as in a <hi>Mercurial ptyaliſm,</hi> urine high coloured, Blood by U. S. more <hi>florid</hi> than natural, in the whole courſe of the Diſtemper a very <hi>great proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004012_0009_100386AFCCC79370"/>of Strength,</hi> and faintneſs upon recovery, <hi>nervos pains</hi> and weakneſs in the joints, particularly in the neck, wriſts and ancles; univerſal tenderneſs to the touch; a tickling guttural cough, ſome ſhort <hi>Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick fluſhings,</hi> and loſs of <hi>enbon point.</hi> As in the Meaſles there is a peculiar ſmell, ſo in our Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the <hi>effluvia</hi> from the Patient have a proper ſmell; in Children as if troubled with <hi>Worms,</hi> in grown Perſons the <hi>rancid ſmell</hi> of foul Bed Linnen. The <hi>alvine excrement</hi> is of a dark caſt and very fetid.</p>
            <p>This Standard kind when left to nature, with a warm ſoft <hi>Regimen,</hi> had generally an eaſy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary courſe in ſix or ſeven Days; but when by a hot cordial method, or on the other extreme, by being too much expoſed to the cold, or by officious <hi>profuſe evacuations</hi> Nature was difturbed in her Work; the Diſtemper was protracted, or ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential ails from an imperfect defecation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n|ſued.</p>
            <p>Where Nature required any aſſiſtance, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>intentions</hi> were with regard to the cuticular eruption and the <hi>ulcuſcula</hi> in the Throat. Any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Throat does frequently produce a natural <hi>ptyaliſm: Mercurials</hi> uſed with diſcretion are a kind of ſpecifick in ſuch like ulcers &amp; <hi>ulcuſcula,</hi> and in fact here they moiſtned the Throat and Mouth, ſtopt the ſpreading of the <hi>ulcuſcula,</hi> and promoted the caſting off of the ſloughs; and as an acceſſory advantage (the Patients being moſtly Children) <hi>deſtroy'd Worms:</hi> amongſt all its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations <hi>Calomel</hi> anſwered beſt, the gentle vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or few ſtools that it occaſioned in ſome, did not confound the natural courſe of the Diſtemper: <hi>Turbith</hi> proves generally too ſtrong a revulſion, and the Eruption is thereby too much diverted; this
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004012_0010_1003643AD7F8F298"/>Diſtemper did not well bear any other evacuations but <hi>Mercurials.</hi> Any detergent <hi>Gargle,</hi> with an addition of the <hi>Tincture of Myrrh and Aloes,</hi> was of good uſe, eſpecially for the <hi>Vlcuſcula,</hi> and did promote the diſcharge of a ropy Phlegm lodged in the <hi>Fauces.</hi> As to the <hi>cuticular effloreſcence,</hi> it was not a ſcarlet <hi>ſuffuſion,</hi> but a <hi>miliary</hi> palpable erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in lieu thereof in ſome conſtitutions a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued gentle breathing <hi>Sweat;</hi> and in a very few, who have naturally a <hi>liberior tranſit us</hi> by the <hi>Pores</hi> than is uſual, no ſenſible cuticular excretion; in all the morbid <hi>effluvia</hi> diſcovered themſelves by their peculiar ſmell: Theſe were with good effect ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by <hi>Snake-root Tea;</hi> or (as in ſome Perſons) where this did occaſion an <hi>ardor</hi> or burning heat, inſtead of a breathing mellow Sweat, <hi>Sp. C. C.</hi> or any other volatile Spirit in ſmall Herb Teas an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered well. <hi>Bliſters</hi> and <hi>Suppedanea,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning where Symptoms were not violent, occaſioned a protracted Eruption; in ſome immediately upon their application, the Eruptions vaniſhed or became leſs vivid. When the Eruption began to decline a few <hi>looſe Stools</hi> were very refreſhing. The Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent being up, and having recovered a competent degree of Strength, is <hi>to be purged</hi> once or twice, to carry off any feculency that may have remained in the Blood and Juices.</p>
            <p>For a more diſtinct conception of the <hi>varities in this Diſtemper,</hi> they may be reduced to three <hi>Claſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Thoſe who die the firſt, ſecond and third day of Illneſs, by an irremediable <hi>Necroſis of the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy:</hi> in ſuch the Seizure is generally ſudden, a ſinking pain at the Stomach, an extreme proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Strength, a titubating low pulſe, in ſome a ſtupor, in others a delirium, in ſome children
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004012_0011_100364985EB5FBF8"/>convulſions, and all of them generally die dozie: they are attended with ſome <hi>colliquation,</hi> as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued vomiting, purging, profuſe Sweats, bloated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the habit, an infiltration like that of the <hi>Mumps</hi> vulgarly ſo called, one or more of theſe: in general the texture of their blood and juices is much deſtroy'd and rendred an incoherent puddle of corruption; in fact immediately upon (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before) their <hi>exit,</hi> they have an intolerable <hi>faetor.</hi> In this Claſs U. S. and other evacuations did accelerate death.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thoſe where the diſtemper has its common or ordinary courſe; here the 6 or 7 day ſeems to be <hi>critical,</hi> and the Symptoms of death or recovery do generally then begin to manifeſt themſelves. Some by peculiarity of conſtitution, and from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper adminiſtrations do die or have an incipicent recovery ſooner: others for the like reaſons or ſome particular accidents (u. g. if about the time of regular <hi>monſtruation,</hi> the complicated fret occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons worſe Symtoms, and of longer continuance) have this period protracted and in ſuch (where death is inevitable) the Symptoms of death may continue a day or two longer, that is the Patient may die the eighth or ninth day. All who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Ill after that period, belong to the third Claſs, that is of conſequential ails.</p>
            <p>The Symtoms of <hi>bad Omen</hi> in this Claſs, are very great proſtration of ſtrength, dejection and deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of mind, titubating low pulſe, inceſſant vomitings purgings or ſweats, Tonſils much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed endangering ſtrangulation, the ſpecks in the <hi>Fauces</hi> of a browniſh or leaden colour, or ragged and jagged, a continued <hi>jactantia</hi> in ſome, in others <hi>a ſtupor,</hi> refuſal of <hi>aſſumenda</hi> even of diluting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004012_0012_100363E919F8D978"/>drinks, a dry parched skin, Eruptions appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſappearing alternately, Eruption univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of a dark rediſh caſt continuing <hi>crude</hi> many days (becauſe in this as in all eruptive Fevers, the darker or more livid the effloreſcence, the more malignant) where the <hi>miliary</hi> puſtles are large, diſtinct and pale like a <hi>chryſtaline Small-Pox;</hi> where ſtrong Cordials and <hi>Alexipharmicks</hi> have been uſed, the face, eye-lids, arms, hands, legs, feet ſwell, and are of a dark red complexion, as in the moſt malignant Small-Pox; in children if the <hi>velum Palati</hi> be much affected, with an <hi>ichorous</hi> diſcharge by the Noſe; where many <hi>mucous</hi> linings are expectorated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the cuticle raiſed by Veſications; when <hi>pus</hi> was brought up, where no ſloughs or exulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could be ſeen in the <hi>Pauces;</hi> where without any difficulty in ſwallowing, this affection has reached down the <hi>Bronchia</hi> unto the Lungs with the Symptoms of a <hi>New-England Quinſey,</hi> and was erroniouſly deemed ſuch: the deeper in the <hi>Thorax</hi> the complaint the greater the danger: in ſome young children with ſcarce any appearance in the Throat, ſpreading Ulcers did form behind the Ears in the place where Infants have a natural Iſſue or running. In ſome the Tongue did throw off a ſlough or <hi>Exuvia,</hi> retaining the impreſſions of the Papillae; being a <hi>Mucus</hi> inſpiſſated, and of the ſame nature with thoſe mucous linings expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>Bronchia</hi> or <hi>Oeſophagus.</hi> Some have had impoſtumations in the <hi>Fauces,</hi> with a fatal ſtrangulation, while others have eſcaped by the diſcharge of <hi>Ichorous</hi> curdly matter. Some eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the adult female kind, have had <hi>Hyſterical</hi> or Nervous Suffocations; but of no bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, unleſs officiouſly and ignorantly treated with U.

The Fever is ſeldom too high, ſometimes it is too low for a thorough laudable Eruption. If the Fever is too high, if the patient is plethorick or accuſtomed to U. S.; take away ſome Blood but with diſcretion; if the <hi>Tonſils</hi> are much inflamed with great pain and difficulty in ſwallowing, uſe U. S. in the <hi>Jugulars,</hi> Epiſpafticks ad <hi>Nucham,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Eruption, or its <hi>ſuccedaneum</hi> a breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſweat; a profuſe <hi>ſudor</hi> is equally to be avoided as a continued <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> either of them confound the diſtemper in its natural courſe. In caſe of colliquations give <hi>ol. Cinamomi, decoct. Alb. Elixir Vitriol, torrified Rhubarb</hi> and the like. As to the ſpecks or ſloughs in the <hi>Fauces</hi> (they caſt of in courſe in the benign kind) <hi>Mercurials</hi> inwardly, and the <hi>Gargles</hi> before mentioned topically, are uſeful; the practice in ſome Country places of ſeparating them forcibly by <hi>ſpatulas</hi> is hurtful, becauſe the irritation occaſioned thereby induces a further flux upon the part, and the ſloughs form again worſe conditioned than before. Where the Brain is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected as in <hi>Vigiliae, jactantia, delirium, Coma, ſtupor,</hi>  glyſters, Veſicatories &amp; <hi>ſuppedanea</hi> are to be uſed. Where faintneſs or great proſtration of ſtrength, give toaſted Bread ſoaked in ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Wine and Water, or volatile Spirits in their common drinks; <hi>Bezoars, Teſtacea</hi> and the like are of no uſe, the Shop <hi>Cordial Juleps</hi> and mixtures are only ſugar'd drams. To enumerate all the other accidental Symptoms which do happen here, in common with other acute diſeaſes, would be trifling.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Conſequential ails,</hi> which may be enumerated as in the following articles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The natural Effects of an intenſe corroſive ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004012_0014_100364BB811870F8"/>like colliquation of the Blood and Juices. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarcous</hi> ſwelling or blotedneſs of the face, in ſome to that degree as to ſhut up the Eyes; the ſame <hi>Oedemetous</hi> ſwellings in the extremities, in a few an Infiltration in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> in ſome <hi>Petechiae,</hi> Purple ſpots, ſcorbutick like <hi>ſugillations</hi> upon the leaft ſcratch or bruiſe; <hi>hamorrhages</hi> of all ſorts, by the Noſe, from the Lungs in expectoration, by Stool, by Urine, <hi>Profluniums</hi> in Women <hi>tempore non debito;</hi> theſe are diſmal <hi>phanomina</hi> in the ſtate of any acute Fever, u. g. <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and ſcarce any recover; but in our diſtemper being only ſhort tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary conſequential ails, ſcarce any of them prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mortal, but gave way to a ſoft milk diet, in ſome to <hi>Cortex Peruw.</hi> or <hi>Elixir Vitrioli</hi> in others; a Girle aet. 14. with haemorrhages of ſeveral ſorts, with Purple ſpots, and ſcorbutick like ſugillations, recovered, notwithſtanding of a very looſe <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> N. B. Theſe were not to be attributed to the <hi>Mercurial</hi> adminiſtrations, becauſe they equally happened to thoſe who had taken no Mercury.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Where the deſecation has not been compleat,</hi> from want of natural ſtrength, or from catching cold, or from undue evacuations: the <hi>reliquiae</hi> were thrown off by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rtications,</hi> by <hi>Veſications</hi> in ſeveral parts of the Body, by <hi>ſerpiginous</hi> eruptions chiefly in the face, by purulent <hi>Puſtules,</hi> by Boils, by ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and <hi>impoſtumations</hi> in the groin, armpits and other parts of the Body. The moſt frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential ail of this kind is, when from cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the <hi>glands</hi> and cellulary tegument called the <hi>panicula adipoſa</hi> in the fore part of the neck becomes infiltrated and obſtructed; if not ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by the continued fotus of warm woollens and hot animating applications; the induration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004012_0015_100386C59605B200"/>and ſpreads every way, ſo as to ſuffocate ſome, in others they ſphacelate and become Ulcers mortal or of difficult cure: thus a few have died with us in <hi>Boſton,</hi> but many in the Country. By catching cold likeways the <hi>Tonſils</hi> have afterwards inflamed and come to ſuppuration: In a young Woman the <hi>Tonſils</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula</hi> being much ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did unite and coaleſce into one maſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo; this might have been prevented by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent gargling.</p>
            <p>While theſe indurations are only in the form of <hi>Kernels</hi> as they are vulgarly called, woollen mufflers, <hi>Empl. de Ranis cum Mercurio</hi> and the like, with gentle <hi>Catharticks,</hi> ſoon reſolves them. <hi>Cataplaſms</hi> in this caſe have done much miſchief; becauſe ſo ſoon as they are become cold, they act as a chilling damp upon the part, and deſtroy its vitality. When they arrive to the ſtate of putrid flaccid Ulcerations, digeſtives and ſoft fomentations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenerate tenerate the part and occaſion the Ulcer to ſpread; ſpirituous animating deſiccative dreſſings have done better. Expoſing the part to the cold, either in ſtate of Tumefaction only, or in the ſubſequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerations aggravates the ail.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>From the violence which the Nerves have ſuffered in this Illneſs;</hi> even where the Symptoms were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently mild, they all complain of great faintneſs and Univerſal weakneſs, particularly in the joints-Some Women have Hyfterick affections, in a few upon recovery imbecility of mind or ſillineſs, in ſome ſtammering or loſs of Speech for a few days, ſome have had ſhort fits of Melancholy, ſome were ſeized with Epileptick fits, but not ſo as to become habitual. All theſe diſorders ſoon vaniſhed, as the Patient recovered his Strength in courſe of time,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004012_0016_1003644C52E91C38"/>and by the help of a reſtorative cordial <hi>Regimen</hi> and diet.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Other conſequential ails in common with other fevers;</hi> particularly where the Strength of nature has been much impared by the diſtemper it ſelf, or by immoderate evacuations, the Patient is left in a languiſhing weakneſs. Where the Eruption has been impeded by being expoſed to the cold, or by unſeaſonable <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> S.</hi> or <hi>Catharticks;</hi> the patient falls into <hi>Hectical waſtings,</hi> fatal to ſome in a very ſhort time. All who underwent immoderate evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were a long time in recovering of their Strength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SCHOLIA or ſome general remarks upon the whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This ſeems to be a new kind of Epidemical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe.</hi> It is not the ſame with the <hi>Aphthae</hi> which have at times prevailed in <hi>Holland,</hi> as deſcribed by <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> and mentioned by <hi>Boerhaave</hi> in his Colleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. <hi>Tournefort</hi> ſays there is a diſtemper not uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the <hi>Levant, viz</hi> a Carbuncle or plague ſore in the bottom of the Throat; it carries off chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in a few days, but does not affect grown People as does ours. Capt. <hi>Morton</hi> of late <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Colony, who wrote many years ago his <hi>New. England Memorial,</hi> ſays that an. 1650. a diſeaſe in the Mouth and Throat prevailed, which proved mortal to many in a ſhort time; but he does not deſcribe it, and mentions nothing of a Fever. In <hi>Boſton November</hi> 1719. a ſlight milary fever chiefly with children, but was over in two or three days, unleſs by catching cold it continued appearing and diſappearing alternately for ſome days longer; there was no complaint of the Throat, and no deaths enſued. It is not the ſame with the ſore Throats which are obſerved from
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004012_0017_100386CCDDF24A50"/>time to time in ſome of our Country Towns, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Winter ſeaſon: theſe are Endemial and conſtitutional, being tumefactious and exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratious with fluxion in the <hi>Fauces</hi> and Neck; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an intenſe ſcropholous, ſcorbutick, or <hi>Pſorick</hi> habit (in ſuch ſubjects veſications by <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides</hi> did putrifie) without any Eruptive fever: ours have generally an Eruptive fever or tendency that way, ſo that of thoſe who have died in <hi>Boſton,</hi> not above one in ſeven died of any Throat ail, but of this fever. It is however obſervable that the Serophulous and Pſorick, are moſt ſuſceptible of this diſtemper, and ſuffer more remarkably.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Epidemical diſtemper is no creature of the Seaſons,</hi> it having prevailed from <hi>May</hi> 1735. when it firſt emerged, the whole year or all the Seaſons round. <hi>It is no produce of peculiar climates and ſoils,</hi> becauſe it hath made its appearance in various places from <hi>Pemaquid</hi> in 44 N. Lat. to <hi>Carolina</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and as we are lately informed, it is in our <hi>Weſt India Iſlands.</hi> It is remarkable that in damp places, as near large Ponds, freſh water Rivers, woodlands, and the like, it has done the greateſt execution, as does the <hi>Rot</hi> amongſt <hi>Sheep</hi> in fenny Lands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not perſonally infecting after the rate of the Plague, Small Pox,</hi> &amp;c. where every Perſon is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, excepting a very few <hi>anomolous</hi> conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Children are the moſt obnoxious to any infection; but with us ſeveral Children in the family, where the diſtemper appeared, have eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: it is true where it happens in a family, it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeizeth ſeverals, as is the caſe with our Country <hi>Peripneumonick Fevers,</hi> and our Autumnal remitting ſlow Fevers, which cannot be ſaid to be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004012_0018_100386D1C9EC15B8"/>contagious. The diſtance in time of Infection to be ſuppoſed received from a ſick Perſon, to the time of the diſtemper's appearing in the ſuppoſed infected, could never, with any reaſonable allowance of latitude, be reduced to any rule, as in Small-Pox, Meaſles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have <hi>Anatomically</hi> inſpected Perſons who died of it with ſo intenſe a <hi>faetor</hi> from the violence of the diſeaſe, that ſome Practioners could not continue in the room; but without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infected our ſelves or carrying it into families. Many children without reſerve, frequent the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and chambers of the ſick, and eſcape. <hi>It does therefore proceed from ſome undiſcovered quality of the air, affecting only peculiar conſtitutions of perſons and families:</hi> notwithſtanding of its being generally favourable, it proves fatal to certain families; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny families for this reaſon have buried all or moſt of their children, u. g. <hi>Boynton</hi> of <hi>Newbury-Falls</hi> loſt his eight children, at <hi>Hampton-Falls</hi> in 5 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies died 27 Perſons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This is a very anomalous Illneſs,</hi> ſome complain a day or two before they are confined, ſome are ſeized as it were inſtantaneouſly, it is generally moſt ſevere with theſe laſt. In ſome a ſoreneſs of the Throat and darting pain there, reaching the Ears, is previous to all other Symptoms; in others the common Symptoms of a fever appear, before any inflamation or ſpecks are perceivable in the <hi>Fauces.</hi> Some have a ſore Throat without any perceivable cruption, only a gentle breathing continued Sweat, or an increaſed inſenſible perſpiration with the peculiar ſmell of the morbid <hi>effluvia.</hi> Some (but very few) have the cuticular eruptions without any ſloughs in the Throat; only the <hi>Tonſils, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula, and velum Palati,</hi> tumified and inflamed; and in a few,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004012_0019_100364A818E52370"/>
               <hi>a purulent</hi> diſcharge from ſome parts deeper than the <hi>Fauces,</hi> that is lower than the ſight can reach, theſe are not without danger. Many of thoſe who died early of a <hi>Necroſis,</hi> had no tumefaction, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or ſpecks in the Throat.</p>
            <p>The time of Eruption is very uncertain; in a very few it preceeds the ſoreneſs of the Throat, in a few it goes <hi>pari paſſu</hi> with the affection of the <hi>Fauces;</hi> but generally it is (not much) later than the firſt complaints of the Throat, in a young Woman it was later by 14 days.</p>
            <p>In ruddy complexions the effloreſcence is very diſcernable; it is not ſo diſtinctly perceivable in Brunets, Indians, and Negroes; unleſs the miliary Eruption have a conſiderable <hi>Relievo</hi> as in ſome, they generally ſcale and peal notwithſtanding. Sometimes it appears only in the cheeks, ſometimes only a few cluſters in the extremities. Sometimes the <hi>ſuffuſion</hi> was ſcarce miliary and vaniſhed inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly by becoming gradually paler without ſcaling. Where the Miliary Eruptions were conſiderable, the extremities peel in ſcraps or ſtrips like <hi>Exuviae;</hi> in one or two the nails of the fingers and toes did caſt off. The period or continuance of Eruption is ſometimes prolonged by weakneſs of nature, by undue evacuations, or by the Patients being expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the cold.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In ſome who were very ſlightly affected, their Illneſs was of a much ſhorter continuance, than is deſcribed in the Standard kind. <hi>Moſt of thoſe who died of the Phyſician died by immoderate evacuations.</hi> As to the deaths, only a few were occaſioned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by any diſtemperature of the Throat; they were generally the effect of the Fever, either by an immediate <hi>Necroſis</hi> at firſt ſeizure, or by the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004012_0020_100386D9C61E4CA8"/>ordinary fatality of Fevers, or by conſequential ails. In <hi>Boſton</hi> at a medium of the laſt eight heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy years (1723. 1724. 1725. 1726. 1727. 1728. 1732. and 1733) in the Months of <hi>October, Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, December, January, February, March, April</hi> to 18th <hi>May,</hi> died <hi>pr. an.</hi> 268 Whites and Slaves; this year in the ſame ſpace of time died 382, is 114 <hi>extra</hi> deaths, and may be reſonably charged to this Illneſs, it being otherways a healthy time: of theſe 114. about 71 caſes came to my knowledge, whereof in the firſt period died 35, in the ſecond period 28, and of conſequential ails, 8. Of theſe 71, only about 10 can be ſaid to have died of ſore Throats. Of theſe 71 only 9 were upwards of 14 <hi>aet.</hi> According to the neareſt eſtimate I can make in round numbers, about 1 in 35 have died, that is about 4000 Perſons in <hi>Boſton</hi> have had this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which is about one 4th part of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Summer 1735 was unuſually wet and chilly with many Eaſterly winds, in the Summer &amp; Autumn it prevail'd and was very mortal in ſeveral Country Towns. In <hi>Boſton</hi> it began in Autumn, but did not prevail until Winter, which was not rigid with hard froſts as is uſual, but with a very diſagreeable chill in the air, eſpecially in the Month of <hi>March</hi> laſt, in which Month was our greateſt Mortality.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Moſt Malignant diſtempers affect to throw off their malignancy by ſome Emunctory.</hi> The deſpumation of this acrid inqination of the juices in our diſtemper, that is, its natural <hi>Criſis,</hi> ſeems to be by the patent and ſalutary <hi>Emunctories</hi> of the <hi>Fauces</hi> and skin. In corroſive taints, u. g. Venereal and others, a <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial ptyaliſm</hi> and ſudorifick decoction of the <hi>woods,</hi> anſwer beſt; this gave us the hint of promoting
