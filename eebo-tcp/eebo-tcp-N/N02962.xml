            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>WHAT is here presented to thy View, is written in great Love; and I desire that the Lord, by his Holy Spirit, may give thee a right Understanding of the Truths herein laid down. Our Principles and Doctrine has been very much misrepresented, and many of</hi> our Friends <hi>Words and Writings have been wrested and mis-construed by many, who wanted Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is the Bond of Perfection: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle has excellently described it, in his first Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>he saith,</hi> Charity suffereth long, <note place="margin">1 Cor 13, 4, 5, 6.</note> and is kind; Charity envieth not; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity vaunteth not it self, is not puffed up, doth not behave it self unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no Evil, rejoiceth not in Iniquity, but
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003552_0003_0000000000000000"/>
rejoiceth in the Truth, <hi>Oh, that it might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail amongst the Children of Men universally, that so there might be no envying one another! Charity is so far from speaking Evil, or doing Evil, that it thinketh no Evil:</hi> Although, <hi>saith the Apostle,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 3.</note> I bestow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and give my Body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me not. <hi>It is greatly to be desired, that all might endeavour to excell therein, that so there might be a holy Harmony amongst the Children of Men. This Treatise being small, may come into many Hands, where some larger Books, that give a more full and particular Account of our Doctrine and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, may not come; and if the Observations that are made on the several Heads touched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may have the good Effect to remove Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and open the Understanding of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well-minded, it will very much answer the Desire of him, who wishes well to Thee, and all Men;</hi>

            <head>A SERIOUS CALL IN CHRISTIAN LOVE To all PEOPLE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AS the Lord hath been so wonderful gracious and kind to the Children of Men, who were gone astray from him, <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> that he has <hi>sent the Spirit of his Son into their Hearts,</hi> to be a Guide and Teacher to them; it is greatly to be desired, they might all take Heed unto it, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be enabled to withstand and resist the Enemy of their Souls, in all his Temptations and Assaults; for it is certain, as Christ said, <hi>without me you can do nothing;</hi> we are not able without the Help of his Spirit, to resist the least Temptation; for in that Divine Light, <hi>which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 1. 9.</note> giving Men and Women a Sight and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that which is evil, there is Power to enable them to withstand and resist the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003552_0005_0000000000000000"/>
Enemy in all his Temptations, as they take Heed to it; but many People are Strangers to this Divine Light, tho' the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, how Men may know it, he saith, <hi>All Things that are reproved,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>are made manifest by the Light; for whatsoever doth make manifest is Light.</hi> It is no Sin <hi>to be tempted,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 1.</note> if Men shut out the Temptation as soon as it is presented; for we read that Christ was tempted seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ways, but he overcame the Tempter by resisting of him; the Apostle <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>resist the Devil and he will flee,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">James 4. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>and draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.</hi> It is to this holy Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that lets People see the Evil, when it is presented, that we endeavour to turn the Minds of the Children of Men, that thereby they may be enabled to withstand the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in all his Temptations; we read that <hi>the Nations of them which are saved,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 23, 24 1 John 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>must walk in the Light of the Lamb: If we walk in the Light,</hi> saith <hi>John, as he is in the Light, then have we Fellowship one with another, and the Blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from all Sin.</hi> If all that profess, to be the Followers of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, did but walk in this Holy Light as they ought to do, then they would shew
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003552_0006_0000000000000000"/>
forth Christianity in the Purity of it, and adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour, by their Good and Holy Living; we read, <hi>the Light shined in Darkness, and the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness comprehended it not.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 1. 5.</note> How many that are Strangers to this Holy Light which God has caused to shine in Mens dark Hearts, have spoke Evil of it; and also of many that have born Testimony to it, we read that the Apostle <hi>Paul, was sent to turn Men from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God.</hi> And this is the great Labour now of them that are truly the Ministers of Christ, to turn the Children of Men to that true Light, which we read, <note place="margin">John 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> This Divine Light ought not to be rejected, nor the true Way of worshipping God, despised; because they may be evilly spoken of by many that are ignorant of them: The Way in which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> worshipped God, some that were Strangers to it, counted it <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,</hi> and the Believers, <note place="margin">Acts 24. 14. Acts 28. 22. John 7. 48, 49.</note> 
               <hi>a Sect every where spoken against;</hi> and it was said concerning Christ, <hi>have any of the Rulers, or Pharisees, believed on him, but this People, who know not the Law are accursed.</hi> They were so ignorant, that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003552_0007_0000000000000000"/>
they counted them that believed in Christ accursed. Many of the Children of God have been evilly spoken of, by them that were Strangers to the Lord, <hi>Behold,</hi> saith <hi>John,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 John 3. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>what Manner of Love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</hi> He assigns the Reason, why the World knew them not, because, saith he, <hi>it knew him not:</hi> While <hi>Saul</hi> was ignorant of God, he persecuted his People; all his Learning and Scholarship did not give him the Knowledge of God, nor yet the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his People; <note place="margin">Acts 9. 1, 2, 3, 5.</note> 
               <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>yet breathing out Threatnings and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against the Disciples of the Lord, went unto the High-Priest, and desired of him Letters to</hi> Damascus, <hi>that if he found any of this Way, whether they were Men or Women, he might bring them bound to</hi> Jerusalem; <hi>and as he was journeying to</hi> Damascus, <hi>suddenly there shined round about him a Light from Heaven, and he heard a Voice saying,</hi> Saul, Saul, <hi>why persecutest thou me? And he said, who art thou Lord? And the Lord said, I am</hi> Jesus <hi>whom thou persecutest, it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks.</hi> It is to be feared, that many do not know that it is the Lord by his Spirit,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003552_0008_0000000000000000"/>
that inwardly pricks them when they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss. Now here is the Ground of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Men know not God, nor them that are truly his People, they persecute the true Worshippers of God as Hereticks: How many of the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Mary'</hi>s Days, were persecuted, and put to Death as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, by them that were ignorant of God, and how many of <hi>our Friends</hi> have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted unto Death by them that were Strangers to the Lord, and his People; but as it was of old, so it is now, <hi>he that is born after the Flesh, persecutes him that is born after the Spirit;</hi> we read how Christ said to his Followers, <hi>If the World hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you: If ye were of the World,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 15. 18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>the World would love his own, but because ye are not of the World, but I have chosen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Word that I said unto you, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is not greater than the Lord; if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.</hi> It has often been the Lot of many of the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Christ, to be persecuted and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and evilly spoken of; but our Saviour, to encourage his Disciples to bear Persecution and the Reproaches and Revilings of Men,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003552_0009_0000000000000000"/>
saith, <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed are ye when Men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all Manner of Evil against you, falsly for my Sake, rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your Reward in Heaven, for so persecuted they the Prophets which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</hi> Altho' they that believed in Christ, were accounted accursed by some, it was happy for them who did believe in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>to them he gave Power to become the Sons of God.</hi> This is the great Blessing which they have, that receive Christ by his Spirit into their Hearts. As they are subject to him, they do not only receive Power to conquer their Lusts and Passions, but also to do the Will of God, and keep his Commands.

            </p>
            <p>And as the Lord by his Light, gives thee a Sight and Discovery of the Truth, I desire that thou may'st embrace it, and join with It; <hi>the Lord,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>has, own to thee, O Man, what is good, and what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of thee, to do justly, love Mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Now the Lord by his Holy Light doth not only shew Men that which is good, and what he requires of them; but he is near to shew them that

If Men do not take heed to this, they may soon err in Judgment, and receive and embrace false Doctrine, and wrong Principles. And Men's receiving false and worng Opinions, doth very much open a Door for wrong Practices. If Men once entertain a Belief, that there is no Possibility of their conquering and overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Corruptions while here, what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is there for them to war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; or if they believe that there is a Purgatory, or a Place in which they may be cleansed from their Sins after Death, it is no Wonder, if they live to fulfil and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their own carnal Desires and Inclinations. But it is his Work, that was a Liar from the Beginning, to perswade Men to believe this; we do not read, that the rich Man, that we have an Account of in <hi>Luke,</hi> met with any Place of cleansing after Death.

And if Men entertain a Belief, that God has before ordained a great part of Mankind to perish, and the rest to be saved, and that the Numbers are so fix'd, that none can be diminished from them, that are to perish or any added to the Number of them that are to be saved, what need any Body take any Care about another World: This Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine doth very much destroy Religion and Christianity. I believe some have been so darkned in their Understandings, that they have not stuck to say, that God has fore-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd whatever comes to pass; that he has appointed the Murderer to murder, and the Thief to steal, that so they might consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perish. How contrary is this Doctrine to what we read in the Holy Scripture, where the Lord has said, <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 11.</note>

I wish that all would be careful how they are imposed upon, to receive any Doctrines, which are repugnant to the Doctrine of Christ, and the primitive Christians, recorded in the Holy Scriptures; and that People would compare their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine with the Doctrine there laid down, and see how they correspond. It has pleased God to raise up a People to preach the same Doctrine, and bear the same Testimony, that the Apostles and primitive Christians bore; <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>we are of God, he that knoweth God,</hi>

that Men may be saved by the Lord Jesus Christ, that suffered upon the Cross for them, if they are subject to his Spirit in their Hearts, although their Lots may be cast in such remote Parts of the World, that are deprived of the Benefit of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and may know nothing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ in the Flesh, for the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in the 5th of the <hi>Romans</hi> saith, <hi>as by the Offence of One, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation, even so by the Righteousness of One, the free Gift came upon all Men to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Life;</hi> for as all Men partake of the Fruit of <hi>Adam'</hi>s Fall, by Reason of that evil Seed, which through him is communicated unto them, which inclines them unto Evil, although many Thousands of them never heard of the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> nor of his Eating of the forbidden Fruit; so we believe many may, and do receive Benefit by the Lord Jesus Christ, as they take Heed to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light and Grace, which is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Mankind universally, through him, although they may know nothing of his Coming in the Flesh.

Friendly Reader, I desire the Lord may open thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding by his holy Spirit, that thou mayst have a right discerning of these Things, <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>account that the long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of our Lord is Salvation,</hi>

               <p>ALTHO' some have misrepresented us, as tho' we undervalued or dis-esteem'd the Holy Scriptures, of the Old and New Testament; yet we do bless the Lord, and have great Cause so to do, that the excellent Counsel therein contained, which proceeded

from the Spirit of God, is preserved upon Record unto this Day, and it is a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that we live under such a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we have the Liberty to read them, this being a Priviledge that many called Christians are deprived of, in some other Countries, and I wish that all would be frequent in reading of them: The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> commended <hi>Timothy, in that from a Child he had known the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>which,</hi> saith he, <hi>are able to make thee wise unto Salvation, thro' Faith, which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture given by Inspiration of God, is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in Righteousness, that the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good Works.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 5. 39, 40.</note> Ye <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi> said Christ, <hi>for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and they are they which testify of me, and ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</hi> They are greatly to be valued, in that they testify of Christ, in whom there is Power to give Men Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over their Corruptions and Passions, and enable them to do the Will of God; we read, <note place="margin">John 1. 11. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that Christ came unto his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them gave
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003552_0030_0000000000000000"/>
he Power to become the Sons of God.</hi> They that receive Christ by his Spirit into their Hearts, they receive Power; for Christ's Spirit is a Christian's Strength: <hi>I can do all Things,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>thro' Christ which strengthens me;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 13. 2 Pet. 1. 20. 21.</note> we read <hi>that no Prophesy of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of any private interpretation; for the Prophesy came not in the old Time by the Will of Man, but holy Men of God, spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we say, the most true Interpreter of the Holy Scriptures, is the Holy Ghost, or Spirit from which they did proceed; we read <hi>that the natural Man receives not the Things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know them,</hi> saith the Text, and there is a strong Reason laid down for it, because they are spiritually discerned; they are beyond his Reach and Comprehension, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>for what Man knoweth the Things of a Man, save the Spirit of a Man which is in him; even so the Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> This is the Key which opens the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God to Men. I take this to be the great Reason why there are such great Mistakes about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and why many put such gross Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions upon many Parts of the Holy

Scriptures, as they do, because they do not come to that Divine Spirit which gives a right and true Understanding, as <hi>Elihu</hi> said, <hi>there is a Spirit in Man,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joh 32. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Almighty giveth them Understanding.</hi> Till Men come to the Holy Spirit of God in themselves, they can neither know God, nor the Things of God; for we read, <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>that no Man knoweth the Father save the Son, and he, to whom soever the Son will reveal him.</hi> Now if Revelation were ceased, as some do imagine it is, what a sad Condition would Mankind be in? For we read, the World by Wisdom knows not God, there is no Knowledge of God but by the Revelation of his Son; and it is as Men come to have an inward Knowledge of God, that they come to have a right Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Scriptures, which proceeded from the good Spirit of God, wherefore we highly value them, tho' 'tis to be feared, some called Christians, do dis-believe many of the great Truths therein contained, for I believe, that a Man through often rebelling against the Holy Spirit of God in himself, may arrive to such a Degree of Wickedness, that he may reject the Scriptures, and count them but Fables; and that he may be so far from owning of any Thing of God in Man,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003552_0032_0000000000000000"/>
that he may come to deny the Holy Three that bear Record in Heaven, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>there are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these Three are One.</hi> It must be very deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if a Man come to be so wicked, as to deny the Lord that bought him, and to say, as 'tis written, <note place="margin">Psal. 14. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the Fool hath said in his Heart, there is no God.</hi> It is the Work of the Enemy of all Righteousness, to perswade Men to believe that there is no God, and that the Scriptures are but a Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that Men are not accountable for their Words and Actions, and that there are no future Rewards and Punishments; that they might walk at large, and take their full swing in Wickedness. It is greatly to be desired, if there be any such now living, whose Day of Mercy is not wholly over, that have arrived to such a degree of Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Wickedness as this is, they may be brought to a Sense of their Iniquity and Error, and be so truly humbled in Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thereof, that if possible, they might find Mercy at the Lord's Hand.

               <head>3. Concerning Worship.</head>
               <p>WE live in a Time, in which there is great Difference, even amongst them called Christians about Religion and the Worship of God. Difference about Religion and the Worship of God, <note place="margin">John 4. 9.</note> is no new Thing, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> differ'd to such a great Degree, that it seems they did not deal with one another. It is very much amiss, where Religion sowers People, and makes them rigid, and bitter one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another. Christianity is Love, and he that is a Christian in his Heart, is full of Pitty and good Will to them that are under a Mistake in Matters of Religion; and the worst that he wishes for all such, is, that the Lord may direct them right; for they that have the Mind of Christ, would not have any Soul to err, neither in Faith nor Practice. Our Saviour in his Discourse with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> has clearly described the true and spiritual Worship, <hi>but the Hour cometh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 4. 23 24.</note> 
                  <hi>and now is, when the true Worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth; for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and they that worship him, must worship
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003552_0034_0000000000000000"/>
him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> Now we believe, that as God is a Spirit, that he may be truly worshipped, as we are gathered in his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if there be not a Word outwardly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken amongst us, <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 20.</note> as Christ said, <hi>for where two or three are gathred together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them;</hi> and the Holy Prophet saith, <hi>they that wait upon the Lord,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 11. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>shall renew their Strength, and mount up with Wings as Eagles; they shall run, and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I believe a great many pious good Christians can say, as they have waited hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon the Lord, in the true Silence of all Flesh, with their Minds truly staid upon him, they have enjoyed that divine Comfort which has been beyond what they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press in Words; yet this of silent waiting, is a great Mystery to many People. There is a Divine Teacher near Men, even in their own Hearts, which is sufficient to teach them, as they take heed thereto. It is to be feared, that many People too much depend upon the Teachings of Men, and neglect the Divine Teacher in themselves, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any Man teach you, but as the same Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003552_0035_0000000000000000"/>
teacheth you, of all Things, which is Truth, and no Lic, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we understand the Holy Man here, to speak in a large Sense. He told them that they needed not that any Man taught them, but as the same Anointing taught them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We do very much own outward Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Praying, where it proceeds from this Divine Anointing. If it please God to speak by this through any Instruments, whether Male or Female, we believe there should be Liberty amongst us, for every one to speak as he requires it of them; <hi>for ye may all prophesy one by one,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 31. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>that all may learn, and all may be comforted,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them Utterance.</hi> We believe the true Preaching and Praying is that which proceeds from the Holy Spirit, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh Intercession for us, with Groanings which cannot be uttered. I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the Understanding also,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 15.</note>

                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:003552_0036_0000000000000000"/>This is the Preaching and Praying, and Singing, which we own, that is, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Assistance of the holy Spirit.

                  <hi>with all Subjection, but I suffer not a Woman to teach, nor to usurp Authority over the Man, but to be in Silence.</hi> We do not take this to be a prohibiting of Holy Women to speak, whom the Lord calls thereto; and I think it would be very much amiss, to say that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was against holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men speaking, that God called to speak; but such troublesome and unruly Women, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed the Church by their Questions, and usurp'd Authority over the Man.

               <p>BECAUSE of our Disuse of Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and Bread and Wine, we have been very hardly spoken of, as though we denied the Ordinances of Jesus Christ, when as there is no People that I know of, that do more truly own the Necessity of believing and being baptized, than we do, but we do not understand it to be only a Historical Belief of the Conception and Birth, and Life and Miracles, and also of the Death and Sufferings, and Resurrection and Ascension

of Christ, or a being outwardly baptized with Water, that will entitle Men to Salvation; for we read, <hi>that</hi> Simon <hi>the Sorcerer believed,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 8. 13, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>and was baptized;</hi> and yet he was so far from being in a State of Salvation, that <hi>Peter</hi> saith to him, <hi>I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thou art in the Gall of Bitterness, and in the Bond of Iniquity.</hi> But lest any should be under a Mistake, and take the Baptism of Water, to be the one essential and saving Baptism, hear the Apostle <hi>Peter, when once the long-suffering of God, waited in the Days of</hi> Noah, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 20. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>while the Ark was preparing, wherein few, that is, eight Souls were saved by Water, the Antitype wereunto even Baptism now saveth us, not the putting away of the Filth of the Flesh</hi> (mark that) <hi>but the Answer of a good Conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</hi> Now it is the Baptism of Christ by his Spirit, that brings Men to that, for it is plain, from the Instance of <hi>Simon</hi> before-noted, that a Man may believe, and be baptized with Water, and be so far from having the Answer of a good Conscience, that he may be in the <hi>Gall of Bitterness, and in the Bond of Iniquity,</hi> which is the very Reverse of Christianity. A great many take the Commission in the 28th of <hi>Matthew,</hi> to be a Commission for
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003552_0041_0000000000000000"/>
Water-Baptism, <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Now here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Water. Is it not reasonable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that if our dear Lord had intended that they should baptize with Water, that he would have expresly mention'd it; altho' the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was not inferior to the chief of the Apostles, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> he saith, <hi>I thank God, that I baptized none of you, but</hi> Crispus <hi>and</hi> Gaius, <hi>least any should say, I baptized in mine own Name; and I bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized also the Houshold of</hi> Stephanus, <hi>besides, I know not whether I baptized any other; for Christ sent me</hi> NOT <hi>to baptize, but to preach the Gospel:</hi> So that, what he did in that Case, was by way of Condescension, as in the Case of circumcising <hi>Timothy,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 16. 3, 21, 26.</note> and going into the Temple, and purifying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. It would be a weak Thing to plead for these things now, because the Apostle practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Doth it therefore follow, that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptism should be practised now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> by way of Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension, practised it? For if he had took that Commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. to be a Commission for him to baptize with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Water, we may safely conclude, that
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003552_0042_0000000000000000"/>
he would not have thank'd God that he had done him so little Service. We do not deny, but that some other of the Apostles, did also by way of Condescension, practise Water Baptism; but that they were commanded to baptize with Water in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> I think, will be too hard for any body to prove. It is possible some may be ready to say, it must needs be meant of Water; because say they no Man can baptize with the Spirit, or into the Power and Spirit of Christ. We freely own, that no Man, as he is a Man, by his own Power can do this; neither can any Man by his own Power, as he is a Man, <hi>heal the Sick, cleanse the Lepers, raise the Dead, cast out Devils,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 8.</note> and yet we find the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were commanded to do these Things. And by the same Power, by which they did cast out many Devils, and heal'd the Sick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were instrumental to baptize Men into the Name and Power of Christ. And as I began to speak, saith <hi>Peter, the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>

                  <hi>Then remembred I the Word of the Lord, that</hi> John <hi>truly baptized with Water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</hi> At that great Meeting we read of in the 2d of <hi>Acts,</hi> verse the 4th,

saith, <hi>and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them Utterance;</hi> yet some of the Multitude mocked, and were so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Operation of the Holy Ghost, that they said, vers. 5, 13. <hi>these Men are full of new Wine; but</hi> Peter <hi>standing up with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, lift up his Voice, and said unto them, ye Men of</hi> Judah, <hi>and all ye that dwell at</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>be this known unto you, and hearken to my Words, for these are not drunken, as ye sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, seeing it is but the third Hour of the Day, but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet</hi> Joel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is hard to make Men sensible of the Operation of the Holy Ghost, and of the spiritual Baptism, while they are Strangers to the Spirit in themselves; but if it could be proved, that the Disciples in that Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19, 20.</note> were commanded to baptize with, or in Water, which I believe cannot be done; how will they that are for the sprinkling of Infants, prove their Practise from that Commission, <hi>go teach all Nations,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 16. 33.</note> &amp;c. for they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being taught. As to what is urged of the Jailor, and all his, and of whole Families being baptized; there is no Account that there was any Infants baptized in any of them.

now (as we may reasonably suppose) there were then, in which there are no little Children. As to that of our Saviour, where he saith, <hi>suffer little Children to come unto me and forbid it not, for of such is the Kingdom;</hi> it cannot be proved from the Scripture, that he baptized any of them in, or with Water. But as to this Practise of sprinkling Infants, it is so much without Foundation in the Scripture, that a great many People who are not of our Society, do not hold it nor own it. The Way rightly to understand this Commission, is to come to that Spirit, by which it was given forth. Many urge, that our Saviour was baptized of <hi>John,</hi> he was also circumcised, doth it therefore follow, <note place="margin">Luke 2. 21.</note> that we must be circumcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because he was circumcised; for as he was born under the Law, he fulfilled the Law, and <hi>he is the End of Law, for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness Sake, to all them that believe.</hi> When Christ came to <hi>John</hi> to be baptized of him, <hi>John</hi> forbad him, saying, <hi>I have need to be baptized of thee.</hi>

                  <hi>and the Lord whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his Temple, even the Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts, but who may abide the Day of his Coming, and who shall stand when he appears: for he is like a Refiner's Fire, and like Fuller's Sope:</hi> 
                  <q>And he shall sit as a Refiner and Purifier of Silver: and he shall purify the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> and purge them as Gold and Silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an Offering in Righteousness.</q> For this End the Lord Jesus Christ is come into the Hearts of Men,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003552_0046_0000000000000000"/>
by his Spirit, to purge them from their Dross, and wash them from their Uncleanness, that so they may be fitted for that Kingdom, into which nothing that is unclean can enter; this is the Washing which will avail, for Men to know their Hearts to be washed from Wickedness; as it was said to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, wash thy Heart from Wickedness:</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 5.</note> saith, <hi>that there is one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism. John,</hi> as is before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, has distinguished very plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Baptism with Water, and the Baptism of Christ with the Holy Ghost. Now, what we desire is, that all might come to the Baptism of the Spirit, which the Apostles and primitive Christians witnessed, that could say, <hi>by one Spirit, we are all baptized into one Body,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>whether we be</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Gentiles, <hi>bond or free; and have all been made to drink into one Spirit, for as many as have been baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ,</hi>

                  <hi>have put on Christ,</hi> Now this is the Sum of all, for Men to put on the Lord Jesus Christ, the new and heavenly Man, then they will witness inward Communion with the Lord.</p>
               <p>But why are many of our sober Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours so strenuous for Water Baptism, and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:003552_0047_0000000000000000"/>
neglect to wash one another's Feet, when as we read, <hi>John</hi> 13. and ver. 14. that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour wash'd the Disciples Feet, and he told them, that he had given them an Example, that as he had done to them, so they should do to one another: Now here is both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Precept for this; and if we ask many sober People, why they are not in the Practice of this? I presume many would be ready to answer, that they look upon it to be but an outward and visible Sign, by which our Saviour shew'd his Followers, that they ought to serve one another, and be ready to do the meanest Offices of Love if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: and that they do not hold the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Part of washing one anothers Feet, to be obligatory upon them, as long as they come to the spiritual Part of what was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by signify'd; although we find that this was practised by our Saviour, now, why they should lay such Stress upon Water Baptism, which we cannot find was ever practised by our Saviour, and drop this, deserves their serious Consideration; although as we disuse Water Baptism, so we do also disuse the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious Part of washing one another's Feet, being sensible that they that are come to the spiritual Part of what was thereby signify'd, are come to the End of the outward and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Signs.</p>

I also will chuse their Delusions, and will bring their Fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake they did not bear; but they did Evil before mine Eyes, and chose that, in which I delighted not.</hi> Here is the Reason laid down, why the Lord was angry with them. These Things afford great Instruction and caution, and I desire that all may learn from what

such brought upon themselves, through their chusing their own Ways, and delighting in their Abominations, to beware of doing the like; but they that are Christ's, and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in reality, are crucified to the World, with the Affections and Lusts thereof; and we desire that all who are called Christians, may demonstrate themselves to be such, by their so doing, that they may witness the spiritual Communion and Supper here spoken of. There are many religious People, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>Holland,</hi> who do not propose to be of our Society, though they do not clearly see beyond the Use of Water Baptism, and Bread and Wine, do join with us in opposing Swearing upon any Account; because they are convinced, that all Swearing is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by <hi>Christ, but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by Heaven, for it is God's Throne, nor by the Earth, for it is his Footstool,</hi>

                  <hi>freely you have received, freely give;</hi> and they are likewise one with us, in holding forth the universal Love of God to all Men. Now although there be many that are purely Consciencious for the Use of Water Baptism, and Bread and Wine, we have a great deal of Charity for all such; for many that are now join'd in Society with us, were once as much for the Use of these Things, as many well-minded People now are, and as the Lord has mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully brought many of us, in a good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to witness the spiritual Baptism and Supper, we desire that others might be brought to the Experience thereof in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;

and he that witnesses the Substance of what many allow, the Water Baptism, and Bread and Wine to be but outward and visible Signs of, he is come to the End of the Signs; for I hope, I may be fate in saying, all Signs end in their Substance. Now as we have Charity for all them, who do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienciously use these Things, we think they ought to have Charity for us, if we disuse them; because we believe they are ceased in Point of Obligation; and we read, <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note>

If God did require that of Men, which they were not able, neither of themselves, nor by any Grace received to perform, then it might be said, that his Ways were unequal, and that he was a hard Master; but that would be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to charge upon the Almighty, who is full of Justice and Equity. The Wise man saith, <note place="margin">Eecl. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>fear God, and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole Duty of Man.</hi> Now if God require this of Men, as to be sure he doth, then there is a Possibility of it, or else, as is before observ'd, his Ways are unequal; but it is far from the Children of God, to charge him with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice: The Disobedient and rebellious People of <hi>Israel</hi> said, that the way of the Lord was not equal, <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 29, 30.</note>

               <p>HAVING made the foregoing Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are left to the Reader's serious Consideration; what I greatly desire, is, that all may come to the practical Part of true Religion and Christianity; for altho' a Man may believe, according to the Scripture, <hi>that there are three that bear Record in Heaven,</hi>

Reverse of Christianity; many not only amongst us, and I hope, also amongst other Societies, have so much of the Fear of God, that they hate this; the Scripture saith, <hi>that the Fear of God is to hate Pride and Arrogancy, and the evil Way.</hi> The more Men live in the Fear of God, there is the greater Hatred in their Hearts against ill Things, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for want of this, have fallen into very bad Company, and evil Things, whereby they have brought great Ruin and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon themselves.

But it is very profitable to read the Holy Scriptures, which proceeded from the good Spirit of God; as People read them in the same Spirit from which they did proceed; and there are also a great many other good Books that are written by such as did fear

God, which do greatly tend to promote Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Virtue, and are very profitable to be read.</p>
               <p>Great Controversies have been, and yet are amongst the Professors of Christianity, about Religion, one saith one Thing, and another another, so that I believe, many well-minded People are at a very great stand to know which is the right Way: Now the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> by the Direction of the Holy Ghost, <note place="margin">Acts 10. 35.</note> has told us, <hi>that God is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specter of Persons; but in every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he that fears God and works Righteousness is accepted with him.</hi> Now here are the Terms and Conditions clearly laid down, upon which Acceptance with God stands: and this is what we desire, all People may come to be found in the Practice of, that so all Bitterness and envy one against another, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, might cease and come to an End, that Truth and Righteousness may flourish in the Earth.</p>
               <p>If all did but truly live in the Fear of God as they ought to do, there would be a holy Harmony amongst the Children of Men, and Love, Peace, Mercy, Truth, Justice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, would abound amongst them, but for want of this, how doth Strife, Envy, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and Oppression, abound even amongst
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:003552_0074_0000000000000000"/>
many of them, who prosess to be the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Followers of Christ. O that the Children of Men had it but in their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, what great Reward and Peace there is in living in the Fear of God, and in keeping of his Commands, then they would serve him with Pleasure; for there is Peace and Comfort in obeying and serving the Lord, beyond what any are sensible of, except those that have it in their own Experience; so that I believe many pious good People are thankful beyond what they can express in Words, that they were prevailed upon to serve him.</p>
               <p>And such are concerned in Heart, that others might also be gained upon to serve the Lord, that so they might be truly happy; it is for this End, that many of our Religious good Friends, have travelled from one Land and Country to another, in Hazard of their Lives; it is also upon this Account, that many have appeared in Print, that if possible, they might be instrumental to gain upon the Children of Men, to fear and serve the Lord, for if Men observe a thousand out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Observations, if they do not obey the Lord, they will not all render them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his Sight: <hi>Samuel</hi> told <hi>Saul,</hi> that Obedience was better than Sacrifice, and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:003552_0075_0000000000000000"/>
to hearken to the Voice of God, was better than the Fat of Rams.</p>
               <p>When it pleased God to reach to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul,</hi> and bring him to partake of his Love and Goodness, how did his Bowels yern for his Relations and Kinds folks after the Flesh, that they might be gained upon to serve the Lord: And his Love did not only reach to them, but to Mankind universally, for in his first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he saith, <hi>I exhort that Prayers and Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> &amp;c. <hi>be made for all Men; and the Apostle laboured, as in Christ's Stead, that Men might be reconciled to God:</hi> O what could a true Christian, that hath the Mind of Christ go through, that Men might be won upon to serve God truly, that so they might experience the Love and Goodness of God in themselves; for the Nature of the Love of God is such, that when it prevails in Men's Hearts, that they desire that others might come to share thereof with them, as the good Man of old said, <hi>Come, Taste and see that the Lord is good.</hi> It is when Men are truly revealed upon, by the Power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, that they come to be in Love with God, and to run the Ways of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with Cheerfulness; for if there were no future Rewards and Punishments, that

Power to become the Sons of God, consider what Victory thou has gotten over the Enemy in thy self. And as some People have been too inquisitive how the Dead should be raised, and with what Bodies they should come, let it be thy great Concern to know thou art raised out of the Grave of Sin and Iniquity, that thou mayst walk with the Lord in newness of Life, and live to his Praise and Glory, whilst thou hast a Being here, that so thou mayst attain to the Resurrection of the Just hereafter.</p>
               <p>As the Lord in his wonderful Love and Mercy, has sent the Son of his dear Love, the Lord Jesus Christ, to die for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, whilst they were Enemies to him; I tenderly desire that all may consider the great Love of God to them therein; and as he is the Fountain and Author of all the Good that we receive, it is greatly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, that his long-forbearance, great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and manifold Mercies extended to the Children of Men, might engage them to Care and Watchfulness, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 20.</note> we read that the Long-suffering of God waited in the Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> while the Ark was preparing; <note place="margin">Geref. 6. 3.</note> and when the Lord had long striven with them by his Spirit, and they would not be
