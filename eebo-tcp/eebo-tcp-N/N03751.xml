            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Execution of the ſaid Women drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a vaſt Concourſe of People, and probably the greater, becauſe theſe were the firſt Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever were ſeen in this Province: For,
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004599_0004_100DA9EC16A9C200"/>
altho' this Province, in ſome Part of it, has been inhabited as long as any of the neighbouring Provinces yet never any Perſon, before theſe unhappy women, was legally convicted of any capital Crime among us.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' <hi>Curioſity</hi> might move many Perſons to come to behold thoſe ſad Objects, I would charitably hope that many came from a <hi>better Principle</hi>; with Minds diſpos'd to reflect on the <hi>Vileneſs and Corruption of their own Nature,</hi> which would have betrayed them into the worſt of Crimes, had it not been for the <hi>reſtraining Grace</hi> of God, to whoſe Name alone belongs the Praiſe, that any of us have been with-held from the groſſeſt and moſt horrid Acts of Wickedneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And, while they ador'd the <hi>Juſtice of God</hi> in leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Criminals to die before their Time, I hope they were <hi>diſpos'd to take Warning</hi> by them, agreeable to the Advice of the wiſe Man, <hi>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou fooliſh; for why ſhouldſt thou die before thy Time</hi>? And, as the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of Crimes committed, is deſign'd <hi>in Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorem,</hi> for the Prevention of the like; 'tis to be hoped, that all others, who <hi>hear</hi> of it, will <hi>fear and do no more any ſuch Wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, whereas <hi>Secrecy</hi> is a ſtrong Temptation to many Sins, the ſtrange <hi>Diſcovery of the ſecret Crimes of theſe poor Women</hi> may well abate the Force of that Temptation. All <hi>our Iniquities are before God, and our ſecret Sins in the Light of his Countenance,</hi> who can when he pleaſes <hi>bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkneſs</hi>; as is remarkably evident in the preſent Caſe; for an Infant, that was found in a Well at the Entrance into the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a <hi>Search</hi> for the Mother of it; whereby it was found that the ſaid Women had lately been deliver'd of Children: Now each of them deny'd, that the Child in the Well was theirs; and <hi>one</hi>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004599_0005_100DA9EE2533D978"/>
of them declar'd, where ſhe had bury'd her Child, which was accordingly found; but the <hi>other</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that ſhe caſt her Child into the River; which has never been found: And ſhe ſtedfaſtly affirm'd to the laſt, that ſhe knew nothing of the Child in the Well: So that it looks very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a Woman equally (and perhaps more heinouſly) guilty than either of theſe, was the Mother of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and has yet eſcap'd Diſcovery: But, if ſhe will not <hi>take Warning and give Glory to GOD</hi> by timely Repentance, ſhe will ſooner or later find herſelf in a doleful Caſe; and her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition may be worſe than if ſhe had been detected with the other Women: For theſe were <hi>awaken'd to conſider their Ways</hi>; and, as they <hi>had a Space of Repentance</hi> allow'd them, they <hi>ſhew'd a Concern to make a due Improvement thereof</hi>; gratefully <hi>accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good Advice</hi> that was given them from Time to Time, and ſeriouſly <hi>joining in the Prayers</hi> that were put up for them in Priſon, and <hi>devoutly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on the publick Worſhip:</hi> And they ſo behav'd both in Priſon and on the Day of their Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that 'tis charitably hop'd they had <hi>made their Peace with</hi> GOD. <hi>One</hi> of them had been brought up in <hi>groſs Ignorance</hi>; but ſhe ſeem'd <hi>willing to be inſtructed</hi> in the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity: <hi>Both</hi> of them greatly <hi>lamented their paſt Life,</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Juſtice of</hi> GOD in leaving them to be brought to ſuch an untimely End, becauſe they had been <hi>great Sinners:</hi> Tho' they <hi>deny'd that they laid violent Hands on their Children; one</hi> affirming that her Child was <hi>dead born;</hi> and the <hi>other,</hi> that hers dy'd <hi>ſoon after it was born</hi>: But both ſeem'd ſenſible of their <hi>Neglect of taking due Care</hi> to preſerve the Life of their Children: So that they tho't themſelves guilty of the <hi>Breach of the ſixth Commandment by Omiſſion,</hi> if not by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>

               </hi> the Crucifixion of the bleſſed Jeſus, being now arriv'd; among other Circumſtances that attended it, we are told in the preceding Parts of the Chapter, (agreable to what was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore predicted, that he ſhould <hi>be number'd with the Tranſgreſſors</hi>) that there were <hi>two Malefactors led forth with him to be put to Death</hi>; who were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>crucified</hi> with him, the <hi>one on his right Hand, and the other on his left:</hi> And in the Text, and the immediately foregoing Verſes, we have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>count in what Manner theſe Malefactors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted themſelves.</p>
            <p>One of them, ſays the Evangeliſt Ver. 39, <hi>railed on him, ſaying, If thou be the</hi> CHRIST, <hi>ſave thy ſelf and us: But the other rebuked him,</hi> and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers himſelf to be a ſincere and real Penitent. It is indeed ſaid in the two preceding Evangeliſts, that <hi>the Thieves that were crucified with him, reviled him:</hi> And accordingly ſome ſuppoſe, that they both did ſo at firſt, 'till the Heart of one of them was wonderfully and ſuddenly chang'd. But it is the more general, and, I think, much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Opinion, that it was but <hi>one of them that
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004599_0009_100DA9F6D06EB5F8"/>
reviled,</hi> as is here related by St. <hi>Luke:</hi> And, as to its being elſewhere affirm'd of <hi>both;</hi> it's obſerv'd to be uſual with the Evangeliſts, and common in the Jewiſh Style, to aſcribe that to <hi>many,</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees only to <hi>one</hi> Nay, ſo far are ſome from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that he, who approv'd himſelf penitent, at firſt <hi>rail'd with the other,</hi> that they conceive he <hi>began his Repentance</hi> before: But, whenſoever it firſt began, whether in the Priſon, or upon the Croſs, conſidering the extraordinary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Caſe, it can give no juſt Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to the Sinner to put off this Work to the laſt. But as I may have Occaſion to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further to the Point, before I finiſh my Diſcourſe, I ſhall wave is for the preſent, and only ſay that from what Period ſoever we ſuppoſe the Repentance of this dying Malefactor to bear Date, it was doubtleſs <hi>genuine and true:</hi> And this what he here ſays to his Fellow-Sufferer, ſeems plainly to ſhew: <hi>He rebuked him, ſaying, Doſt not thou fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? and we indeed juſtly; for we receive the due Reward of our Deeds: But this Man hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs.</hi> And then we are told that <hi>he ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom.</hi> Theſe are the Words I am now to ſpeak to. And could I upon the Warning I have had, have redeemed ſo much Time from my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary Employments, as to have prepar'd a juſt and full Diſcourſe upon the Subject, I could not have had Time allow'd me for the Delivery of it. I muſt therefore content myſelf with a few Hints.</p>
            <p>And all, that I ſhall attempt at preſent, ſhall be as follows,

                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004599_0010_100DA9FA08624168"/>
                  <item>I. To <hi>conſider ſome great and weighty Truths, of which this dying Perſon was, and which we all may be in the firm Belief and Perſwaſion.</hi>

                  <item>II. To <hi>conſider the Prayer, which he put up; and which all ought to put up conſequent upon ſuch a belief, eſpecially if in the like Circumſtances</hi>:</item>
                  <item>III. To <hi>conſider the Manner in which he puts up this Prayer, and in which it becomes every one to do it in the like Time and Caſe</hi>; if he would hope for the Succeſs he met with:</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And then to make ſome ſuitable <hi>Application</hi> of the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Then, I am here to <hi>conſider ſome great and weighty Truths, in which this dying Perſon was, and which all may be in the firm Belief and Perſwaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt Place, He <hi>firmly believ'd, that, after his Death and Departure out of this World, he was to exiſt and live in another State.</hi> Otherwiſe, what would it have avail'd him, for his <hi>Lord to remember him when he came into his Kingdom?</hi> He had nothing to ask as to this World, being conſcious, that he was now taking his laſt Leave of it: So that he plainly asks for ſome Favour beyond it. From whence it is evident, that he was verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a <hi>future World.</hi> And who, that is in the Exerciſe of his Reaſon, and that does not turn away his Ear from liſtning to its Dictates, can poſſibly doubt of <hi>his future Exiſtence</hi>?</p>
            <p>When we look within ourſelves, and take a View of the <hi>noble Faculties</hi> we are furniſh'd with,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004599_0011_100DA9FCD7E7D7B0"/>
how can we forbear concluding, that in this Body there dwells a Soul or Spirit that is imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, and in its own Nature immortal?</p>
            <p>And then, if, from reflecting upon theſe Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we proceed to the Conſideration of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of human Life, ſhall we think it likely, that a Creature endued with ſuch Powers, capable of ſuch Improvements, and form'd with Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, after having continued here for a little Space, ſhould loſe his Exiſtence, and not lay it down for a Certainty, that <hi>he was deſign'd for another State</hi>?</p>
            <p>Nay, if it were only upon obſerving the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Diſtribution of Events to good and bad Men in this Life, how ſhould we be puzzled to reconcile it with the moral Perfections of God, without the Suppoſition of another life?</p>
            <p>But then we are not left to find out this Truth by the bare Light of Reaſon; but it is manifeſt from divine Revelation: And, if we look into the Scriptures, eſpecially of the New-Teſtament, we ſhall find not only the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> but the <hi>Reſurrection of the Body</hi> aſſerted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified to us.</p>
            <p>We may then be verily perſwaded, that after our Death and Departure out of this World, we are to exiſt and live in another State. Indeed the Belief of this great Truth is ſuch a Trouble and Diſturbance to a great many in their ſinful Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, that they would fain get rid of it, and may poſſibly ſo far root it out of their Minds, as to have hardly any Senſe and Apprehenſion of it in their proſperous Seaſons: But, in a <hi>Time of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>Hour of Death,</hi> the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004599_0012_100DA9FEC1A2D6A8"/>
of it ordinarily appear in their full Force: And they are fully convinc'd that they are not about to be turn'd out of Being, but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from one World to another, and to paſs from a State of Probation, to a State of Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And hence, by the Way, What a ſerious and awful Thing is it to die? I may appeal to the <hi>miſerable Object</hi> I have now before me, whether ſhe does not find it to be ſo? Yea, I may appeal to all of you, whether it would not appear to be ſo to you in the like Caſe? And whether it be not Matter of Surprize, even at an uncertain Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to think ſeriouſly of paſſing the dark Entry of Eternity, through which, as you go right or wrong, you are made, or undone for ever? To think of putting off this fleſhly Tabernacle; of your Spirits appearing ſeperately before your great LORD, and of being fix'd in an everlaſting State?</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the Conſideration of a <hi>ſecond</hi> great and weighty Truth of which the dying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſpoken of in the Text, was in the firm Belief, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That CHRIST, <hi>who was now leaving this World, was going to his Kingdom, and ſo would have Authority to diſpoſe of him after Death.</hi> And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we may be verily perſwaded, that he is actually gone into his Kingdom; that he is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Throne, and has the determining of our future State. <hi>Remember me,</hi> ſays his Thief upon the Croſs to his dying LORD, <hi>when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom</hi>; which plainly declares his Belief, that he was going into his Kingdom:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004599_0013_100DAA00E0BE7628"/>
And accordingly we find him telling his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after his Reſurrection, Mat. xxviii.18. That <hi>all Power was given him in Heaven and Earth.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as God, all Power was originally in him: In this Senſe <hi>his Kingdom</hi> and Dominion was <hi>from everlaſting to everlaſting:</hi> But the Kingdom, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Text, is that, which as GOD-Man, or Mediator, he is poſſeſs'd of; which he receiv'd partly in Recompence for what he had done and ſuffered in the Work of our Redemption. Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably we read, Philip. ii.9. That, <hi>becauſe he had humbled himſelf, therefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name: That at the Name of Jeſus,</hi> or as it may be read, <hi>in the Name of</hi> JESUS; that is, in the Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſovereign Power, <hi>every Knee ſhould bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may all then be verily perſwaded that he, whom the Text ſpeaks of as <hi>going,</hi> is <hi>gone into his Kingdom:</hi> That he <hi>is ſet down at the right Hand of the Throne of GOD:</hi> That <hi>the Government is upon his Shoulders</hi>: That all Perſons &amp; Things are put in Subjection to him; &amp; that he has a ſovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpoſe of us at his Pleaſure. It is he, that has the ordering of us, and of all Events that concern us, in this World: It is he alſo, that determines the Time and Manner of our going out of this World: And then, when we come into another, it is he that has the Diſpoſal of us: <hi>I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>am he that liveth, and was dead, and am alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and have the Keys of Hell,</hi> that is, of Hades, or the unſeen World, <hi>and of Death,</hi> Revel, i.18. It is he, that determines the State of our Souls, and diſpoſes of them in a State of Happineſs or Miſery, when they firſt leave the Body: It is he alſo, that will have the Deciſion of our Caſe, that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004599_0014_100DAA03021E01E8"/>
will pronounce us either <hi>bleſſed</hi> or <hi>curſed</hi>; that will ſentence us either to <hi>inherit a Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>to go away into everlaſting Puniſhment</hi> at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and final Judgment.</p>
            <p>And hence, by the Way, How worthy is he to be reverenc'd and obey'd? Of what Concernment it to us to yield an entire Subjection to him? And how ſtupid muſt we be to content ourſelves till we are in good Terms with him? He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the moſt proper Object of our Love, and ought to be incomparably amiable in our Eyes: But then there is alſo the utmoſt Reverence due to him: Shall we not ſtand in Awe of him, who has ſuch an abſolute Dominion over us, and be afraid of trampling upon his Laws, who has the Keys of Death and Hell, who has a Right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of us both here and hereafter, and is at the Head of all Principalities and Powers? Shall we refuſe that he ſhould reign over us, who is gone into the Heavens, and is at the <hi>right Hand of God, Angels, Authorities and Powers being made ſubject to him,</hi> as 1 Pet. iii.21.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We little know, ſays One, or can conceive as yet, the ſeveral Orders and Diſtinctions of the Celeſtial Inhabitants, and their great and illuſtrious Princes and Potentates, <hi>Thrones and Dominions,</hi> that all pay him a dutiful and joyful Subjection and Obedience <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>How's</hi> Redeemer's Dominion over the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World, Page 92.</note>:</q>
And ſhall we, poor weak and worthleſs Worms, diſpute his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and dare to rebel againſt him? What Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is there in ſuch a Caſe, <hi>leſt his Wrath be kindled
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004599_0015_100DAA04953C7278"/>
and we periſh by the Way</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, as he is a mighty ſo he is a merciful Prince: He invites and courts our Submiſſion; and will readily accept us upon Condition of it: And there is no other Way, whereby the Sinner can effectually provide for his own Safety. Oh, then that you would all immediately flee for Refuge to this powerful and compaſſionate Saviour; that you would entirely reſign and give up your ſelves to him, and not reſt ſatisfied till you have good Ground to hope that you have made him your Friend, and are comfortably aſſur'd of being kindly remember'd by him.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. General Head propos'd in ſpeaking to the Words, which was, To <hi>conſider of the Prayer the dying Perſon in the Text puts up, and which all which ought to put up conſequent upon the Belief</hi> of the foregoing Truths, <hi>eſpecially in the like Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</hi> Being verily perſwaded of his own future Exiſtence, and that the dying JESUS was about to be exalted at the right Hand of GOD, and to enter upon the full Poſſeſſion of his regal Power, and ſo would have the diſpoſing of him after Death, He makes this Requeſt, <hi>LORD, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me, when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me,</hi> that is, <hi>remember me for Good</hi>: Or <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me ſo as to ſhew Favour</hi> to me: He does not preſcribe to him, how far, and in what Degree he ſhould do it: But he dreads the Tho't of being utterly rejected, and begs that he might not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall ſhort of his Mercy. And, as he prayed to Chriſt as <hi>going,</hi> we are to pray to him as <hi>gone into his Kingdom</hi>; and as having <hi>all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him,</hi> that <hi>he would remember us for Good,</hi> and <hi>ſhew Favour to us in the other World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004599_0016_100DAA07015D9048"/>And further, to prove that this ought to be the Matter of our Prayer, I need only put you in Mind, what an ineſtimable Bleſſing it is, and how much it muſt needs be the Object of our Deſire. It is a Thing greatly to be deſir'd, that CHRIST in his Kingdom would think upon us for Good while we are in this World, and when we are departing out of it: That, as we are <hi>walking thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death,</hi> he would take a favourable Notice of us, and let no needful Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and Conſolations be wanting to us. But it is more eſpecially to be deſir'd, that we may have his kind Remembrance when we come into the other World; whether upon our immediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, or at the Reſurrection and final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is infinitely worthy of our Deſire, and ought therefore to be the Matter of our Prayer, that we may be <hi>thus remember'd by CHRIST in his Kingdom immediately upon our Death and Departure out of this World</hi> If he, who is the Lord of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and has the Keys of it in his keeping, be not merciful to us, what will become of us? If we are then excluded from his Favour and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what can we expect, but that our Souls, as ſoon as ever they quit their preſent Habitations, will fall as a Prey into the Hands of that roaring Lion, who has always greedily ſought to devour them? What, but that they will be carried away to ſome or other of thoſe helliſh Dens; where, beſides the Tortures we ſhall receive from thoſe mercileſs Spirits, to whoſe Company we ſhall now be perpetually confin'd, we ſhall undergo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more than we can at preſent conceive from our own awaken'd and enrag'd Conſcience, that biting Worm that ſhall never dy, and from
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004599_0017_100DAA09EC1F16F8"/>
the Wrath of an omnipotent GOD, that fierce and flaming <hi>Fire that will never be quench'd.</hi> But, if upon our leaving this World, our exalted and glorified LORD be pleas'd to think upon us for Good, and to diſpoſe of us in a State of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſome of thoſe Angels, that attend upon him, and pay their cheerful Subjection to him, ſhall have Charge concerning our departed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; who ſhall defend them from the helliſh Hoſts, that ſtand ready to devour them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them ſafe to the bliſsful Habitations provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them; where they ſhall obtain a compleat Reſt from Sin and Sorrow, where they ſhall be like to CHRIST, and ſee him as he is; where their Faculties ſhall be vaſtly improv'd; where they ſhall join the ſweet and agreable Society of Angels and perfected Spirits, and be perpetually exerciſed in the moſt noble Employments, till the Reſurrection and final Judgment. And ſo I come to ſay</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is a Thing infinitely worthy of our Deſire, that CHRIST, <hi>who is gone into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and will in that Day ſit upon the Throne of his Glory, may ſo remember us as to ſhew Mercy to us.</hi> We have full Aſſurance that there is ſuch a Day approaching: A Day, when our bleſſed LORD, who now ſits at the right Hand of GOD, ſhall <hi>come in his Glory, when he ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a Shout<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and the Trump of GOD:</hi> When <hi>all that are in their Graves ſhall hear his Voice and come forth,</hi> and when <hi>Quick and Dead ſhall appear</hi> before him. So that, in a Senſe, he may then be ſaid to <hi>remember us all,</hi> there being no one of the whole Race of <hi>Adam</hi> that ſhall eſcape his Notice and Regard. But the Thing ſo much to be deſir'd is, that <hi>he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004599_0018_100DAA0CDF24EA68"/>
us for Good, and ſo as to ſhew Mercy to us.</hi> Without this, what a miſerable State ſhall we be in? If we are of the Number of thoſe, to whom he ſhall ſay, <hi>I know you not,</hi> how diſmal will be the Sound? Oh! the hideous Shrieks and bitter Outcries, that will be heard at the pronouncing of that dreadful Sentence, <hi>Go ye curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire, prepar'd for the Devil and his Angels!</hi> Who can conceive the thouſandth Part of the Miſery and Torment that is included in it, and which thoſe forlorn Wretches, that fall under it, muſt forever endure? But, if our great LORD be then pleas'd to think upon us for Good, and we are rank'd among his Favourites and Friends, what can we deſire more to compleat our Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city? With what raviſhing Pleaſures ſhall our Minds then abound and overflow to behold our LORD placing us at his right Hand, and to hear him ſaying to us, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepar'd for you from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World</hi>? With what Songs of Joy and Victory ſhall we return with him to the City of the living GOD? And how faint, how imperfect, and inadequate are the moſt exalted Ideas, we are now able to form to ourſelves of the ineffable Delights we ſhall uninterruptedly partake of throughout eternal Ages? Thus you ſee how worthy it is of our Deſire, and conſequently how much it becomes us to make it our Prayer, <hi>that CHRIST would remember us now he is in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and during the Exerciſe of that royal Power, with which, as Mediator, he is inveſted: We are to pray, that he would <hi>remember us at Death,</hi> and that he would <hi>remember us at the Reſurrection</hi>; that he, who has the Deciſion of our Caſe, would <hi>ſhew us Mercy, and determine us to a State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi>: We are to be often making this Prayer
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004599_0019_100DAA0E7A5F38D8"/>
in the Time of our Life and Health: But it is eſpecially proper in the Time of our Death: And it very well becomes thoſe that die, as did the Malefactor ſpoken of in the Text. And ſo I come to the</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thing propos'd, which was, To <hi>conſider the Manner in which he puts up this Prayer, and in which it becomes every one to do it in the like Time and Caſe,</hi> if he would hope for the Succeſs he met with. That the Prayer of this dying Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor was <hi>prevalent and effectual,</hi> we may learn from the Verſe immediately following our Text. Having ſaid unto JESUS, <hi>LORD, remember me, when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom</hi>; we are told, that <hi>JESUS ſaid unto him, Verily I ſay unto thee, To Day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> And the Manner, in which he puts up this Prayer, and in which it becomes <hi>all</hi> in the like Time and Caſe, to put up the ſame, may be learn'd from the Text and the preceding Verſes.</p>
            <p>And here, I ſhall inſtance in a few Things, which deſerve to be more fully inſiſted on, than the Time will allow of at preſent. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perſon here ſpoken of, <hi>makes this Prayer in the Exerciſe of a ſtrong and active Faith;</hi> and ſo <hi>muſt every one in the like Caſe, that expects to be heard, accepted and bleſſed.</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> of this dying Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, is in ſome Meaſure evident from what has been already ſaid: And what is related in the Context is abundantly expreſſive of <hi>it</hi>: He profeſſes his Belief concerning JESUS, that <hi>he had done nothing amiſs</hi>; and conſequently that, in ſuffering as an Impoſter, he ſuffer'd wrongfully, that he was the very Perſon he profeſs'd himſelf
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004599_0020_100DAA109853B110"/>
to be, even <hi>a Prophet ſent from GOD</hi>: And then, being convinc'd that he was perfectly innocent, and had no Sin to ſuffer for of his own, he was doubtleſs perſwaded, that he ſuffered for the Sins of others: That <hi>he was cut off to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for Iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> and therefore truſted to the Merit of his Sacrifice: Thus he implicitly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges him as <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Prieſt</hi>; and expreſly owns him as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> &amp; ſubmits himſelf to him as ſuch: And all this he does at a Time, when he was in the very Depth of Diſgrace: Such was the Faith that he was in the Exerciſe of —And, with ſomething of the like Belief in CHRIST, of the like Reliance upon him, and entire Reſignation to him, does it become all in the like Circumſtances to make the foregoing Prayer, as they would hope for Succeſs.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The dying Perſon ſpoken of in the Text, puts up the Prayer here recorded, <hi>in the Exerciſe of a ſincere and fervent Love.</hi>—And ſo muſt <hi>every one</hi> in the like Caſe, if he expects the like graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anſwer that he met with. <hi>His Love to GOD and CHRIST is evident,</hi> in that he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear manifeſting his Diſlike of the Irreverence and Diſreſpect that were ſhewn to them by his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Sufferer: And his Love to his Neighbour is evident, from the Rebuke he adminiſters to him and the Concern he expreſſes for him: And, in the Exerciſe of the like Love to GOD and CHRIST, and the like charitable Diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, are we all, while living, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when dying, to put up this Requeſt, <hi>That CHRIST would remember us</hi> now <hi>he is in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> even with Minds free from all manner of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004599_0021_100DAA13EBAA7F50"/>
Ill-Will to thoſe, who, we conceive, have been injurious to us, or we can't expect to prevail.</p>
            <p>Again;</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was <hi>in the Exerciſe of a deep Repentance,</hi> that the condemn'd and dying Perſon here ſpoken of, makes this Prayer: And in the like penitent Frame muſt every one put up this Requeſt, if he hopes to ſucceed, as he did. He was fully appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive how unworthily he had behav'd towards GOD, and how ill he had deſerv'd at his Hands: <hi>Doſt not thou fear GOD,</hi> ſays he to his Fellow, <hi>ſeeing thou art in the ſame Condemnation; and we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed juſtly, for we receive the Reward of our Deeds.</hi> Yea he doubtleſs ſaw himſelf worthy not only of Death, but of Hell; was ſuitably affected with the Conſideration of it, and ſenſible that nothing but infinite Mercy could reſcue him from it. And in the ſame Manner ought all dying Perſons, eſpecially all dying Malefactors, to make this Prayer to their exalted LORD and Saviour, if they expect that it ſhould be prevalent and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, viz. That he would <hi>remember them</hi> now he is <hi>in his Kingdom:</hi> They muſt ſee their Sins, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing odious and offenſive to GOD, and as laying them open to his Vengeance: They muſt take Notice of the Hand of God in what has befallen them &amp; own that it is but the juſt Recompence of their Doings: Yea, they muſt be ſenſible that they have expoſed themſelves to greater Miſeries than have befallen them, or that can befall them, in this World, and that they might juſtly be <hi>puniſh'd with everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the LORD, and from the Glory of his Power</hi>: They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to caſt themſelves down at his Feet, and to place their only Hope in his free and ſovereign
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004599_0022_100DAA16915758A8"/>
Grace, <hi>looking for the Mercy of our LORD JESUS CHRIST unto eternal Life.</hi> And then, once more,</p>
            <p>It is <hi>with the utmoſt Fervency,</hi> that the dying Perſon, whom the Text ſpeaks of, makes this Prayer; and in the ſame Manner muſt every one put up this Requeſt to his LORD and Saviour, if he hopes for the Succeſs he met with. His Words, as One notes,
<q>carry an Air of Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in them: When he ſays, <hi>LORD, remember me</hi>; he as it were breathes out his very Soul in his Prayer. It is as if he had ſaid, <hi>LORD, do but remember me,</hi> and I have enough; <hi>I deſire no more; into thy Hands I commit my Caſe</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </note>.</q>
And thus does it become <hi>every one</hi> when he makes this Prayer in the like Caſe, if he would do it to any Purpoſe, to do it with the <hi>utmoſt Earneſtneſs and Fervour of Soul</hi>: He muſt pray with the <hi>Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> that the vaſt Importance of the Thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: He muſt <hi>plead</hi> with his great LORD, as one that is pleading <hi>for Life, even an immortal Life,</hi> and muſt <hi>ſtrive and agonize in his Prayer,</hi> as one that can't tell how to be denied.</p>
            <p>Thus I have as briefly as poſſible <hi>conſider'd ſome great Truths in which this dying Perſon was, and which all may be in the firm Belief and Perſwaſion;</hi> as alſo <hi>the Prayer which he put up, and all ought to put up in Conſequence of ſuch a Belief:</hi> And the <hi>Manner in which he put up this Prayer, and in which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns every one to do it,</hi> if he would hope for the like Succeſs that he had.</p>
            <p>All then, that remains, is to make ſome ſuitable <hi>Application</hi> of what has been ſaid: And here,</p>

With the tendereſt Bowels of Compaſſion, and the deepeſt Concern of Soul, I would apply myſelf to the <hi>poor Priſoner,</hi> whoſe miſerable Caſe has occaſion'd this vaſt and numerous Aſſembly: And in a few Words let me exhort you, that you would <hi>in a becoming Manner make the Prayer of the condemned and dying Perſon,</hi> that has been now put into your Mouth.</p>
            <p>You are, I truſt, verily perſwaded of that which you will moſt certainly find to be true, that, as you are leaving this, you are going into another World, and are to exiſt and live forever in a future State: I take it for granted, that you are alſo perſwaded that CHRIST, who is gone into his Kingdom, has Authority to diſpoſe of you; and that accordingly, being by and by, even within an Hour or two more, to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he will then determine your State; and you will be unalterably fix'd in a Condition of Happineſs or Miſery: And, believing this, how can you forbear breathing out this Requeſt, <hi>LORD, remember me, now thou art in thy Kingdom</hi>?</p>
            <p>It ought to be, and I truſt is, Matter of deep Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation to you, and the great Grief and Burden of your Soul, that you have liv'd ſo much in the <hi>Neglect of Prayer, and other religious Duties,</hi> in the Time paſt of your Life, whereby you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked GOD to leave you to a great many Sins, and particularly to the Sin, that has brought you to this ignominious Death. And, as you have rejected CHRIST in your proſperous Seaſons, when he has called you, you having one Time after another refuſed; you muſt acknowledge, that it would be juſt with him, to reject you,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004599_0024_100DAA19FB288800"/>
and turn a deaf Ear to your Cry now in the Time of your Calamity and Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>But yet don't abſolutely deſpond; but ſo far encourage yourſelf as to make your humble Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to him: And be ſure to do it in the Manner that has been now preſcribed.</p>
            <p>See to it, that you make this Prayer to CHRIST in the due <hi>Exerciſe of Faith</hi>; with an entire Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of yourſelf to him, and a firm and ſtedfaſt Reliance upon him. Again,</p>
            <p>Put up this Prayer in the <hi>Exerciſe of Love to</hi> GOD <hi>and CHRIST, and of univerſal Benevolence and Charity to Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do it alſo under a <hi>penitent Senſe of your Sins</hi>; ſorrowing that you have offended and diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a glorious and gracious GOD. Acknowlege the Equity of what has befallen you: That you are <hi>receiving the Reward of your Doings</hi>: Yea, that you are juſtly expoſed to greater and more amazing Miſeries. But yet have Recourſe to <hi>ſovereign Grace,</hi> and let your ſole Dependance be upon it.</p>
            <p>And then, Let this Prayer be put up to your glorified Lord and Saviour, with all <hi>poſſible Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and Ardour of Soul:</hi> Plead your Neceſſity of an Intereſt in him, and the inconceivable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery you muſt incur without it: Say,

               </q>
Plead alſo his infinite Compaſſion to poor periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners: Say to him,
<q>Was it not in Love to the Souls of Men that thou wer't pleas'd to

come down from Heaven, to be made Fleſh, and to dwell among us? Haſt thou not manifeſted an infinite Concern for their Salvation in thy Life and Death; and doſt thou not do the ſame ſince thy Reſurrection and Aſcenſion? Art thou not now <hi>touch'd with the feeling of our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> and affected with our Miſeries? LORD, <hi>pity me in this my Time of Need.</hi> LORD, <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, have Mercy upon me, and receive my Spirit.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And, if you look to him in the Manner you have been now directed to, you may hope to be heard and accepted of your gracious LORD, and that <hi>this Day,</hi> you ſhall <hi>be with him in Paradiſe.</hi>

            <p>It is, you are ſenſible, <hi>the firſt</hi> Inſtance of the Kind that has occur'd in the Province. And Oh! if it were the Will of GOD, that nothing of the like Nature might again happen among us!

            <p>And here, as to thoſe of you, that have been in a good Meaſure preſerv'd from falling into the like Sins, let me exhort you, when you look upon theſe Objects, to do it not with Contempt and Triumph as to them; nor yet with vain Glory as to yourſelves: But conſider, <hi>who it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you to differ,</hi> and admire and adore his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Grace.</p>
            <p>But are there not thoſe of you, who upon En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry may find that you have been too faulty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a like Account?</p>
            <p>It now ſeems that there has been <hi>one</hi> among us, thro' whoſe Means theſe Perſons have been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably detected, that is <hi>equally</hi> &amp; it may be much <hi>more heinouſly, guilty in the Sight of</hi> GOD: And, could I ſuppoſe the Perſon to be with in Hearing, I would ſay, <hi>Don't encourage yourſelf from your preſent Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> Be aſſur'd that, though you are as yet conceal'd from Men, both you and your Crime are known to GOD, and that, though to ſerve ſome wiſe and good Purpoſes, he may ſuffer you
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004599_0027_100D8380F7259978"/>
to eſcape for a while, you may be bro't to Shame and Miſery in this World: Repent therefore, make thy Peace with GOD, and walk very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly before him: Or elſe, if your Sin do not find you out in this World, you will be expos'd to very heavy and diſtinguiſhing Puniſhment in the other World.</p>
            <p>And, as to all ſuch of you as are indulging your ſelves in any unchaſt and filthy Practices; let me admoniſh you of the Folly of truſting to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy of your Sins. Conſider, that the GOD, to whoſe View they are expos'd, may before you are aware and in a Way you little think of, <hi>bring to Light thoſe hidden Things of Darkneſs:</hi> And you may be brought to Puniſhment on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them: Take Heed then, leſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens reveal your Iniquity, and the Earth riſe up againſt you: And be prevail'd with to betake your ſelves to the Exerciſe of a ſpeedy &amp; deep Repentance towards GOD, and to <hi>put away the Evil of your Doings from before his Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me alſo exhort all ſuch of you as allow yourſelves in the Neglect and Abuſe of GOD's Sabbaths; (which the condemn'd Perſon here preſent reflects upon with ſo much Regret) and in ſuch like Sins as make Way for others, and very often lead to Capital Crimes, to beware of perſiſting in them, <hi>leſt you alſo Mourn at the laſt,</hi> and ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>How have we hated Inſtruction, and our Souls deſpiſed Reproof?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word, Whatever are the Sins of Heart or Life you have any of you hitherto indulg'd, be perſwaded to give yourſelves no Reſt till you are effectually reclaim'd and turn'd from them to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004599_0028_100DAA219CFFA908"/>
GOD; that ſo you may the more confidently expect and pray to be <hi>remembred for Good, and to obtain Mercy from your great</hi> LORD, when you come into that other World, to which you muſt quickly and may ſuddenly remove.</p>
            <p>But here perhaps you may be ready to object,
<q>That there is no need of your making ſo much Haſte to leave your Sins and to return to GOD and your Duty, but that you may ſafely put it off to the Cloſe of your Days; that it will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to make this Prayer at the laſt:</q>
And may be apt to bring this Inſtance of the Thief upon the Croſs as an Evidence of it.</p>
            <p>But, if this Perſon's Converſion was begun during his Impriſonment, which as it has been hinted to you, is what ſome have conjectur'd, the Argument utterly fails, and there is no Force at all in it.</p>
            <p>But, ſuppoſing it to be otherwiſe, and that, to keep Men from abſolute Deſpair, there ſhould be this one inſtance in our Bible of one who at the laſt Hour was thus heard and accepted in his Prayer: Seeing this is the only one, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with very extraordinary Circumſtances, that Man can hardly be thought to be in his Wits, that ſhould take any great Encouragement from it. "It was done, ſays Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>

                  <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Works, Page 385.</note>, at the Time of CHRIST's Suffering; a Seaſon, wherein GOD, in that one Act of the Redempti- of his Son, expreſs'd the very utmoſt of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. and diſcover'd unto the World as it were in

one entire Sum, <hi>all the Riches and Treaſures of his Goodneſs:</hi> If therefore he was pleas'd at ſuch a Time to Work a Miracle of Mercy, what Ground can any have from hence to expect it in ordinary Caſes?"</p>
            <p>And beſides, It is probable, that this Perſon had never before enjoy'd, and therefore could not abuſe the Day and Means of Grace, and ſo could not incur the like Guilt that we do, in putting off our Repentance, who live under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And whoſoever is embolden'd from this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to defer it to the laſt, preſuming that he ſhall then <hi>find Mercy,</hi> (ſhould he have the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ask for it, which is too great an Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty for any one to depend upon) will moſt probably find himſelf deceiv'd.</p>
            <p>Let none then dare any longer to delay this great and neceſſary Work: But if you are yet in Bondage to any of your Luſts; let me entreat you, that you would not reſt ſatisfied until you are deliver'd from ſo baſe and dangerous a Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and have in good Earneſt ſubjected your ſelves to the Yoke and Government of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>In a Word, Let us all cordially embrace and obey his Goſpel, and labour more and more to conduct ourſelves as becomes his Diſciples: <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide every Weight, and the Sins that do moſt eaſily beſet us, let us run with Patience the Race ſet before us; looking unto JESUS, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith</hi>; and be continually aſpiring after a nearer Conformity to his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Example,</hi> that ſo, when we are taking Leave of this World, we may with the greater Confidence pray
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004599_0030_100DAA2664CE3DC0"/>
               <hi>that he would remember us when we come into the other World:</hi> And he will then be aſſuredly mindful of us at Death and the Reſurrection, and make us compleatly and inconceivably happy for ever and ever, AMEN and AMEN.</p>

The Way of publick Worſhip to which ſhe had been us'd, was the Way practic'd by the Churches in this Country: Accordingly ſhe went every <hi>Lords-Day</hi> to the Place of Worſhip, where ſhe had been formerly wont to attend.

She was indeed very willing to be inform'd, and diligently heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd to ſuch as would take the Pains to inſtruct her: She attended upon the <hi>Lord's-Days,</hi> at an Epiſcopalian Aſſembly, that being the only Way of publick Worſhip at which ſhe had ever been preſent; except it be that in which ſhe was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. But ſhe was privately viſited and aſſiſted not only by the Miniſter of that Society, but the Miniſters of the other Churches: And from the Pains that had been taken to make her duly <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of her miſerable and periſhing Eſtate by Reaſon of Sin, and of the Way to obtain Salvation by JESUS CHRIST</hi>; ſhe ſeem'd at length to have ſome ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Apprehenſions of them, and expreſs'd her <hi>Repentance for her other Sins, as well as that for which ſhe was condemn'd.</hi> She heard a Sermon at Church the Morning before her Execution. She walk'd to the Place accompanied by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> who read Prayers for her there. She was greatly <hi>affected with her Caſe</hi>: And, having ſpoken a few Words by Way of <hi>Warning to others,</hi> and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Fitch</hi> having <hi>commended them both to the Mercy of</hi> GOD <hi>in CHRIST,</hi> ſhe and the other were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, according to the Sentence that had been paſs'd upon them, and <hi>left us not without Hopes of their being delivered from the ſecond Death.</hi>

would to GOD, that the Impreſſions made upon them may abide, and have an happy Effect; that not only ſuch as ſaw, but that all ſuch as hear, may fear: That thoſe, who are in their younger Years would flee youthful Luſts: That all would be careful to ſhun the Sin, which has been the Occaſion of bringing theſe Perſons to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely End, and avoid every other evil Work: This is what GOD in his Providence calls you to: <hi>Hear then the Concluſion of the whole Matter: Fear</hi> GOD, <hi>and keep his Commandments: For this is the whole of Man: For</hi> GOD <hi>ſhall bring every Work into Judgment, with every ſecret Thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil.</hi>
