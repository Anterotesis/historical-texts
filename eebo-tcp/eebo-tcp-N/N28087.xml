            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>2 KINGS, ii. 12.</bibl>
                  <p>—MY FATHER, MY FATHER, THE CHARIOT OF ISRAEL, AND THE HORSEMEN THEREOF!—</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHEN the death of General WASHINGTON was announced, theſe ſignificant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive words were among the firſt that occurred to my thoughts. They are the words of the prophet Eliſha, on beholding Elijah tranſlated from earth to heaven!</p>
            <p>THE idea of the many diſtinguiſhed benefits, which this eminent ſervant of God and man had conferred on his country, ruſhed into his mind, and inſpired him with ſuch an affecting ſenſe of the unſpeakable loſs, ſuſtained in his departure, that, overwhelmed with grief and regret, he cried out, "My father, my father, the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof!"</p>
            <p>THE propriety of this apoſtrophe will be ſeen and felt by every one, who reflects, that warlike chariots, as well as horſemen, were in general uſe, both among
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037438_0003_100D42CB6F211428"/>
the Jews and Pagans of antiquity; and that on theſe they principally relied in the day of battle. In this ſhort, but comprehenſive ſentence, therefore, Eliſha not only recognizes in Elijah, the venerable, endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and provident qualities of a parent; but aſcribes to him all the influence and energy of a numerous hoſt; and bewails his exit as a misfortune, which reduced the kingdom to a weak and defenceleſs condition!</p>
            <p>PURSUANT to this interpretation of the text, I propoſe briefly to conſider, I. The ſingular favour which Heaven beſtows on a people, by raiſing up men of elevated genius and patriotiſm to take part in the conduct of public concerns: II. The deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calamity of being deprived of their abilities and labours, by death: and then, to improve the ſubject by pointing out the uſes to be made of ſuch afflictive bereavements.</p>
            <p>BY far the greater part of mankind, in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the earth, however diſpoſed, are, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, incapable of managing the affairs of ſtate. Engroſſed by the cares and purſuits which perſonal deſires and wants create, they have neither leiſure nor inclination to prepare themſelves for ſo important a truſt. For this purpoſe, a concurrence of circumſtances and properties, which can fall to the ſhare of but very few, are indiſpenſably requiſite. Beſide undeviating rectitude of intention, a capacious underſtanding, much ſtudy, accurate obſervation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive knowledge, inflexible firmneſs, and great
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037438_0004_100D42CE373583B0"/>
preſence of mind, are eſſential characteriſtics of a good magiſtrate, or leader. I need not remark, that perſons of this deſcription are rarely to be found, and therefore proportionably eſtimable.</p>
            <p>WITH ſuch men at the head of the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, a nation has little to fear, but from its own degeneracy. Like the ſun in the firmament, they are the centre and ſource of light; and, while they regulate the motions of the ſeveral parts of the ſyſtem, and confine the moſt excentric to their proper ſpheres, they ſhed a benign and ſalutary influence on the whole. Meanwhile, by their vigilant circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, they guard againſt the hoſtilities of foreign powers; and, in caſe of actual annoyance or invaſion, furniſh the beſt human means of indemnity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Under their adminiſtration, tumult and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſappear, and every thing conſpires the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of order, peace, and ſecurity.</p>
            <p>HAPPY the land, whoſe rulers are thus commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſent, not to tyrannize and oppreſs; but "for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well:" and peculiar are the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its inhabitants to Him, "by whom kings reign and princes decree juſtice," for his diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goodneſs!" "For promotion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth. But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and ſetteth up another."</p>
            <p>THIS, my brethren, has hitherto been our favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lot. Few nations can boaſt a more ample ſupply
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037438_0005_100D42D0DEC37918"/>
of illuſtrious ſtateſmen and warriors than America. We have now at our head, a man whoſe integrity and wiſdom demand our higheſt confidence and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem; and we can recount many in the legiſlative and judiciary branches of our government, in the military line, and even in private life, who are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to their country, and ornaments to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!—Still, however, we cannot but deeply feel and lament the loſs of one of the greateſt and beſt men, whom this, or any preceding century, has produced.</p>
            <p>I PROCEED, then, II. To conſider the deplorable calamity of being deprived of ſuch characters, by death.</p>
            <p>AMONG the ſevereſt judgments which the prophets, of old, denounced againſt the Jews, were the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: "Behold the Lord, the Lord of hoſts, doth take away from Judah, and Jeruſalem, the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient. And I will give children to be their princes, and babes ſhall rule over them. And the people ſhall be oppreſſed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child ſhall behave himſelf proudly againſt the ancient, and the baſe againſt the honorable."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah iii. 2, 4 5.</note> A more juſt and ſtriking deſcription of that anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to which the want of able politicians and ſkilful chiefs invariably expoſes a community, can hardly be conceived. Every people, in this ſituation, is more or leſs expoſed to theſe diſtreſſes. For although there may be others, capable of ſucceeding and doing
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037438_0006_100D42D269C19EF8"/>
honor to the ſtation of the deceaſed; yet it cannot be certain that the preference will be given to the moſt deſerving ſurvivor. It is poſſible, at leaſt, that ignorance, party zeal, or ſelf-opinionated obſtinacy may veſt with the authority thoſe who are totally unfit to govern: the conſequence of which would be, a change of meaſures, fatal to the dignity and happineſs of the nation!—But imagination muſt paint the long catalogue of evils which would inev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itably follow ſuch a miſtaken deciſion; for language is inadequate to the taſk!</p>
            <p>How great and portentous, then, is <hi>"our</hi> breach! Who can heal us?"</p>
            <p>THE father, the friend, and the deliverer of his country ſleeps in the ſilent tomb! And where is the man who will refuſe to pay a tribute of the ſincereſt reſpect to his memory; or to contemplate, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſembled gratitude, his multifarious labours of love for the land in which we dwell?</p>
            <p>HAVING previouſly ſignalized himſelf, both by his courage and conduct, <note n="*" place="bottom">THE reader will ſcarcely need to be reminded, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor here alludes to the gallant behaviour of General [then Col.] WASHINGTON, at Braddock's defeat, in 1755, and to the many other valiant achievements of his youth; too many to be enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in a ſingle diſcourſe.</note> he was early invited to the ſupreme command in the revolutionary war. During that long and arduous ſtruggle for liberty, he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the moſt perplexing difficulties, outbraved the moſt formidable oppoſition, and, with a degree of perſeverance and addreſs which aſtoniſhed the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037438_0007_100D42D4092DEE08"/>
world, finally compelled one of the greateſt powers in Europe to acknowledge the independence and ſovereignty of its colonies. Yet far from being ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his unexampled ſucceſs, or, like the haughty monarch of Babylon, aſcribing it to the might of his own arm, his language was uniformly the language of piety, gratitude, ſubmiſſion, and confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
            <p>AT the concluſion of the war, the army, who had fought and bled in the American cauſe, had claims, to a large amount, upon the public; nor was it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that theſe claims ſhould be immediately ſatisfied. Hence diſcontent and murmurs prevailed; and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to lay down their arms, till they were indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, was even contemplated. In this ſtate of things, had the commander in chief been actuated by thoſe ambitious views which have uſually governed the conduct of heroes, both ancient and modern, how eaſily might he have ſubjected to his own control, thoſe provinces, which he had been able to protect againſt foreign invaders! But he recoiled at the thought; and inſtead of availing himſelf of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited aſcendency he had gained, to diſtreſs his country, no ſooner was the object, for which an army had been raiſed, completed, than he perſuaded his troops peaceably to diſband, and wait with patience the reward of their toils; <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"AFTER the return of peace, the United States were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the diſagreeable neceſſity of diſmiſſing their brave troops, without paying them their ſtipulated wages. In this emergency, an attempt was made, by ſpirited and anonymous publications, to inflame the minds of the officers and ſoldiers, and induce them, previouſly to laying down their arms, to unite in redreſſing their own grievances.</p>
                  <p>"As ſoon as General WASHINGTON was informed of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe papers, he requeſted the general and field officers, with one officer from each company, and a proper repreſentation from the ſtaff of the army, to aſſemble on an early day. When they were convened, he addreſſed them in a pathetic and animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpeech, in which he pledged himſelf to exert all his abilities and influence in their favour; requeſted them to rely on the faith of their country, and conjured them, "as they valued their honor; as they reſpected the rights of humanity; as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the military and national character of America, to expreſs their utmoſt deteſtation of the man, who was attempting to open the floodgates of civil diſcord, and deluge their riſing empire with blood."</p>
                  <p>"THE patriotic exertions of their beloved General ſaved the ſtates from impending danger. The army was diſbanded, and returned peaceably to their reſpective places of abode." Vid. Miſs H. Adams's Hiſtory of New-England, page 478, 479.</p>

            <p>HE did not, however, ſo far ſeclude himſelf from ſociety, as to become indifferent to its welfare; nor was his fondneſs for the calm enjoyments of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py retreat, though great, ſufficient to prevent his hearing and obeying the call of his country, when her exigencies again demanded his attention and his talents. He readily ſtepped forth, and with other long-tried patriots, formed that excellent conſtitution, which is, at once, the pride and ſecurity of every

free-born American. When this conſtitution had received the ſanction of the different ſtates, and was to be brought into operation; and when all eyes were fixed upon him, as the firſt preſident, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme executive of the Union, diſclaiming the wiſh and expectation of reward, he aſſumed the reins of government, and exchanged the pleaſures of rural ſolitude, for the anxious cares and arduous duties of the moſt public and reſponſible office in the nation. When he had diſcharged the functions of this office, during the terms for which he was ſucceſſively cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, with a degree of rectitude and diſcernment, no leſs honorable to himſelf, than advantageous to his conſtituents, he felt at liberty to reviſit the peaceful ſhades of his retirement.<note n="†" place="bottom">"HAVING been twice choſen," ſays Gen.

            <p>THOUGH grown old in the ſervice of his country, and having a claim, on this account, to reſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the remainder of his days; yet the revered patriot, in the ſtyle of his accuſtomed magnanimity, conſented to fill the important, laborious, and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardous ſtation. His bare acceptance of this truſt has doubtleſs been attended with the moſt ſalutary effects. Known and venerated, as he was, in every part of the civilized world, who could queſtion the juſtice, and the ultimate ſucceſs of a cauſe, which ſo great and ſo good a man had voluntarily eſpouſed? That power, from which, at the eventful moment, we had moſt to apprehend, had witneſſed his military ſkill, and the unbounded affection and confidence, which the people at large cheriſhed towards him. When, therefore, its leaders beheld him entruſted with the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037438_0011_100D42DCC292E7B0"/>
conduct of our troops, and obſerved the promptitude and ſpirit with which our defenſive arrangements were made, is it not probable, to ſay no more, that this ſpectacle, ſo contrary to their avowed expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſentiments, <note n="*" place="bottom">SEE the diſpatches of our firſt envoys to France: in which it is more than intimated, that the French rulers believed the people of the United States detached from their government; and that ſo great a portion of our citizens were in their intereſts, that it would be dangerous, if not impracticable, for Congreſs to reſiſt or counteract their deſigns.</note> gave riſe to their ſubſequent policy in refraining from menaces and inſults, and taking a more pliable and pacific tone? Hence, we are authorized to believe, that, by his declared readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to come forward for the purpoſe, when occaſion ſhould require, he has contributed, even in retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to our ſafety and deliverance. As the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and watchman of the nation, his very attitude filled our foes with diſmay, and conſtrained them to relinquiſh, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at leaſt, to ſuſpend their hoſtile deſigns.</p>
            <p>SUCH, O Waſhington, greatly eſteemed in life, and univerſally lamented in death—Such were the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and uſefulneſs of thy character! To thy lateſt breath thou haſt promoted the proſperity and honor of the land which gave thee birth! With what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, then, may every true American exclaim, "My father, my father, the chariot of our Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof!" For no more, alas! ſhall we enjoy the benefit of thy wiſdom in council, or of thy proweſs in arms, except by the happy fruits they have produced, and the invigorating influence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037438_0012_100D42DEF397B7C8"/>
of their recollection! Adieu, therefore, venerable ſhade—Adieu, till the heavens be no more! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in the regions of immortality, that recompenſe of thy labours for the good of mankind, which earth could not confer! "Though dead, thou yet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;" and never, never may thy country ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forget thy diſtinguiſhed ſervices and virtues! Never may ſhe forfeit that independence and glory, which, under the direction of an indulgent provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, thou haſt procured for her; that providence, the ſuperintendency and bleſſing of which thou haſt conſtantly and devoutly recogniſed, as the origin of all thy brilliant achievements! May thy mantle fall upon many, and may a portion of thy ſpirit be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through all claſſes of thy ſurviving countrymen!</p>
            <p>I AM, now, to improve the ſubject by pointing out the proper uſes to be made of this afflictive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reavement.</p>
            <p>A CRISIS, when the abilities and exertions of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men were more neceſſary to the preſervation of her ſovereignty and peace, America has never ſeen. At this criſis, therefore, to be deprived of <hi>one,</hi> who has been ſo invariably, and ſo conſpicuouſly uſeful to us, is a manifeſt token of the divine diſpleaſure at our ſins, and calls loudly upon us to lie low in the duſt before that God, from whom we have revolted. Let us, then, lay it ſeriouſly to heart, and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively inquire, "wherefore it is that the Lord hath this controverſy with us?" A general reformation
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037438_0013_100D42E24769CBF0"/>
is, certainly, deſirable, expedient, and neceſſary.— Such a reformation, nevertheleſs, cannot be effected, but by the amendment of individuals; for, of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals the community is compoſed. Under this impreſſion, let each one critically examine the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing tenor of his deſires and purſuits, and compare it with the rule of his duty, in relation both to God and man. However contracted the ſphere, in which we move, it is in our power, either to counteract, or to advance the commonweal. Indeed, one or the other of theſe muſt be the perpetual reſult of all our actions. Taught, therefore, both by reaſon and ſcripture, that "as righteouſneſs exalteth a nation, ſo ſin is the reproach of any people," let us ſtudiouſly avoid tranſgreſſion, and "abſtain from the very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil." Firſt of all, let us cultivate the profoundeſt reverence for the authority of Jehovah; and under the influence of this corrective and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding principle, let us pay a conſtant and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious attention to all the intimations of his will. Not content with mere pretenſions to piety, moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, or patriotiſm, let us inveſtigate the nature and extent of theſe obligations, and from chriſtian mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, diſplay a cheerful and unreſerved conformity to them, in the whole ſeries of our deportment.</p>
            <p>I KNOW it has been alleged by ſome infidel writers, that the goſpel no where enjoins the love of our country. But this allegation I conceive to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. Does not every page of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment implicitly inculcate this duty? And does not
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037438_0014_100D42E3D38F9D38"/>
the uniform courſe of our Saviour's life intelligibly and powerfully recommend it? Who ever prayed more earneſtly for the welfare, or wept more ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the misfortunes of his country, than he? Did he diſcover no appropriate attachment to it, when he made its inhabitants the firſt offers of his religion; and when, in defiance of the moſt cruel perſecutions, and with the certain proſpect of the moſt ignomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious death, he perſiſted in his endeavours to promote their virtue and felicity?</p>
            <p>SHALL we, then, extol thoſe pagan worthies, who, though exiled from their native clime, continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, notwithſtanding, in their regard to its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and unwearied in their endeavours to increaſe its honor? Shall we repreſent them, as inſtructing all ſucceeding ages in the noble principles and offices of patriotiſm? And ſhall we, in the mean time, refuſe an equal, nay, a far ſuperior degree of the ſame honor to Jeſus of Nazareth? No, my brethren, for Jeſus of Nazareth was a perfect pattern of this, as well as of every other excellence. This, therefore, is incumbent upon us, not only as citizens, but as Chriſtians. We are eſpecially urged to it by the critical ſituation, into which we are thrown by the loſs we now deplore. Bereft of the counſel and guidance of him, who has been ſo long and ſo exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively viewed as our ſafeguard and defence, will not thoſe, who ſeek our hurt, be emboldened to redouble their arts and intrigues, to facilitate and haſten our ruin? And are we not furniſhed, by this apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037438_0015_100D42E65120D3A0"/>
with the ſtrongeſt arguments for union, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and public ſpirit among ourſelves?</p>
            <p>HAPPY for us, while the departure of our beloved Chief admoniſhes us of the <hi>importance,</hi> his example clearly teaches us the <hi>nature</hi> of the patriotic affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: thrice happy, if we be diſpoſed to walk in his ſteps! The ſyſtem of his politics was pacific, and yet dignified and conſiſtent. Perſeverance in ſuch a ſyſtem, alike independent of every foreign power, and of all foreign interference, is manifeſtly requiſite to ſave us from national degradation. Nor let any imagine, becauſe he is incapable of contributing, like him, to its adoption and prevalence, that, therefore, he has nothing to do in ſo good a cauſe. Every man has his influence in ſociety; and every man is bound to exert it, not by ſowing the ſeeds of diſſention and jealouſy; not by indulging party feelings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; not by obſtructing the meaſures of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or calumniating the characters of thoſe who adminiſter it. Theſe are the ebullitions of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ambition, which graſps at every place of honor and emolument, and would ſacrifice an empire at the ſhrine of pride and avarice! Such were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the temper, nor the practice of WASHINGTON. He was not eager for promotion; and when it was forced upon him by the united voice of the people, he was apparently induced to accept it, not ſo much by the impulſe of inclination, as by the dictates of conſcience. He was willing to ſerve his country in any ſtation, to which ſhe called him; and to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037438_0016_100D42E8A1264848"/>
honor be it remembered, the rank which he held at his death, was a voluntary deſcent from his former exaltation! It is equally incumbent upon us all, to aim rather at uſefulneſs, than diſtinction; and, ſatisfied with the poſt which nature and the public have aſſigned us, to diſcharge, with fidelity, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious duties it impoſes; and contribute, though it be but a ſingle mite, to the harmony, order, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the great whole. To this end, we are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly obliged, without conferring with ſelf, or ſelfiſh men, to make the general good the rule of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions and actions. Deaf to the importunities of clamorous ſeekers, (for ſuch are of all mankind the moſt unqualified to rule), we ſhould countenance none, either by our converſation, or our ſuffrages, but thoſe whom we believe, in our hearts, both ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and deſirous of rendering ſervice to the nation.</p>
            <p>WHEN, by theſe means, we have done our utmoſt to place integrity and talents in the adminiſtration, it is no leſs our duty to "ſtrengthen the hands, and encourage the hearts" of our rulers, not only by a perſonal ſubmiſſion to the laws; but by inducing others, as far as in us lies, to "lead quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lives in all godlineſs and honeſty."</p>
            <p>COULD theſe pure intentions, and this laudable conduct, univerſally prevail, peace at home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability abroad, would be our favoured lot! We might ſet every adverſary at defiance, and truſt in God, that, as thoſe illuſtrious names, who have hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto been our ſhield and protection, are numbered
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037438_0017_100D42EA9C83DDA0"/>
with the dead, others will be raiſed up in their ſtead, to defend our rights, and perpetuate our proſperity!</p>
            <p>ANOTHER thought, which the ſubject and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion jointly ſuggeſt, while it additionally enforces the preceding obligation, particularly invites us to "lay up in ſtore for ourſelves, a good foundation againſt the time to come."</p>
            <p>HAD wealth, had fame, had friends been ſufficient to "redeem from death," WASHINGTON had not died! But "there is no diſcharge in that war!" High and low, learned and ignorant, free and bond, muſt "lie down alike in the duſt: for the ſmall and the great are there!" Such being "the end of all the living," how vain and inſignificant, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are the poſſeſſions and acquiſitions of time; and how infinitely important is a ſeaſonable preparation for eternity! "Let not the wiſe man, then, glory in his wiſdom; neither let the mighty man glory in his might; let not the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth and knoweth the Lord!"</p>
            <p>OUR chief emulation ſhould be, to "obtain an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among all them that are ſanctified;" and ſince "we have no continuing city here, to ſeek one to come. For the world paſſeth away, and the luſt thereof; but he that doeth the will of God, abideth forever." Soon ſhall the fierce contentions of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and ſtates, and the buſtling rivalries of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, be ſuperſeded by the more awful war of elements, and conflagration of matter! But ſooner
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037438_0018_100D42EC9AC90A58"/>
ſtill ſhall a final period be put to all <hi>our</hi> ſublunary cares and purſuits! The king of terrors is not far from every one of us! "In ſuch an hour as we think not," we may be ſummoned into the inviſible ſtate, and called to a ſtrict and ſolemn account for "the deeds done in the body!"</p>
            <p>"SEEING then we look for ſuch things," and are appriſed of their ſpeedy and certain approach, by the dictates of reaſon, the declarations of ſcripture, and the awakening admonitions of providence, "what manner of perſons ought we to be, in all holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and godlineſs!" Can we cheriſh anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this kind, and yet preſume unduly to covet the pleaſures, the profits, or the honors of this lower creation? Can we conſent, for the ſake of theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and periſhable attainments, to forfeit the complacency and approbation of Heaven, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the community to which we belong? Let us rather reſolve, never to gain the leaſt gratification, or to receive any degree of applauſe, but as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of laudable deſigns and exertions; deſigns and exertions, at once, acceptable to God, and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to man.</p>
            <p>IF, in this way, we riſe into public eſtimation, let us improve our increaſed influence in the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs. But if, after all, it be our fate to remain in the humbler walks of life, let us not repine at the divine ordination; but exerciſe a pious reſignation and obedience to the will of our Maker, and ſtrive, even in the narrow circle by which we
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037438_0019_100D42EEC835F590"/>
are circumſcribed, to mitigate the ills, and enhance the enjoyments of humanity.—In any event, whether in affluence, or in poverty; whether "in good report, or in evil report," let us "ſerve God and our generation" faithfully; hold ourſelves in habitual readineſs for our laſt change, and "give all diligence to make our calling and election ſure. If we do theſe things, we ſhall never fall: for ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtered to us abundantly, into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt."</p>
