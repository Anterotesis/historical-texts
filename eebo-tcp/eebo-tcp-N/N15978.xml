            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>ISAIAH 1.19, 20.</bibl>
                  <p>IF YE BE WILLING AND OBEDIENT, YE SHALL EAT THE GOOD OF THE LAND: BUT IF YE REFUSE AND REBEL, YE SHALL BE DEVOURED WITH THE SWORD; FOR THE MOUTH OF THE LORD HATH SPOKEN IT.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHAT was ſpoken by the prophets to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people of God, is written for our uſe, that we, through the warnings of ſcripture, might be moved with fear; and, through the comforts of ſcripture, might have hope.</p>
            <p>OUR relation to God, as a people redeemed by his hand and preſerved by his care, as a people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying his oracles and profeſſing obedience to his laws, is ſo ſimilar to <hi>theirs,</hi> that we may juſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to ourſelves what was here ſpoken to them. I ſhall therefore conſider my text in accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our own caſe: and ſhall obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the land, in which we are placed, is a <hi>good</hi> land: and,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:020451_0004_0FAF0E9373BF73A8"/>II. That our <hi>enjoyment</hi> of the good of the land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on our <hi>obedience</hi> to God.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It may as truly be ſaid of <hi>us,</hi> as of ancient <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God has given us a <hi>good land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE lately thought it worth defending by our <hi>arms:</hi> it is ſtill worth ſecuring by our <hi>virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is an <hi>extenſive</hi> land. Few empires on the globe are ſo large, as the territory claimed by theſe ſtates. It will admit a vaſt increaſe of numbers; and probably diſtant generations will not find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtraitened for room.</p>
            <p>IT is a <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>fruitful</hi> land. As it lies in the midſt of the temperate regions, no part of it is afflicted with intolerable heat, or rendered uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable by eternal froſts and ſnows. With proper culture it yields us, not only the neceſſaries, but the delicacies of life, in ſuch plenty and variety, that we need to be but little indebted to foreign trade.</p>
            <p>GREATER <hi>induſtry</hi> may be neceſſary here, than in ſome other climes: but this is no unfavourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; for induſtry contributes to health, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, freedom and ſecurity.</p>
            <p>WITH regard to <hi>commerce,</hi> nature has given us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very advantage that can be wiſhed. We have an extenſive coaſt, convenient harbours, navigable bays and rivers, materials of all kinds for ſhipping, a rich and inexhauſtible fiſhery, and a variety of exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble produce, which may be exchanged for the riches of other climes. Late experience ſhews, that, we are in greater danger from the <hi>exceſs,</hi> than from the <hi>want</hi> of commerce. Moderate trade contributes to poliſh and enrich a people; but when it is carried beyond its proper limits, it produces contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, diſſipation, poverty and vice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:020451_0005_0FAF0E93AC350440"/>THIS is a <hi>healthful</hi> land. Thoſe direful peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which have ravaged other countries, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known here. A conſiderable proportion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple live to old age; fewer die in infancy than in moſt European nations: Our natural increaſe is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to double our numbers as often as once in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five years.</p>
            <p>IT is a land of <hi>liberty,</hi> and has been ſo, with little interruption, from the days of our fathers.</p>
            <p>THE royal charters firſt granted to the American colonies, particularly to thoſe of New-England, were of the moſt liberal kind, and fully agreeable to their views and wiſhes. No attempts hitherto made, to ſubvert our liberties, has been ſucceſsful. They will probably be preſerved, until the people themſelves, ſunk in vice and corruption, deſtroy them with their own hands. How near we are to this fatal period, Heaven knows!</p>
            <p>THE freedom of theſe colonies was firſt invaded by James II, who, with a deſign to eſtabliſh an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute monarchy, ſeized their charters, together with thoſe of the corporations in England. But by the revolution which took place on the acceſſion of the prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to the throne, the freedom both of Britain and America was reſtored and eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>THE late encroachments of the Britiſh court on our charter-rights awakened a juſt and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Though we were but an infant people, and our enemies were an ancient, rich and powerful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ventured to reſiſt their claims; and, by a ſeries of wonderful interpoſitions, our reſiſtance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated their deſigns and terminated in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our independence.</p>
            <p>WE are now under a government of <hi>our own</hi> fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020451_0006_0FAF0E9474ED2DD8"/>
and chuſing. There is perhaps ſcarcely another inſtance of the kind on earth. It is a privilege, which few nations ever enjoy, and which the ſame nation probably can never enjoy more than <hi>once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MANY of the governments, now ſubſiſting in the world, were eſtabliſhed by the conquering arms of a powerful invader; ſome were introduced by the uſurpation of princes; others have been fixed in conſequence of a civil war, in which one party pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing has by arms given law to the reſt. Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which owe their exiſtence to ſuch a birth, muſt, you know, in their very nature, be <hi>tyrannies.</hi> The <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution was ſettled in a more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner, by an explicit compact between the king, the hereditary nobles and the repreſentatives of the people; and it is undoubtedly more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to liberty, than moſt other forms of government in Europe. But the conſtitution of theſe ſtates, and particularly of <hi>this,</hi> was framed and ratified in a manner ſtill more liberal. It is not, in any ſenſe whatever, a compact between the rulers and the people; but it is a ſolemn, explicit agreement of the people among themſelves. It was conſtructed by a convention of wiſe men, whom the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſolely for that purpoſe, and who, at that time, could have no ſhare, and no appearance of a future ſhare in the government they were framing. It was then remitted to the people at large, and competent time allowed for their deliberate examination and diſcuſſion; and it was finally adopted and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in conſequence of their <hi>general</hi> approbation. So happily was it adjuſted to the views of the people, at a time when the ſpirit of liberty was at the height, that not a <hi>ſingle</hi> article was found in the <hi>whole,</hi> but
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020451_0007_0FAF0E9574C58D50"/>
what met the approbation of more than <hi>two thirds</hi> of the inhabitants aſſembled in the ſeveral towns to give their voices upon it. It is therefore, in the moſt abſolute ſenſe, THE CONSTISTUTION OF THE PEOPLE; and, in this view, it is more ſacred than any form of government in Europe. Being framed by the people, it never ought to be changed, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered without their <hi>general</hi> conſent <hi>fairly</hi> aſked, and <hi>freely</hi> given. There may undoubtedly be defects in it: nothing human is perfect: but ſtill it is <hi>our own;</hi> not impoſed, but <hi>choſen.</hi> And whatever imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions attend it, yet it is acknowledged, by all, to be formed on the higheſt principles, of liberty. The adminiſtration of it is committed to men appointed by, and from among <hi>ourſelves;</hi> to men who are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to return to <hi>private</hi> life; to men who are ſubject to the <hi>ſame laws</hi> and <hi>burthens,</hi> which they impoſe on their fellow citizens. The people have it in their power always to influence the meaſures of government by <hi>petition</hi> and <hi>inſtructions,</hi> and often to change their rulers by <hi>new elections.</hi> Nations, whoſe government is abſolute, may be under the ſad ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſubmitting to oppreſſion, or of repelling it <hi>by force. This</hi> is a dreadful alternative, and uſually terminates in the increaſe of the evil. We are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> ſuch neceſſity. Our government is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, that publick oppreſſions may be ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved without <hi>force,</hi> either by <hi>remonſtrances</hi> againſt the meaſures of rulers, or by a <hi>change</hi> of the rulers themſelves.</p>
            <p>YOU will aſk, 'What if our new-choſen rulers purſue the meaſures of the former?' In this caſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour will lead us to ſuſpect, that poſſibly <hi>they</hi> may judge better than <hi>we.</hi> If their meaſures meet with
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020451_0008_0FAF0E95F724FD38"/>
               <hi>general</hi> approbation, the <hi>few</hi> who are diſſatisfied muſt ſubmit, until, by ſpeaking and publiſhing their ſentiments, they can give general <hi>conviction.</hi> If we ſhould ever be ſo unhappy as to fall under <hi>ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of wicked rulers, we muſt cenſure our <hi>ill choice.</hi> We have ſtill wiſe and good men among us If the time ſhould come, when there is not a man to be found, who will execute judgment, and ſeek the truth, how will God pardon us for this! Nothing, but immediate reformation, can prevent the fatal conſequences of ſuch woful depravity. <hi>Theſe</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by a <hi>divine</hi> eſtabliſhment, and it is not in the power of <hi>human</hi> government to guard againſt them.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS it will be aſked, 'Is there no caſe in which a people may reſiſt government?' Yes, there is <hi>one</hi> ſuch caſe; and that is, when rulers <hi>uſurp</hi> a power <hi>oppreſſive</hi> to the people, and continue to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it by <hi>military force</hi> in contempt of every <hi>reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remonſtrance.</hi> In this caſe the <hi>body</hi> of the people have a <hi>natural</hi> right to unite their ſtrength for the reſtoration of <hi>their own conſtitutional</hi> government. And, for the ſame reaſon, if a <hi>part</hi> of the people at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by arms to controul or ſubvert the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the rulers, who are the <hi>guardians</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, have a right to call in the aid of the people to protect it. If the people may uſe force to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs an armed <hi>uſurpation</hi> of unconſtitutional autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, rulers may, on the ſame principle, uſe force to ſuppreſs an armed <hi>inſurrection</hi> againſt conſtitutional authority.</p>
            <p>CIVIL liberty is a very valuable bleſſing. It was the profeſſed object of the late dangerous war. It is ſecured to us, as far as ſucceſs in the proſecution of the war, wiſdom in the ſettlement of the peace, and

deliberation in framing our government, <hi>could</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it. Our own virtue and prudence, under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, muſt do the reſt.</p>
            <p>THIS is a land; not only of civil, but <hi>religious</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The enjoyment of goſpel-privileges was a grand motive with our anceſtors to enterpriſe on emigration to this diſtant world. They brought with them the ſacred ſcriptures, early formed church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for divine worſhip, diligently inſtructed their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the knowledge of religion, erected private ſchools for their education, and, as ſoon as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of the country would permit, they eſtabliſhed larger ſeminaries, in which youth might be trained up for publick employments, eſpecially for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, that this important office might not become uſeleſs and contemptible by falling into the hands of illiterate men. Care was taken to ſecure to the churches the privilege of chuſing their own teachers, and of worſhipping God according to the dictates of their own conſciences; a privilege which theſe churches now poſſeſs in the ampleſt manner, and which is happily confirmed by the civil government under which we are placed. In conſequence of the pious zeal of our fathers, we ſtill, through the divine goodneſs, enjoy the goſpel of the Redeemer, and the offers and means of eternal ſalvation. The word of God is diſpenſed, his ordinances adminiſtred, his ſabbaths continued, churches are maintained and religious worſhip preſerved in them, and, we have reaſon to hope, that the gracious influences of the divine ſpirit, are not wholly withdrawn, but are ſtill vouchſafed to render the goſpel ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>IS any thing now wanting to make this a <hi>good land?</hi> —Nothing but our own virtue and wiſdom in the improvement of theſe advantages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:020451_0010_0FAF0E99796CD9F8"/>THIS thought naturally introduces our other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,</p>
            <p n="2">II. That our <hi>enjoyment</hi> of the <hi>good</hi> of this land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on our <hi>obedience</hi> to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>External</hi> advantages, without wiſdom and virtue to apply them, will make neither a people, nor a perſon happy. A man, ſurrounded with all the means of wealth, will be indigent, if he knows not how to uſe them. One poſſeſſed of the ampleſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, without a capacity to enjoy it, will ſuffer all the miſeries of real poverty. The beſt natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of body will ſoon be ruined by exceſſive indulgence. So a people, bleſt with all imaginable circumſtances of national felicity, may be enſlaved, and even deſtroyed by their own vices and follies.</p>
            <p>There is a connection between virtue and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; between vice and wretchedneſs, in ſocial as well as private life. From the juſtice and goodneſs of the ſupreme Governour, we may naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he will protect and proſper a virtuous people, while he leaves corrupt and irreclaimable nations to ſuffer the fatal effects of their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs. This natural concluſion from the divine character is confirmed by the declarations of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the uſual courſe of providence. The threatning and the promiſe in our text are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and peremptory; and to give them the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſolemnity, it is added, <hi>The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT will be proper for us particularly to conſider, what thoſe virtues are, on which our national hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs principally depends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt thing that here meets our thoughts is <hi>internal peace</hi> and <hi>union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:020451_0011_0FAF0E9A934457B0"/>CAN a man be happy, whoſe breaſt is the ſeat of contending paſſions? Can a family proſper, who a members continually oppoſe and counteract each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Can the harveſts of your fields ſtand ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt a war of conflicting elements?—No more can a nation flouriſh, while it is diſtracted with inteſtine broils. 'Every kingdom divided againſt itſelf is bro't to deſolation.' A ſmall people united will be ſtrong and reſpectable: the largeſt community broken and disjointed becomes impotent and contemptible. It was our union in the late war, that gave us ſtrength to bear up againſt the power of a ſuperiour enemy. Had we been divided, we muſt have fallen. The union, which was neceſſary to an effectual defence, is ſtill neceſſary to our enjoying the good of the land.</p>
            <p>IT is not uncommon, that when the burthens ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from a long war preſs hard on a people, and the terrour of the invading enemy, which for a while animated and united them, is intirely remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they loſe their patriotick zeal, and fall into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous contentions. This is an event which our enemies predicted for us; which our friends fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned us of, and which, to our diſgrace, we now begin to realize.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER oppreſſions we ſuffer, or ſeem to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, our meaſures of redreſs muſt be only ſuch, as may conſiſt with our internal peace; for being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt ourſelves, we ſhall become an eaſy prey to foreign invaders; or rather, ſhall fall a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible prey to one another. Contentions, once begun, may proceed to, we know not what, dreadful lengths; and may terminate in, we know not what, direful events. While, with a watchful eye we guard againſt every <hi>real</hi> invaſion of our rights, we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020451_0012_0FAF0E9B382E5AD0"/>
muſt place a <hi>reaſonable</hi> confidence in our rulers, and ſtudy and purſue the things which contribute to peace, both in our ſmaller ſocieties, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity at large.</p>
            <p>A general diſtruſt is inconſiſtent with government and ſubverſive of all ſecurity. Confidence joined with circumſpection tends both to peace and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let not Ephraim envy Judah, nor Judah vex Ephraim, and their common adverſaries will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In order to our enjoying the good of the land, there muſt be mutual <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>benevolence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe</hi> are neceſſary to internal peace, and branches of the obedience recommended in the text. <hi>Seek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, plead for the widow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR firſt obligation to mankind is <hi>juſtice.</hi> This is rendering to all their dues, in oppoſition to every kind of fraud, oppreſſion and violence. The great law, which ought to govern our ſocial conduct, is <hi>to do to others, as we would, that they ſhould do to us; to owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</hi> This law, written in the heart, will prompt us to the <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi> exerciſe of equity, integrity and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is the want of <hi>this,</hi> that makes the <hi>coercion</hi> of <hi>human</hi> government ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the ſubſiſtence of ſociety. 'The law is made for the lawleſs.' Every man can eaſily judge of himſelf what is right, by aſking his own heart, what, in a ſimilar caſe, he would expect from another.</p>
            <p>OUR next obligation is <hi>goodneſs.</hi> The poor we have always with us: and there are times when their number is increaſed. The late war, as might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be expected, has made a conſiderable change of property. It has reduced many to abſolute po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020451_0013_0FAF0E9BF127F048"/>
and others to an incapacity of ſuſtaining any great ſhare of the common burthen without leaving their families to want. Government, at ſuch a time, ought to adjuſt their demands to the common abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and this, we hope, is their <hi>aim,</hi> for <hi>they</hi> bear a part of the burthen with others. But it ſhould be conſidered, that the <hi>general</hi> rules, by which the meaſures of government <hi>muſt</hi> be directed, will often operate with <hi>ſome inequality.</hi> This is an <hi>unavoidable</hi> imperfection of human ſociety. In ſuch caſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of charging government with cruelty, it would be proper for the more ſtrong to aſſiſt the weak. <hi>Bear ye one another's burthens,</hi> ſays the law of Chriſt. The law of reaſon ſays the ſame.</p>
            <p>NO community ought to leave her prudent and induſtrious members to ſtruggle in vain under an inſupportable load. By mutual ſuccour in times of diſtreſs we increaſe the common ſtrength. Recip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocal ſupport and protection is one end of ſociety. 'Two are better than one, for if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but wo to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up. And if one prevail againſt him, two ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, and a threefold cord is not quickly brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.'</p>
            <p>A community, in which an oppoſite ſpirit prevails, cannot be happy. Mutual fraud, injuſtice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion cauſe perpetual animoſities, and frequent litigations, diſcourage induſtry and enterprize, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy all confidence, and obſtruct every meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the common good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The happineſs of a people farther depends on <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>frugality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS, though a good laud, will not ſupport us in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020451_0014_0FAF0E9CB93A11F8"/>
idleneſs and profuſeneſs. If it would, it muſt ſoon ceaſe to be a good land. In a country, where every man could grow rich with little labour, almoſt every man would in fact be poor; for there being no ſpur to induſtry and few examples of it, the body of the people would ſink into idleneſs, luxury and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All the wealth, and all the power would be engroſſed by the provident and enterprizing few. The reſt would be ſlaves, or little ſuperiour.</p>
            <p>AT a time like this, when the expenſes, incurred by the late conteſt for independence, are lying as a burthen on the country, diligence in our callings, and prudence in our manner of living, are of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar importance. While the object of the war ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared precarious, we thought no ſacrifice too great to obtain it. Since we have obtained it, let us ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſome ſelf-denial, that we may ſecure it. Tho' our burthens are heavy, yet we may hope, that by thoſe ſmiles of heaven, which will always attend a virtuous people, we ſhall ſoon, in a way of prudence and induſtry, find relief: without <hi>theſe,</hi> miracles could not make us happy. Idleneſs and luxury brings on poverty; <hi>this</hi> multiplies the temptations to injuſtice; injuſtice breeds contention, and this makes confuſion and every evil work.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our enjoyment of the good of the land will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the <hi>regular adminiſtration</hi> of, and a <hi>peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubmiſſion</hi> to civil government.</p>
            <p>MANKIND cannot ſubſiſt without ſociety, nor ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety without government. If there was no way to controul the ſelfiſhneſs, check the paſſions and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train the vices of men, they would ſoon become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to each other. Government is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of the whole community againſt the vices
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020451_0015_0FAF0E9F30A191D8"/>
of each member. The deſign of it is not meerly to provide for general defence againſt <hi>foreign</hi> power, but to exerciſe a controul over every individual, to reſtrain him from wrong, and compel him to right, ſo far as the common ſafety requires. The beſt form of government will not make a people happy, without a <hi>juſt adminiſtration</hi> of it, and <hi>cheerful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to it; and both theſe very much depend on the virtue of the people. We muſt commit the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of our government to our wiſeſt and beſt men: not to thoſe, whom we would not dare to truſt in our private affairs; but to thoſe, whoſe known ability and integrity intitle them to our confidence; for 'he that is faithful in the leaſt, is faithful alſo in much; and he that is unjuſt in the leaſt, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt alſo in much.'</p>
            <p>WILL you think a man capable of being a <hi>patriot</hi> whom you ſee to be diſhoneſt, unfaithful, diſſolute, and profane? You may as well judge him a <hi>ſaint.</hi> As well may your <hi>charity</hi> ſend him to heaven, as your <hi>prudence</hi> prefer him to be a leader in the affairs of ſtate. We muſt alſo contribute our aid to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into effect the <hi>good</hi> laws of the ſtate, eſpecially thoſe which relate to virtue and morals. If we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover errours, we muſt endeavour to rectify them; but let us not, under pretence of redreſſing wrongs, deſtroy what is right; nor in our zeal to amend the ſtate, forget to amend ourſelves. The more virtue there is among the people, the more there will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong rulers, becauſe better men will be elected to power; and they, who are elected, will be more ſtrongly influenced to a right uſe of their power. If we indulge in ourſelves the faults that we condemn
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020451_0016_0FAF0EA07193B238"/>
in rulers; if, while we complain of publick oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or profuſeneſs, we are prodigal in our expenſes, or unjuſt to our neighbours, we are groſsly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. We ſhew, how government <hi>would</hi> be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, if it was committed to <hi>our</hi> hands.</p>
            <p>ZEALOUS for a good government, let us be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works, maintain them ourſelves, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them among others, and, as far as our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence extends, give efficacy to wholeſome laws, that they may be a terrour to evil doers and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to them who do well.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another thing neceſſary to our national happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is <hi>a diligent attendance on the inſtituted means of religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE goſpel inculcates thoſe virtues, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately conduce to publick felicity, ſuch as peace, juſtice, charity, induſtry and temperance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our attendance on its inſtitutions, which are deſigned for the promotion of theſe virtues, is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal mean of national proſperity. The obſervance of ſabbaths and of ſocial worſhip is, in this view, of vaſt importance to ſociety, and of ſtill higher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to each individual in regard to his future ſalvation. It much concerns us therefore as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of civil ſociety, and more as chriſtians, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the publick diſpenſation of God's word and ordinances, to attend on it ourſelves and encourage the attendance of others, and to be likeminded one toward another, that we may with one mind and one mouth glorify God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As we wiſh to tranſmit to our children the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of our land, we muſt train them up in ſuch a manner, that they may be <hi>capable</hi> of enjoying it.</p>
            <p>WE have generally profeſſed, that the happineſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020451_0017_0FAF0EA132E79DC0"/>
of <hi>poſterity,</hi> rather than our own, was our object in the late war. This was our <hi>language,</hi> 'The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent generation will ſuffer much in the conflict; but we cannot be reconciled to the proſpect of leaving our children ſlaves. <hi>We</hi> ſuffer to purchaſe freedom for <hi>them?</hi> The war has ended as ſucceſsfully as we wiſhed, and we have ſuffered no more than we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to exert. If the good of poſterity was our aim, let us not loſe ſight of it now. Let us educate them in knowledge and virtue, and teach them to be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obedient, that they may eat the good of the land. What benefit will all our labours and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the cauſe of <hi>liberty</hi> tranſmit to them, if we leave them to grow up ſlaves to their own luſts and to the evil manners of the world, and thus to bring down on themſelves the fatal judgments of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Deity?</p>
            <p>POLITICAL liberty depends on national virtue. Prevailing vice ſooner or later introduces national ſlavery. Under almoſt any form of government a virtuous people will be free and happy. But a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſunk in corruption muſt be wretched. Their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, however liberal in its principles, will be fevere in its adminiſtration, becauſe they can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt under no other. If we would convey to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the greateſt poſſible freedom, we muſt train them up in virtuous ſentiments and manners.</p>
            <p>HAVING illuſtrated the obſervations contained in the text, let us now ſeriouſly apply them.</p>
            <p>WE ſee what obligations we are under to God for his goodneſs to our nation; and how we may enjoy the continuance of his goodneſs.</p>
            <p>HE has placed us in a land of health, plenty, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goſpel light; defended us in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020451_0018_0FAF0EA1EFA26988"/>
of our privileges; proſpered us in a dangerous war; granted the ſweet return of peace; allowed us the independence which we ſought; ſettled us under a government of our own chuſing; given us abundance of health; made the ſeaſons peculiarly favourable for ſeveral years, and eſpecially in the year paſt, and ſmiled on all the labours of our hands.</p>
            <p>IT becomes us, under a thoughtful ſenſe of his great goodneſs, to praiſe and exalt his name, and to reſolve that our future conduct ſhall be correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with our preſent profeſſions of gratitude. 'They who offer praiſe glorify God, and to them who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their converſation aright, 'he will ſhew his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.'</p>
            <p>LET us, as becomes a people profeſſing their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God, deeply humble ourſelves for our ſins. One principal deſign of his goodneſs is, to lead us to repentance.</p>
            <p>LET the reſtoration of peace, after a bloody and diſtreſſing war, influence us to peace and union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ourſelves. How provoking, in the ſight of the God of peace, would be inteſtine diviſions and animoſities, after ſuch recent experience of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of war, and of the divine goodneſs in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance! Would he not be angry with us, till he had conſumed us?</p>
            <p>LET the bounty of our divine Benefactor, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying our various wants, excite us to do good to the needy. The beſt expreſſion of gratitude to God, is an imitation of his beneficence. We are to offer the ſacrifice of praiſe continually, and eſpecially to do good and communicate, for with ſuch ſacrifices he is beſt pleaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:020451_0019_0FAF0EA2E2D47548"/>LET us uſe the bounties of his providence with temperance and moderation. This is a moral duty at all times; it is a political duty at ſuch a time as this. As chriſtians we are required to be temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in all things, and with quietneſs to work the thing that is good, that we may eat our own bread, and have to give to thoſe who need. As members of ſociety we are now under additional obligations to induſtry and ſobriety, that we may relieve our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and our country from the peculiar burthens of the day, and may enjoy the good of the land.</p>
            <p>LET us remember our obligations to God for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to us his glorious goſpel, and pray for its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſucceſs, and for a divine power to accompany it in our own ſouls.</p>
            <p>LET us attend on the inſtituted worſhip of God, cultivate peace in the religious ſocieties of which we are members, and avoid all ſuch diviſions as tend to obſtruct the influence of the goſpel and to defeat the end for which churches are formed.</p>
            <p>LET us bring up our children in the knowledge, and inculcate on them the duties of religion, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and piouſly in the world, and thus to look for the bleſſed hope which the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſets before them.</p>
            <p>WORLDLY proſperity, however deſireable, is not an object of the firſt importance. We are ſoon to quit this mortal ſtate; let us be chiefly ſolicitous to ſecure a title to a better country.</p>
            <p>WE have here no continuing city. In a few days we ſhall make our final remove, and another ſet of mortals will ſucceed in our places. Every year makes conſiderable changes; a few years produce vaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020451_0020_0FAF0EA5D9CD0E88"/>
in the inhabitants of this dying world. Though the paſt year has been generally healthful, yet the number of deaths in this ſociety has been greater than uſual.</p>
            <p>GOD's providence utters a warning voice to people of every age.</p>
            <p>CHILDREN and youths are ſolemnly warned of their mortality, and urged to give an immediate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to their everlaſting concerns. Let this day, be with you, my children, not a day of thoughtleſs levity, wanton mirth and wild diſſipation; but a day of ſerious recollection, fervent prayer, and humble dedication of yourſelves to God. While you praiſe him for his goodneſs in preſerving you another year, repent of the ſins and follies of the year paſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate your ſpared lives to his ſervice and enter on a ſpeedy preparation for the changes, that may await you in the year to come.</p>
            <p>HEADS of families, and perſons in the midſt of life, are taught the uncertainty of their continuance here. While the death of a neighbour and friend awakens in our minds a grateful remembrance of God's ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to us and our families, let it alſo impreſs us with a ſenſe of the changes to which we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and excite a ſerious concern to maintain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in our hearts, and promote it in our houſes.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>aged</hi> have been repeatedly warned. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, a greater number of your cotemporaries have been removed in the year paſt, than has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in preceding years. God's voice to you is, <hi>Be ye alſo ready.</hi> You ſtand on the borders of the eternal world. Soon you muſt go the way, whence you will not return. Within the enſuing year, it is probable, ſome of your ſmall number will make
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020451_0021_0FAF0EA6F00EBC00"/>
their laſt remove. You ought to examine your ſtate, to be inſtant in prayer, to live in the daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of faith and piety, and by a holy and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs example recommend religion to thoſe who are coming after you. May you, and may we all, when the time of our departure is come, be able to rejoice in the reflection, that we have finiſhed our courſe well, and in the hope that there is laid up for us a crown of righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>THIS, though on many accounts a day of rejoice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is, in other reſpects, a day of danger and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>THE general indifference to the inſtituted ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the goſpel, threatens the diſcontinuance of them; the prevalence of wickedneſs forbodes divine judgments; and our civil commotions and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances give cauſe to apprehend a troublous ſcene approaching. Should they ſpread and prevail ſo far as to involve the ſtate in a civil war, what have we to expect as the conſequences, but general poverty, bondage and wretchedneſs?</p>
            <p>THAT the people are under great burthens, all are agreed. Whether there are <hi>grievances,</hi> I leave with others to determine. Admitting there are, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly there may be methods of redreſs more ſafe, and more effectual than <hi>arms.</hi> If any of you have thought this a neceſſary meaſure, I only aſk, that you would calmly review what I have ſaid on the nature of our government, and ſeriouſly conſider what may be the conſequences of drawing the ſword; and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly you will ſee reaſon to alter your ſentiments.</p>
            <p>I have ſpoken with freedom, becauſe I am anxious for my country; and without fear of offending, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know the candour of my audience.</p>
