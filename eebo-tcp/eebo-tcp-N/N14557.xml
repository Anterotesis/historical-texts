            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>BRIEF OBSERVATIONS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is propoſed in theſe few pages—to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, as late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaimed in this city—to conſider the principal arguments by which it is attempted to be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—to mention ſome paſſages of ſcripture which are inconſiſtent with it—and to point out ſome of the conſequences which will follow from it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The doctrine is, that all mankind, without exception but none of the devils, will be ſaved; that this univerſal ſalvation will take place imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the general judgment, ſo that after that time, there will be no puniſhment of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of the human race; that this deliverance from future puniſhment is obtained in the way of the moſt ſtrict juſtice; that Chriſt having paid the whole debt, for all mankind, it is not conſiſtent with juſtice, that any man ſhould be puniſhed for ſin, in his own perſon; that the ſinners of the old world however, were kept in hell from the flood till the crucifixion of Chriſt, and that during the three days, that Chriſt's body lay in the Grave,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018455_0003_0FA76EBF404050D8"/>
his ſpirit went and preached the goſpel to them, and delivered them from further puniſhment; that <hi>perhaps</hi> thoſe who die in impenitence and and unbelief, may, till the final judgment, be in the ſame ſtate, in which the ſinners of the old world were, before the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am to conſider the principal arguments by which this ſyſtem is attempted to be ſupported.</p>
            <p>It is argued partly, from the divine goodneſs and compaſſion, but chiefly from ſeveral paſſages of ſcripture. The arguments from divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, equally prove that all <hi>devils,</hi> as that all <hi>men,</hi> will be ſaved. If a God of infinite goodneſs and compaſſion cannot inflict endleſs puniſhment on a fallen <hi>man,</hi> how can he inflict the ſame on a fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en <hi>angel</hi>? True goodneſs and compaſſion do not act with partial biaſſes and attachments, but ſee the happineſs of every intelligent being, whoſe happineſs is conſiſtent with the good of the ſyſtem. To ſay, there is no atonement made for the fallen <hi>angels,</hi> gives no ſatisfaction. For why did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs provide an atonement for them, as well as for mankind? If it be ſaid, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of devils is not inconſiſtent with goodneſs, becauſe it is not oppoſed to the good of the ſyſtem in general, but neceſſary to it: I anſwer, in the ſame way the eternal perdition of ungodly men, may be reconciled with goodneſs.—The argument from the divine goodneſs is alſo wholly inconſiſtent with the well known diſpenſations of providence towards mankind in this world. The argument
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018455_0004_0FA76EC1F4455CE8"/>
hath been ſtated thus;
<q>Can you, an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate parent, take your own child, and caſt it into a glowing oven?—No—But hath not God as much goodneſs and tenderneſs as you? How then can you ſuppoſe, that he will caſt any of his children, into the lake of fire and brimſtone, and confine them there forever.</q>
—On this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it equally militates againſt the eternal puniſhment of any of the fallen angels, as any of fallen men: for they are the children of God by creation, as truly as men. It is however true, that though we cannot bear to caſt our children into glowing ovens, yet God can and does, firſt neglect the means neceſſary for the ſalvation of ſome of his children, and then caſt them into the the of fire and brimſtone.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it alſo proves, (ſo far as it proves any thing) that God cannot afflict and deſtroy mankind, as we all know he does, in this world. Permit me in my turn, to uſe this argument:—
<q>Can you an affectionate parent, throw down your child from eminences, ſo as to brake his bones, mangle his fleſh, and diſlocate his neck? Or can you plunge him into a raging ſea, and leave him to the mercy of the waves? Can you caſt him to be devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by lions or tygers? Can you voluntarily bring on him the tortures of convulſions, of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or of the ſtone? Can you ſet your houſe on fire, and in it conſume your wife, your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and whole family together?—I know, you
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018455_0005_0FA76EC3F16BA838"/>
cannot think of doing any of theſe. But hath not God as much goodneſs and tenderneſs as you? How then can you ſuppoſe that he will ever treat any of his children in this manner?</q>
—Yet in fact he doth all thoſe things to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: The inſtances are very common.—This ſhows the abſurdity of all ſuch arguments, as that ſtated above; which however are the moſt popular, and with many, the moſt convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments employed to prove univerſal ſalvation. It is mere trifling to argue againſt future puniſhment, on principles which cannot be reconciled with God's common providence: and to aſſert boldly that God cannot do what we all ſee and know, that he in fact doth.</p>
            <p>The principal texts of ſcripture, produced in ſupport of this doctrine, are theſe which follow.</p>
            <p>I. Cor. 15.22.
<q>As in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</q>
From theſe words it is argued, that as all mankind died in Adam, ſo all mankind will live eternally in and through Chriſt.—In this chapter, the Apoſtle is diſcourſing of the reſurrection of Chriſt's people, the whole body of his followers, Verſe 23.
<q>But every man in his own order, Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterward <hi>they that are Chriſt's,</hi> at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</q>
Theſe words immediately follow thoſe now under conſideration, and plainly ſhew the ſenſe of the Apoſtle in the 22d. verſe to be, that all <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> all his <hi>diſciples,</hi> or his <hi>followers</hi> ſhall be made alive in him. But who thoſe are whom the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018455_0006_0FA76EC544755798"/>
Apoſtle calls <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> or his <hi>people,</hi> his <hi>followers,</hi> is not determined in this text. It is however abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly determined by the whole New Teſtament, that they are the <hi>penitent</hi> and <hi>believing,</hi> and they only. As all who were in Adam, or were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by him, died in him; ſo all who are in Chriſt, or are repreſented by him, ſhall live in him. But it is denied, that all men are in Chriſt, and are repreſented by him, as their ſpiritual head, nor is this aſſerted in this text. The whole that is aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it is, that all who are in Chriſt, ſhall live by him, as all who were in Adam, died in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his Fall.</p>
            <p>But in aid of the conſtruction of the text afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, which I oppoſe, it is ſaid, "that the head of every man is Chriſt;" which is ſuppoſed to mean, that every man is in Chriſt, and is repreſented by him. The words are in I. Cor. 11.3. "The head of every man is Chriſt, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Chriſt is God." I grant that, as in the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the character and office of God the father is ſuperior to the Son; and as in the family oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the huſband is ſuperior to his wife in honour and authority: ſo Chriſt is exalted in authority and dominion over all mankind. In this ſenſe too, he is the head of the devils, as he is "made head over all things to the church," and "all things are put under his feet, he only excepted, who put all things under him." But that he is ſo the head of all men, that all will be ſaved by him, does not appear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:018455_0007_0FA76EC60DB00358"/>But it is pleaded, that "Chriſt died for all;" that he is "the Saviour of all men;"—that he is "the Saviour of the world,"—"and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the ſins of the whole world"—"that he gave himſelf a ranſom for all"—"and that he taſted death for every man."—Doubtleſs theſe expreſſions are ſtrictly true, as Chriſt has made an atonement, or laid a foundetion in his death and ſufferings, for the ſalvation of all mankind: ſo that ſalvation is offered to all:—ALL without exception are invited to accept it. But what if ſome obſtinately refuſe to accept it?—Will they ſtill inherit this ſalvation?—This is not aſſerted in any one of thoſe texts now referred to: Yet it ſhould be aſſerted, to make them at all to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of univerſal ſalvation. All that is aſſerted, is, that Chriſt has made atonement or proviſion for the ſalvation of all men. But this no more proves that all men will in fact be ſaved, than if a prince ſhould make a feaſt ſufficient to entertain all the inhabitants of a city, this proves, that all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants will actually partake of the feaſt. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this proviſion, a great part may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to comply with the royal invitation, and thus exclude themſelves—Yet it is true that there was a feaſt made for all.—In like manner the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made by Chriſt is abundantly ſufficient for all; yet ſome exclude themſelves by their unbelief.— In this ſenſe Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſom for all, and taſted death for every man: and this ſenſe of theſe paſſages is plainly given by the ſcripture it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018455_0008_0FA76EC6C9E130A8"/>
particularly in John iii. 16. "God ſo loved <hi>the world,</hi> that he gave his only begotten Son," not that all mankind might be ſaved by him, but "that <hi>whoever believeth in him,</hi> ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life."</p>
            <p>It is further pleaded, that God "will have all men to be ſaved,"—that he hath "no pleaſure in the death of the wicked,"—and that he is "not willing that any ſhould periſh." The death or perdition of the wicked is not in itſelf a deſirable object; in this view God doth not, nor can take pleaſure in it: he cannot delight in the puniſhment and deſtruction of his creatures ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered. Yet he may inflict on them pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and deſtruction, when they are neceſſary to vindicate his character, to ſupport his law, to reſtrain others from ſin, and to promote the good of the whole.—The texts now under conſideration are to be taken in the ſame ſenſe with Lam. iii. 33. "He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men." And Hoſ. xi. 8. "How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? How ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael? How ſhall I make thee as Admah? How ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me; my repentings are kindled together." —A moſt benevolent parent may find it neceſſary to chaſtiſe, and even to diſinherit a child. Yet he never does it, as we ſay, <hi>of choice</hi>; but with great reluctance. It is true, all things conſidered, he may chooſe to do it. Still, in itſelf, it is very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and painful to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:018455_0009_0FA76EC7818D8D70"/>Jer. xxxi. 34. "They ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them, to the greateſt of them," hath been introduced as an argument of univerſal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, becauſe, <hi>to know God is life eternal.</hi> But thoſe words of Jeremiah refer not to the ſtate of things after the general judgment, but to the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenial ſtate, and are equivalent to Iſai. xi. 9. "For the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea;" and to Hab. ii. 14.—But it is not pretended, that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation will be effected on <hi>this earth,</hi> or before the general judgment, which is to be in the air, not on this globe. It is granted that in the general reſurrection, ſome will come forth to the reſurrection of damnation. Therefore univerſal ſalvation will not take place before that period.</p>
            <p>A further argument hath been drawn from Rev. v. 13. "Every creature which is in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I, ſaying, bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and honour," &amp;c. It is ſaid that theſe words ſhow, that all men will finally unite in hymns of praiſe to God and the Lamb and therefore will be ſaved. But this text ſays nothing particularly of <hi>all men:</hi> it ſpeaks of <hi>all creature</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rational and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, animate and inanimate, and repreſents them as joining with the angels, the four beaſts, and elders, in a hymn of praiſe, and is an inſtance of the figure called <hi>proſopopaeia,</hi> ſimilar to that in Pſal. xix. 1. and in Pſal. cxlviii. 1—11. It is therefore nothing to the purpoſe of the ſalvation
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018455_0010_0FA76EC85D1EC9C8"/>
of all men.—Beſides; this text as much implies the ſalvation of all devils, as of all men, and ſo if it prove any thing, proves too much for thoſe by whom it is quoted in the preſent queſtion.</p>
            <p>Phil. ii. 10. "That at the name of Jeſus, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord," &amp;c. Is ſuppoſed to imply the ſalvation of all men. But this is a mere declaration of Chriſt's exaltation, and of the ſubjection of all things to him, and is tantamount to thoſe texts before quoted, which declare, that he is made head over all things to the church; and that all things are put under his feet. But theſe paſſages do not imply, that all men will <hi>voluntarily</hi> ſubmit to him. See alſo Rom. xiv.9—13.</p>
            <p>From "the reſtitution of all things," mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Acts iii. 21. it hath been argued, that all men will be reſtored to the favour of God. On this I obſerve,</p>
            <p>That theſe words might well have been render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, The <hi>completion</hi> or <hi>comſummation</hi> of all things, and are ſo rendered and interpreted by ſome of the beſt commentators.—If they be taken ſtrictly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſent tranſlation, they will prove that all devils are to be reſtored to the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as well as <hi>all men.</hi> Therefore they prove too much for thoſe with whom I am at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.—But the original puts this text entirely out of the preſent queſtion. Without inſiſting on a different rendering of the word tranſlated <hi>reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:018455_0011_0FA76EC9028176D8"/>
the ſenſe according to the original is this<note n="*" place="bottom">Pantoon oon elaleeſen.</note>; the times of the reſtitution of <hi>all thoſe things which</hi> God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his prophets. So that if the reſtoration of all men be a doctrine taught by the prophets, this text declares, that the time will come, when ſuch a reſtoration will be effected. Otherwiſe it ſays nothing concerning it. —This text is ſometimes introduced in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; "The reſtitution of all things is declared by all the prophets from the foundation of the world:" Which is a perverſion of the text, and ſhows either great diſhoneſty, or great inattention to the original.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principal ſcriptures on which the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, as lately publiſhed among us, is ſuppoſed to be founded, and whether they be a ſufficient foundation, I now appeal to every candid man, who is but tolerably acquainted with the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I am to mention ſome paſſages of ſcripture which appear to be irreconcileable with the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all men.</p>
            <p>Matt. xxv. 31—46. eſpecially v. 41. "Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." It is pretended that the goats on the left hand, in this paſſage, are the devils; that the ſheep on the right, are all mankind, and that the devils are condemned to everlaſting fire, becauſe they reſtrained men from acts of charity.—Why then is it not ſaid, Depart,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018455_0012_0FA76EC9C92CE850"/>
ye curſed, &amp;c. not becauſe I was an hungred, and <hi>ye gave</hi> me no meat; but becauſe I was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred and ye <hi>reſtrained others</hi> from giving me meat? —And why was it not ſaid, Depart, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire prepared for <hi>you?</hi> not, for <hi>the devil and his angels,</hi> implying, that they were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons from thoſe to whom the Judge was ſpeaking.—But the 32d. v. puts this matter out of all diſpute, "Before him ſhall be gathered <hi>all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>; and he ſhall ſeparate <hi>them</hi> one from another, as a ſhepherd divideth his ſheep from the goats." What is the antecedent of <hi>them?</hi> not ſurely the devils, for they are not mentioned in the context. It is the <hi>nations</hi>; and to ſay that <hi>them</hi> refers to any other antecedent, is a violation of all the rules of grammatical conſtruction.—But to ſuch ſhifts as theſe, the advocates for univerſal ſalvation are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, to reconcile their doctrine with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! Surely that doctrine muſt be very foreign from the ſcriptures, which can be no better recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with them, than univerſal ſalvation can with this paſſage in the 25th of Matthew.</p>
            <p>Rev. xiv. 11. "And the ſmoke of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſcendeth up forever and ever: and they have no reſt day nor night, who worſhip the beaſt and his image."—If <hi>the beaſt</hi> mean what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtood by it, Rome heathen and papal, the worſhippers are not merely the devils, but ſome men are comprehended in the number.—If <hi>the beaſt</hi> mean the devil himſelf, ſtill ſome <hi>men</hi> are comprehended in the number of <hi>his</hi> worſhippers.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018455_0013_0FA76ECC67918FF8"/>
See I. Cor. x. 20. Thus on every ſuppoſition, this text declares that ſome <hi>men</hi> will be tormented for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Iſai. lxvi. 24. "They ſhall go forth and look upon the <hi>carcaſes</hi> of the <hi>men,</hi> that have tranſgreſſed againſt me; for their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched."—Theſe were not <hi>devils</hi>; they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly called <hi>men,</hi> and were cloathed with <hi>carcaſes,</hi> or <hi>bodies,</hi> which is not true of the <hi>devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Phil. iii. 18, 19. "The enemies of the croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their <hi>belly.</hi>"—The <hi>end</hi> or <hi>laſt ſtate</hi> of theſe perſons is <hi>deſtruction,</hi> not <hi>ſalvation</hi>; and they cannot be the devils, becauſe <hi>they</hi> have <hi>no bellies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Theſſ. i. 8, 9. "In flaming fire, taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance on them that know not God, and <hi>that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who</hi> ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction."—The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, however they are obliged to obey the law, are not obliged to obey the goſpel and to believe in Chriſt. Therefore this paſſage means <hi>men</hi> and not <hi>devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Cor. xi. 15. "Whoſe end ſhall be according to their works."—The perſons ſpoken of are <hi>falſe-apoſtles, evil-workers,</hi> v. 13. and in v. 22. are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be <hi>Hebrews, Iſraelites, the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> Therefore they could not be <hi>devils.</hi> But their end is ſaid to be according to their works, as falſe-apoſtles and evil-workers; which end muſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be an <hi>evil</hi> one, not the good end of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>II. Pet. iii. 7. "The heavens and the earth —are—reſerved unto fire—and <hi>perdition</hi> of ungodly <hi>men.</hi>"—<hi>Men</hi> not <hi>devils.</hi>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:018455_0014_0FA76ECCE0E27118"/>Luke xvi. 22, 23. "The <hi>rich man</hi>—in hell— lift up his eyes being in torments."—This was a <hi>rich man,</hi> not a <hi>rich devil</hi>; v. 19. Anthropos; and he was confined in hell by an impaſſible gulf, v. 26.</p>
            <p>I. Cor. i. 18. "The preaching of the croſs is to them that <hi>periſh</hi> fooliſhneſs: but to us which are <hi>ſaved,</hi> it is the power of God." Theſe that periſh are thoſe to whom the goſpel is fooliſhneſs, and ſuch the apoſtle declares the Jews and Greeks to be, v. 23.</p>
            <p>Heb. x. 38. "We are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the ſaving of the ſoul." Some then do draw back unto perdition, i. e. from a profeſſed <hi>faith,</hi> as is manifeſt from the verſe preceeding, "The juſt ſhall live by faith, but if any man draw back," i. e. from the faith, or the profeſſion of it; "my ſoul hath do pleaſure in him." But the fallen angels do not draw back from the faith, or the profeſſion of it; becauſe they never pretended to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it. Therefore the perſons who draw back <hi>unto perdition,</hi> are men and not devils.</p>
            <p>Luke xiii. 25—29. We are here informed of ſome who ſhall be ſhut out of heaven, and ſhall in vain ſeek admiſſion. But who are theſe? Not the devils ſurely, becauſe Chriſt addreſſes them in the ſecond perſon, "and <hi>ye</hi> begin to ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;" "I know <hi>you</hi> not, whence <hi>you</hi> are, all <hi>ye</hi> workers of iniquity;" which ſhows that they were the <hi>men</hi> with whom he was then in converſation.— How is this reconcileable with the ſalvation of all men?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:018455_0015_0FA76ECEE403C5B8"/>Dan. xii. 2. "And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt." This is ſpoken of thoſe who ſleep in the duſt of the earth, who cannot be the devils, but <hi>men.</hi> Some of theſe are to awake to everlaſting contempt.</p>
            <p>Theſe are only a few of the many ſacred paſſages which might be adduced on this occaſion.—And can we ſuppoſe that a God of infinite goodneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to vex and worry mankind with groundleſs fears? Or that a God of inviolable truth will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce threatnings, which he never means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute? Would not ſuch a conſtruction of the <hi>threatnings,</hi> weaken the credibility of all the <hi>promiſes</hi> of the goſpel too? If God doth not declare what is about to be in one caſe, how know we that he does in another?</p>
            <p>Beſides the ſuppoſition that devils only are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in ſome of the threatnings, the advocates for univerſal ſalvation, whom I oppoſe, have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other evaſions. According to them, in ſome inſtances in which death is threatened to ſinners, no more is intended than that they ſhall die <hi>as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> i. e. ſhall <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>forſake their ſins.</hi>—In others, they ſhall <hi>die,</hi> be <hi>damned,</hi> &amp;c. as they ſhall be condemned <hi>in their own conſciences,</hi> and ſhall <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> eternal death.—In others, it is only declared, that they ſhould die in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as in this text, "The ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die."</p>
            <p>On the <hi>firſt</hi> mode of evaſion, I obſerve, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentence is no death of men, or of the ſoul; on
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018455_0016_0FA76ED184F82FB0"/>
the other hand, it is a reſurrection to ſpiritual life, the proper life of man. Again; that repentance is no token of divine diſpleaſure, but is a ſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of divine favour; Acts. xi. 18. "They glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God, ſaying, Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life." It cannot therefore be made the ſubject of a <hi>threatning</hi>; but whenever it is predicted, is promiſed as a bleſſing. Again; it cannot be ſaid, that in this ſenſe, the worm of the wicked ſhall not die; that their ſmoke ſhall aſcend forever and ever; that they are fixed in torment by an impaſſable gulf; that they ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction; that they ſhall ſeek admiſſion into heaven, but ſeek in vain.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>ſecond</hi> mode of evaſion, That ſinners ſhall be damned in their own <hi>conſciences</hi> and die in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</hi> I obſerve, that by the ſame rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, we have no warrant to ſuppoſe, that the promiſes of the goſpel, mean any more than that ſome men will be confident of their good eſtate, or favour with God, and ſo pronounce a ſentence of juſtification on themſelves, in the <hi>expectation</hi> or ſtrong <hi>hope</hi> of eternal life. If it be ſaid,
<q>that they that do evil ſhall come forth to the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of damnation,</q>
only as they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a ſentence of condemnation on themſelves, and ſhall expect and fear eternal damnation; I will ſay,
<q>that they that do good ſhall come forth to the reſurrection of life,</q>
only as they ſhall, in a confidence of the divine favour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018455_0017_0FA76ED2C4ED8538"/>
ſentence of juſtification on themſelves, and ſhall expect and hope for eternal life, yet ſhall never enjoy it, any more than the wicked ſhall ſuffer eternal puniſhment. If "he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, ſhall be damned," mean only, that he ſhall be condemned in his own mind; then, "he that believeth, ſhall be ſaved," means only, that he ſhall be ſaved in his own mind or expectation. Beſides, according to this ſenſe of the threatnings, how can the wicked be ſaid to be the ſubjects of the never dying worm? or to be in a place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from which they can never eſcape? or to be puniſhed with thoſe torments the ſmoke of which ſhall aſcend forever and ever? Surely, according to the doctrine which I oppoſe, they will not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever</hi> expect puniſhment: nor can they be ſuppoſed to be the ſubjects, <hi>forever and ever,</hi> of any other ſelf-condemnation, than that which is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in true repentence, which is conſiſtent with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and eternal happineſs, and therefore cannot be made the matter of threatning.</p>
            <p>On the laſt mode of evaſion, That ſinners ſhall die <hi>in Chriſt</hi> only, I obſerve, That it is applicable only to thoſe texts, which were written before the death of Chriſt, not to any which were written af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that event and are expreſſed in the <hi>future tenſe</hi>; as theſe, II. Theſſ. i. 9. "<hi>Shall be</hi> puniſhed with an everlaſting deſtruction," &amp;c. Phil. iii. 19. "Whoſe end is deſtruction." II. Cor. xi. 15. "Whoſe end <hi>ſhall be</hi> according their works."—Again; dying in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018455_0018_0FA76ED3903D0738"/>
Chriſt, i. e. that Chriſt ſhould die for a ſinner, is no proper ſubject of threatning, as it is the greateſt bleſſing ever granted to a fallen world; as well might we be threatened with the inheritance of heaven.—Again; that this threatning, if it be ſo called, might as well have been denounced on the righteous, as on the wicked; it being granted on all hands, that Chriſt died for the penitent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.—Once more; that if theſe words, "the ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die," mean that ſuch a ſoul ſhould die in Chriſt, as Chriſt ſhould die in its ſtead, and the ſoul perſonally ſhould not die: with as much authority will I ſay, that theſe words, "He is juſt, he ſhall ſurely live," mean only that he ſhall live in Chriſt, as Chriſt ſhall live in his ſtead, but the man perſonally ſhall not live at all.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe men, while they attempt to reduce or annihilate the threatnings of ſcripture, equally annihilate the promiſes, and entirely overthrow that very univerſal ſalvation, for which they ſo earneſtly plead.</p>
            <p>There is ſtill another mode of evading the texts of ſcripture, which aſſert a future puniſhment; this is by ſuppoſing that the ſins of men are to be ſeparated from the men themſelves, and to be ſent to hell, while the men who committed thoſe ſins are to be taken to heaven. Thus the chaff in Matt. iii. 12. Luke iii. 17. is ſaid to mean the ſins of mankind: theſe ſins are to be ſeparated from the wheat, which is the men themſelves, and to be burnt up with unquenchable fire. The carcaſes of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018455_0019_0FA76ED442F32468"/>
men, who have tranſgreſſed againſt God, in Iſai. lxvi. 24. are ſaid to be the ſins of thoſe tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.—On this, I obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is difficult to conceive how this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation can be reconciled with moſt of thoſe texts quoted above, or with others which may be quoted; as Phil. iii. 18, 19. Thoſe whoſe end is deſtruction, are ſaid to be the enemies of the croſs of Chriſt, whoſe God is their belly. Sins are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed acts of enmity, but not <hi>enemies,</hi> nor have they any <hi>bellies</hi> to be their Gods.—Thoſe who, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to II. Theſſ. i. 8, 9. are to be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction, are not lifeleſs actions, but perſons (oitines, in the maſculine gender) who know not God, and obey not the goſpel. But ſins are capable of neither knowledge nor obedience. In II. Cor. xi. 15. Falſe apoſtles and evil workers, who were Hebrews, Iſraelites, the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, are ſaid to come to an end according to their works. But ſins are neither falſe nor true apoſtles, neither good nor evil workers, are neither Iſraelites, Hebrews, nor the ſeed of Abraham; nor can they perform any works, according to which their end ſhall be. II. Pet. iii. 7. ſpeaks of the perdition not of <hi>ſins,</hi> but <hi>men.</hi> Surely the Jews and Greeks to whom the goſpel was fooliſhneſs, and who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore periſhed, were not <hi>ſins</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>ſinners.</hi> And what an abſurdity to ſay, that the ſins of men draw back from the goſpel faith unto perdition, according to Heb. x. 39</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is equally difficult to reconcile the idea of <hi>ſin's ſuffering,</hi> or being <hi>tormented,</hi> with common
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018455_0020_0FA76ED643E014A8"/>
ſenſe. How can the ſins of tranſgreſſors be eaten by worms, or burnt with fire, while the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors themſelves are in heaven? How can an act of murder, or fornication, or blaſphemy, be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forever and ever in fire and brimſtone, while the authors of thoſe actions are in perfect bliſs? If ſuch puniſhments are feaſible, and anſwer the end of puniſhment, why are they not adopted by human legiſlators? Why is not felony hanged, or cropt and branded, and the felons ſuffered to go free?— But the abſurdity ſufficiently appears: it would be altogether as good ſenſe to talk of puniſhing the north-weſt wind, or tormenting the ſound of a trumpet.</p>
            <p n="3">3. With regard to that text in Iſai. lxvi. 24. it ſeems to be very unluckily choſen to prove, that <hi>ſins</hi> are to be tormented, but the <hi>ſinners</hi> ſaved. I will undertake to prove from the ſame text, with much more plauſibility, that the ſins of mankind are all to be ſaved, and to be happy in heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, while <hi>all men</hi> without exception are to be ſent to eternal torments in hell.—For the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceding are, "All fleſh ſhall come to worſhip before me, ſaith the Lord." As the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had been juſt ſpeaking of the new heavens and new earth, theſe words, I ſuppoſe on all hands are allowed to be deſcriptive of the heavenly ſtate. Therefore <hi>all fleſh</hi> ſhall be admitted into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſtate. But <hi>fleſh</hi> in ſcripture very commonly ſignifies the <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of men. Therefore all the ſins of all men, will be taken to heaven.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018455_0021_0FA76ED6C807E498"/>
But the worm of thoſe who have tranſgreſſed againſt God ſhall never die, and their fire ſhall never be quenched. Now all men without exception have tranſgreſſed againſt God. Therefore all men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, ſhall ſuffer eternal torments in hell, while their ſins ſhall enjoy eternal peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in heaven.—Thus we ſee to what concluſions we are led, by taking no greater liberty with the ſcriptures, than thoſe take with whom I am now concerned.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I am to point out ſome of the conſequences which will follow from this ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It follows from this ſyſtem, that the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſinners of the old world in the priſon of hell, till the death of Chriſt, and the ſimilar treatment of thoſe who die in impenitence and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, is a direct violation of juſtice, and can no more be reconciled with it, than the eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a great part of mankind. The reaſon why it is ſuppoſed to be inconſiſtent with juſtice, that any men ſhould be eternally puniſhed, is, that Chriſt as the ſubſtitute of all mankind, hath taken the whole puniſhment of ſin on himſelf, and hath paid for all men the whole debt. Therefore pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being made by the ſubſtitute, it is unjuſt to exact payment of any ſinner in his own perſon.</p>
            <p>This would be to exact double payment.—On the ſame principle I argue, that if Chriſt has ſo paid the <hi>whole</hi> debt for all men, that it is unjuſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the <hi>whole</hi> puniſhment of ſin on <hi>the perſon</hi> of any ſinner, it is alſo unjuſt to inflict on the perſon
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018455_0022_0FA76ED7425D4538"/>
of any ſinner <hi>a part</hi> of the puniſhment; as this would be <hi>ſo far</hi> to exact double payment of the debt: and to exact double payment for <hi>a part</hi> of a debt is as <hi>real</hi> injuſtice, though not ſo great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it, as to exact double payment for <hi>the whole.</hi> —Therefore juſtice was entirely violated, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the ſinners of the old world, in the priſon of hell, for more than two thouſand years.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It follows from this ſyſtem, that the <hi>divine juſtice</hi> is violated alſo by all the tokens of divine wrath or diſpleaſure, which are ever inflicted on men, in this life. That there have been many tokens of divine wrath inflicted on men, in this life, cannot be denied, to be ſure, by thoſe who believe the divine authority of the ſcriptures: ſuch was the deſtruction of the old world, of Sodom and Gomarrah, of the Canaanites, of Pharaoh and his army in the Red-Sea, of Jeruſalem by Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, and afterwards by the Romans, when wrath came upon them to the uttermoſt; the death of Nadab and Abihu, of Hophni and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas, of Ananias and Sapphira, &amp;c. &amp;c. Theſe are plain inſtances of puniſhment of ſin inflicted by God; but how can theſe, on the ſyſtem which I oppoſe, be reconciled with divine jusſtice, any more than the everlaſting puniſhment of ſin? If theſe puniſhments were juſt, it follows that Chriſt has not ſo paid the whole debt, but that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with juſtice that ſinners ſhould be puniſhed in their own perſons: and therefore the argument in favour of univerſal ſalvation, drawn from the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018455_0023_0FA76ED86F95E280"/>
conſideration of Chriſt's having paid the <hi>whole debt,</hi> entirely falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>I may alſo mention the calamities to which all mankind are liable, and which they conſtantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; the ſickneſs, pains and ſorrows, the vexations and diſappointments, which await us all; the pangs of child-birth, the agonies of death, &amp;c. To ſay that theſe are the neceſſary conſequences of ſin and could not have been prevented by the Deity, is an affront to reaſon and an impeachment of the divine Omnipotence. It was in the power of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, to have conſtituted things in ſuch a manner, that child-bearing and death ſhould have been without the leaſt pain, or that we ſhould all have been tranſlated without taſting death.—With equal eaſe could God have prevented every other temporal calamity.—To ſay that theſe calamities are mere parental chaſtiſements deſigned for our good, and therefore not puniſhments or tokens of divine diſpleaſure, is contradictory. For no good parent ever chaſtiſed a child, but for ſome fault, at which he was diſpleaſed.</p>
            <p>What then are all theſe calamities of life and agonies of death, but ſo many tokens of God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at ſin? But ſuch tokens of God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure can never be reconciled with juſtice, on the ſuppoſition that Chriſt ſo paid the whole debt of puniſhment for all mankind, that juſtice will not allow, that they be puniſhed in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And if juſtice will allow that men be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in their own perſons, it is a matter of grace,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018455_0024_0FA76ED8E7C7F1D8"/>
ſovereign grace, that any of mankind are ſaved; and if any, who and how many.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It follows from this ſyſtem, that we have an abſolute and immediate right, on the footing of <hi>juſtice,</hi> to the inheritance of heaven and all its bleſſedneſs, and that we are injured by the Deity, in being kept out of it for a day or an hour. Chriſt has purchaſed heaven for us, equally as an eſcape from hell. But to be kept out of a glorious inheritance, to which we have an entire and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute right on the ſooting of juſtice, and at the ſame time, to be detained a ſtate of impriſonment, as is in the caſe with a great part of mankind (Zach. ix. 12.) or in ſuch a ſtate that even the beſt of men groan being burdened, and are in bondage, (Rom. viii. 23. and II. Cor. v. 2,—5. and Heb. ii. 14, 15.) is not merely to be injured, but to ſuffer an injury which is great and oppreſſive.—If, to avoid this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it ſhould be ſaid, that doubtleſs Chriſt in the covenant between him and the father, conſented that his redeemed ſhould be kept out of the poſſeſſion of heaven for a ſeaſon; this would be to open a door at which certain gueſts, very unwelcome to the advocates for univerſal ſalvation, may eaſily enter. For in this conceſſion it is granted, that the purchaſe of Chriſt is not abſolute and unconditional, but limited with ſtipulations and conditions. Hence at once ariſes this queſtion; What are the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conditions, on which an inheritance of the bleſſings of Chriſt's purchaſe is to be obtained? Is not that purchaſe ſo limited, that none can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018455_0025_0FA76EDADD0EF318"/>
the ſaving bleſſings of it, who die in impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and unbelief. Doubtleſs he who had a right to conſent, that all men ſhould for a ſeaſon be kept from the enjoyment of the bleſſings pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt, had a right to conſent that ſome men ſhould be kept from them forever. And if, this being the caſe, no injury is done thoſe who are excluded from thoſe bleſſings for a ſeaſon, neither is any injury done thoſe who are finally excluded: becauſe the conditions of the purchaſe in either caſe are fulfilled. It remains therefore to be ſhewn, what are, and what are not, the conditions of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the bleſſings purchaſed by Chriſt; and the argument from the abſolute purchaſe, whether of eſcape from hell, or of the poſſeſſion of heaven en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely falls to the ground.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It follows from this ſyſtem, that we have a right on the footing of <hi>juſtice,</hi> to immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſanctification, and are conſtantly injured ſo long as we are kept in a ſtate of depravity or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Perfection in holineſs is a part of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Chriſt. (Heb. xii. 23. and Rev. xxi. 27.) But the foundation of the argument, that we cannot conſiſtently with juſtice, ſuffer the penalty of the law, is, that we have a right on the footing of <hi>juſtice,</hi> to whatever Chriſt has purchaſed for us. Therefore we have a right to immediate and complete ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—If here too it ſhould be ſaid, that Chriſt has conſented, that we ſhould be kept out of this privilege for a while; I anſwer, as under the preceding article, that with as much reaſon, I
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018455_0026_0FA76EDB00A3F890"/>
may ſay, he has conſented that ſome ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main without it for ever.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It follows from this ſyſtem, that we are under no obligation to obey the divine law.—Chriſt has equally obeyed the law for us, as he has ſuffered the penalty. He has equally paid the debt of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as the debt of puniſhment. Now if, ſince Chriſt has paid the debt of puniſhment, to exact puniſhment of men perſonally, be to exact double payment of the debt; then, ſince Chriſt has paid the debt of obedience, to exact obedience of men perſonally, is to exact double payment of the debt of obedience; which is unjuſt, tyrannical and oppreſſive, and can never conſiſt with the divine rectitude and perfection. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows therefore that we are under no obligation to obey the divine law in any particular, whether as it reſpects God or men.—We are under no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to love the Lord our God with all our heart, to obſerve his Sabbath, his ordinances of public or private worſhip, or to comply with any precept of the firſt table. Equally free are we from obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to love our neighbour as ourſelves, to ſpeak the truth, to practiſe juſtice, fidelity, humanity, charity, temperance, ſobriety, or any other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.—And where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion.—Therefore, according to this ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, we are not capable of committing ſin; and though we ſhould fall into profaneneſs, perjury, blaſphemy; though we ſhould practiſe injuſtice, fraud, theft, malice, revenge, murder, they would
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018455_0027_0FA76EDD949E1380"/>
be no ſin, but would be as perfectly innocent, as thoſe which are eſteemed the moſt amiable virtues.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It follows from this ſyſtem, that <hi>grace</hi> is in a great meaſure excluded from the plan or ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion publiſhed in the goſpel. In the late exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of univerſal ſalvation in this place, the preacher himſelf declared, "that however ſome hoped to be ſaved by <hi>free grace, he</hi> expected to be ſaved in the way of <hi>ſtrict juſtice.</hi>" This declaration is perfectly conſiſtent with his general ſyſtem, and neceſſarily implied in it. For if we have a right <hi>on the footing of juſtice,</hi> to deliverance from hell, and admiſſion to heaven, we doubtleſs have the <hi>ſame right</hi> to converſion, pardon, juſtification, the teachings and aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, in ſhort, to every bleſſing which Chriſt has purchaſed.—If ſo, where is the grace in communicating theſe bleſſings? Manifeſtly there is no grace in the communication of any of them. They are <hi>due</hi> to us, and, according to the ſyſtem which I am op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, in communicating them, God does but diſcharge his <hi>debts.</hi> But is not this grating to the ear of every chriſtian? It moſt directly contradicts the whole goſpel, the language of which is, "By <hi>grace</hi> are ye ſaved"—"Being juſtified <hi>freely</hi> by his <hi>grace</hi>"—"in whom we have—forgiveneſs according to the <hi>riches of his grace,</hi>" &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It follows from this doctrine, that there is no foundation for <hi>thankſgiving</hi> or <hi>praiſe,</hi> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any of the forementioned bleſſings of converſion, pardon, juſtification, victory over the world, over our luſts, over ſatan, or final and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018455_0028_0FA76EDF817BB708"/>
eternal glory. We are not obliged to thank any man for giving us our <hi>dues</hi>: nor are we any more obligated to render thanks to <hi>God</hi> if <hi>he</hi> only give us our dues. Therefore all that is ſaid in the Pſalms, or any other parts of ſcripture, in the way of praiſe or gratitude, on account of theſe bleſſings, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon or foundation, and the inſpired writers herein ſhow their great ignorance of the truth.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It follows from this doctrine, that there is no foundation for <hi>prayer.</hi> To pray is to aſk a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But all ſpiritual bleſſings being purchaſed for us by Chriſt, we have a right to them on the footing of juſtice, and therefore may properly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> them; and to pray for them, is to act out of character. For the ſame reaſon, there is no propriety in praying for temporal bleſſings, if they are purchaſed by Chriſt, as they are generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be.—Again, as we are under no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to obey the divine law, and are incapable of ſin, we are of courſe, in our own perſons, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly innocent, and being innocent, we deſerve none of of the calamities to which we are liable in the world, which are tokens of God's diſpleaſure. We may therefore demand exemption from them. As to thoſe calamities, which are tokens of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine complacency or approbation, if any ſuch there be, ſurely no man in his ſenſes would pray to be preſerved or delivered from them.—From this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of particulars, it appears, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the univerſe, whether good or evil, whether of a temporal or a ſpiritual nature, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this ſyſtem, can with propriety be made the ſubject of prayer.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:018455_0029_0FA76EDF8BB26E38"/>9. This doctrine takes off all reſtraints on wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ariſing either from a ſenſe of ſin or moral evil, or from the proſpect of puniſhment in the future ſtate. Becauſe the doctrine not only aſſerts, that there is to be no future puniſhment, but as I have already ſhewn, implies that men are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der moral obligation and conſequently are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſin. There is therefore no reaſon why men ſhould avoid any actions, either through fear of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhment, or through fear of contracting the guilt and turpitude of ſin.—Nay, this doctrine greatly diminiſhes, if it do not entirely annihilate the the force of civil puniſhments. The greateſt and laſt of them is death. But if death be a ſure tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to complete and eternal happineſs, what is there in it terrible? The mere pains of death by the hands of the executioner, are ſo momentary and all ſenſibility is ſo ſoon paſt, that they cannot juſtly excite any great terror. Thus this doctrine cuts the ſinews of all civil government, and throws off almoſt every reſtraint by which mankind, in the preſent depraved ſtate, are kept in tolerable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Having now finiſhed what I propoſed on this ſubject, I leave it with the candid reader to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether I have done juſtice to thoſe ſacred texts, which I ſuppoſe to have been perverted to ſupport the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the many texts which ſeem to declare a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhment, the few which I have found room to inſert in theſe obſervations, do ſufficiently
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018455_0030_0FA76EE140ECC160"/>
eſtabliſh it; whether the remarks, which I have made on the ſeveral modes of evading the force of thoſe and ſimilar texts, be pertinent; whether the conſequences, which I have mentioned, do not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow from the doctrine which I oppoſe; and finally, whether, if the conſequences are abſurd and even ſhocking, the doctrine itſelf from which they follow, is not ſo too.</p>
            <p>I hope and pray, that the promulgation of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation in this city, may be the means of happily exciting the attention of the citizens, to the important ſubject of a future ſtate in general, and of future puniſhment in particular; that they may enquire for themſelves, make the ſcriptures the foundation of their faith, imitate the example of the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> in ſearching the ſcriptures daily, with reſpect to this ſubject; and that in the iſſue they may be eſtabliſhed on "The foundation of God, which ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth them that are his."</p>
