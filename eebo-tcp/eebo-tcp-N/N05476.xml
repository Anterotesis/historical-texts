            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE following Diſcourſe was at firſt written for the Inſtruction and Admonition of my own Pariſh, without any View at that Time, of it's going farther; but being called, by your Honour, to preach before the General-Aſſembly, I could not think upon any Subject better adapted to the preſent Circumſtances of our Country, and more neceſſary to be inſiſted on. The Gentlemen of the Houſe of Burgeſſes having honoured it with their Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſired it ſhould be printed, I very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly comply with their Requeſt, as it may be a Means of rendering the Truths contained in-it more publick and diffuſive, and may poſſibly contribute ſomething towards the Cure of this enormous Vice.</p>
            <p>IT was not without a ſenſible Pleaſure, that I obſerved a Vein of Piety run through your Honour's SPEECH to the General-Aſſembly, and a high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard expreſſed for the true Intereſts of Religion.
<pb facs="unknown:006939_0004_102A9C2F94C732D8"/>It is upon this, Sir, that the Thrones of Kings are eſtabliſhed, and that Princes and Magiſtrates reign and decree Juſtice. So that every Violation of the Dictates of Religion and Morality is, not only an Act of Rebellion againſt the Majeſty of Almighty GOD, but alſo a flagrant Offence againſt the real Intereſts, and true Felicity, of the State. And this is the Reaſon, that all wiſe and well conſtituted Governments have ever had the utmoſt Attention to Religion, and made it's Purity and Practice their firſt and principal Concern.</p>
            <p>BUT how deſtructive of every religious Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and corruptive of all Honeſty and Morality, this flagitious Practice is, hath been, I hope, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſet forth and explained in this Sermon. It is upon you, Sir, that the Executive Part of our Government now chiefly reſts; and if, by a proper Vigour in the Execution of the Laws againſt it, or by any other Method, you can diſcourage and ſuppreſs this crying Enormity, it will greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the Honour of your Adminiſtration; which that it may be long and happy over us, is the ſincere Wiſh, and ſhall be the conſtant Prayer of, Sir,</p>
            <closer>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>EXODUS XX.—Part of v 17.</bibl>
                  <p>Thou ſhalt not covet.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE Words contain the principal Verb and preceptive Part of the tenth Commandment; and I have choſen them for a Diſcourſe upon a particular Kind of Coveting, which is become a growing and crying Evil among us. I believe, you will eaſily judge, that the Coveting, which I mean, is that of Gaming; a Vice, that always hath it's Root in Avarice, and which, in it's greedy Wiſhes and Aims, devours it's <hi>Neighbour's Houſes and Lands, his Man-Servants and his Maid Servants, his Oxen and his Aſſes, and every Thing elſe, that is his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, it may be thought perhaps by ſome Perſons, that this is a Subject below the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion and Dignity of this Place. But altho' Gaming is in itſelf a very low and contemptible Vice, yet as it is, in all its Complications and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, a Sin of a very deep Dye and aggravated
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006939_0006_102A9C35561E6A20"/>Nature,—and as it is at preſent very prevalent among us, and hath, within theſe few Years, grown viſibly, and as it were to the Eye; — I am ſure, I ſhall never eſteem any ſuch to be below my Duty and Function. On the contrary, both as a Miniſter of GOD's Word, and as a Lover of my Country, I ſhall joyfully embrace every Occaſion, as well publick as private, of bearing my Teſtimony againſt a Practice, ſo very ſinful and hurtful to Men's Souls, and ſo vaſtly injurious and deſtructive to every Country, where it is much followed.</p>
            <p>BUT it may perhaps be objected, that all Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is not of this heinous and ſinful Nature; but that, in ſome Inſtances and Degrees, it is a lawful and innocent Diverſion. This indeed is a diſputed Point among Moraliſts and Divines; but I believe, it is generally agreed to be ſinful, as ſoon as ever it ceaſes to be a mere Amuſement, and becomes a Conteſt for Money, ſo that Avarice mingles itſelf with, and corrupts, its Nature. However, not to ſcrew Things up to their greateſt Height and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and to err rather on the mild and good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured than on the ſour and unrelenting Side, I ſhall willingly grant, that even Gaming for Money, in ſome Inſtances and Degrees, may be a lawful and innocent Diverſion. But then let me add, that thoſe Inſtances and Degrees are much fewer, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, than it is generally ſuppoſed. For whenever Gaming engroſſes too much of our Thought and Affection, or employs too much of our Time; — whenever it leads us into ſinful Habits, or betrays us into violent and criminal Paſſions; — or when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it makes us neglect more uſeful Buſineſs and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006939_0007_102A9C36E0E55360"/>Purſuits, or omit our neceſſary Duties to GOD, our Neighbour, or ourſelves; — in all theſe, and other ſuch Caſes, it immediately loſes the Harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of it's Nature, and degenerates into down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Sin and Folly.</p>
            <p>TO this it may be obſerved, that the Spirit of Gaming is of a very growing and encroaching Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo that no Man can ſay to it, <hi>thus far ſhalt thou come, and no farther;</hi> nor anſwer for the evil Conſequences of indulging it, even in the loweſt Degree. It will therefore always be an eſpecial Point of Prudence, carefully to guard againſt, or even wholly to avoid, ſuch a dangerous Contagion; leſt it gains inſenſibly upon the Mind, and at laſt totally engroſſes and enſlaves us.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides, Gaming, in it's moſt innocent Degree, muſt be acknowledged to be at beſt only a Supplement to Good-ſenſe, which ſerves to fill up the Vacancies of uſeful Diſcourſe and diverting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. It's greateſt Uſe is to kill Time, and to paſs away thoſe Hours, which lie heavy upon the Hands of the Idle; and it's higheſt Praiſe is only the negative one, of keeping ſuch Perſons from hard Drinking, and other more ſinful and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courſes. So that to give it it's whole Due, it is nothing but a harmleſs Kind of Trifling, and a leſs hurtful Manner of fooling away our Time.</p>
            <p>BUT however void of Guilt ſo childiſh an Amuſement may be, yet no ſuch Thing, I am ſure, can be pleaded in Excuſe of high Gaming, which is an evident and undeniable Sin. For we therein
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006939_0008_102A9C388FAF2AD0"/>ſin againſt our Neighbour, againſt our Country, againſt our Families, againſt ourſelves, and againſt GOD. And therefore, in the Proſecution of this Diſcourſe, I beg Leave to make ſome Obſervations on each of thoſe Heads. And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. IN Gaming we ſin againſt our Neighbour, as we therein covet our Neighbour's Goods, and are undoubtedly guilty of an eminent Breach of this tenth Commandment. For Covetouſneſs is the Mother-Paſſion to the Spirit of Gaming; and no true Gameſter ſits down to play with his Neighbour, without a determined Deſign againſt his Purſe and his Property. It is not, to relieve the Mind after hard Application to other more ſevere and uſeful Purſuits, or to divert and trifle away an idle Hour, that the Gameſter plays, — but it is wholly with a View to get Money; — and the more he wins from his Neighbour, his Friend, or his very Brother, the more is he pleaſed, and the better are his Ends an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; ſo that, in Mind at leaſt, we are evidently guilty of hurting our Neighbour, as we deſign and endeavour to gain from him his Neceſſaries and Conveniencies of Life.</p>
            <p>AND indeed it were well, if it ſtopped there, and went no farther than a bare Deſire and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind. I am afraid it is conſtantly led on and brought into Act, and too often ſettles into a fixed Habit of Fraud and Knavery. For that Man muſt certainly be an extraordinary Perſon, who can be for ever hankering after and eager for his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Goods, and yet keep himſelf from all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt Arts and fraudulent Practices towards obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006939_0009_102A9C3B3ABC9F00"/>them. In truth, a ſettled Habit of Gaming, and ſteady Principle of Honeſty, ſeem to be utterly repugnant and inconſiſtent with each other. Our Honeſty will make us quit Gaming, or Gaming will make us deſert our Honeſty. Two ſuch oppoſite Principles can never long agree and dwell together in the ſame Breaſt.</p>
            <p>AT firſt indeed the Gameſter's Deflections from the Paths of Honeſty may be modeſt and fearful. He will perhaps only take, what, in the Style of that Art and Myſtery, are called fair Advantages; that is to ſay, he will only take Advantage of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Ignorance, and cheat him by his own Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. And this, according to the Caſuiſtry of the Gaming-Table, is entirely conſonant to the Rules of Juſtice and Honour; altho' by all other Laws of GOD and Man it is accounted a palpable Fraud and arrant Knavery. For certainly, the Man, that takes Advantage of my Ignorance and ſteals my Horſe, or that robs my Houſe, by my Miſtake or Inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in leaving my Key in the Door, is as honeſt as he, that wins my Money upon the like Ignorance or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. And there is no Court of Juſtice, but what will oblige a Man to rectify any Errors, that may be committed in the Settlement of an Account, and refund the Money, which he hath unjuſtly got from his Neighbour, by his own Acuteneſs, or the other's Negligence or Error. And yet from ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples doth the Gameſter's Syſtem of Morality ſet out; ſuch, I ſay, as contradict the plaineſt Dictates of Reaſon and Juſtice. And when the Mind is once debauched and corrupted by ſuch wicked Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, it is no Wonder, if it afterwards wades on
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006939_0010_102A9C3DC635DFD0"/>from Guilt to Guilt, till it at laſt arrives at all the inſidious Arts, iniquitous Tricking, and knaviſh Refinements of Gaming.</p>
            <p>AND this Habit of cheating and tricking, which is contracted at the Gaming Table, will dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe itſelf through all other Parts of a Man's Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Conduct. He will not be able to buy any thing without a Nick, or to ſell the leaſt Trifle without a Bite. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? then may ye alſo do Good, that are accuſtomed to do Evil.</hi> Jer. xiii. 23. The Habit of ſhuffling and couſening will be ſo grafted and rooted in their very Nature, that it will ſhew itſelf in every Branch of their Behaviour, and every the moſt indifferent Office of Life. So that Life itſelf is with them one continual Scene of Gaming, and their whole Study and Employment in it is to lie upon the Watch, and to take all Advantages, that offer.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed one Step farther: I wiſh the Evil of Gaming terminated even here. But it is often found to go ſtill farther, and at laſt to bring Men to downright Stealing and Robbery. For it is well known, that there never was any notorious Thief or Robber, who was not at the ſame Time a notorious Gameſter. And when the near Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Death obliges thoſe wretched Creatures to repent of the Evil of their Ways, it may be obſerved, that a Caution againſt this unrighteous and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Practice always makes one Part of their dying Admonitions, as it hath always been one main Road, that led them to that miſerable End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:006939_0011_102A9C3F9975DE38"/>
NEITHER is this the worſt of it yet. For Gaming is often known to lead Men to thoſe black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more odious Crimes of Duelling and Murder. Nay, the Deſpair and Diſtraction of the Ruin and Beggary, which they have brought upon themſelves and Families, hath ſometimes carried the unhappy Wretches to that higheſt and moſt horrid of all Crimes, the Sin of Self-Murder; and has made them ruſh wildly into the Preſence of Almighty GOD, with all their Sins and Iniquities freſh upon them, and without a Poſſibility of redeeming their Conduct by a future Repentance and Amendment.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort; no good and prudent Man can ever concern himſelf far with this abominable Practice of Gaming. For if he is a good Man, he will not himſelf cheat; and if he is a prudent Man, he will never engage himſelf among a Pack of Thieves and Sharpers, where, if he will not cheat, he is ſure to be cheated.—But as in Gaming we thus ſin againſt our Neighbour. So,</p>
            <p n="2">II. ARE we guilty of a very heinous Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Country. And this plainly follows from what has been urged under the former Head. For if Gaming has a natural and direct Tendency, to ſap the Honeſty, and to corrupt the Morals of a People, then Gaming is undoubtedly a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Offence againſt every Country, where it is practiſed. For moral Virtue and Honeſty is the grand Fountain of publick Honour and Felicity; as the Vice and Wickedneſs of a Nation are the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Forerunners and Cauſe of it's Diſgrace and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006939_0012_102A9C4276208588"/>According to that excellent Remark of the Wiſeman; <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation, but Sin is a Reproach to any People.</hi> Prov. xiv. 34.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides, the Strength and Proſperity of every Country entirely depend upon the Number and honeſt Induſtry of it's Inhabitants, who by their Labour and Manufactures increaſe the publick Stock, and add to the general Wealth of the Nation. Every honeſt Labourer, of any uſeful Trade or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that faithfully and induſtriouſly follows the ſame, is ſo far a Benefactor to the Publick, and contributes to the Wealth and Proſperity of his Country. As on the contrary, every Art or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, that tends to make the People idle, and to draw them off from their honeſt Callings and uſeful Trades, immediately becomes hurtful and pernicious to the Community. Theſe are ſome of the firſt Principles of Polity—and plaineſt Truths in the Science of Government.</p>
            <p>BUT now, what can be imagined, more deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Induſtry, a greater Enemy to honeſt Labour, and more immediately calculated to draw Men off from their uſeful Callings, and to render them idle and vagrant, than this Practice of Gaming? For when Mankind can be ſo far gulled and deceived in their Hopes, as to promiſe themſelves more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from one Hour's Play, than from a Year's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, human Nature will be apt to be too indulgent to itſelf, and joyfully to embrace the Scheme of much Money and little Trouble. And thus are they induced to quit their ſeveral uſeful Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Profeſſions, and to gad about from Place
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006939_0013_102A9C44962A31C0"/>to Place, in Purſuit of theſe wild Hopes and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Riches. Whereas, if they would give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Trouble of making a juſt Calculation of the Matter, they would ſoon find ſo much expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in travelling Charges, ſo much thrown away in Drinking, Rioting, and other concomitant Vices of Gaming, that upon the whole they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great Loſers, and that the Tavern-keepers, and other Panders to their Vices, are generally the chief Gainers.</p>
            <p>BUT on the other hand, what poſſible Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage can accrue to a Country from the Practice of Gaming? What uſeful Art is promoted? What Manufactures are carried on? Or what Addition is there made by it to the publick Stock and Wealth of a People? None certainly. For the Whole of Gaming is only to ſhift the Property and Specie, which hath been acquired to a Country and brought in by the honeſt Labourer's Induſtry, from one Hand to another, — and oftentimes from the more worthy to the moſt unworthy Members of the Society. And Arts and Manufactures are ſo far from being advanced by it, that it is the greateſt Obſtruction imaginable to them, by drawing off thoſe Hands to the Ways of Idleneſs and Knavery, which by GOD and their Station in Life, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for Labour, and which ought by all the Reaſon in the World to be ſo employed. So that to call them off from their neceſſary Employments, is in truth to rob their Country of the Profit and Advantage of their Labours, and even to run coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to GOD's Providence, and to contradict his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will in allotting them their Rank and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006939_0014_102A9C4690B30258"/>in the World. And that this is the Caſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us is very notorious; when Perſons, who by their Fortune and Figure in Life are marked out for Labour, dare to deſert their Poſt at the Plow and the Hoe, where they may do their Country good Service by increaſing the publick Export and Riches, and betake themſelves to the more eaſy and idle, but leſs honeſt Employment of Gaming.</p>
            <p>AND as this is true of the inferior Sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo is it more particularly applicable to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Perſons of Diſtinction. As they have a greater Stake in a Country, and enjoy a larger Property, ſo are they bound, both in Gratitude and Intereſt, to be more ſtudious of that Country's Good, and to prevent every Art or Practice, that ſhall be found hurtful to it. Inſtead of waſting and laviſhing away their Time, their Money, and their Conſtitution, at the Gaming Table, they ought to be employed in <hi>deviſing liberal Things,</hi> in ſetting forward any uſeful Project or Branch of Trade and Manufacture, and in promoting every Thing, that may tend to the publick Good and Improvement. Inſtead of throwing away their Money among the rapacious and unthankful Tribe of Gameſters, they ought to <hi>caſt their Bread upon the Waters,</hi> by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the honeſt and induſtrious Poor, and ſo <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many Days</hi> they will be ſure <hi>to find it again,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid with Uſury, both in this World and the next. Inſtead of defiling themſelves with ſo foul a Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and ſetting Faſhions to the lower People in Vice, they ought by their Example to lead them on to every Thing, that is virtuous and honeſt, and with the utmoſt Severity of the Law to reſtrain and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006939_0015_102A9C49848086E0"/>puniſh this execrable Cuſtom; a Cuſtom ſo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corruptive of the People, and ſo prejudicial to the Publick, that there is no Country in the World, where it roſe to any Height, that did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately prohibit it under the ſevereſt Penalties. And this is certainly an unanſwerable Proof of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Senſe of Mankind concerning it's pernicious Nature and Tendency. But,</p>
            <p n="3">III. IN Gaming we are alſo guilty of a Sin againſt our Families. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE all owe to our Families an honeſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and careful Endeavour to ſupport and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them according to our ſeveral Stations and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; which Duty, I am afraid, is not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the Gentlemen of this Profeſſion. For although the Gameſter may ſeem to be ſollicitous to provide for thoſe of his own Houſe, and may be thought to follow his Calling out of a View and Hope of enriching himſelf and Family, yet ſhall we be greatly miſtaken, if we think him ſuch a careful Huſband or Father. For how often is it found, whilſt Gameſters are flaunting it and flouriſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, with their fine Horſes, rich Furniture and Cloaths, and luxurious Living, that their Families are left at home in a pinching and ſtarving Condition? Every Thing they can ſcrape and rend is ſquandered away upon their own Vices and Extravagancies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Thought or Concern how far it may affect the Happineſs and Well-being of their Wives and Children. Neither is it to be wondered at. For this Vice is certainly very deſtructive of all the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006939_0016_102A9C4B4DB12468"/>gentler Paſſions of Tenderneſs and Humanity; and by the Habit of taking all Advantages, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually doing hard, unjuſt, and cruel Things, it ſteels the Mind, as it were, againſt every kind and benevolent Sentiment.</p>
            <p>BUT yet farther: Although a Gameſter ſhould win much, yet is he at the ſame Time obliged to be at a conſtant and great Charge; and whether he wins or loſes, his Expences are ſtill high. So that upon the whole, taking their Expences into the Calculation, every Man bets againſt ſuch Odds, as in a long Run of Play, without the helping Hand of a little Cogging and Coſenage, muſt undo the richeſt Man alive. To which we may add that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy, which will be naturally bred in the Mind, by having ſuch large Sums perpetually flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and going out. This brings them to ſet but little Value upon Money, and makes them think and act, as if they were the abſolute and real Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of all the Caſh, that paſſes through their Hands. All which Things will certainly intercept and run away with that Profit and Advantage to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, which otherwiſe a Run of Luck might poſſibly give them. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. BESIDES this Duty of being careful and induſtrious and providing for our Familes, we are ſtill farther obliged to be watchful over their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Behaviour, to ſet them a good Example, and <hi>to bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord,</hi> Eph. vi. 4. And this is a Branch of parental Duty equal, if not ſuperior to the other. But how does the Gameſter comply with this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular?
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006939_0017_102A9C4D59E8BC78"/>To ſpeak the Truth ingenuouſly, I think, I never knew any Profeſſion, ſo conſtantly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly handed down from Father to Son, as this of Gaming. A Lawyer's Son may be a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a Clergyman's Son may be a Phyſician; but you may take it for granted, that a Gameſter's Son will forever be a Gameſter. He takes the Ply in his

            <p n="4">IV. DO we alſo thereby ſin againſt ourſelves: And this with Regard to our Bodies, our Minds, and our Souls. For,</p>

1. HOWEVER innocent Gaming may ſeem to our Health and bodily Welfare, yet upon a juſt Examination of the Matter we ſhall find it very prejudicial to the Conſtitution. For the Gameſter is obliged to be a Man of all Hours: He is forced to ſit up, and to drink; and (as the Antitype of of St. <hi>Paul) to be made all Things to all Men, that he may by all Means</hi> ruin <hi>ſome.</hi> He is an inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Animal, that is eternally upon the Watch for his Prey; and however diſguſtful it may be to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or hurtful to his Conſtitution; he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quit the Profit and Fineſſe of his Profeſſion, or elſe he muſt univerſally conform himſelf to all Kinds of Humours and Vices. However his Body may crave it's Reſt, at thoſe Hours, which GOD and Nature have aſſigned for Refreſhment and Repoſe; yet hath he more Senſe than to obey the Calls of Nature, and thereby loſe the hopeful Proſpect of getting Money, which will only coſt him a little Trouble and much Knavery.</p>
            <p>BUT as to thoſe Gentlemen, who would not be thought to make Gaming their Profeſſion, and that only now and then throw away Part of their Time and Eſtates in this innocent and laudable Diverſion, I refer it to their own Conſciences, whether they do not often find themſelves betrayed by it into hard Drinking and late Hours? And this will be for ever promoted by the expert and dextrous Gameſter; it being one of the honeſt Arts and grand Myſteries of their Craft and Calling, firſt to make Men drunk, and then to win their Money. In ſhort, it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and invariable Rule always to follow Nature;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006939_0019_102A9C525522EB50"/>and whoever turns Night into Day, and Day into Night (however the Thing may be palliated and diſguiſed, or however excuſed and defended) yet certainly runs counter to this Rule, does a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Nature, and muſt injure his Health and Conſtitution. Neither,</p>
            <p n="2">2. IS it leſs injurious to our Minds, than it is to our Bodies. It exceeds the Power of Language to expreſs the Pangs and Anguiſh, the Remorſe and Bitterneſs of Soul, that muſt attend a ruined Eſtate and beggared Family. No Colours can paint, nor Words deſcribe the Grief and Diſtraction of ſuch a Man. And even when it does not come to that Height; yet a bad Run of Luck, and the Loſs of a Sum of Money, which we are in immediate and preſſing Want of, and which perhaps we know not how to raiſe again, muſt give a Man no ſmall Pain and Compunction. And indeed the Gameſter's Art is the very Reverſe of the Wiſdom of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Sages and Philoſophers. One grand Leſſon of theirs, and a principal Aim of their Inſtructions, was to bring Men to a ſettled Peace and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mind; without which they wiſely concluded, there could be no ſuch Thing as Happineſs in this Life. And this Truth was ſo eagerly purſued, and ſo over-run, as it were, by ſome of the Sects, that they fell into the unnatural Abſurdity of an Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, or a perfect Unconcern and Diſregard for whatever can happen to us. But Gaming tends to the very contrary of this. It deſtroys all eaſe and Tranquillity of Mind, and throws it into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Confuſion and Perturbation. The Tranſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Grief to Joy, from Gain to Loſs, are ſo
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006939_0020_102A9C5414645258"/>quick and perpetual, that the Paſſions are for ever kept in a Flame and Hurricane, and have not Time left them to grow cool and compoſed. Philoſophy profeſſes to teach us, to govern our Paſſions and command our Appetites; but this Anti-Philoſophy, with ſtill greater Force and Efficacy, lets them looſe, and renders them furious and ungovernable.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, by committing ourſelves to the blind Arbitrement of Chance, to the Caſt of a Dye or Turn of a Card, we give the Reins quite out of our own Hands, and loſe all Power and Authority over our Spirits. We are toſſed to and fro by every Wind of Paſſion, and are enſlaved to wild Deſires, exceſſive Hopes, impotent Joys, and groundleſs Griefs. 'Till at laſt we are ſo abandoned to theſe frantic Tranſports, that whenever Things ſucceed not according to our Wiſh, we immediately loſe all Prudence, Temper, and Reſpect, and grow impious and profligate. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſing the Caſe to be otherwiſe, that the Gameſter's <hi>Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all his Paths are Peace:</hi> Suppoſing, he is always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful and a perpetual Gainer; yet, my Brethren, <hi>what is a Man profited, if he ſhould gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? or what ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi> Matt. xvi. 26. For you may eaſily judge, from what hath been already ſaid, that the Guilt of this Practice is very heinous and complicated; and that a State of Grace, and a State of Gaming, ſeem hardly compatible with each other. And that this may appear the more fully, I proceed to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:006939_0021_102A9C559D29AED8"/>
V. THAT in Gaming we ſin greviouſly againſt GOD. And ſurely of this there can be no Manner of Doubt. For how can that Man be innocent in the Sight of GOD, who breaks through and violates ſo many, ſo plain, and ſuch important Divine Commands? How can he ſtand abſolved towards his Creator, who ſins againſt his Neighbour, his Country, his Family, and his own Soul; and conſequently, in each of thoſe Particulars, is guilty of a moſt egregious Offence againſt GOD?</p>
            <p>BUT beſides theſe oblique Ways of offending GOD, Gaming naturally leads to, and is produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of, ſome of the moſt direct and audacious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts imaginable againſt the Divine Majeſty. For what horrid Oaths and Blaſphemies, what dreadful Imprecations, and ſhocking Impieties, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attendant upon this frantic and outragious Diverſion? The groundleſs, unprovoked, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Habit of Curſing and Swearing is indeed but too common through all Parts of Life; and cannot but give continual Pain and Concern to every ſerious and pious Chriſtian. But yet the Gaming Table ſeems to be the peculiar Soil and darling Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of Oaths and Blaſphemies. There every puny Mortal, that has loſt a Sum of Money, thinks himſelf authoriſed to call Divine Providence to an Account; and is ſure to liſt up his Voice aloud againſt GOD, and to pour forth the Bitterneſs of his Soul againſt the Almighty. And theſe indeed do it in ſerious Sadneſs, and in the Height of their Grief and Frenzy; whilſt others are led on by it to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006939_0022_102A9C5956283208"/>an habitual Courſe of Blaſphemy and Profaneneſs, and loſe all Senſe of Reverence for the Name and Majeſty of that <hi>GOD, in whom they live, and move, and have their Being.</hi> So that in cold Blood, as it were, and unprovoked, they will be throwing forth their Impieties; and even with ſtudied Jeſts, and out of mere Wantonneſs, divert themſelves with Blaſphemies, <hi>caſting about Firebrands, Arrows, and Death, and ſaying; Are we not in Sport?</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we may obſerve, that in every Circle of Gameſters there is commonly one or two, who are the Buts and Diverſion of the reſt; and who chiefly ſhine by their Talent in pouring forth queer and unexpected Oaths, and inventing new Figures of Speech in the Art of Swearing and Profaneneſs.</p>
            <p>BUT however Divine Providence may be rated for their Loſſes, and it's Juſtice queſtioned, yet the Caſe is quite altered, when they happen to win. Then they will be ready enough to <hi>ſacrifice to their own Net,</hi> and to aſcribe their Succeſs to their own Merit and ſuperior Wiſdom and Addreſs. GOD muſt bear the Blame of their Miſcarriages; but they themſelves are applauded, as the ſole Authors, and dexterous Contrivers of all their good Fortune.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides theſe open and daring Inſults on the dread Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, Gaming naturally begets in us many other ſinful Ways and evil Habits. And particularly, notwithſtanding his perpetual Uſe of the Lord's Name, yet hath the Gameſter little or no Senſe of GOD and Religion upon his Mind. No Man can ſerve two ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Maſters, as GOD and Mammon; but our
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006939_0023_102A9C5B08C894B8"/>Love to the one will make us cold and negligent in our Duty towards the other. And the Gameſter is ſo blinded by the GOD of this World, and ſo eager and devoted to his Service, that it will ſoon bring him to neglect GOD's Ordinances and Sanctuary, and at laſt induce a total Deadneſs and Inſenſibility to all the Duties and Pleaſures of Religion. And thus does he habitually forget to ſanctify the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to honour GOD's holy Name, and to tread the Courts of the Lord's Houſe; gradually ſinking into a State of ſpiritual Sloth and Irreligion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming <hi>an Alien from the Commonwealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and a Stranger to the Covenants of Promiſe, having no Hope, and being without GOD in the World.</hi> Epheſ. ii. 12.</p>
            <p>THUS exceeding great and grievous is the Guilt, contracted by this crying and execrable Sin of Gaming. I hope, that a juſt Indignation againſt a Vice, ſo profligate and irreligious, and ſo produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Sin and Evil;—ſo unrighteous in itſelf and injurious to our Neighbour, ſo hurtful to our Country and deſtructive of all honeſt Labour and Induſtry, ſo prejudicial to our Fortunes and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ſo pernicious to ourſelves both in Soul and Body, and above all ſo madly audacious and affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to GOD;—I hope, I ſay, that a juſt Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt ſo infamous and deteſtable a Vice, may plead ſufficiently in my Excuſe, for any Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Reflection, or Bitterneſs of Language, that may have fallen from me. I am ſure, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to our Country did ever give me ſo much Grief and Concern, as to obſerve this Frenzy grow, as it hath done of late, and ſo mightily prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006939_0024_102A9C5C93426B80"/>us. It has ſeized, without Exception, upon all Ranks and Conditions of our People; and hath equally infected <hi>the high and low, rich and poor, one with another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND what is the ſaddeſt Circumſtance of the Whole, all this hath happened in Deſpite and Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of excellent Laws againſt it, and by the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Example of thoſe very Perſons, who, by their Stations and Oaths, and by every other Reaſon of Duty and Intereſt, are bound to reſtrain and puniſh it. And we of the Miniſtry will lift up our Voice in vain, and may ſpeak, and preach, and print, againſt it without the leaſt Effect, as long as it hath to ſupport it the Countenance and Example of Perſons of Wealth and Eminence. For I have long obſerved by a melancholy Experience, that the beſt written Diſcourſe, nay even the plaineſt and moſt important Inſtances of Duty, will loſe all their Weight and Influence with the Generality of the People, if they are contradicted by the Lives and Converſations, or even by the unmannerly Scoffs and irreverent Gibes, of their rich and powerful Neighbours. As therefore, I believe, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, that this Madneſs firſt got Footing among us, and ſpread itſelf by the Practice and Example of Perſons of Fortune and Diſtinction; ſo will it chiefly lie upon them, to apply proper Remedies, and to put an effectual Stop, to it's Rage and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity. And this they are loudly called upon to do, as they will anſwer it to GOD and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. For GOD cannot but be highly provoked by ſuch a complicated Scene of Vice and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the Gaming Table preſents. And there is
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006939_0025_102A9C5E57BB60E0"/>ſcarce any other Vice to be found, ſo vaſtly perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ruinous to a Country, as this of Gaming. It draws after it a long and diſmal Train of other Crimes. Sharping, Robbing, Luxury, Drinking, Rioting, Lewdneſs, Duelling, with other ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Peccadilloes, commonly ſerve and attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this grand and maſter Vice. So vaſtly prolific in Sin, and fruitful of Crimes, is this iniquitous Practice; and ſo directly deſtructive of all good Manners and ſound Morality among a People!</p>
            <p>IF therefore Gentlemen would but ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and follow the Dictates of their Reaſon, this unrighteous Cuſtom would ſoon be diſcountenanced and diſcarded among us. For certainly, above all Things, it is very prejudicial and diſgraceful to a Gentleman. It degrades and brings him down to the Level of every Scoundrel; who, if he has the Raſhneſs and Reſolution to venture a large Sum of Money upon the Caſt of a Dye, immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences a Man of Spirit; and without any other ſingle good Quality to recommend him, is admitted as a fit Companion among Perſons of the higheſt Dignity and moſt conſpicuous Fortune. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the little Arts and mean Tricking of Gaming muſt be quite below the Character of a true Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who does not only act up to the ſtrict Rules of Virtue and Honeſty, but is governed by a ſtill higher Principle of Honour; which implies a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Nobleneſs and Generoſity of Sentiment and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, that ſoars above every Appearance of Evil, and ſcorns, that the leaſt Stain ſhould be caſt upon, or Cavil raiſed againſt it.</p>

THERE are indeed very good and wholeſome Laws at preſent ſubſiſting againſt this Practice, which only fail in the Execution. But whether there may not be ſome farther and more effectual Remedies found againſt it, I ſhall leave to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Conſideration of our Legiſlature to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. I ſhall only ſay that there is no reigning Evil among us at preſent, ſo virulent and outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and which ſeems ſo greatly to demand their Regard and healing Hand, as this of Gaming; nor any Thing, wherein they can do their Country a more real and ſubſtantial Service, than by putting an effectual Stop to it.</p>
            <p>AS for my Part, I am deeply ſenſible of my Inability to do any great Good towards the Cure of this deadly Contagion. However, being by my Station in GOD's Church, <hi>ſet as a Watchman upon the Wall,</hi> I will not be <hi>a dumb Dog, that cannot bark; that ſleepeth, lyeth down, and loveth to ſlumber,</hi> Iſa. lvi. 10. But according to the Words of the ſame Prophet, Iſa. lxii. 6. <hi>I will never keep Silence, nor hold my Peace, Day nor Night,</hi> againſt ſo vile and flagitious a Practice.— And to conclude with the patriot Words and noble Admonition of the Prophet <hi>Samuel: As for me GOD forbid, that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you;</hi> or in neglecting to <hi>teach you the good and the right Way. Only fear the Lord, and ſerve him in Truth with all your Heart; for conſider, how great Things he hath done for you. But if ye ſhall ſtill do wickedly, ye ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006939_0027_102A9C6525185680"/>both ye and your Leaders,</hi> 1 Sam. xii. 23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NOW unto him, that is able to keep you from falling, and to preſent you faultleſs, before the Preſence of his Glory, with exceeding Joy,—To the only wiſe GOD our Saviour, be Glory and Majeſty, Dominion and Power, both now and evermore. Amen.</hi> Jude xxiv. 25.</p>
