            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>JOB V. 12—16.</bibl>
               <q>He diſappointeth the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot perform their enterprize. He taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs: and the counſel of the froward is carried headlong. They meet with darkneſs in the day time, and grope in the noon day as in the night. But he ſaveth the poor from the ſword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. So the poor hath hope, and iniquity ſtoppeth her mouth.</q>

            <p>WHEN we conſider the works of God, compoſed of the material and intellectual ſyſtems, with their varying orders, conſtitutions and operations of being; they give us a moſt grand idea of the immenſity and infinite perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the creator. Univerſal nature is conſtituted with ſuch wiſdom, and adorned with ſo many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that the Father of it muſt be a Being, in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf glorious and wiſe infinitely above our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:017002_0003_0F9ED071B3D1E650"/>
LOOKING back to the time of creation, when divine council brought forth, and completed the birth of nature, we are apt to conceive it a period the moſt filled with divine glory of any which hath happened; containing more bright diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the God-head, than any which have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; and that there was in that work ſome more immediate exertions of his power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than have ſince been generally exerciſed. Doubtleſs that period and work did contain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of ſuch immenſe perfection, as will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever delight and aſtoniſh all his rational and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous creatures; but then, I imagine, we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conceive the time of creation, as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a new aera, of which every ſucceeding part is as glorious, and as much filled with marks and diſplays of God's infinite perfection, as the firſt was. When ſupreme power, wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had given exiſtence to created nature; the way was prepared for the ſame perfections to be exerciſed in preſerving, governing and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its ſeveral parts and powers, to the purpoſes for which they were deſigned, both in his natural and moral government.</p>
            <p>THE univerſal and conſtant providence of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, is as bright a diſplay of himſelf as creation was. Inattention and irreligion are the principal reaſons it is not thus conceived. The univerſe, the material and intellectual ſyſtems, with all their parts and all their powers, are under a conſtant direction of the Deity. He not only upholds the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017002_0004_0F9ED07280D954B8"/>
ſecondary powers or ſecond cauſes which are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating; but points them to the ends which he hath in deſign, in ſuch a manner, that an attentive and pious mind cannot overlook his agency.</p>
            <p>COULD we comprehend the divine plan—could we look through the ſcheme of Heaven, we ſhould doubtleſs ſee that all natural events, all political events, and all the wiſdom of this world, are permitted and deſigned by the Moſt High, for the benefit of his moral government, to diſplay his own glory, and bring eventual perfection and bleſſedneſs to the univerſe. The doctrines of the Holy Scripture confirm theſe ideas—they teach us that thoſe natural events, which in our view have the ſmalleſt poſſible influence, even the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a hair from our heads, do not happen without a divine ordering; and if there be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular direction of heaven therein, infinite wiſdom means thereby to accompliſh ſome important end. If there be a divine direction in all thoſe moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute events, how glorious, and of what infinite energy muſt be the conſtant exertions of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head! which operate upon the whole, keeping all the parts in order, and directing them to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt final perfection. This view of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence gives us as venerable an idea of the GREAT SUPREME, as we can have from conſidering him the ſelf-exiſtent GOD, and creator of the univerſe—This view of the ſubject teaches us, that a ſtudy of divine providence is one of the moſt important and improving Chriſtian duties; one of the beſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017002_0005_0F9ED07335AAFF98"/>
means for acquiring juſt apprehenſions of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine character and will, and for exciting adoration, Chriſtian reliance and gratitude. Men's luſts are ſo oppoſed, not only to God and truth, but to the happineſs and moſt eſſential privileges of human nature; that if there were not a conſtant <hi>ſuperior influence,</hi> controuling the whole, all order, peace, improvement and civil and ſocial rights would be loſt in the confuſion and violence of iniquity. Theſe providential influences are meant in the ſcriptures, when they ſpeak of the Lord bringing light out of darkneſs, and order out of confuſion—the wrathful exertions of men, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, are over-ruled to praiſe him and promote his cauſe, the remainder of wrath he reſtraineth.</p>
            <p>THE MOST HIGH hath exerciſed a ſpecial agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, through every age of the world, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his church; which is the reaſon that the gates of hell, and the deſigns of wicked men, have never prevailed againſt it. Many events happen in ſo ſingular and extraordinary a manner, that is is impoſſible a devout mind ſhould not ſee in them the hand of a GOD. The ordering of things is often ſuch, though we cannot call it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, as to carry evidence of a divine interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, nearly equal to any miracle which could be wrought. A people or individuals experiencing ſuch interpoſitions in their favor, ought publicly and fervently to adore, the wiſdom and goodneſs by which they are preſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017002_0006_0F9ED07423C84F10"/>
THE duties to which we are particularly direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this day, are the moſt devout GRATITUDE and THANKSGIVING to the GOD of HEAVEN, both for public and private bleſſings. No ſubject of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is more proper to quicken our devotion, than a recollection of that kind and conſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, by which our land and its intereſts have been preſerved, in the midſt of great dangers; and at ſundry times, in ſuch ways as have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated a divine interference. <hi>The works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein; and he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR text points us to a particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of that providential agency, which bringeth down the proud feelings and high looks of men, and deſtroyeth the deſigns of the wicked, who are powerful, crafty, and wiſe to do evil. <hi>He diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot perform their enterprize.</hi> The higheſt wrought policy of men is ſtopped in its courſe—the gradual and irreſiſtable execution of the divine counſel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts their meaſures, by enfeebling their hand, and enervating the inſtruments on which they depend. <hi>He taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs, and the counſel of the froward is carried headlong.</hi> The policy they uſe is often overruled to baffle itſelf, or to take themſelves in the ſnare, which was layed for others; ſo that their higheſt expectations fall headlong into ruin. <hi>They meet with darkneſs in the day time</hi>—where they did not expect it. Thinking their deſigns
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017002_0007_0F9ED074B45D7CB0"/>
wiſely concerted, and ſo powerfully ſupported that they cannot fail; the Almighty interpoſes at an unexpected time, and by unexpected means ſhews that the weakeſt inſtruments, under his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, are more powerful than the craftineſs, wiſdom and ſtrength of man.</p>
            <p>IN this way, <hi>He ſaveth the poor from the ſword, from their mouths, and from the hand of the mighty—So that the poor hath hope, and iniquity ſtoppeth her mouth.</hi> So that thoſe who are engaged in a righteous cauſe, whatever difficulties aſſault them, ought notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to truſt in the Lord, who can deliver in his own way by his own inſtruments, and in his own time—So that thoſe who contemn the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending influence of Jehovah, and deſpiſe divine and human obligations are compelled to ſtop their mouths; being convinced by his glorious works, that there is a God who protects ſuch as truſt in him, and holds in his hand the reins of univerſal government.</p>
            <p>You remember, my brethren, the extraordinary inſtance of Ahitophel's counſel being turned into fooliſhneſs.—King David in circumſtances almoſt deſperate, ſtriving againſt the rebellion of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful ſon, and accompanied by a faithful, but ſmall band, was flying from place to place, for his own perſonal ſafety.—Ahitophel was a politic man, full of ſtratagem, and renowned for the ſoundeſt wiſdom; <hi>ſo that his counſel, which he counſelled in thoſe days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God.</hi> Had the traiterous Abſolom, who was at this time in great force, adopted his advice, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017002_0008_0F9ED075741A6100"/>
followed hard upon his royal father, while his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were ſmall and fatigued, they muſt in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability have fallen an eaſy prey. By a particular influence of heaven, Abſolom was inclined to adopt other counſel, which was given on purpoſe for his deſtruction. A ſhort delay afforded time for the country to riſe, and ſave their injured and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſovereign, from an unnatural deſtruction. Thus Abſolom's affairs ſuddenly ſunk from the faireſt proſpects, into irretrievable ruin—this was the work and influence of GOD!</p>
            <p>PERMIT me to remind you of another inſtance, which is likewiſe recorded in the ſcripture—the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of Iſrael by the elevation of Mordecai, and the fall of Haman. Mordecai was a Jew, and the only one who was capable of being the patron of his people, who were then in captivity, ſubjected to the ſevereſt bondage—Haman was a proud, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical favorite at the Babylonian court, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly deſigning to deſtroy the Jews, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the moſt cruel means for their total extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—He had even built the gallows, upon which he deſigned Mordecai their chief man ſhould be hanged, ſo ſanguine were his expectations! What he eſteemed a private affront was the ground of his enmity againſt the whole nation; and as a means of revenge, and to diſpoſſeſs them of the royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, he accuſed their religious laws and inſtitutions, which diſtinguiſhed them from all other people, and which they obſerved for the honor of Jehovah, even in their captive ſtate. The Lord, whoſe eye
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017002_0009_0F9ED076B5487508"/>
ſeeth all things, beheld and determined to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf, his inſtitutions and his people, and he diſconcerted the infernal deſign by a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of events, apparently unintereſting in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but in the connexion his infinite wiſdom ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged them, ſufficient for the great deſign. It ſo happened on a certain night, that the king could not ſleep—for his entertainment and probably to invite repoſe, he ordered the book of records to be read—It was found recorded, that in former time Mordecai had detected and diſcloſed a treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the life of the king; and upon enquiry that he had never beeen rewarded. God inclined him to reward this inſtance of fidelity, though it had been long forgoten. It was propoſed to Haman, <hi>What ſhould be done to the man whom the king delighted to honor?</hi> He propoſed the moſt extravagant ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, proudly thinking to receive them himſelf, and was ordered immediately to confer them on Mordecai—this turned the balance, and from that hour, every event concured for Haman's deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, until he died in the place prepared for Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai, who ſucceeded him in the royal favor, and the Jews were delivered. That one ſleepleſs hour of the king, was a neceſſary link in the chain of means for Iſrael's deliverance. Who may not ſee the hand and counſel of the LORD in all this!—Human life is full of ſuch interpoſitions; whereby the counſel of the froward is carried headlong, thoſe who cannot defend themſelves preſerved, and iniquity obliged to ſtop its mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:017002_0010_0F9ED0776B6519B0"/>
LET us next take notice of GOD's dealings with us his people. We ought piouſly and gratefully to recognize the divine influence, and ordering of events, ſince the commencement of the war in which we are now engaged. The God of heaven hath marvelouſly wrought for us! Sometimes by dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and infatuating the counſel of our enemies—Sometimes wonderfully interpoſing to derange their meaſures and break their force—Sometimes by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring our people with an irreſiſtable enthuſiaſm, which dares to attempt and execute the greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes—Sometimes by affording us ſupplies in an extraordinary way, which no ordinary means could procure—and often by diſcovering the ſnare which was laid in darkneſs, and obſerved only by his eye which ſeeth in the darkneſs, as in the light.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems that divine counſel hath ſome great deſings to accompliſh in this land. The pious obſerver of his providence may ſee, that from the time of its firſt diſcovery, he hath been preparing the ſtage by the energy of unerring wiſdom, for ſome very grand exhibitions, which will probably diſplay his glory to all the nations of the earth, and improve ſocial happineſs and rights to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree of perfection than hath yet taken place in the world. The manner of its ſettlement is one of the moſt extraordinary events recorded in hiſtory; religion was the motive, and though piety is now much decayed, may we not hope that the intereſts of Meſſiah's kingdom, which influenced the firſt adventurers, ſhall be yet moſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017002_0011_0F9ED0784B911EE0"/>
gloriouſly advanced thereby. Our rapid popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is viewed with wonder, wherever it is known, there is not an inſtance equalling it in the hiſtory of the world. The commencement of the preſent war, was the opening of a new aera, every part of which is filled with wonders, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering that there is a God, who ruleth and doth his pleaſure among the kingdoms of the world. When this controverſy began, not a mind among us anticipated the length to which it would run, nor the great political changes it hath produced.—We viewed it as a family quarrel, which muſt and would be accomodated—in this we judged from our own feelings, being ignorant of God's deſign. It now appears, that the Lord deſigned it for a compleat ſeparation of the Britiſh empire. And conſidering it as fixed by God's appointment, that a ſeparation ſhould take place; may we not ſee his wiſdom and goodneſs to us in determining the time. The event hath been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally eſteemed premature, as haſtened, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for us, by the neceſſity of ſelf-defence.—But is not this a miſtake? We had received every poſſible benefit from the connection, and were beginning to be endangered—we had learned the Britiſh arts—had drank at her fountains of ſcience—made her moſt valuable improvements our own—were rich enough for a virtuous and free State;—and were beginning to import her luxury, effeminacy and irreligion. Had the national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection continued longer, a familiar intercourſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017002_0012_0F9ED07871C16D40"/>
would have introduced into this new country, that declenſion of morals, which hath uſually been produced in an old empire, by their luxury and pride; and the arts of a corrupt court, might have ſeduced ſo many of our own citizens, as to render an emancipation more difficult, even though we had increaſed both in riches and numbers. Thus we ſee the goodneſs and the the care of God, exerciſed for the preſervation of our virtue, even in appointing the time for this ſeparation. And let us not meaſure the councils of Heaven, upon the narrow ſcale of ſelf-regard; the Moſt High is governing the world for the advancement of virtue, and may not this event be propitious to the intereſts of morality in Great-Britain, by dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſome of the ſources of that luxury, which through a great part of the nation, hath effaced almoſt every impreſſion of revealed religion, and of a ſuperintending providence. The Moſt High had the means in readineſs, and in order for the accompliſhment of his own purpoſe—He often raiſes up wicked men as inſtruments to execute what he hath decreed; and in the preſent caſe permitted thoſe, whom we called our fathers and brethren, and whom we reverenced and loved as ſuch, to entertain evil deſigns againſt us—deſigns fraught with impolicy, injuſtice and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>THERE were at that time, wiſe men in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Senate who foreſaw the conſequences, and propheſied the tragic effects, as they have ſince hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, urging their opinions by the united weight
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017002_0013_0F9ED07BD26A4F48"/>
of good policy, juſtice and mercy—but in vain! As in the caſe of Pharoah, ſo in this; the Lord permitted thoſe who held the reins of government, to harden their hearts, and ſhut their eyes againſt wiſdom; probably it was, that he might bring us out from under their dominion with a high hand, and ſo as to diſplay his glory before the nations of the earth. Had not an infatuation been permited it is impoſſible they ſhould have remained ſo long ignorant, of the ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> feelings, and united ſentiments of the people in this country, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from their meaſures, they did—had it not been determinied by the Moſt High, that they ſhould believe a lying ſpirit, it would have been impoſſible to give ſuch credit as they did, to a few evil perſons, who eſcaped from among us, and whoſe own private intereſt led them to deceive. This infatuation and diffuſion for ſeveral years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded the vigorous efforts of our enemies; and was permitted left the ſtorm ſhould gather more faſt, or in greater force, than we were prepared to receive it—this permiſſion of divine providence was kind to us, but fatal to them—thus the <hi>Lord deſtroyeth the wiſdom of the wiſe!</hi> By viewing the ſubſequent ſchemes of Britiſh policy, we may ſee, <hi>how he carried the counſels of the froward headlong;</hi> for it is certain, that moſt of their counſels have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their own heads, and haſtened the events, which they wiſhed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the privileges of our ports, ſuſpending the rights of legiſlation, and annulling by their own ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign acts all the barriers of freedom; ſet before us at once in glaring view, the horrors of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and taught us that liberty was worth contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, through the greateſt ſeverities—Their haughty rejection of our ſuppliant, patient and long-continued applications for redreſs, eraſed from our hearts thoſe filial feelings towards them, which it would have been their higheſt wiſdom to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; and opened our eyes to ſee, that <hi>there is none good but one, that is God,</hi> and that we had, in time paſt, implicitly truſted in them for juſtice and protection, as we ought to have truſted in him alone—Their pronouncing us out of the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their laws, taught us the neceſſity of ſeeking it, in an <hi>Independent Conſtitution</hi> of our own—Their employing a foreign mercenary force, gave us good grounds for applying, and other European nations for interfering in the controverſy, and aſſiſting us—Since they deigned to make over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for conciliation, every propoſal hath been ſo marked with inſidiouſneſs and pride, as to unite us more firmly inſtead of dividing, which they wiſhed; and teach us that there is no hand, beſide that of the Almighty, in which we can truſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſafety.</p>
            <p>I MENTION theſe inſtances, to exemplify the providence of GOD in carrying the counſel of the froward headlong, and permitting them to adopt meaſures, which haſtened what they meant to prevent.</p>

NEXT let us view the events which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in our own country, and ſee in them both the wonderful influences and interpoſition of the MOST MERCIFUL. To what cauſe, but the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate influence of Jehovah, can we impute the aſtoniſhing union, both of ſentiment and feeling, which pervaded through the whole American em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, though of prodigious extent, and divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many provinces; each of which had its ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate legiſlature, its own ideas of law and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and its own peculiar manners, cuſtoms and jealouſies. A ſympathy unfelt before, inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and reciprocally circulated, by which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of every part were felt and reſented through the whole—when ſome of the firſt miniſterial mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were ſpeciouſly covered and deſigned to be enforced by our own luxury; the whole body of the people ſeemed to have an intuitive view of the conſequences which would follow, if they received the alluring bait, and determined to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any gratification, rather than admit a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent which might be drawn into dangerous prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice hereafter. When ſuch wiſdom, foreſight and union, are found in the whole body of a people circumſtanced as we then were; they muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the extraordinary influences of the Most High.</p>
            <p>THE ſame energy of heaven, which had before given union and the moſt ſympathetic feelings through the whole; when the time for enterprize and action was come, waked up a moſt aſtoniſhing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017002_0016_0F9ED07E744C0020"/>
enthuſiaſm in the minds of every order, claſs and condition of people; by which many things were attempted, and many performed, which in ſome meaſure ſupplied our deficiencies and want of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent military preparations. It was the Lord who raiſed up and inſpired the country with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a commander, who was formed by his own infinite wiſdom, on purpoſe for the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of vindicating American freedom.—Our eaſtern coaſt was moſt impregnable, both by its natural ſituation, and poſition of ground, and the unanimity of its inhabitants, and could by no means be eſteemed a key to the country; on all which accounts it was the moſt improper place, the enemy could have choſen to open the bloody ſcene: And had they inſtead of that occupied the poſition they now hold, where a naval force may co-operate with and defend one on the land, a ſingle campaign in the unprepared ſituation we then were, might have decided the whole conteſt.—The LORD directed where they ſhould attempt, that they might be baffled! Some of the firſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary rencounters, though bloody, were ordered by infinite wiſdom to check the rage of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſhew them that they had undertaken a ſerious taſk; and at the ſame time teach us our own conſequence in the field, and that we were able, under GOD, to defend ourſelves.</p>
            <p>SOON after the commencement of hoſtilities, when we were upon the brink of deſtruction, through want of military ſtores and the habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of war: Providence threw into our hands,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017002_0017_0F9ED07F386F8A50"/>
by the capture of a ſtore-ſhip, the very neceſſaries which we moſt wanted—An interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven, which ought never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten! Several times ſince we have had ſupplies, both of cloathing and proviſion, ſent in the ſame manner, at the time when, and to the places where they were needed.—The prodigious number of captures made from the enemy upon the ſeas, hath generally afforded us a comfortable ſupply of foreign articles; which appears ſurprizing when we conſider the greatneſs of their naval force, and the ſmallneſs and inexperience of our own; and ſhews us that the Lord directeth in all theſe things. In the ſecond year of the war, a formidable naval and land force was ſent againſt one of the moſt ſouthern States in the confederacy: As things were then circumſtanced with that country, any conſiderable ſucceſs of the enemy, muſt have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached ſeveral States from the union, and been much more fatal to our cauſe, than their late ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the ſame parts can be.—He who directeth the events of war, determined that the deſign ſhould be defeated for that time, in a moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing manner, by a body of men haſtily drawn together, and whom they viewed with contempt.—</p>
            <p>THERE have been ſeveral gloomy periods, in which the arm of the LORD and the counſel of the ALMIGHTY, have wrought ſalvation for us, in a wonderful manner.</p>
            <p>WE remember the time, after the conqueſt of a conſiderable part of the States of New-York and New-Jerſey, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> force,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017002_0018_0F9ED07FF1C05FB8"/>
fluſhed with victory, and aiming towards the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of our councils—Our army, except a brave handful, was diſbanded, and every thing in a ſtate of diſtraction.—In this hour of great deciſion, when, as the country was circumſtanced, a few weeks of vigorous action muſt have determined the fate of America; our enemy were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to diſcern the importance of the moment! Thinking the work done, and ſitting down to eat and drink the ſpoils of cruelty, they were taken in their own craftineſs.</p>
            <p>PLEASE to turn your attention to the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing campaign. The Britiſh force in America was then very great; compoſed of two grand arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the northern and ſouthern. One of the moſt fortunate events we could then wiſh, was ſuch a deſtination of thoſe two formidable powers, that they might not act in concert, and bring their united efforts to a point, and thus form a ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the northern and ſouthern States. By ſome influence their councils were darkened! Providence led their ſouthern armament from the moſt important place of action, by a lengthy rout through the waters of Virginia, where more than a year was ſpent without any thing decided, and that great force was finally obliged to quit its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and return with ignominy.</p>
            <p>IN the north, appearances were more gloomy, for a ſeaſon a cloud roſe ſo black that all coutenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces gathered paleneſs—every thing that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in that quarter, for a long time before, was calculated to inſpire the enemy with precipitation
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017002_0019_0F9ED080B3C138C8"/>
and a raſh confidence—they poſſeſſed themſelves of thoſe fortreſſes on which we depended, in ſuch a manner as wrought their pride and preſumption to the higheſt pitch—the Lord was preparing them for a fall! He allured them into a ſnare from which they could never eſcape! By means the moſt different from human concerting, he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their whole armament into our hands, and brought wonderful ſalvation to our country. This was the Lord's work and marvelous in our eyes! and prepared the way for our being known and acknowledged among the nations as brethren.</p>
            <p>THERE has been at many times, and in divers ways, a ſurprizing interpoſition of providence, in the diſcovery of treaſons and conſpiracies againſt the ſtate, and its moſt important ſervants. I ſhall mention only one, which is a recent inſtance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and ought to be remembered this day, with the moſt devout gratitude. The diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a traiterous plot which had been for a long time concerting and maturing in the cabinet of darkneſs, under the nuture of inſtruments vile enough for the perpetration of any crime, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever repugnant to the laws of God and nature—this conſpiracy was ſo ripe for execution, that a day or two more intervening before the diſcovery, might have ſealed the doom of America, by the maſſacre of our brave and virtuous commander, and many others who have diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in defence of the country; and the key to our territories, our magazines, our arſenals, our ſoldiery in the hands of an inſulting foe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:017002_0020_0F9ED08174EA95C8"/>
WAS it not the God of heaven who preſerved us in this danger? ſurely it was. The treaſon was arranged—it was ripe for execution—the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal inſtrument of treachery, was one prepared for any wickedneſs, and placed by the unſuſpecting confidence of his country, in a ſituation, and with full power to accompliſh his deſign—the whole was hid from man—how awful is that hour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſpective view! The Lord ſaw, and he wondered that there was no deliverer, therefore his own arm brought ſalvation, and his wiſdom ſaved us! He directed the ſteps of a triumvirate of virtuous young citizens, to an unfrequented ſtation—His providence placed them as a centry, to take the man, who had been a principal emiſſary in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing the plot; and thus the diſcovery was made, which ſaved our country from a deſtruction in proſpect of which the enemy already exulted. Let us praiſe him who directeth the times and the ſeaſons—he liveth forever, his dominion is from everlaſting to everlaſting—all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before him—He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can ſay to him what doeſt thou. The inſtances I have mentioned, are only a few from among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in which the kind direction, influence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of providence might be obſerved—the ſubject is far too copious for the limits of a ſingle diſcourſe, and to treat it juſtly, requires much greater diſcernment than I f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>el myſelf to poſſeſs—The works of God's providence, are immenſe as
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017002_0021_0F9ED0824BDC4528"/>
his nature; and happy are thoſe, who by a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his operations, are led to adore and love his being, and rejoice in his government—we ought, my brethren, to review the great events which have taken place within a few years paſt, not ſo much to gratify curioſity, as that we may ſee in them the greatneſs, holineſs and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jehovah.</p>
            <p>OUGHT we not likewiſe this day to recognize divine goodneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in providing us with plenty of food—our ſtores are filled with good things; and though ſome part of the ſeaſon was ſuch as excited our apprehenſions, the event hath taught us they were groundleſs, and that the Lord can direct the ſeaſons better than man—It is very common, that we ſinfully ſuſpect and are jealous of Providence, while God is ordering nature, in the beſt manner, to give us a rich ſupply.</p>
            <p>LET us remember with gratitude, the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary health, which hath attended us through the year paſt. I preſume the oldeſt perſon in this place, cannot recollect an inſtance of ſo little ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſo few deaths. Some of our friends have been taken from us, but the proportion, compared with our numbers, is ſmall; and ſo far as I have heard, the like extraordinary health hath prevailed both in our armies and among the people in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. While we rejoice in the preſervation of life and health another year, let us not wax wanton and forget our mortality. Sickneſs and death muſt come—the ſolemn decree, <hi>duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi> muſt be accompliſhed—the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017002_0022_0F9ED082F2720830"/>
Lord grant that we may all live in readineſs for the change.</p>
            <p>THE bleſſings which have been mentioned, great as they can be repreſented, are but temporal and worldly favors—they are only the ſmalleſt of God's benefits, and only valuable as they aſſiſt us to glorify him, ſerve our fellow men, and prepare for eternity. With what fervent gratitude, we ought to adore the wiſdom and mercy which hath brought life and immortality to light! Which pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties us under a moſt awful condemnation and death, and offers pardon through the atonement which Jeſus made by the ſheding of his own blood—which invites us to become parties to the covenant of grace, and receive the remiſſion of ſin and the ſanctification of our natures, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling influences of the HOLY GHOST—which hath given us many great and precious promiſes, offering to make us partakers of a divine nature, and heirs of glory together with CHRIST—which ſets before us the bleſſedneſs of heaven, the Lord himſelf to be our portion. Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael who hath viſited and redeemed us—who hath raiſed up an horn of ſalvation for us in the houſe of his ſervant David. Let us therefore ſerve before him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of our lives.</p>
            <p>I CONCLUDE with ſome very brief remarks by way of inferrence.</p>
            <p>1ſt. WE are taught to adore GOD's providence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his government of the world as a moſt illuſtrious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his glorious nature. The events which take place before our eyes, are parts of a plan moſt highly wrought, by
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017002_0023_0F9ED083B247B058"/>
infinite wiſdom, goodneſs and juſtice. By reaſon of the depth of his deſigns and works, and the ſcantineſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man underſtanding, we know but a ſmall portion of his ways. But that his agency might not be forgotten, ſome inſtances are ſo ordered as to flaſh conviction upon the mind, that nature in its minuteſt operations, is under the direction of a God, who by ſmall cauſes is producing great events, and accompliſhing moſt important purpoſes in his moral kingdom.</p>
            <p>2d. WE are taught to whom the glory of every ſalvation is to be attributed. We have conſidered ſome inſtances of deliverance, which are manifeſtly the effects of a divine interpoſition and the ſpecial ordering of heaven. Theſe inſtances were deſigned by God to bear teſtimony for himſelf, that he is the author of every ſalvation; and tho' we do not ſee his hand ſo clearly in all, they are nevertheleſs his work. On the other hand, we ſhould remember that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity cometh not out of the duſt, but was appointed and is accompliſhed by all ſearching wiſdom, to anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of his own council.</p>
            <p>3dly. WE are taught not to truſt in ourſelves—not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on our own wiſdom and ſtrength. To exerciſe our own power and wiſdom for preſervation, and for obtaining all needed bleſſings, is an indiſpenſable duty, and the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard hath no reaſon to expect God will ſave him; but when this is done we ſhould look to the Almighty to give efficacy to our endeavors, to preſerve, bleſs and proſper.</p>
            <p>IF we truſt in the arm of man, or the wiſdom of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Lord will confound them; for it is his uſual courſe to bring low the proud and exalt the humble, that all the earth may know the Lord reigneth.</p>
            <p>IF, my brethren, we deſign to invite the divine protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let us rejoice that the Lord reigneth, and commend ourſelves and the public to his holy protection and keeping—let us be juſt, and merciful, and honeſt, and humble ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God's providence—let us do our duty to our country ourſelves and poſterity, and then look to him who hath ſo often wrought gloriouſly in our favor, for the continuance of his goodneſs—that he would make our land glorious and a praiſe through the whole earth, and that he would finally receive us to his bleſſed kingdom.</p>
