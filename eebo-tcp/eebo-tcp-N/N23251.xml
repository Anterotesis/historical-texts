            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>NEHEMIAH V. 19.</bibl>
               <q>Think upon me, my GOD, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is the language of a ruler, who was an ardent lover of his nation. He had done much for the people over whom he was placed, and had the ſatisfaction ariſing from a conſciouſneſs, that he had ſerved them from the beſt principles and the pureſt motives. He could appeal to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030738_0005_0FE8D66536621A98"/>
God, to whom he had reſpect in the diſcharge of the duties of his office, and with comfort hope in him for that reward in his favor, which he hath graciouſly encouraged all, who do well, to expect. Happy are thoſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who, like NEHEMIAH, have the intereſt of their people at heart, and under the habitual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the fear of God, and with a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regard to his approbation, exert themſelves for the promotion of their welfare! Happy is that people that is diſtinguiſhed with ſuch ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers!</p>
            <p>IN the following diſcourſe, I propoſe, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the occaſion of the preſent meeting, and the ideas ſuggeſted by the paſſage juſt read, to conſider the deſign of civil government, and the importance of religion in thoſe, to whom the adminiſtration of it is committed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> LET us conſider briefly, the deſign of the inſtitution of civil government.</p>
            <p>THIS is intimated in the text to be the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the people: <hi>According to all that I have done for this people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>COULD men have been as ſecure in their lives and properties, and enjoyed equal happineſs in a ſtate of nature, as in a ſtate of ſociety, civil pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030738_0006_0FE8D66CABB04BB0"/>
would never have been erected among them. It is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that any number of men, inhabiting any portion of the earth, would ever have come into an agreement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh ſome of their natural rights as individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals, and to ſubmit to certain laws deriving their authority from ſuch agreement, without a view to their greater advantage—to the more effectual ſecurity of their moſt valuable rights, liberties and privileges.</p>
            <p>MAN is formed for ſociety. Such are his fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulties—his natural deſires, inclinations and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, that he would be uneaſy without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with his fellow-creatures.—Such his weakneſs and his wants, that without their aid, he could not exiſt comfortably, if he could exiſt at all. And ſuch are the luſts of men, from whence come wars and fightings, that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would always be in danger from the ſtronger, without the protection of laws, which numbers agree to adopt and ſupport, for their mutual ſafety and advantage.</p>
            <p>THIS being the caſe, nothing is more natural and reaſonable, than that numbers ſhould aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate for the defence, aſſiſtance and improvement of one another. And though, by ſuch aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they put themſelves out of a ſtate of natural
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030738_0007_0FE8D66E43F3EEB0"/>
freedom, they are richly compenſated therefor, by the numerous important benefits to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only in a ſtate of civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>THE end of the appointment of civil rulers cannot be their own perſonal honor and emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the benefit of thoſe over whom they are placed. Rulers are made for the nation, and not the nation for rulers.</p>
            <p>As members of ſociety, they are to enjoy in common with others, the advantages reſulting from the ſocial compact. As rulers, they are entitled to an honourable ſupport, and to all that reſpect and eſteem, which the dignity of their ſtations and the importance of their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces render fit and proper. They are not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to ſeek their own ſeparate intereſt, but the intereſt and welfare of the community.</p>
            <p>THESE dictates of nature and reaſon, the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of revelation ſtrengthen and confirm. In the book of inſpiration it is expreſsly ſaid of the civil ruler, "He is the miniſter of God to thee for good. Rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil. They are God's miniſters, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending continually upon this very thing."</p>
            <p>THE benevolent author of our exiſtence—of our capacities and all the means of improvement
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030738_0008_0FE8D675D09BF400"/>
and happineſs, in the directions he has given in his word, reſpecting the qualifications and duties of rulers, as well as correſpondent conduct of the people, has an evident view to the good of ſociety—that the members in general, "may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godlineſs and honeſty."</p>
            <p>VARIOUS are the forms and conſtitutions of government, which the different genius, prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, circumſtances, ſituations and cuſtoms of men, have led them to frame and adopt. That in juſtly accounted the moſt eligible for a partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular people, which is beſt adapted, under their circumſtances, to promote and ſecure the great end for which magiſtracy is appointed. But no form of government can enſure happineſs to a people, unleſs it be well adminiſtered.</p>
            <p>A CONSTITUTION, in many reſpects defect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive, in the hands of an able and upright admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration, may be rendered ſubſervient to the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proſperity of a people. Whereas, a far more perfect form of government, in the hands of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of an oppoſite character, will fail of affording the citizens that protection and ſecurity, that peace and quietneſs, without which they cannot but be miſerable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:030738_0009_0FE8D677B0236128"/>
IF theſe obſervations be juſt, what a poſt of importance is that of the civil magiſtrate! His elevated ſtation, as it is a ſtation of honor, is alſo one of labor and high reſponſibility; and it will be no further honorable to him, than as he fills it with dignity, and uſefulneſs to the public.</p>
            <p>THE care of thoſe things which reſpect the welfare of a great people requires the cloſe and unintermitted attention of the civil ruler. To attend to their ſituation with regard to other powers—to provide for their defence againſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign invaſion and internal ſedition—to ſecure thoſe advantages that may juſtly be derived from an intercourſe with other nations—to attend to the internal ſtate of the commonwealth—to its fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances—to its agriculture—commerce—manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures—morals—learning and religion; to make ſuch alteration in the laws, or ſuch new ones, as the varying circumſtances of the country, ſtate, towns and corporations, may render expedient, and take effectual care to have them executed, is a moſt laborious and difficult employment. Such a variety of great, intereſting and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated buſineſs cannot be properly performed but by men of ſuperior ability, knowledge and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, firmneſs and integrity.</p>
            <p>THEY who are called to ſuſtain the weight of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030738_0010_0FE8D67F1CAF9120"/>
government, and to manage the great affairs of the ſtate and nation, need the united influence of every argument and motive, adapted to ſtrengthen and invigorate the human mind, and to encourage and animate them in their arduous work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I PROCEED to conſider the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of religion in the civil ruler. <hi>Think upon me, my God, for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS requeſt, in connexion with what it is grounded upon in the latter part of the text, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that NEHEMIAH had acted under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of religion, in his public character—that the great things he had done for the people over whom he ruled, were the fruit of a pious regard to GOD, and a firm belief in his promiſes.</p>
            <p>RELIGION is of high importance in a ruler, as an incentive to fidelity, in the diſcharge of the duties of his ſtation—as it will lead him to ſeek the direction and aſſiſtance of Heaven—as it will afford him the beſt ſupport under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of his office, and cauſe him, by his precepts and example, to do much for the promotion of piety and virtue among the people.</p>
            <p>GREAT abilities, through indolence and a love of eaſe, may lie uſeleſs in a ruler. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030738_0011_0FE8D680AD3E0030"/>
will derive little or no benefit from them, unleſs he is poſſeſſed of a principle ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently active to bring them into operation, and ſufficiently virtuous to direct their operation for the public good.</p>
            <p>As ſuperior talents in an exalted ſtation render a man capable of doing ſignal ſervice for the community, ſo they render him capable of doing as ſignal miſchief. Nothing, like a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of religion deeply imbibed in the heart, can ſecure him from the one, or prompt him to the other.</p>
            <p>OTHER and lower principles, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, have influenced, and may influence, men to do many beneficial deeds for their nation, and greatly promote their quietneſs and proſperity.</p>
            <p>BUT theſe principles—ſuch as honor, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a natural benevolence of temper, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the continued enjoyment of the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a public office, are too contracted to reach many caſes, with which the happineſs of ſociety is intimately and eſſentially connected, and have not that force requiſite to produce an even, ſteady and conſiſtent courſe of action.</p>
            <p>THE ruler, who is not under the prevailing influence of the fear and love of GOD, and that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030738_0012_0FE8D68832FFD110"/>
love of mankind which is an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant of the love of GOD, is always in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of betraying his truſt, and involving the community in miſery and ruin. Temptations to do wrong, when they make a vigorous aſſualt upon him (and none are more expoſed to tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, than thoſe, who are in elevated ſtations) will be likely to meet with a feeble, if any reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He will not be deterred from a meaſure however injurious it may be to individuals, or deſtructive in its tendency to the intereſt of his country, when, by going into it, he can gratify his avarice, or ſave himſelf from preſent infamy, and preſerve the favour of a majority of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents.</p>
            <p>SUCH may frequently be the ſituation of things, that the civil ruler cannot, in conformity to the dictates of an enlightened underſtanding, and a benevolent heart, purſue ſuch conduct, as will greatly conduce to the advantage of the community, without expoſing himſelf to certain reproach, and hazarding the loſs of his official exiſtence.</p>
            <p>BUT he, and he only, who, regarding the praiſe of GOD more than the praiſe of men, is ſolicitouſly concerned to approve himſelf to that glorious BEING, who ſtandeth in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mighty and judgeth among the Gods,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030738_0013_0FE8D689CA3E5C38"/>
is to be depended on in all ſeaſons. In ſeaſons the moſt trying nothing can warp him from his duty. Having accepted an important truſt, he is deeply concerned to diſcharge it with all fidelity. He feels himſelf accountable to God, whoſe eye is continually upon him. The fear of man, which bringeth a ſnare, is ſwallowed up by the greater fear of that great and terrible BEING, with whom are all the poſſible cauſes, of life and death—of happineſs and miſery.</p>
            <p>CHARMED with the character of the DEITY who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and cannot look on ſin, whoſe goodneſs is his glory, he has an ardent deſire to imitate it. In his official, as well as private capacity, he will feel an averſion to every thing immoral—every thing impure, unjuſt, oppreſſive and cruel—eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that tends to the hurt of the public, or individuals. He will feel a diſpoſition to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, to his utmoſt, the comfort, the peace and happineſs of all men, with whom he has to do.</p>
            <p>THE civil ruler, who is under the united in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of this diſpoſition and the various pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful arguments and motives of religion, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and motives that reſpect both the preſent and the eternal world, will be a benefactor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to his nation. He will not fail to attend to the duties of his ſtation. He will take due
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030738_0014_0FE8D691456A46B8"/>
pains to inform himſelf what is right and fit to be done, in every caſe that comes under conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration. He will not be backward to decide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, according to the dictates of his conſcience, however ſuch deciſion may expoſe him to infamy and reproach. His fortitude and independence of ſpirit will be in ſome good proportion to the ſtrength and vigor of his faith, in the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of religion. "With him it is a very ſmall thing that he ſhould be judged of man's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He that judgeth him is the LORD."</p>
            <p>IN ſeaſons of darkneſs and perplexity, when it is not eaſy to know what ought to be done, the ruler, who is a man of religion, will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuperior advantages for forming a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In a humble ſenſe of his dependance on GOD who is the father of lights, he will repair to him for all needed illumination. Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by that direction and declaration in his word, "If any of you lack wiſdom, let him aſk of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not; and it ſhall be given him," he waits upon him in hope of a gracious anſwer.</p>
            <p>THE moſt able men know by experience, that the human mind is not poſſeſſed of a principle of inerrability, but that it is liable to miſtake and err—that in things which relate to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they frequently want wiſdom. The ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030738_0015_0FE8D692D8D9D4E8"/>
who ſeeks it of GOD, ſurely, is more likely to determine wiſely in difficult caſes, than he, who refuſes to apply to him for direction and aſſiſtance. It is eaſy for that BEING, who formed the mind of man with all its powers and faculties, and has the moſt intimate acceſs to it, ſecretly and imperceptibly to influence its operations, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and aſſiſt its enquiries, and lead it into ſuch views, as will eſſentially affect its determinations, without the leaſt infringement of its moral lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty. Thoſe, therefore, who truſt ſo far in their own wiſdom, as to neglect all application to HIM for counſel and direction, act very irrationally, and are in danger, through the juſt reſentment of HEAVEN, of having their boaſted wiſdom turned into fooliſhneſs.</p>
            <p>RELIGION, in civil rulers, is of high import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in reſpect to the influence they have, in forming the religious and moral character of the people. The character of the rulers of Iſrael marked the ſtate of religion in that nation. A ſimilar influence may be looked for, from the diſpoſition and conduct of the rulers of every other people. It is an obſervation of Solomon, who was diſtinguiſhed above all others for his wiſdom, If a ruler hearken to lies, all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:030738_0016_0FE8D69A89107AF8"/>
EXPERIENCE evinces, that there is a peculiar propenſity in perſons in the lower walks of life, to imitate thoſe, who are in places of eminence and dignity. When this propenſity, by means of the corrupt practices of great men, is led to co-operate with another, which is natural to all, I mean an inclination to do evil, what an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of wickedneſs is to be expected?</p>
            <p>THE ruler, who allows himſelf in prophaning the name of GOD—in treating the Inſtitutions of religion with neglect, irreverence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt—in violating the laws of righteouſneſs, ſobriety, chaſtity and temperance, though he ſhould be active in framing and enacting laws, for encouraging piety and virtue, and for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing and ſuppreſſing vice and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, takes the moſt effectual method to defeat the good tendency of ſuch laws, and ſpread cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption far and wide.</p>
            <p>HE only who enforceth his precepts by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, whether he be the head of a private fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, or the ruler of a larger ſociety, can ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expect that his precepts will be much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Religion will be likely to flouriſh, or decline, among a people, according as it is treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men in conſpicuous places. Their eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtation gives a luſtre to their example, which
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030738_0017_0FE8D69C859EEB48"/>
will not fail to produce a great and extenſive effect. What regard then, ought to be had to the moral and religious character of perſons, who are candidates for any important office, by thoſe to whom it belongs to elect them!</p>
            <p>THE civil ruler, who is a man of piety and virtue, ſenſible that he cannot be a good ruler, any further than he is a benefactor to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, will conſult and purſue their true intereſt, by every juſt and reaſonable method in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Knowing by experience, the ſalutary effect of religion upon his own temper and conduct, convinced of the neceſſity of it in order to the happineſs of others, viewing in a ſtrong point of light, the benign aſpect of the chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, on the liberty and order, the peace and proſperity of the community, he will ever be ready to recommend it, and uſe the whole of his influence to encourage its profeſſion and practice. The good ruler will cheerfully give his aſſent to laws calculated to promote the education of youth in virtue and knowledge, and the train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up for public uſefulneſs in the Church and State; and which will moſt effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſupport of public worſhip and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and are friendly to the general diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of knowledge and true religion. Nothing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030738_0018_0FE8D6A3F97682A0"/>
will diſcourage him from adopting and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch meaſures as appear to him, on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation, neceſſary, and the beſt adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to encourage and promote righteouſneſs, which exalteth a nation, and diſcountenance ſin which is a reproach to any people. What ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction muſt the ruler of this character, who has been inſtrumental of great good to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have in reflecting on his paſt conduct, and the happy fruit of his beneficent labors?</p>
            <p>BUT, ſhould his faithful ſervices for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, his tried patriotiſm, his inflexible regard to the intereſt of his country be forgotten—ſhould he be neglected, and treated with infamy, by thoſe of whom he has deſerved well, what a ſource of comfort will he have in the teſtimony of his own conſcience to his integrity? And, with what pleaſure, may he look forward to that day, when the ſecret motives of his conduct ſhall be laid open and applauded, with all his worthy deeds, by the Judge of all, in the preſence of the whole world?</p>
            <p>THOUGH he is deeply ſenſible of his many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, and that had he done all that was required of him, he would have been an unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervant, having done no more than was his duty to do, yet, poſſeſſed of a character, formed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030738_0019_0FE8D6A58F2D7F80"/>
thro' the influence of the divine word and ſpirit, a character, to which the promiſe of eternal life, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, is made by the infinitely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and faithful GOD, he may well rejoice in hope of all that glory and felicity, with which the righteous ſhall be remunerated in the world to come.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſhould the faithful ruler receive no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable treatment from thoſe whoſe peace and proſperity lie near his heart—ſhould his ſervices meet the approbation, and be rewarded with the grateful acknowledgements, of the multitude of his fellow citizens, yet there is a trying ſeaſon approaching, from which none are exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even of thoſe among men, who are ſtiled Gods. It is a declaration of ſcripture, which the experience of all paſt ages has verified, "I ſaid ye are Gods; but ye ſhall die like men." In the near proſpect of his diſſolution, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort muſt it afford the pious ruler to be able to ſay, "Remember, O LORD, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight."</p>
            <p>THIS State, bleſſed be GOD, has been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed with rulers of this character, who in ſeaſons that try ſouls, have exhibited the moſt undoubted evidence of their firm and unſhaken attachment to the cauſe of truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030738_0020_0FE8D6AD74C03620"/>
—of liberty, order and religion. They have exerted their great talents in the cauſe of their endangered country, and have not been afraid openly to aſſert the rights of man; and as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppoſe that ſpirit of intrigue and levelliſm, which threatened all the evils of anarchy and confuſion.</p>
            <p>THE preſent ſignal proſperity, with which we are diſtinguiſhed from all other nations, is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under God, to the vigilance, the care, the exertions, of wiſe and faithful rulers.</p>
            <p>MAY we never want a ſufficient number of citizens worthy to be intruſted with the admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration of government, and may the people never be ſo blind and inattentive to their own intereſt, as to be duped by the artifices of deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, into the beſtowment of their ſuffrages on perſons of a bad, or ſuſpicious character.</p>
            <p>THROUGH the ſmiles of divine providence, the people of this State have had another oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of giving their ſuffrages for thoſe, who are to compoſe the two branches of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the ſupreme executive. And the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful anniverſary is returned, when we behold moſt of the heads of the tribes of our ISRAEL come together into this city of their ſolemnities, and aſſembled in the houſe of the Lord, to give thanks
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030738_0021_0FE8D6AF6FAD3B10"/>
unto his name, and ſupplicate his preſence and bleſſing.</p>
            <p>BUT it is no ſmall degree, in which the joy of the day is leſſened, by the abſence of the late CHIEF MAGISTRATE.<note n="*" place="bottom">Governor HUNTINGTON died January 5th 1796, in the 65th year of his age. In 1786, he was elected Governor, in which office he continued until his death.</note> We have been wont, with pleaſure and ſatisfaction, to behold him at the head of the legiſlature, on this anniverſary ſolemnity: But we ſhall ſee his face no more.</p>
            <p>THE SOVEREIGN DISPOSER of all things has ſeen fit, in his holy providence, to remove him from our world, and to put a final period to his ſervices for this people, by whom he was deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly held in high eſtimation.</p>
            <p>BY his public profeſſion of religion, for many years, his ſteady attendance on the inſtitutions of chriſtianity, and his exemplary good converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, GOVERNOR HUNTINGTON made it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to all, that he was not aſhamed of the Goſpel of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>THE various important public ſtations into which he was ſucceſſively choſen, he ſuſtained with dignity, and diſplayed ſuch ability, prudence and integrity in the diſcharge of them, as met with great acceptance from the multitude of his brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:030738_0022_0FE8D6B6E12127C8"/>
THE important ſervices he rendered this State and country, during the ſcenes of danger and diſtreſs, through which we paſſed, whilſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with a powerful nation for our juſt rights and liberties, ought not to be forgotten. His name will be tranſmitted with honor to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, enrolled among the names of thoſe ILLUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRIOUS PATRIOTS, who dared to ſign that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, which ſealed the independence of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited America.</p>
            <p>THE remarkable unanimity, with which his late EXCELLENCY was re-choſen, from year to year, to fill the chair, exhibits an evidence, not only of the general approbation, but of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and equity of his adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>THE ſatifaction reſulting from the continued approbation and acceptance of his ſervices, by his fellow citizens, however great, muſt have been a ſmall thing with him, in the near view of his departure, compared with the joy ariſing from the teſtimony of his conſcience, that in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but by the grace of God, he had diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the duties of the ſeveral relations in which he had been placed.</p>
            <p>THE voice of GOD in the death of the GOVERNOR, and in the more recent death of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030738_0023_0FE8D6B8730176F0"/>
the SECRETARY of the State,<note n="†" place="bottom">GEORGE WYLLYS, Eſquire, who died April 24th 1796, in the 86th year of his age. He was choſen Secretary in the year 1730, and filled the office until his death. Through the long term of 66 years he never miſſed attending a ſingle ſeſſion of the Legiſlature, and was a ſtranger unto diſeaſe, until the ſickneſs which in few days proved fatal to him.</note> a Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable for his abilities—his uſefulneſs in the long continued exerciſe of his office, and for his exemplary chriſtian faith and virtue, demands the attention of the PUBLIC.</p>
            <p>WHEN rulers, of ſuch a character, are taken away, eſpecially, in times of growing infidelity and corruption, the people have great reaſon to mourn, not for them, but for themſelves and their children; and may well exclaim, "Help, LORD, for the godly man ceaſeth; for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fail from among the children of men."</p>
            <p>MAY ſurviving rulers and officers of every grade, be deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of the high importance of approving themſelves to GOD, in the whole of their conduct. May they lay it to heart, that though they are called gods, and are ſaid to be children of the moſt High, yet the time is approaching with great celerity, when they ſhall die like men.</p>

To him they are accountable for their conduct in their public, as well as private capacity.</p>
            <p>THE power with which they are clothed, is given them, both by God and man, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the good of the community. This, therefore, they will ever keep in view in all their deliberations and deciſions.</p>
            <p>IT is juſtly expected of them, that they act upon a large ſcale. While they take effectual care that no injuſtice be done to any citizen, they will be concerned not to ſacrifice the good of the State, or Nation, to the honor, caſe or emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of individuals. They will take heed how they are influenced by local advantages, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal attachments.</p>
            <p>LAWS that will do equal juſtice, afford equal protection, and ſecure equal advantages to all, and the beſtowment of offices upon men the beſt qualified, the people have a right to expect from thoſe, whom they intruſt with the power of leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſlation, and of making civil and military ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments.</p>
            <p>IN all their proceedings, it is reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that they act with the ſame integrity, virtue and honor, as becometh men and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in private life.</p>

DEEPLY impreſſed with the importance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and virtue to the welfare of a community, you will ſuffer me, Honored Fathers, to beſeech and exhort you, not to fail to do every thing in your power, to cauſe them to flouriſh among the people, whoſe greateſt and beſt proſperity you are under every obligation to ſeek.</p>
            <p>'MAGISTRATES may probably do more by their example, than in any other way, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, more than any other men,' to promote the practice of piety and virtue among a people. Happy are thoſe rulers, who, by the united influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their authority and example, are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of ſpreading religion and virtue through the community, over which they are placed:—happy, in rendering their government eaſy and pleaſant to themſelves, and to the people:—hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in the reflection upon the great good they have been inſtrumental in doing for them:—happy, in an approving conſcience, that gives them confidence towards GOD, the Judge of all:—And ſupremely happy will they be, who in the great day ſhall be found faithful; for they ſhall be rewarded with a crown of glory, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away.

            <p>THE paſtors of the churches, who have the ſpirit of their ſtation, and feel the power of that benevolent religion, which they preach to oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, will be deeply concerned for the welfare of the community, and ready to exert themſelves, to their utmoſt, in their proper ſpheres, that the great end of civil government may be attained. Though not ſharers in the adminiſtration, they have an important influence on the object of government. In laboring to promote the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual and eternal intereſt of mankind, which is the immediate object of the inſtitution of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical miniſtry, they co-operate with the civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il Magiſtrate in promoting their temporal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. The wiſe and benevolent Governor of the world, in the appointment of magiſtracy and the prieſthood, has expreſſed a tender regard to the happineſs of men, and is pleaſed to make uſe of both conjointly, for accompliſhing the purpoſes of his good pleaſure. He led his ancient people like a ſtock, by the hand of MOSES and AARON.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIAN paſtors are workers together, not only with the civil Magiſtrate, but with the great GOD himſelf, for the good of their fellow men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>SENSIBLE of the aid we derive from the civil ruler in our work, may we be ready to encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age him in his, by our prayers; and by inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the people of our reſpective charges, both by our preaching and example, all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and obedience to magiſtracy, which our holy religion requires.</p>

            <p>UNDER the auſpices of his preſidency, "our country," highly favored by Heaven, "has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed general tranquility, while many of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe, with their American dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, have been involved in a conteſt unuſually bloody, exhauſting and calamitous—Our agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, commerce and manufactures have proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030738_0031_0FE8D6DDB757CD08"/>
beyond former example:—and our popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation has advanced with a celerity exceeding the moſt ſanguine calculations"—And by treaties with the ſeveral powers, "between whom and the United States controverſies have ſubſiſted"—treaties, for carrying which into effect the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary proviſions have been made (though not until the public mind was greatly agitated and offended by the delay) "a firm and precious foundation appears to be laid, for accelerating, maturing and eſtabliſhing, the proſperity of our country—a country that exhibits a ſpectacle of national happineſs never ſurpaſſed, if ever before equalled."</p>
            <p>MAY all the enemies of the public peace and proſperity—and of this Benefactor of our nation, be clothed with ſhame. But may God think upon him for good, according to all that he hath done for this people.</p>
            <p>WHILST we rejoice in the bleſſings of external peace and proſperity—and are ready to felicitate ourſelves, and one another, on the fair proſpect of their continuance, preſented by the removal of the dark cloud that ſo lately menaced our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility;—May we remember that theſe bleſſings, however eſtimable in themſelves, derive their principal value from the more favorable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030738_0032_0FE8D6E51C4A33E8"/>
they afford us, for attending to thoſe things, which relate to our ſpiritual and everlaſting peace and happineſs.</p>
            <p>THIS world is but the beginning of our exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It bears no proportion to the eternal dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which we are formed. It is, however, an important part of our exiſtence, as on our conduct here, our condition hereafter has a ſettled and unalterable dependence. He, who created us, and, therefore, has an indiſputable right to be our judge, has declared in his word, that "he will render to every man according to his deeds:—to them, who, by patient continuance in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeek for glory, and honor, and immortality; eternal life; But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; indignation and wrath; tribulation and anguiſh upon every man that doth evil."</p>
            <p>THE time is faſt approaching, when death will put a period to our ſtate of trial, and ſeal up our accounts to the judgment of the great day; when, "we muſt all appear before the judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat of Chriſt; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."</p>
            <p>IN all our affairs, civil, ſecular and religious, may we act with a wiſe reference to that day,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030738_0033_0FE8D78E3AEAEE78"/>
when an end ſhall be put to all civil diſtinctions—when all earthly kingdoms, ſtates and empires ſhall be no more:—when CHRIST who is King in Zion, after he has judged and paſſed ſentence on all men, of every rank and denomination, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their behaviour in the body, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the mediatorial kingdom to GOD, even the Father, that GOD may be ALL in ALL.</p>
