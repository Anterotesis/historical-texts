            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Friends, Country-men, and Fellow-Soldiers;</salute> Favor me, I beſeech you, with your attention and candor.</opener>
            <p>I COME, in compliance with the mournful call of this day, to offer my honeſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, as well as to unite my moſt ſincere zeal with this honorable Aſſembly, in paying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the memory of our worthy deceaſed General.</p>
            <p>No labors nor expences, as we are aſſured in hiſtory, were ever neglected by wiſe and gallant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which in any manner could honor and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the memories of great and illuſtrious men.</p>

               </gap> virtue.</p>
            <p>WHEN living characters of worth and excellence are the objects of our daily and pleaſing contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, or, by recollection, we bring into view thoſe of paſt ages, and are perſuaded, that, by zealous imitation of them, we can advance to great degrees of pre-eminence in honor and virtue; then, a generous emulation is kindled in our boſoms, and we are animated, and even charmed to ſurpaſs others in glory and excellence: for good examples poſſeſs the inchanting powers of perſuaſion, even when they are cloathed with the important dignity
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017150_0004_0FA06EAC8DC48170"/>
of inſtruction. And our own experience muſt have taught us, that their influence is more extenſive and powerful than that of the moſt accurate and profound reaſonings. By extraordinary examples our admiration is excited, our vigor and reſolution are drawn into action, and we are led on to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous atchievments. On this account we find that, not only juſtice, always faithful to excellent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, demanded honor and reſpect for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious memories; but alſo the public intereſt of mankind required ſuch uſeful characters to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as patterns worthy the imitation of poſterity.</p>
            <p>WITH a laudable deſign of kindling a generous emulation of the beſt examples, and of always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this pure and VESTAL flame alive; the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent republics directed their orators to pronounce eulogiums over their deceaſed heroes and patriots, before they committed their bodies to the funeral pile.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:017150_0005_0FA06EAF4E80D848"/>BOTH Greece and Rome, thoſe ſublime patterns of republican wiſdom, virtue and valor, inſtructed their citizens that their glory and fame ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only in life, but ſurvive their aſhes, and flouriſh among nations of future periods.</p>
            <p>AN exalted motive this! But the influence of it reaches only the virtuous man, who is animated by the ſublime hope and expectation of future ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and nobly aſpiring to the attainment of true glory, tranſcends the applauſe of the preſent age, and greatly lives in the proſpect of gaining a plaudit from future generations and future worlds.</p>
            <p>BE this then the improvement of the preſent day's tranſaction; this the advantage we will ſtrive to obtain even from the loſs of a worthy citizen, a brave and virtuous man, we will conſider by what means we may with dignity approach that eternal
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017150_0006_0FA06EAFA0B73E80"/>
ceſſation from earthly employments, which our friend has ſo lately reached.</p>
            <p>BY poſſeſſing true virtue, we ſhall be furniſhed with the eſſential qualifications for ending this life gloriouſly, and leaving an illuſtrious character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us which will ſpeak for us, we being dead, and prolong our uſefulneſs far beyond the narrow compaſs of a few years in which our preſent lives are circumſcribed.</p>
            <p>HONORABLY to purſue ſuch heroic and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fame, as the greateſt and moſt uſeful men have acquired, is the true glory which their examples point out to us and encourage us to poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>BUT though a love of fame is found in almoſt every breaſt, yet that deſire and expectation of gaining it only are innocent and laudable which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017150_0007_0FA06EB001A74378"/>
from virtuous actions. True fame and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory are founded upon the rock virtue, and ſhall outlaſt the flight of ages and the moſt dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble memorials of human ſtructure.</p>
            <p>WHEN the brazen ſtatue and the ſculptured mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhall become faithleſs to their charges, and they ſhall themſelves crumble to duſt; even then, true glory, the firſt born of virtue, ſubſtantial virtue, ſhall uphold an immortal duration: but falſe glory, built upon a ſelfiſh and contracted foundation, ſhall tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and fall in diſgraceful ruin, like a fabric raiſed on the unſtable ſand. May this therefore be the rich profit which we will endeavor to derive from the beſt and nobleſt characters; they ſhall teach us not to graſp ſo much at the airy viſion of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary name, as to covet, and therefore poſſeſs all thoſe virtues out of which true fame and ſublime glory will grow and flouriſh, without the danger of ever fading.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017150_0008_0FA06EB1A2928660"/>THE character of the famous Cato of Rome will inform us how much he loved his country and eſteemed the practice of virtue above the applauſe of mankind, even though a regard to the juſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation which our fellow-men owe unto us is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and lawful,</p>
            <p>CATO fled from fame, but ſhe purſued him with the greater ſpeed. He choſe to be virtuous rather than appear ſo; he preferred that ſelf approbation which ariſes from meritorious actions, to the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and tumultuous acclamations of the fickle mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.—From this, as well as other examples of worth beyond number, we are induced to ſay that men can never travel in the road of true glory, but when they are employed in the ſervice of their country, and for the benefit of their fellow-citizens and friends, and are juſtly entitled to their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and praiſe. That approbation and praiſe, we
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017150_0009_0FA06EB1F49D73B0"/>
ſay, which are devoted to them by their fellow-citizens, and unalterably confirmed by the voice of every good man. And, if I were here permitted to enrich this humble page with a name known and loved by every friend to juſtice and liberty, I would ſay, ſuch united and univerſal love and praiſe are juſtly devoted to the character of * * * * * * And the God of all goodneſs has in mercy to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army preſented us with a man whoſe example is moſt worthy our imitation.</p>
            <p>NEITHER the abundance of wealth, nor the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted gratification of ſenſual appetites, nor the poſſeſſion of power formidable to liberty, and too often intolerable: none of theſe can bribe the voice of divine juſtice to pronounce that man truly great who is deſtitute of noble and virtuous actions, to entitle him to ſo great a reward. True merit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, has a righteous demand on true glory, and yet it ſeldom makes this lawful demand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:017150_0010_0FA06EB225CAF128"/>HERE then we will fix our determination: that man is eminently great who is truly good, for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they happily conſpire to form a ſublime and dignified character. The ſolid baſis of permanent glory and happineſs, is true religion, and the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of that bleſſed Being, who is worthy of all veneration, is the ſublime reward which animates the good man through life, and, at death, crowns him with <hi>glory and honor and immortality.</hi> For as the Poet ſays,
<q>
                  <l>Let the witling argue all he can,</l>
                  <l>'Tis Religion ſtill that makes the man.</l>
               </q>
Moſt happy then is that man who having a truly public ſpirit and an enlarged and catholic ſoul in the ſervice of mankind, does yet, above all things, ſolicit the love and favor of his infinitely wiſe Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, who being acquainted with all his virtuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, however much they may be concealed from the imperfect view of ſhort ſighted mortals!
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017150_0011_0FA06EB37B8DA6B8"/>
Pleaſing conſideration to the virtuous mind! An all wiſe and merciful God is the Judge of the good man's actions, and perfectly knowing their weight and value, will give them their equitable reward.</p>
            <p>OH, divine virtue! Methinks thou haſt charms and beauties ſufficient to court and captivate the love and admiration of every rational being. It is virtue which dignifies both life and death: Oh let my breaſt be ever one of thy fair habitations, and there deign to ſway thy peaceful ſceptre, until all my inclinations and paſſions are ſweetly and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubjected to the laws of unchangeable recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude! Thou gentle dove of happineſs, ever bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the olive branch of peace to the mind of the good man! Mild angel, of heavenly birth, daily whiſpering in the ſofteſt accents, ſweet innocence and ſeraphic joy to the ſmiling conſcience! Bright and unſpotted conſcience, thou approving ſpirit,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017150_0012_0FA06EB3CFFC50D0"/>
lovely daughter of virtue, ſiſter to the pure hoſts of the Cherubim, and beſt companion of Arch-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.—</p>
            <p>I HOPE then it is evident to all of us, that thoſe examples are moſt worthy our careful imitation, which have the largeſt portion of moral goodneſs united to the moſt heroic and patriotic abilities. True piety ſhould be the vital and animating prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all our purſuits, and we ought to conſider it the firſt and ſtrongeſt obligation which is laid on us: and indeed the duties of love and reverence to God are ſo juſt and important, that without them no character can be complete. Suppoſe many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and excellent qualifications may juſtly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a man, and let it be granted, that he has a comparative dignity; yet the want of love to the kind parent of the univerſe will be found ſo great
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017150_0013_0FA06EB46AFDA168"/>
a blemiſh in his character as to tarniſh all the reſt of his boaſted excellencies.</p>
            <p>BUT when I ſay a character excellent in many uſeful qualifications among men, is not complete; do I diſcourage the cultivation of thoſe heroic pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic and other abilities and qualifications by which the cauſe and intereſt of men are ſupported? Not by any means I hope. I wiſh the world all the happineſs and dignity which can poſſibly be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from whatſoever generous and laudable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives they may be purſued: but deſpairing ever to ſee mankind in a happy and flouriſhing ſtate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they unite the love of the great diſpoſer of all events with the generous ſervice of the public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; I am conſtrained to intreat all my fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as far as I am able, to lay the foundation of their uſefulneſs and future glory, on true piety to God, and then they will be ſure to ſtand immova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017150_0014_0FA06EB51F3B5898"/>
Does this appear unreaſonable or impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Shall we not find it more eaſy to follow the dictates of reaſon and conſcience than to oppoſe them?—</p>
            <p>ARE we pleaſed with a good human character, and powerfully diſpoſed to admire what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in it; and can we, without offering violence to our reaſon and intereſt, withold our love and grateful admiration of the infinite rectitude, the unſpotted purity, and the uncreated excellence, goodneſs, and omnipotence of the Moſt High? Do we feel the principles of gratitude warmly excited within us, and our paſſions laid under a weighty ſenſe of the many acts of kindneſs and generoſity our benefactors have conferred on us? And can we refuſe to be grateful to our Creator, our preſerver and moſt bountiful benefactor, and the eternal ſource of all that is good and glorious in the whole
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017150_0015_0FA06EB8C1F26DA8"/>
creation? A character therefore without theſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affections muſt be very defective in the moſt eſſential requiſites, and can not have the trueſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for it is deſtitute of that which is of all things moſt reaſonable, moſt pleaſing, and which gives a luſtre to all our actions. And what is this but piety, which is no more than the exerciſe of love, reſpect and gratitude to the author of all good. Let us then be invited to make the character of the Supreme Being the firſt object of our love and veneration, and let us follow the exhortation of our Saviour. <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> And may we <hi>mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR greateſt dignity conſiſts in going off the theatre of life with a full orbed blaze of reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent glory; like the ſun himſelf whoſe ſplendors

are not diminiſhed, even when he retires from this hemiſphere to illuminate the other.</p>
            <p>HERE let us pauſe a moment; and reflect on what has been ſaid! What, may it be aſked, is the deſign of this addreſs? Has it attempted to teach us the certainty of dying, and the near approach of our exit? This was not thought neceſſary among men who exerciſe their reaſon and reflection; but to remind us how we may die with dignity, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the poſſeſſion of true glory. The beſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from life to death has been pointed out to us, and virtue has been offered to pilot us ſafe from all the ſhoals and rocks of vice and ruin, into the haven of celeſtial glory. Under the convoy of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly guide we need not fear the approach of death, nor turn pale at the ſight of an opened grave. Let us then, with a chearful hope, draw near to theſe precious relics of the deceaſed! Sweet are the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017150_0017_0FA06EB8D61C1090"/>
ſlumbers of the virtuous man! How beautiful is death when earned by virtue! Here, Oh Death, is one of thy trophies! Thou haſt dyed thy arrows in the blood of a hero! But the good man has power to gain a triumph even out of thy boaſted victory. <hi>Oh Death,</hi> will he ſay, <hi>where is thy ſting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?</hi> Here ends the journey of life! The weary traveller has laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down to reſt! Short is the interval between the weeping infant and the dying hero! Such is the lot of man! <hi>He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down!</hi> Experience has demonſtrated this truth, which the ſacred voice of inſpiration has proclaimed; that <hi>It is appointed unto all men once to die.</hi> The many millions who leſt this world in thick ſucceſſion, and have given room that others might advance and act their ſeveral parts: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who fall around us may convince us beyond the uſe of an argument, that in a ſhort time we ſhall
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017150_0018_0FA06EB98F16B390"/>
be called from the poſſeſſion of this world, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into one more extenſive and unconfined.</p>
            <p>BUT am I come to make the approach of Death alarming and terrible? Did I come to unmaſk the ghaſtly tyrant, and to repreſent the groans and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the laſt conflict? No, my friends. Let this taſk be aſſigned to the votaries of vice; they bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can ſpeak the painful fears of a reſtleſs, unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed conſcience. It is vice alone which can arm death with a poiſonous dart. Vice is the enemy to mankind which arrays death in gloomy horrors, and repreſents him as the inexorable murderer of the human race, for ever, in purſuit of their lives and happineſs, from the very cradle to the tomb. Oh vice, thou hell-born monſter! nurſed by infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal furies, and ſent by ſome malignant ſpirit, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the felicity of man, to plague, to curſe, and damn mankind. Inſlaved to thy tyranny of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017150_0019_0FA06EBA4EDA2790"/>
and madneſs, and poiſoned by the infectious breath of thy more rancorous heart; men, alas, once the bright image of Heaven, turn their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of unſpeakable goodneſs, and unwearied mercy, into foul blaſphemies, and with oaths and curſes abuſe the hand which feeds them, and defy the God who made them! Oh, my heart bleeds within me! Shall this intrepid army of patriots, who have offered themſelves champions in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the liberties of America; whom no hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips can conquer, whom no tyrant army can terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy: ſhall theſe heroes reject virtue, the friend of men, and charmer of angels? Shall they deſpiſe this fair companion of all this charming train of graces; modeſty, decency, complaiſance, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, chaſtity, and pure untainted language, the voice of angels, and men of honor? And will they proſtitute their reaſon and their glory to vice, the unchangeable enemy of mankind, and intail miſery on themſelves, and the curſe of ſlavery on their
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017150_0020_0FA06EBB0E798D18"/>
poſterity? Forbid it liberty, forbid it virtue; and Oh, thou author of all good, for thy mercies ſake prevent it! But ſtop my zeal, a milder theme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks thy attention. Be mine ever the pleaſing employment to diveſt death, the imaginary tyrant, of all his ſuppoſed terrors; let me ſeparate him from vice, and then I ſhall diſarm him of his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous weapons. I will repreſent him coming with the ſmile of a cherub, to call the truly virtuous from their poſts of toil and danger, to the regions of eternal felicity and unabating joy. There ſhall they join a countleſs multitude of heroes and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, and be united <hi>to an innumerable company of angels,</hi> and, <hi>to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect:</hi> where they ſhall ſee the bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of mankind, and ſit with him <hi>in the throne of his glory.</hi> And they ſhall be admitted into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017150_0021_0FA06EBBCFFA2620"/>
of the unwaſted ſource of life and happineſs, and, <hi>beholding the glory of the Lord,</hi> be <hi>changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory.</hi>—Theſe are proſpects ſo full of glory and happineſs, as methinks are more than ſufficient to reconcile us to every trial and difficulty we may have to encounter in our paſſage through life; ſufficient to ſweeten our very toils and labors; to ſoften every care and grief; to put all our murmurs and complaints to ſilence, and to diſpoſe us to ſubmit patiently to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpenſation of divine Providence, however great our loſſes and ſufferings may ſeem to be. It was an heroic fortitude, as well as a pious heart, which enabled the good man, Job, to ſay, under the loſs of every earthly comfort, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; bleſſed be the name of the Lord. Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE now, gentlemen and fellow ſoldiers, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed what I had in view, when I aſked your
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017150_0022_0FA06EBC8F2044C8"/>
candid attention. I have endeavoured to plead the cauſe of virtue and true honor before you, and I hope your reaſon and intereſt will chearfully give their ſuffrages in favor of what has been offered. I have attempted to mark out the road which leads to ſubſtantial greatneſs. And when I conſider that every military breaſt in this army, beats high with the love of glory; I am induced to hope that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is neceſſary to engage you in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of true glory, than only to ſhew you the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite difference there is between real and falſe glory. To attain the one deſerves our moſt careful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to avoid the other requires the ſteady exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our reaſon, and the conſtant cultivation of virtue. For this generous purpoſe, I have ſaid, the hiſtories of the beſt and moſt illuſtrious characters have been preſented to us as ſo many wiſe and ſafe guides to conduct us beyond the dangerous and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive phantoms of falſe glory, through the temple of virtue to the temple of true honor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:017150_0023_0FA06EBD504DCC30"/>To anſwer a ſimilar laudable purpoſe, we ought to ſpare no labors nor expences in tranſmitting to poſterity, the hiſtories of thoſe good and great men whom we have ſeen, and by whoſe bright and living examples we have felt our hearts warmed, and our zeal kindled to virtuous exertions.</p>
            <p>WARRIORS and ſtateſmen, and patriots, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, an illuſtrious growth of a few years, have ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Many indeed have left us after paying down their blood to purchaſe liberty for this country and mankind; but their virtues will be remembered to prolong their uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even though their lives were ſhort. Some have been called from their poſts of defence, while ſupporting the cauſe of liberty, and even when ſhe moſt wanted, and ſeemed moſt earneſtly to plead for their longer ſtay to vindicate her violated rights, and to gain a complete triumph over the machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of tyranny!—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:017150_0024_0FA06EBE0EFE8040"/>OH, ſacred liberty! with thee this day we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole the loſs of one of thy worthy ſons! Early he ſaw thy danger, and early in this conteſt eſpouſed thy cauſe. Happily he united the love and defence of thy glorious perſon with the practice of ſublime virtue. That glory, which reſults from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous protection of the privileges of our country, and that <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> which <hi>exalteth a nation,</hi> he laudably purſued.</p>
            <p>I WILL not preſume to determine how far the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry amiable and uſeful character of our worthy friend and much lamented General, correſponded with thoſe examples and characters of true glory which I have attempted to deſcribe: for I muſt venture to uſe the freedom of ſaying he was my friend, and I loved him ſincerely!</p>

And yet, neither my time nor my abilities can reach the extent of his virtues, civil and military!

The languor of the country, and their inattention to the ſuffering and ſtarving ſituation of the moſt patient and perſevering army in the world; the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and poverty of ſpirit, which prevailed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny civil councils; the want of energy in the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative bodies; none of theſe things however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging they are, could for a moment chill his zeal and ardor for the public intereſt of America. When proſpects of amaſſing wealth, with diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temptations, bewitched ſo many Americans

from the ſervice of their country, and bound them with the execrable chains of mean and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſelf intereſt: then might you have ſeen him ſhine with a ſoul of ſuperior make; and, no charms were powerful enough to allure him from the unutterable hardſhips of the American war, and the dangers of the field of battle. Though the preſent emolument and the future ſupport of a riſing family, together with the ſweets of domeſtic happineſs, ſeemed all with the fair ſhow of juſtice, to conſpire in demanding his attention to them; yet, with a patriotic firmneſs, he put all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties aſide, and choſe rather to make a daily ſacrifice of private intereſt and perſonal happineſs, and to ſupport the cauſe of liberty, than to live in affluence when the liberties of his country were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring. This ſhall decree him the American crown of honor; this ſhall procure him the glorious name of a FATHER to his country.</p>

            <p>NOR were the virtues and abilities of our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral leſs conſpicuous in the field. He was prudent in counſel and ſolid in judging, firm and ſteady in his reſolutions, cautious of unneceſſary danger, calm and undaunted in battle, vigorous and unwearied in obeying military commands, and executing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes; patient and perſevering under hardſhips
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:017150_0028_0FA06EC3600EF860"/>
and difficulties, punctual and exact in the duties of the army. His mind ever engaged in promoting the good of the army, and in preſerving order and regularity among thoſe troops he commanded: and far from poſſeſſing ſuch a narrow and impoveriſhed ſoul as can be content with a bare eſcape from cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; he was ever willing and pleaſed to do as much as poſſible, even though it were out of the immediate line of his military duty. He was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable and condeſcending, eaſy of acceſs, yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining dignity, and commanding reſpect; ever ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an honorable command of his paſſions. He well knew how to reſpect, and he honored all cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters which were faithfully employed in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their duty, and he thought none, who were faithful and brave, beneath his notice. The ſoldier under preſſing circumſtances of diſtreſs had free acceſs to him, and he was as a father to them! Yes, my dear fellow ſoldiers, you who have been
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017150_0029_0FA06EC540E1EBF0"/>
long acquainted with him, and happy under his juſt and reſolute, but merciful command, well know he was dear to you as a father! But he is gone from us, he is gone where we hope and truſt he has found the approbation of his Maker.</p>
            <p>HIGH heaven, whoſe will is ever right, has cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him from the ſocieties of men, and from acting his part, any longer, in this calamitous war, which we are involved in, by the ambition of the fooliſh tyrant of Britain. We however rejoice, that our deceaſed patriot has left a worthy example of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and perſeverance to animate us in the glorious conflict, in which we are engaged, and lead us on to laſting honor.</p>
            <p>IN this place I think myſelf happy that I have his example to furniſh a ſubſtantial argument in ſupport of a truth I have long labored to eſtabliſh.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017150_0030_0FA06EC8E96D4920"/>
Namely, that religion and true courage are no ways inconſiſtent with one another; but being united, mutually promote dignity and true glory. Many parts of the ſacred writings might be adduced to ſhow that the generous zeal of the patriot and the unſhaken intrepidity of the warrior, never appear with ſo diſtinguiſhing a luſtre, as when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with the piety of the truly good man. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe divine examples and precepts being too numerous to repeat before you at preſent, and I hope too familiar to you to appear new, let us for a moment, at this time, turn our attention more particularly to the example before us. You gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who now appear the diſconſolate mourners at this funeral ſolemnity of our late beloved friend and General, and were in time paſt the ſubjects of his more immediate command; you well remember how regular and unſpotted were his life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners! He was an unchangeable friend of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſocial virtues, and taught the excellence of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017150_0031_0FA06ECC138B5F48"/>
them more by his amiable example than by a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous parade of words without actions. He was an invariable advocate for public and divine worſhip, never omitting to aſſemble the troops under his command, at the ſtated time for this purpoſe, when the circumſtances of the army would permit, nor DISDAINING to pay his own perſonal attendance. Was this a blemiſh in his character? Did this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure his courage, or make him inſenſible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his country? None of theſe things! His virtues laid the ſolid foundation for all his other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellences to build upon, and ſtand immoveable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all the ſeeming caſualties of time.</p>
            <p>NEED I ſay, that intemperance and profaneſs, and every vice, were ſtrangers to him? Here let me obſerve, for ſuch an omiſſion would be criminal, that during three years ſervice under his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate command, I never once knew him guilty of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017150_0032_0FA06ECE9B1263B0"/>
profane curſing and ſwearing. But I ſhould treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs on your patience, by attempting to draw his character to its juſt and full length, and rehearſe all his labors and ſervices ſince the commencement of the preſent war. From the time when he with his country, firſt armed in oppoſition to the cruelty and domination of Britain, and precious American blood was firſt ſhed in defence of our rights near Boſton. From Boſton to Canada, and from Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da to thoſe important fortreſſes on the lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and from thence in various encounters, in toils of marches, and pains of hunger, until his troops fought the army of Burgoyne, on the heights of Behmus, where in repeated battles, and in the convention of Saratoga, he was entitled to a large ſhare of thoſe laurels which crowned the American arms. The laſt year it was his lot, with many more, to dare the hardſhips of the wilderneſs, and traverſe a land, before unknown, as far as the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017150_0033_0FA06ED0168555C8"/>
and it was by the troops under his command that the ſavage enemy were defeated.</p>
            <p>WHEN the preſent campaign opened, without ſoliciting the poſt of honor and ſuperior danger, or even knowing the intention of any new appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his merit procured him the command of a Brigade of light infantry under the Honorable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General the Marquis de la Fayette. With pleaſure he accepted that command, deſirous of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the intereſt of his country more eminently in this ſtation, and of emulating the generous zeal of him, who though not born in America, has made the cauſe of this continent his own, and has ſpared neither blood nor treaſure to eſtabliſh our Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Oh Americans, ſerve your country with ſuch unwearied zeal as this noble ſon of France ſerves you, then may we hope ſucceſs will attend our arms!</p>
            <p>I ſaid that our General, whoſe loſs we have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, with pleaſure accepted the command
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017150_0034_0FA06ED2DEB4AFF0"/>
which was offered to him, eagerly panting to meet the enemy, and, under the direction of that Being in whoſe hand is the fate of nations, to bring this war to an honorable and ſpeedy concluſion: But alas! in the midſt of thoſe ſanguine hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations he was removed from the ſervice of the United States.</p>
            <p>THUS do our diſappointed hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions teach us the uncertainty of holding the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of earthly bleſſings independent of the great Governor of the univerſe.</p>
            <p>IN the laſt words which I ſhall addreſs to you on this occaſion, and if they were to be the laſt I ſhould ever utter for my country, I would moſt earneſtly pray and beſeech you to lay the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your future glory and happineſs on true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion! Let freedom, from tyranny, be the object of your purſuit; perſeverance in the ſervice of our country be your motto, and victory your hope
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017150_0035_0FA06ED5548DEEB0"/>
and creed; then if we ſhould fall in the field of battle, we ſhall not only purchaſe the glorious titles of heroes and patriots; but our religion ſhall be a paſſport for us to the regions of eternal happineſs!
