            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>PSALM 77, VERSE 20,</bibl>
               <q>THOU LEDDEST THY PEOPLE LIKE A FLOCK, BY THE HANDS OF MOSES AND AARON.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>HOW various and tranſcendent are the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the ſacred writings! They combine all the different ſpecies of literary compoſition in their higheſt perfection, and conſecrate them to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral improvement, the preſent and future happineſs of man. They furniſh the beſt ſummary precepts, models, and incentives, for producing the good citizen and ſtateſman, for effecting an orderly and proſperous ſtate of things in the civil and tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry combinations of this world: Whilſt their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary object is, to prepare men for the far nobler, the everlaſting community of the bleſſed.</p>
            <p>THESE obſervations are eminently illuſtrated by that part of the inſpired volume, which relates to GOD'S ancient people. The words juſt recited, look back to the infancy of that favoured nation. They introduce the GOD of Iſrael under the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024841_0005_0FCD6A92475355F0"/>
figure of a Shepherd leading his flock; which expreſſes in a very lively and endearing manner, the ſingular tenderneſs and care, with which Heaven had conducted that people from the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Egypt, to the promiſed Canaan. The latter part of the verſe, preſents the ſubordinate and united agency of Moſes and Aaron, in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that memorable ſeries of events. Theſe two celebrated characters had been early and cloſely linked together, by the ties of nature, of religion, and of common ſufferings. They were afterwards united by the more awful bond of a divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which conſtituted them Plenipotentiaries from JEHOVAH, the King of Iſrael, to the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Court, which employed them as inſtrumental ſaviours of their oppreſſed countrymen, as their guides and protectors through the dangers of the wilderneſs, and the prime Miniſters of their civil and eccleſiaſtical polity. Whilſt the one was Chief Magiſtrate in the Commonwealth, the other was High Prieſt, or firſt officer in the Church. And the inſtitution and combined influence of theſe two orders in that community, were a moſt wiſe and ſalutary proviſion both for its public and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual happineſs.</p>
            <p>THE divine appointment, then, and concurrent agency of the civil and eccleſiaſtical ruler, in lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient people of GOD, naturally invite our attention to the importance and utility of political and religious guides in a chriſtian ſtate, and to that union of affection and of exertion for the common good, which ought to characterize and cement them. To explain and enforce this union, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confounding the Church and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024841_0006_0FCD6A93C457BD78"/>
or blending the different provinces of their reſpective Miniſters, is a truly delicate taſk. The Speaker hopes, however, that his well-meant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to explore ſuch a field, before an audience ſo reſpectable, will not be deemed either vain, or impertinent to the occaſion. He flatters himſelf that the ſeaſonable and momentous complexion of the ſubject, which cannot fail to ſtrike every intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent eye, will procure to the diſcuſſion and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it a candid reception.</p>
            <p>THIS joyful anniverſary collects our civil and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred leaders from various parts of the State, to one conſecrated ſpot. It unites them, methinks, into one happy brotherhood. It brings them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the altar of GOD, their common Founder, Maſter, and Judge. It makes them joint partakers in a kind of yearly feſtival, ſacred to liberty and to religion—a feſtival, which ſeems to renew and to ſeal mutual friendſhip, and their harmonious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affection to the general intereſt. Is it not congenial then with the ſpirit of the day, as well as decent and uſeful on other accounts, that theſe two orders ſhould ſometimes be the united object of its public addreſſes from the word of GOD; that their reciprocal influence, and their conjunct ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the common good, ſhould be clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and forcibly urged?</p>
            <p>UNDER the ſolemn impreſſion of theſe ideas, we will endeavour to mark out the two different provinces of Moſes and Aaron, or of the Ruler and the Prieſt; the beneficent influence of each upon the public welfare; and the ſeveral ways, in which they may
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024841_0007_0FCD6A9756DFCA08"/>
and ought to befriend and aſſiſt each other in lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people of GOD.</p>
            <p>THE diſcriminating genius of the two depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be thus defined. The one has for its immediate object, the temporal intereſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; the other, their ſpiritual and everlaſting. The one aims to regulate their outward behaviour, ſo far as to reſtrain them from injuring one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other or the public, and engage their contributions to the common welfare: The other contemplates the due regulation of the heart, as well as the overt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts which iſſue from that ſource. The one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces its addreſſes by ſanctions merely civil and worldly; the other by motives which chiefly reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſoul and the life to come.</p>
            <p>LET us now turn our attention to the important and happy influence of each department upon the public intereſt.</p>
            <p>THE importance of ſuch an officer in ſociety as the ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> Magiſtrate, is immediately ſeen and felt by all. It grows out of the preſent weakneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of mankind. It is ſuggeſted by the ſocial feelings belonging to our frame, joined with a ſenſe of mutual dependence and common danger. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, when ſuch officer poſſeſſes the ſpirit of his ſtation, and with intelligence and fidelity pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues its leading deſign, the effects on the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be equally benign and diffuſive. A ruler of this character, like the central orb of the planetary world, enlightens and animates, cements and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the whole political ſyſtem. With a ſkilful, ſteady, yet gentle hand, he moulds a confuſed maſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024841_0008_0FCD6A984CC02900"/>
of diſcordant materials into one regular and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious compound, and holds it together with a ſilken, yet invincible chain. By a ſtrictly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, equal, and paternal adminiſtration, he ſpreads the bleſſings of juſtice, freedom, tranquillity, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private proſperity, through all claſſes of the people. The advantages of ſuch a magiſtracy tranſcend deſcription. To uſe the delicate and ſplendid figures of inſpiration. It reſembles "the light of the morning, when the ſun riſeth, even a morning without clouds; like the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth by clear ſhining after rain."</p>
            <p>BUT it is needleſs to expatiate on this branch of our ſubject. The beneficent influence of good civil rule ſtands confeſſed to the eye of reaſon. It is inſcribed, as with a ſun-beam on the face of our happy country. It has been delineated with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour ability and addreſs, on theſe anniverſary ſolemnities.</p>
            <p>LET us then direct our attention to the other object before us, namely, the importance and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to ſociety, of the CHRISTIAN PRIESTHOOD, or of public religious inſtructors. To ſet this point in a juſt and eaſy light, let us conſider at large, the neceſſity of religion to the well-being of a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and then inquire, what are the beſt means of diffuſing and maintaining it.</p>
            <p>THE neceſſity of religion to public order and happineſs, has been generally acknowledged by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning minds in all countries and ages, yea, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened infidels and atheiſts. But a ſet of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024841_0009_0FCD6A9A4BE6BCD8"/>
and free-thinkers, who boaſt of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour reaſon and liberality, have appeared on the ſtage, in theſe days of modern refinement, who have employed all the powers of metaphyſical ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry and licentious ridicule to ſhake the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of religion: And ſome of them have even denied its political importance and utility, and have propoſed in its ſtead a kind of philoſophical or civil morality, as fully competent to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of general order and ſecurity. A ſyſtem of ideas, or at leaſt of practical feelings, very ſimilar to this, ſeems growing into faſhion in various parts of the American Union; a ſyſtem, which conſiders all religious principles, obſervances and inſtructors, as the remains of old monkiſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſuperſtition and bigotry, or the antiquated offspring of worldly policy, begotten in the early and ruder ſtages of ſociety; but which are wholly unſuitable and uſeleſs, if not a heavy tax upon the public, in this more enlightened and mature period of human affairs! But let us meet theſe refined politicians upon their own ground; and aſk them, what they have to ſubſtitute in the room of religion, as an adequate prop to their own favourite ſcheme of morality.</p>
            <p>WILL they ſay, that civil laws and inſtitutions, planned with wiſdom, and executed with vigour, will completely anſwer the purpoſe? But theſe human proviſions can embrace only the viſible actions of the ſubject. They can prevent or puniſh thoſe offences only, which may be known and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally proved. They conſequently, leave out of their juriſdiction all ſecret crimes; as well as thoſe numberleſs immoralities, which human laws can
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024841_0010_0FCD6A9B9BD1AC70"/>
never diſtinctly define, but which operate as the poiſon both of private and ſocial felicity. Civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations proclaim their own incompetency, even in the judicial procedures ſubmitted to their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For no general rule can accommodate itſelf to an infinite diverſity of circumſtances: And therefore the aid of religious principle ſeems ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to ſupply the defect. This will teach the Legiſlator to conſtruct, and the Judge to interpret and apply the laws, upon ſo juſt and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral a plan, as will preſent the beſt advantages in every caſe, for diſcovering the truth, and ſo for protecting the innocent, as well as chaſtiſing the wilful offender. This will induce a conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a filial and generous obedience, on the part of the ſubject, to the reaſonable authority of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and the laws. At the ſame time it will prevent a cowardly, degrading ſubmiſſion to the claims and meaſures of imperious deſpots, or a fawning, idolatrous, proſtration at the feet of a dignified fellow-worm. In ſhort, whilſt human laws puniſh criminal actions, it is the glory of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to prevent them, to tear up the roots from which they grow. Whilſt law is deaf and unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cries of penitent guilt, religion pardons and comforts the ſuppliant, returning offender, and hereby encourages and fortifies his purpoſes and efforts of future obedience. Whilſt the one enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſtrict juſtice only, the other inculcates the whole train of gentle and beneficent virtues: It inſpires an intercourſe of humane, generous kindneſs, and grateful attachment and fidelity, between the higher and lower claſſes in ſociety; an intercourſe, which like the vital fluid diffuſes chearful health through the whole political body. Thus civil inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions

and meaſures, even in their beſt ſtate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſuccours of religion, to ſupply their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies, to ſoften their rigour, to enforce and to ſweeten their obſervance.</p>
            <p>"BUT a ſenſe of honour, the deſire of eſteem and praiſe, and fear of their oppoſites, joined to the efficacy of ſalutary laws, will certainly form a ſufficient ſecurity of the general order and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare." We anſwer, the good influence of this principle will not bear a compariſon with that of religion. For the praiſe or cenſure of the world, exerts its principal force within a very ſmall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, upon more ſplendid or public characters; whilſt the great majority of the people, concealed under humble roofs, feel little of its efficacy. But religion applies its ſtimulating or withholding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to the ignorant, the obſcure, and the weak; as well as to the wiſe, the noble and the mighty. The world does not beſtow its palm, till men have almoſt reached the goal; but religion applauds and cheriſhes the firſt virtuous deſire, intention, or, effort. The world often miſtakes in its judgment of characters and actions; but religion places an unerring witneſs and judge in our very boſoms. In a word, even the eſteem of men in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, ultimately derives its force from religion. For if the ſocial or moral virtues of mankind, were once ſtripped of the luſtre, the ſtability, and the majeſty, which religious principles communicate, the reſpect paid to them, would ſuffer an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſhock: The idea of honour and diſgrace, connected with their performance or omiſſion, would be greatly enfeebled: And the opinion of the world, left without a ſteady guide, would grow
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024841_0012_0FCD6A9F20C432E8"/>
too fluctuating and capricious, to reſtrain or to actuate human conduct.</p>
            <p>"BUT the connexion between the intereſt of the public and of individuals, lays a ſufficient bond upon the latter to contribute to the order and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the former." We reply, this connexion is not always ſo immediate and ſtriking, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the unthinking, the poor and the wretched, to pay homage to the order and beauty of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſyſtem, whilſt there is nothing for them indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, but apparent deformity and miſery; whilſt thoſe very principles and rules, which ſecure har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the public, wealth, power and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to ſome of their fortunate neighbours, ſeem to bind them down to perpetual poverty and toil; and when a violation of theſe laws promiſes inſtant relief or benefit to themſelves, and at the ſame time, perhaps threatens no direct injury to the community at large. There are ſome caſes too, in which the more opulent ranks, or the governing powers of the State, may with reaſon conſider the public intereſt and their own, as ſeparate objects: And if their minds are not enlightened and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by religion, they will often view theſe two intereſts as diſtinct, when they really unite. They will alſo be ſupremely inclined to purſue private advantage, at the expence of every rival claim. In ſuch inſtances, what is there effectually to reſtrain ſuch elevated characters from ſacrificing the public, at the ſhrine of their adored, though paltry idol? There is nothing which promiſes a ſure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual guard againſt theſe evils, but religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſentiment of a Deity, and of a future ſtate of recompence, early planted in the minds,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024841_0013_0FCD6AA088779270"/>
and deeply rooted in the hearts both of the high and the low.</p>
            <p>"BUT ſome infidel and irreligious characters have conducted well in a ſocial and political view." We anſwer, religious ideas early taught and imbib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will ſecretly influence the conſcience and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, long after the underſtanding has begun to queſtion, and even to reject the arguments, on which they are founded. Beſides, a habit of order and propriety in conduct, once formed, is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued by after ſpeculations; eſpecially when an adherence to it is connected with the marks of public eſteem and favour, or enforced by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding motive of private intereſt. Not to add, that there are ſome, who affect a ſuperiority to the common maſs of mankind, by talking like infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, who yet feel themſelves conſtrained to think and act, in many inſtances, like vulgar believers.</p>
            <p>"BUT if religion be the main prop of ſocial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, why does not the latter always relax and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline with the former?" The anſwer is, religion ſtill keeps her hold of men, through the medium of natural conſcience, of early habit, and ſome aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful controlling impreſſion of a future retribution, even when their hearts do not feel her transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, nor their lives diſplay her peculiar and moſt attractive charms. If then religious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples have ſuch ſalutary effects on ſociety, even when their influence is feeble, and when they manage the human mind by the inferiour and precarious han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of fear; what would be their fruits, if they reigned in full glory, and commanded the free and ſteady ſervices of love? If love to GOD and men,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024841_0014_0FCD6AA204BAC508"/>
which is the life of religion, pervaded all claſſes in the community, what a copious and excellent har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt would it quickly produce! This would enſure the univerſal practice of all thoſe virtues, which nouriſh and exalt a nation; whilſt it directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the intereſt and comfort of all ages, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſtations; it would, as the great law of moral attraction, draw the affections and efforts of all to one common center, the good of the whole. Muſt not ſuch a ſpirit and conduct immediately advance the reſpectability, the vigour, the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſpiritual proſperity of a people? Muſt they not draw down the approving ſmiles, the guardian care, the rewarding munificence of the SUPREME Ruler of nations? On the other ſide, muſt not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, and its natural offspring, vice, equally tend, both by a direct and a judicial operation, to disjoint, to enfeeble, to deſtroy a community? Does not the univerſal experience of public bodies from the beginning to this day, ſeal the truth of theſe obſervations? Is it not one mighty practical demonſtration of the ſalutary fruit of piety and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or the baneful influence of their oppoſites, upon the order, the liberty, the general welfare of nations?</p>
            <p>THE neceſſity of religion to public happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficiently proved, an intereſting queſtion ariſes; what are the beſt means of diffuſing and maintaining in a community this precious and fundamental bleſſing? This inquiry brings up to view the importance of public religious inſtructors. The political neceſſity of ſuch an order of men, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly reſults from that of religion itſelf, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the ignorance, dulneſs, and depravity
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024841_0015_0FCD6AA622A38DC0"/>
of the human mind, the ſpiritual and ſublime na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of religious truths, the want of leiſure as well as ability in the bulk of mankind, for ſtudying and familiarizing them, and the influence of ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects of worldly cares and amuſements to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept their view, to efface or weaken their impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In this dark and impure region," how apt are even the moſt contemplative and virtuous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters to loſe ſight of moral and ſpiritual objects, and to get out of the ſphere of their attractive and regulating influence! How greatly then do we all need the friendly voice of STATED MONITORS, to recal our forgetful, wandering feet; and to enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and warm our hearts afreſh with the divine principles and motives of religion! Thoſe in high ſtation need to be frequently reminded, that there is a BEING above them, to whom they are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, equally with the loweſt of the people. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of great genius and learning, require to be often admoniſhed that their obligations to ſerve GOD and the public, are proportioned to their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour talents. The worthy and good in ſociety, need a frequent and lively inculcation of thoſe truths, which tend to nouriſh and fortify their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to enliven and extend their efforts of uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. How much more needful, then is public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious inſtruction to the inferiour members of the community, to the numerous claſs of laborious poor, to the groſſly ignorant, the careleſs, and the vicious! Without this, how ſhall they obtain a competent knowledge, or an abiding practical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their various relations and duties to GOD, to man, to civil ſociety?</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:024841_0016_0FCD6AA7474D9D18"/>
IN this view, the public worſhip of the DEITY, and ſtated inſtructions in religion and morality, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as neceſſary and beneficial to the State, as they are to the ſouls of individuals: And the inſtitution of a WEEKLY SABBATH, devoted to thoſe purpoſes, is the offspring of profound and generous policy, if viewed merely in its aſpect upon our preſent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial condition. For the decent and united obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, by the Members of each Corporation, is, an eminent mean of promoting uſeful knowledge, civilization and good neighbourhood; of ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the cords both of political and chriſtian union; of bringing ſeaſonable reſt and refreſhment to the body and mind, after the fatigues of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care and toil; and of keeping alive in the minds of all ranks, an awful commanding ſenſe of DEITY, of moral and religious obligation: Agreeably, the public benefits of this inſtitution are diſtinctly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the face of thoſe communities, which care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupport and obſerve it; whilſt the contrary features equally diſtinguiſh thoſe, which deſpiſe or neglect it.</p>
            <p>THE preacher cannot do full juſtice to this part of his theme, or to his own profeſſion as a Goſpel Miniſter, without adding, that the CHRISTIAN RELIGION, properly ſtated and enforced by its teachers, has a peculiarly favourable influence upon the preſent ſocial ſtate of mankind: For, it is the volume of revelation only, that fully illuſtrates and confirms, and with due authority preſſes, thoſe great religious principles, which we have ſhown to be the baſis of virtue and of order. At the ſame time it ſuperadds a new ſcheme of truth, ſuited to the lapſed ſtate of mankind, which at once encourages,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024841_0017_0FCD6AA92F0B8888"/>
directs, aſſiſts and conſtrains to univerſal goodneſs; it preſents the DEITY, in the full orbed luſtre of his perfections; it diſplays the matchleſs philanthropy, the generous expiation and interceſſion of his Son; it offers and conveys the needed ſuccours of his ſpirit; it aſcertains and deſcribes the future joys and ſorrows of immortality. Muſt not theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, ſuitably realized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> powerfully tend to check tranſgreſſion—to kill the ſeeds of vice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, to enoble, and improve every branch of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous character? The moral ſyſtem too, which chriſtianity builds upon theſe principles, is an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent friend to our preſent felicity. For it incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the moſt extended, the moſt active, the moſt ſelf-denying benevolence; it links us to the great brotherhood of man; yea, it unites us to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, to eternity, and to GOD, the head and ſum of both. It levels all the haughty feelings of ſuperiour rank or abilities, and places true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in humble, condeſcending, elevated goodneſs. By this, as well as by conſtantly pointing us to thoſe two great levellers, death and an endleſs retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it introduces a kind of generous republican equality among the different orders and conditions in ſociety. It equally regards and ſecures the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of all the members of the community, by that great rule of equity, "whatever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them." By preſenting the ſame motives and rewards of virtue to the weak and the ſtrong, and by urging both to ſecret acts of goodneſs, from a regard to the approving eye, and final recompence of the SUPREME JUDGE; it provides a ſteady ſupport, a conſtant opportunity, a univerſal engagement to the practice of virtue. We may add, it regulates
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024841_0018_0FCD6AAB5C8266A0"/>
and refines thoſe important ſocial connexions and duties, the conjugal, parental and filial, in a manner highly favourable to the order and happineſs of human ſociety. In a word, the ſpirit of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is uniting and peaceable: It is loyal, patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and free: It is the life and ſupport of good government and of rational liberty. Even the poſitive, ceremonial rites of chriſtianity, properly adminiſtered, are important out-works, which guard the public welfare: For by ſtriking upon the ſenſes and imaginations of men, they bring affecting truths with peculiar force to their hearts, and hereby operate to produce a decent and regular outward deportment.</p>
            <p>WHAT an engine of public uſefulneſs, then, does the chriſtian inſtitution put into the hands of its Miniſters! And how important is it to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, that ſuch an order of men ſhould be ſpread out over the whole community! What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable aid may they afford to, as well as receive from, the civil Magiſtrate! Whilſt the people at large reap a plentiful harveſt from the united la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of both! Which brings us more diſtinctly to point out out the ſeveral ways in which the Ruler and Prieſt may and ought to combine their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or to aſſiſt each other, in leading the people of GOD.</p>
            <p>WE mean not to advocate ſuch a union or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of the two orders, as involves a heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous mixture of civil and ſpiritual objects; as places the Magiſtrate upon CHRIST'S throne, in the Church, and inveſts the chriſtian Miniſter with the honors and the powers of the State: Such motley
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024841_0019_0FCD6AAC92F84708"/>
alliances are the offspring of political and prieſtly ambition, aided by equal cunning; are the main pillar both of civil and religious tyranny; and the ſource of infinite miſchiefs to the intellectual and moral character as well as the temporal condition of mankind. They infect the beſt religion under Heaven, its Profeſſors and Miniſters, with the ſpirit of this world, with a proud, cruel, perſecuting and immoral diſpoſition. As a celebrated writer obſerves, "perſecution is not an original feature in any religion; but is always the ſtrongly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed feature of all law, religion, or religions eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by law. Take away the law-eſtabliſhment, and religion re-aſſumes its original benignity. In Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica a Catholic Prieſt is a good citizen, a good cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and a good neighbour; an Epiſcopalian Miniſter is of the ſame deſcription; and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from there being no law-eſtabliſhment in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica."</p>
            <p>BUT whilſt we execrate ſuch treaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies between Rulers and Prieſts, againſt the deareſt rights and intereſts of man, we may conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently recommend to the two orders, a liberal and patriotick combination for the general good. There is indeed, in many reſpects, a natural alliance between intelligent, virtuous Magiſtrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, in a free and chriſtian State.</p>
            <p>AND firſt, the Magiſtrate may and ought to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with the chriſtian inſtructor, by throwing the weight of his perſonal example and private influence into the ſcale of chriſtian piety and virtue. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of example, when arrayed in all the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of high office, is not to be deſcribed. As re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024841_0020_0FCD6AAE04D3BF90"/>
adds grace and dignity to the moſt exalted ſtation, ſo ſhe derives a ſuperiour charm and majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from it.</p>
            <p>WHEN the great political characters in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, give their uniform ſanction to religion, by exhibiting her faireſt features in their daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; when they openly revere the name, the ſabbaths, the temple, and all the ſacred inſtitutions of the Moſt High; when they liberally and zealouſly contribute to the ſettlement and ſupport, the reputation and ſucceſs of a learned and virtuous Prieſthood, to the extenſive propagation of chriſtian knowledge, and to the pious education of the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing age; when they are eminent patterns of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue themſelves, and are careful to cheriſh and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our it in others; how unſpeakably do ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples confirm and extend the credit and influence of religion! What animation and confidence, what ſuperiour reſpectability and ſucceſs, do they give to its teachers! What authority and energy muſt the inward conſciouſneſs, and open luſtre of ſuch virtue impart to Rulers themſelves, in their official pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; eſpecially thoſe which have for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the ſuppreſſion of wickedneſs, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the oppoſite intereſt! Which leads us to obſerve, that Rulers e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>icaciouſly concur with chriſtian Miniſters, when they carry the ſpirit of religion into their public conduct: When all their political meaſures are regulated by the everlaſting maxims of natural juſtice, of chriſtian equity and benevolence: When they accordingly diſtribute the burdens, apply the reſources, fulfil the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and diſcharge the debt of the public, with the ſcrupulous fairneſs, the exact economy, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024841_0021_0FCD6AB02CCBE540"/>
attention required by thoſe rules, in the ſimilar tranſactions of private citizens: When they deteſt and ſcorn the idea of ſanctioning by their public authority, any meaſure, which they would bluſh to avow or to practiſe in their individual ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: In ſhort, when the whole ſyſtem of their public conduct appears to be prompted and guided by a SUPREME regard to the example and laws, the approbation and honour of the infinite RULER and the good of his moral family: What a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous atteſtation is here of the reality, the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force of religious obligation! Such a train of political meaſures is pregnant with various and almoſt inconceivable good. It inculcates various ſentiments upon the public mind, with all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and force of the higheſt, the moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, and unequivocal example. It alſo directly and efficiently contributes to the general proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For it proceeds upon principles, which are as eſſentially neceſſary and conducive to ſocial union and happineſs, as the laws which govern the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial world, are to the harmony and welfare of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, the Magiſtrate may greatly ſtrengthen the chriſtian Teacher, by directing his public atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the advancement of religion and virtue as an immediate and primary object; by ſo arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his meaſures for the increaſe of temporal good, as to render them in the beſt manner ſubſervient to that which is ſpiritual and eternal; by enacting and executing laws for the prevention or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of profaneneſs and immorality; by promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtuous characters to offices of honor and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; by neglecting and diſpiſing the vicious;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024841_0022_0FCD6AB151C823A8"/>
by leſſening and removing the temptation to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; by augmenting and multiplying the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to goodneſs; by giving birth and efficacy to public and private means of learning, ſo eſſential to rational piety; by effectually providing for the ſupport and decent obſervance of public religious worſhip and inſtruction ſo neceſſary, as we have ſeen, to the virtue, the civilization, and happineſs, of the community. Such a legal proviſion for the maintainance of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious inſtitutions, obviouſly falls within the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the Magiſtrate, on account of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent importance to civil government and ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Nor does ſuch proviſion adjuſted upon an equal and liberal plan, make the leaſt approach to a political eſtabliſhment of any particular religious profeſſion, nor conſequently invole any invaſion of the prerogative of CHRIST, or the ſacred rights of conſcience. On the other hand,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. The chriſtian Miniſter may and ought to ſtrengthen the hands of the civil Ruler. If he poſſeſſes thoſe qualities of head and heart, which ſuit his benevolent and comprehenſive office, he muſt have the moſt tender and ardent feelings for the intereſt of the State, as well as the Church. He muſt perceive an important connexion between them, as well as the friendly aſpect of the chriſtian doctrine upon both. He muſt conſequently feel a double ſtimulus to a prudent and faithful diſcharge of his truſt. He therefore endeavours, both in his public miniſtrations, and in his private converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and example, ſo to repreſent and enforce the chriſtian ſyſtem, as that it may, under the divine bleſſing, have its full effect upon the character and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024841_0023_0FCD6AB285FD7E38"/>
condition of mankind, in reference to this world and the next. He takes particular care not to make this beneficent and peaceable religion, an engine of civil or ſpiritual tyranny, confuſion, malignant ſtrife, or in any reſpect, an inſtrument of increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inſtead of leſſening human depravity and wretchedneſs. He feels himſelf peculiarly united to the worthy Magiſtrate, by the ties of perſonal eſteem and public affection. He ſtudies that his whole deport<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nt reſpecting the Rulers and the laws, may expreſs and promote a ſpirit of decent ſubjection and obedience, and he enforces ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by all the authority and ſanction of religion. His ſocial intercourſe with his family and flock, his daily prayers in private and in public, tend to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and to nouriſh the ſentiments of loyalty and patriotiſm. He loves to mention in the ears of the riſing race, the names and ſervices of patriot Rulers, of eminent public benefactors; and hereby to charm the tender mind to the love of virtue, of country, of mankind, as well as to a due venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for, and grateful ſubmiſſion to ſuch Miniſters of divine benevolence. His public diſcourſes too, all tend either directly or remotely, to form his hearers into good citizens and ſubjects, as well as holy chriſtians. That ſuch a reciprocation of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between the two orders, falls within the line of propriety and important duty, is too obvious to the eye of diſcernment, to require a formal illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>IT is with great ſatisfaction, that we appeal to the hiſtoric page of our own country, for a ſtriking comment upon the preceeding diſcourſe. Our fathers were led out of the houſe of bondage in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024841_0024_0FCD6A52AEA5C1D8"/>
Britain, into the wilderneſs of America, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, as in the land of promiſe, by the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Shepherd, who led ancient Iſrael from deep oppreſſion and miſery, to the joys of freedom and plenty. The ſame good ſpirit, which inſpired Moſes and Aaron, to undertake and conduct ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous an enterprize, evidently guided and animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leaders in that great attempt, which gave birth to New-England. The ſame union of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, of counſel and exertion in the public cauſe, which characterized the Hebrew Lawgiver and High-Prieſt, diſtinguiſhed the political and religious Fathers of Maſſachuſetts. The rulers of the State, were at the ſame time Members and pillars of the Church. The religion which they thus ſolemnly profeſſed, was the rule of their public and private conduct, and the advancement of its intereſts, a main object of both. For this purpoſe, they readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly co-operated with the ſchemes and endeavours of worthy clergymen, and contributed their beſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for their comfort, reputation and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>THE advice and influence of the prieſthood were likewiſe ever at hand, to aid and ſucceed the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Magiſtrate, and to promote the civil, as well as religious intereſts of the people. It is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, indeed, that our anceſtors carried this union of Church and State, to an unwarrantable length. But this was not their peculiar fault: It was the complexion of the age. And ſhall we, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who owe ſo much to their generous ſervices and ſufferings, ſhall we, like undutiful and curſed <hi>Ham,</hi> take pleaſure in expoſing their nakedneſs? No, my fellow-citizens; whilſt we ſpread a veil of filial, piety over their imperfections, let us
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024841_0025_0FCD6AB7CA9BE970"/>
with the moſt grateful emotions, celebrate that united agency of Moſes and Aaron, which, under GOD, laid ſuch early and noble foundations of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and order, of ſcience and religion; which in the feeble infancy, and great poverty of the ſettlement gave birth to a public ſeminary of learning; a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, which from its foundation, to this day, has borne on its front the united inſcription of the Ruler and the Prieſt, in the names of its Founders, and Benefactors, of its Governors and Sons! But paſſing over the intermediate ſtages of our hiſtory; you will permit me modeſtly to aſk, does not the inſcription juſt mentioned, appear very conſpicuous on the face of our late glorious revolution? Did not theſe two orders remarkably unite their efforts to keep the public mind in a poſture of vigilance, of information, of patriotic ardour? In thoſe times which tried men's ſouls, did not the public prayers and diſcourſes, the private infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ence and example of the great body of the clergy, firmly and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully co-operate with the civil and military mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the country? Did not the ſame zealous concurrence of the two departments, procure the adoption of the excellent conſtitution of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, and of the preſent federal ſyſtem, which gives union, order, and happineſs to America? Did not the ſame virtuous and unſhaken combination emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently mark that perilous and alarming criſis, which a few years ſince paſſed over this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? Do not theſe ſtriking facts evince, that the ſpirit of the clerical office at leaſt, in this enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and free country, is an important friend to the liberty, government and happineſs of ſociety? On the other hand, it becomes us gratefully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſupport which religion and its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024841_0026_0FCD6AB947B86508"/>
have received from the civil government of this State, from the authority and example of ſome of the firſt political characters in it; the additional reputation and ſucceſs which they have inſtrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally derived from that ſource; and the conſequent face of ſuperiour union and order, civilization and virtue, which adorns a great part of our community. Theſe advantages would ſtrike us with much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er force, were we allowed to contraſt our ſituation in theſe reſpects, with that of ſome other parts of the Union: But decency forbids the invidious compariſon.</p>
            <p>WHEN we look over this numerous and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſſembly, a cloud of witneſſes ruſhes upon our ſenſes and hearts, in ſupport of the ideas now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
            <p>OUR eye is firſt caught by the CHIEF MAGIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRATE of this Commonwealth, who has had a large ſhare in the great political drama, that has been act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſtage of the new world, and covered it with glory. The preſence of his Excellency reſtrains the lips of delicacy from paying him a formal tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of praiſe. But while his diſtinguiſhed politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſervices are engraven on every American boſom, juſtice to a different part of his character, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains us to obſerve, that he has ever treated reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, its inſtitutions and Miniſters, with a reſpect becoming the enlightened, conſiſtent patriot, and Ruler, in a chriſtian State. The clergy within his juriſdiction, feel the animating influence of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and patronage, and wiſh him in return, a large experience of the comforts of our divine religion, amidſt that trying ſcene of bodily infirmity, with
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024841_0027_0FCD6ABAF5BAAF38"/>
which he has ſo long been afflicted. It is alſo our united prayer to GOD, that his Excellency may ever form his whole private and public conduct upon the divine model propoſed in the life and precepts of the chriſtian lawgiver. That ſo his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal example and official meaſures may unite their influence to ſpread piety and virtue as well as every temporal bleſſing, through the community. To this, he will feel himſelf urged by every motive, which can operate upon a heart of ſenſibility; in particular, by the intereſting proſpect of death and endleſs retribution, to which the higheſt earthly god is equally bound with the loweſt of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. May conſcious fidelity chear the ſolemn hour of diſſolution, inſpire boldneſs before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive tribunal, and be crowned with ſuperiour glory in the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>HIS Honour, the Lieutenant-Governour, merits our tribute of reſpect, on account of that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed union of political wiſdom, patriotic virtue, and chriſtian piety, which has long dignified his character. Notwithſtanding the eminence of his reputation among the civilians of the age, he has not been aſhamed of the croſs of Chriſt, but has long been inliſted under that deſpiſed, but heavenly banner. May he ſtill continue an ornament and pillar, both of the Church and Commonwealth, till his hoary head ſhall come down to the grave in peace.</p>
            <p>THE Honourable Council claim our regards, on account of their important ſhare in the executive department, and worthy perſonal qualities, which pointed them out to the ſuffrages of their enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024841_0028_0FCD6ABD432F46F0"/>
fellow-citizens. Whilſt their elevation to this office reflects on them a ray of glory, it obliges them to a correſpondent dignity of ſentiment and conduct: It invites them to a noble imitation of the governing wiſdom, juſtice and mercy of HIM, who is the wonderful Counſellor, the King of righteouſneſs and of peace. It particularly calls them to adviſe and conſent to the appointment of ſuch characters only, to interpret and execute the laws, as are exemplary themſelves for the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of human and divine injunctions, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with talents and diſpoſitions ſuited to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truſt. In this way they may unſpeakably promote the civil and moral intereſts of all parts of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>THE Gentlemen who compoſe the two Branches of the Honourable Legiſlature, will permit our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations on the freſh mark of eſteem and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with which their conſtituents have honoured them. They will likewiſe remember that the truſt, with which they are charged, is very ſolemn and momentous; that it is rendered ſtill more awful, by the declarations and oaths, with which they have recently entered on its execution. As we cannot doubt their ſincerity in thoſe profeſſions and appeals to Heaven, we entertain a chearful hope that all their tranſactions on this day and through the year, will be regulated by the excellent princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of that religion, and of thoſe civil conſtitutions which they have publicly taken for their guide. We reaſonably expect that all their laws and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings will be ſo many branches growing out of the ſtock of equal juſtice and comprehenſive bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence; that they will be ſtrongly marked with
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024841_0029_0FCD6ABEC98921B0"/>
the ſame integrity, virtue and honor, which ſuit and adorn the rational and chriſtian character in a private capacity. They will ever remember that the ſame practical principles, muſt form the baſis both of public and individual happineſs and glory; and that the policy of thoſe who would rear he fabrick of national proſperity upon a different foundation is equally unphiloſophical and iniquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. As human art, in order to produce certain uſeful effects muſt conform to the principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the eſtabliſhed laws of its great Architect; ſo the politician muſt build the order and welfare of ſociety upon thoſe moral principles and connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, which the ſame ALMIGHTY RULER, has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the rational ſyſtem. If he act an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite part, he virtually, attempts a new creation: Yea, like the man of ſin, he exalts himſelf above all that is called GOD; for it is the glory of the DEITY himſelf, though he be an abſolute ALMIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY SOVEREIGN, that he cannot govern upon any other plan than that of inviolable truth, juſtice, and goodneſs; that he cannot lie to any of his ſubjects, or trifle with their reaſonable petitions, expectations or claims. It will be the glory of our Rulers, to copy after this divine original. No idea therefore of omnipotence or uncontrolled Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, will be permitted to infect their delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deciſions; but their whole conduct, as it reſpects particular citizens, the Commonwealth in general, and the great American Republic, will, we truſt, exhibit a fair picture of honeſt, enlarged and Federal policy.</p>
            <p>HONORED FATHERS: As you do not remove out of the ſphere of religious obligation, by entering the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024841_0030_0FCD6AC03022FB98"/>
circle of politicks; as you, have all this day profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the chriſtian belief, and many of you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete viſible members of the Redeemer's family; you will feel under the moſt ſacred ties, to devote the ſuperiour powers and advantages of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtations, to the chriſtian intereſt. Whilſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you tenderly guard the rights of conſcience, and afford equal protection to all peaceable citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, you will make and enforce every needful proviſion for the general diffuſion of religious and moral ſentiments, and for the maintenance and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of thoſe chriſtian and literary inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are requiſite to that end. Among ſuch inſtitutions, the neighbouring Univerſity has a diſtinguiſhed claim to your liberal patronage. It has been one of the grand nurſeries of civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, liberty, good government and religion. Our very exiſtence, as a reſpectable community, is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der GOD, greatly derived from that ſource. Filial gratitude then, as well as every ſentiment of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic virtue, preſs our Rulers to nurſe and cheriſh this their ancient parent, with a tender and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care.</p>
            <p>IN a word, let me reſpectfully call upon all our civil officers, in every department, to conſecrate their authority, influence and example to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good of the community. You, Gentlemen, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively conſidered, are the moving and regulating principle of the whole political machine. If you jointly and ſtrenuouſly purſue a virtuous train of conduct, it will operate like a powerful charm upon all parts of the ſyſtem, and call up a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beauty, virtue and happineſs. Let it then be your firſt ambition and endeavour, to make
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024841_0031_0FCD6AC1DCB2D510"/>
mankind wiſer, better and happier; to raiſe up the drooping head of virtue; to tread down irreligion and vice; to enlarge the empire of knowledge and righteouſneſs; to augment as much as poſſible, the ſum of created good, and of creating and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory.</p>
            <p>AND ſince the advancement of theſe great inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts lies very much between you and the ſtanding teachers of religion, let gentlemen in theſe different orders cultivate a friendly and patriotic alliance, by all the methods which prudence and generous virtue ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>YE venerable leaders of our civil and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal tribes; how many and how forcible are the ties which bind you together! In this land of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and religious freedom, you both derive your election to office from one ſource; you are fellow-labourers in one great and benevolent cauſe; you are important members of one civil body, and by viſible profeſſion and ſacred obligation, of one chriſtian family; in the due performance of your ſeveral offices, you diſplay the ſame leading excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent talents and virtues, and mutually give and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the moſt important ſupport. Certainly then, there can be no ſtrife, no jealous diſtance between you; for ye are brethren. We congratulate the people of Maſſachuſetts, on the liberal and virtuous union, which at this moment ſubſiſts between you, and which is particularly exemplified in thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous laudable incorporations, which embrace many of your firſt characters; and which have for their object, the intereſts of ſcience, of arts, of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of humanity, of chriſtian knowledge and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024841_0032_0FCD6AC54B4FC850"/>
piety. To perpetuate this union and render it ſtill more operative to the general good, and not the low ſelfiſhneſs or vanity of exalting and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening his own profeſſion, conſidered as a ſeparate intereſt, has been the preachers governing motive in this diſcourſe; and with a view to the ſame grand object, he modeſtly ſubmits to the candour of both departments, a few monitory hints, ſuggeſted by the preſent aſpect of ſociety and of religion.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place: Our leading characters in the civil and the literary line, will feel the peculiar im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, at this degenerated period of animating their clerical brethren, in every method dictated by wiſdom and virtue; and particular, by encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to calculate their public miniſtrations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on principles of the moſt extenſive uſefulneſs. They will conſider, that many of us are connected with ſocieties, which are chiefly compoſed of the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and more illiterate claſs; that theſe peculiarly need the privileges of a weekly ſabbath and public religious inſtruction; and that many of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire very plain, and very pungent applications, in order to enlighten their ignorance, to rouſe their ſtupidity, or to check their vicious career. Our chriſtian patriots, therefore far from deſpiſing, will generouſly aid thoſe teachers, who frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, by all the methods of familiar, pathetic, or alarming addreſs, to reach and refine theſe rougher parts of the community. The enlarged know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience of our learned civilians will alſo inſpire ſentiments of candour towards the prieſthood, in regard to that variety of ſpeculation, of gifts, and addreſs, by which it is diverſified; they will view this diverſity as naturally reſulting
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024841_0033_0FCD6AC6C41D8B08"/>
in great meaſure from the ſpirit of free inquiry and improvement, which characterizes the preſent day. They will conſider too, that it furniſhes public teachers ſuited to the various capacities, taſtes and prejudices, and all the grades of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and condition, which at this period mark the face of ſociety. They will further conſider, that the operation of republican equality and religious freedom, will ſometimes introduce a chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor not perfectly agreeable to the reliſh or the ſpeculations of a few ſuperiour members of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, but perhaps very acceptable and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the general maſs of the people. In ſuch caſes, does not a regard to ſocial order, to equal rights, to the greateſt moral and political good, require a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and peaceable acquieſcence?</p>
            <p>ON the other hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it becomes the clergy at this day ſtudiouſly to hold up their office, and the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they teach, in the moſt reſpectable and pleaſing light. A ſpecial attention to this object, is rendered important, by the preſent improved ſtate of ſociety; by the learning and politeneſs, which adorn many of our religious aſſemblies; by the rapid progreſs of looſe ſentiments and manners, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent diſreliſh or contempt of chriſtian doctrines, inſtitutions, and teachers. To check theſe ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evils it becomes the ſacred order to pay great attention both to the private and public duties of their function; it becomes them, in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the latter, to diſplay a force of reaſoning, a propriety of thought, of method and expreſſion, a decency of ſtyle and addreſs, which may at once bear down the ſcoffs and the ſophiſtry of liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, juſtly pleaſe the taſte of literary refinement,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024841_0034_0FCD6ACAACE66668"/>
and at the ſame time exhibit the plain, the affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, the evangelical preacher. It becomes them both in their miniſtrations and perſonal example, to repreſent the chriſtian inſtitution and miniſtry, as friendly to human happineſs in both worlds; as breathing a ſocial and courteous, a candid and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, a loyal, uniting, and public ſpirit; a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which whilſt it ſupremely attaches us to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and rewards of the life to come, cheriſhes a proper ſenſibility of our rights, duties, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as inhabitants of the earth. It becomes them in every conſiſtent method, to ſupport the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil intereſts of the community, the reſpectability of its Rulers, and the efficacy of its Laws. And whilſt law ſpeaks to the public ear, in one uniform, inflexible tone, it is ours, my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, to bring home the addreſſes of religion to the boſoms of individuals; and by a pertinent and forcible application of her peculiar truths and ſanctions, to ſeize their conſciences, their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their hearts; to poſſeſs and command their inmoſt feelings. By this proceſs, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the all creating ſpirit; we are firſt to mould them into good men, and then by an eaſy tranſition into good citizens, rulers and ſubjects. Above all, let us ever keep in our own realizing view, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to enforce upon our people, the primary, the infinitely weighty object of our religion and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, viz. the ſpiritual, everlaſting ſalvation of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal beings, and the glory of GOD and his SON, ſhining forth in the wondrous contrivance, and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Whilſt our Rulers are puſhing forward our temporal proſperity and glory, let us labour to eſtabliſh and to complete that glory, by a correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding advancement of this moſt important ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Into this channel let us endeavour to draw
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024841_0035_0FCD6ACC1311CA48"/>
all the civil and literary, as well as religious advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which come within our reach. Let the unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed efforts of the clergy and laity, be eſpecially em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in diffuſing chriſtian knowledge and virtue, through thoſe vaſt territories of our country, whoſe poverty, and remote ſituation have precluded the ſtated enjoyment of religious inſtitutions; and in promoting a more general and effectual attention to the private means of education, in various parts of the Commonwealth. By ſuch a union of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic exertion, our leading characters in Church and State, will reſemble the two olive-trees, which the Prophet ſaw in viſion, emptying their golden oil into the candleſtick of Zion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fellow-Citizens of this great Aſſembly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I felicitate you and our common country, on the natural, civil and religious advantages, by which we are ſo eminently exalted; and eſpecially on the proſperous train of our national affairs, under the auſpices of indulgent Heaven, and its favourite Miniſter, the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. When we mention this beloved citizen and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor of America, every boſom preſent, feels the endearing and forcible illuſtration, which his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample gives to the leading ſentiment of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. For the charm of his piety, of his public and private virtue, as well as political wiſdom, has been a principal cement of our national union, and ſo a prime ſource of all its attendant bleſſings. What then is wanting to complete the glory and happineſs of our country? Nothing but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral prevalence of the ſame excellent ſpirit; a ſpirit of ſublime virtue, correſponding to the natural grandeur and extent of America, and to its noble
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024841_0036_0FCD6ACDF2A78B68"/>
conſtitutions of government and religion. Virtue enlightened and invigorated by political and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian knowledge, is eminently the ſoul of a republic. It is neceſſary to direct, to enliven, to guard the election of its Rulers, and to ſecure to them, the generous confidence, ſubmiſſion and co-operation of the people. It is peculiarly requiſite in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity like ours, ſpread out over ſuch an immenſe continent, divided by ſo many local governments, prejudices and intereſts: A people ſo circumſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, can never be firmly and durably united, under one free and popular government, without the ſtrong bands of religious and moral principle, of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and enlarged patriotiſm. Liberty planted in ſuch a ſoil, will be perpetually tending to unbridled licentiouſneſs, diſtracting jealouſies, and popular confuſion. Let us then ſet up a vigilant guard againſt theſe encroaching evils. Let us not imagine that the exerciſe of civil liberty, conſiſts in ignorant or envious abuſe of public characters and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; nor that religious freedom will juſtify care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs neglect or wanton contempt of the truths, the ordinances, and miniſters of that religion, which was ſent down from Heaven to guide us, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future happineſs. Though we are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the civil Magiſtrate for our religious ſentiments and worſhip; yet we certainly are to the DEITY; and he has given us no liberty in this enlightened country, either to think with Deiſts and Sceptics, or to live like Atheiſts; nor will the proſtitution of his Sabbaths, to idleneſs or amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in defiance of human and divine laws, paſs in his account for a mark of ſuperior politeneſs or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. In oppoſition to theſe wicked, but too modiſh abuſes of liberty, let us remember that energetic gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024841_0037_0FCD6AD16E554078"/>
is the guardian of freedom, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, eſpecially the chriſtian, is the pillar of both. Let us then properly reſpect, ſupport, and concur both with our civil and religious Miniſters. Let us exerciſe the moſt ſcrupulous care in the election of both, and be rationally ſatisfied, that their heads and hearts, their principles and morals, comport with the ſpirit of their ſeveral offices. But having choſen them, let us treat their perſons and adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations with that confidence and honour, which become a wiſe and magnanimous people, and which may, by the bleſſing of GOD, give the greateſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to their benevolent labours.</p>
            <p>FINALLY: As the crown of all, let us become pious towards GOD, humble and obedient believers in his SON, conſcientiouſly ſubmiſſive to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and laws of our country, ſober, frugal, and diligent in our ſeveral employments, juſt and kind to one another, unitedly and zealouſly attached to the great intereſts of America, and of the whole human fraternity. Then we ſhall hold out an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting example to all the world, of the propitious operation of a free government; we ſhall encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and accelerate the progreſs of reaſon, and of liberty, through the globe. Already has the new world diffuſed the light and warmth of freedom acroſs the Atlantic, into the old; which has given birth to a ſurpriſing and glorious revolution. Let us be nobly ambitious, by our future conduct, to feed and extend the generous flame; and thus to realize the wiſhes and hopes of all benevolent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in Heaven and earth. Let us eſpecially labour and pray, that theſe political ſtruggles and changes, may, under the divine agency, introduce new and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024841_0038_0FCD6AD2C40B81D8"/>
brighter ſcenes of chriſtian knowledge and piety, till the whole world ſhall be covered with divine glory and human bliſs. And may we in particular, after having filled our departments in ſociety here, with uſefulneſs and honor, be united to the more glorious community of the righteous; where the official diſtinctions of Moſes and Aaron, are known no more; where all the followers of the LAMB, ſhall form one royal prieſthood, one mighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of perfect and happy immortals; and GOD the originial ſource of being and bleſſedneſs, ſhall be ALL in ALL.</p>
