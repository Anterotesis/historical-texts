            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Instructions for young OFFICERS.</head>
            <byline>By General <hi>WOLFE.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>WHEN a young Gentleman betakes himself to the profession of Arms, he should seriously reflect upon the nature and duties of the way of life he has entered into, and consider, that it is not as the generality of people vainly imagine, learning a little of the exercise, saluting gracefully, firing his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toon in his turn, mounting a few guards (carelessly enough) and finally, exposing his person bravely in the day of battle; which will deservedly, and in the opinion of judges, acquire him the character of a good officer: no, he must learn chearfully to obey his superiors, and that their orders and his own be punctually executed.</p>
            <p>As there must of necessity be in a new battalion many young and uninformed officers, I shall, as briefly as I am capable, inform them what I think their duty, and what consequently is expected from them.</p>
            <p>They are, without loss of time, to make themselves perfect masters of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the firelock, that they may be able to assist in training the young soldiers in arms.</p>
            <p>They are constantly to be present at roll-calling; and, as soon as they can, make themselves acquainted with the names and persons of the men of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies they belong to; and as soon as possible with their characters, that they may know the proper subjects to encourage, and point out as examples, as well those also whom it will be necessary to keep a strict hold over.</p>
            <p>They are to observe that the men are dressed in a soldier-like manner, and conformable to the orders of the regiment.</p>
            <p>They are to get exact lists of the mens necessaries, and as well as the captains, of the arms, accoutrements, and stores.</p>
            <p>They under the captains are to be answerable that the proportion of the soldiers pay, ordered by the commanding officer, be laid out in good &amp; wholsome provisions.</p>
            <p>They are to visit their companies quarters at least thrice a week, see that they are kept clean, well aired, and beds made; and that if the landlords have any just cause of complaint against the soldiers, or the soldiers against the landlords, the aggrieved may, by application through the proper channel, find redress.</p>
            <p>They should frequently chuse the hour of the soldiers dining for their visitation, that they may judge whether their victuals are comfortably cooked; they should particularly at that hour inspect the quarters of those men who are billetted upon house of the lowest class, as they are most likely to be prevailed upon, by the disobedient soldier, to give him liquor for his meat.</p>
            <p>They must now-and-then occasionally go round the quarters between nine and eleven at night to see that the men keep regular hours conformable to orders, not always trusting to the reports of serjeants.</p>
            <p>A young officer should never think he does too much; they are to attend to the looks of the men, and if any are thinner or paler than usual, the reasons of their falling off may be enquired into, and proper means used to restore them to their former vigour.</p>
