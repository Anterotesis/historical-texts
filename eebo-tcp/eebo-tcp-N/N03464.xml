            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>This Pſalm</hi> of which our Text is a Part, is <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>

            <p>In the foregoing Pſalm, the holy Prophet had been relating <hi>God's Wonders of old,</hi> for his own <hi>Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in a difficult Time. <hi>In this</hi> he reſumes the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the <hi>Edification</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and enlargeth much upon it; ſhewing not only <hi>how good</hi> God had been to them, which was an Earneſt of further finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy; <hi>but</hi> how <hi>baſely</hi> they had <hi>carried</hi> themſelves to God, which <hi>juſtified</hi> him in <hi>correcting them,</hi> as he did at this Time, and <hi>forbad</hi> all their Complaints.</p>
            <p>Our Text is a <hi>Preface</hi> to this Piece of <hi>Church Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> commanding the Attention of the then <hi>preſent Age,</hi> and recommending it to the Study of <hi>the Generations to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Front</hi> of this <hi>Preface,</hi> the holy Pſalmiſt <hi>demands Attention</hi> to what he was about to deliver. The People of God are call'd upon to hearken to God's Law, his Will and Word: <hi>Give Ear, O my People, to my Law.</hi> Some make theſe the Pſalmiſt's Words; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> as a King, or <hi>Aſaph</hi> in his Name, as his <hi>Secratary</hi> of State, or <hi>Scribe</hi> to the ſweet Singer of Iſrael, here calls upon the People as his People, committed to his Charge, <hi>to give Ear to his Law</hi>: He calls his Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>his Law</hi> or <hi>Edict.</hi> Such was their commanding Force in themſelves; every good Truth receiv'd in the Light and Love of it, will have the Power of a Law upon the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From this Example</hi> of the royal Pſalmiſt we may note; <hi>That thoſe that are in civil Authority, would do well, as far as is conſiſtent with that Liberty in which Chriſt hath made us free, to interpoſe their Power for

the Edification of the People of God.</hi> Or the Pſalmiſt being a Prophet ſpeaks as God's Mouth, and ſo calls them his People, and demands Subjection to what was ſaid, as to a Law. <hi>Let him that hath an Ear, thus hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Hence</hi> we may <hi>obſerve</hi> this Note of DOCTRINE, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That the Miniſters of Chriſt ought in his Name to call upon the People of God, committed to their Charge, to hearken to his Law, his Will and his Word.</q>
            <p>God's <hi>Law</hi> is his <hi>Will,</hi> reveal'd in his <hi>Word</hi>; to this God's People ought to hearken; that is, to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the Power and Authority of it, and <hi>to yield</hi> a chearful Obedience to it. <hi>And to this Exerciſe of Godlineſs,</hi> the Miniſters of Chriſt ought to quicken and ſtir up the People of God under their Care and Watch: <hi>To this we are directed</hi> by the Example in our Text; for what was written afore Time was written for our Inſtruction and Admonition: The Writings of the Old and New Teſtament were given by Inſpiration of God, &amp; that for our Learning; <hi>For they are profitable for Doctrine, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for Correction, and Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs; that the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſh'd unto every good Work.</hi> And agreeably ſays the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>James</hi> 5.10.</note> 
               <hi>Take my Brethren, the Prophets who have ſpoken in the Name of the Lord, for an Example:</hi> And this we ſhould do, not only in their <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and in their <hi>Patience,</hi> but alſo in their <hi>holy Living,</hi> their <hi>examplary Converſation,</hi> and <hi>imitable Services</hi> to the People of God, in the <hi>fulfilment</hi> of <hi>their Commiſſion.</hi> We ſhould be Followers of them, wherein they have been Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Things which are <hi>Virtuous</hi> and <hi>Praiſe worthy</hi> and of <hi>good Report</hi>; of <hi>Holineſs</hi> of Life, of <hi>Purity</hi> of Doctrine <hi>Zeal</hi> for God, and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> in fulfilling the Miniſtry committed to them, and in Diſcharge of their Office as <hi>Watchmen</hi> upon the Wall.</p>

            <p>Hence then by Way of <hi>Application,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>We ſee the neceſſary and incumbent Duty both of Miniſters and People. Miniſters</hi> are to call upon thoſe under their Care and Charge, <hi>to give Ear to God's Law, and to incline their Ears to the Words of his Mouth</hi>; to know and to do that which is right, and that which the Lord their God requires of them. <hi>And the People</hi> are not at their Liberty <hi>whether they will hear, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will forbear:</hi> Their abſolute Duty lying upon them to receive Inſtruction, and to hearken to the Counſels of God.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us now, in God's Name and Fear, apply our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that which the Lord our God requires of us, in our reſpective Characters.</hi> And now; may the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Head of the Church,</hi> abundantly <hi>furniſh</hi> me with his <hi>Word,</hi> from Time to Time, <hi>agreable</hi> to your more <hi>ſpecial Circumſtances,</hi> a Word of <hi>Inſtruction, Reproof, Exhortation,</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi>: and having <hi>God's Word</hi> may I be enabled to ſpeak <hi>his Word</hi> in the <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and with <hi>Power,</hi> agreable to the <hi>lively Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> with <hi>Seriouſneſs, Gravity,</hi> and <hi>Solemnity,</hi> and with ſpecial and pertinent <hi>Application</hi> to the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of <hi>your Souls,</hi> ſeeking your Good, your <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Profit</hi> and <hi>Advantage,</hi> your <hi>Edification</hi> and <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and not any <hi>vain Glory</hi> or <hi>Applauſe</hi> of Men; <hi>you</hi> alſo being my <hi>Helpers,</hi> by your <hi>fervent Addreſſes</hi> to God for me, that I may <hi>obtain Grace</hi> to be <hi>faithful,</hi> and <hi>find Mercy</hi> of the Lord to be <hi>ſucceſsful.</hi> Thus to ſerve you and your's (by the Help of God) is my <hi>earneſt Deſire,</hi> in what may be attempted, in the <hi>following Articles</hi> of <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> upon this <hi>Occaſion,</hi> that God's Name may be glorified, and our Souls nouriſh'd by the ſincere Milk of the Word.</p>

            <p n="2">II <hi>The Reaſons given by the holy Prophet in our Text, to urge the Peoples Duty upon them, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the Inſtructions and Admonitions he was about to deliver to them in God's Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe were <hi>Three,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Things to be diſcours'd of were weighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>That they were Things of an ancient Date.</hi> And</p>

concern'd.</hi> All which render them worthy of Regard and Attention.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Reaſon given in our Text, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd Meſſenger of God, to urge the Peoples Duty upon them, in attending to the <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> and <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi> which he was about to give them in God's Name, is, <hi>that the Things to be diſcours'd of were weighty, and therefore deſerve Conſideration</hi> I will open my Mouth in a Parable, in that which is <hi>ſublime</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common</hi>

               <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Pool.</note> and <hi>dark Sayings,</hi> not from their <hi>Unintelligibleneſs,</hi> but by Reaſon of their <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Weight,</hi> and being of <hi>great Moment</hi> for the Peoples <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi>; and becauſe the Things contain'd in them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God's <hi>tranſcendent Goodneſs</hi> to an unworthy People; and their <hi>unparrallel'd Ingratitude</hi> for, and Abuſe of, ſuch eminent Favours, and their <hi>ſtupid Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Inſenſibleneſs,</hi> under ſuch excellent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Teachings of God's Word and Works, are indeed <hi>prodigious</hi> and <hi>hard to be believ'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may obſerve this Note of <hi>Doctrine, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That God's Word and Providences, the Ordinances, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and Laws of his Kingdom, both of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Grace, are Things of infinite Moment and Concern to us.</q>
            <p>Herein is contained the Whole of Man, reſpecting his <hi>preſent uſeful Being,</hi> and his <hi>future Comfort and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004236_0013_100403BAC592C5E8"/>
God's Word</hi> contains all Things neceſſary for him to know, believe, and practice, in order to his Fruition of the beſt Good, which will never end, after a Period is put to his ſhort Abode in this World. <hi>God's Providences</hi> are Diſcoveries of his Wiſdom and Power, and of his Kindneſs and Favour in <hi>upholding all Things,</hi> and in their <hi>univerſal Government,</hi> wherein he many Times ſhews himſelf ſtrong, on the Behalf of them that fear him; and ſometimes for their Inſtruction and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; and to vindicate the Honour of his own Holineſs and Juſtice, he diſplays his Indignation in the Executions of his Wrath upon bold and incorrigible Sinners.</p>
            <p>And in all this, wherein the <hi>Ordinances, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> of the Kingdom of Nature and Grace are exhibited and diſplayed to us, there are Things of <hi>infinite Moment</hi> and <hi>Concern</hi> to us; Things great and weighty and worthy of our <hi>Conſideration</hi> and <hi>utmoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Attention:</hi> For what can concern us more, than to know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>ourſelves,</hi> our <hi>Duty</hi> and our <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> More particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God's Word and Providences are weighty Things, and will appear to be of infinite Moment and Concern to us, if we conſider their glorious Author,</hi> THE ETERNAL GOD.</p>
            <p>He rules in the Kingdom of Providence and Grace: He utters his Voice, and lo! a <hi>mighty Voice,</hi> and a <hi>gracious Voice,</hi> in his <hi>providential Diſpenſations,</hi> and in <hi>his holy Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inſtructions, Precepts, Promiſes, and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Word of God, are all a Copy of his adore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perfections, who is infinite in <hi>Wiſdom, Holineſs, Juſtice, Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God's Works</hi> of Creation, Providence, and Grace, they are holy, tho' wonderful, and to be ſought into, tho' unſearchable, and his Ways righteous, tho' myſterious, and paſt finding out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore</hi> we ſhould conſider with whom it is we have to do, and remember that <hi>we cannot by Searching find out God, that we cannot find out the Almighty unto

Perfection. Secret Thing belong to God; but thoſe that are reveal'd, to us and to our Children, that we may do all the Words of his Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God's Word and Providences are weighty Things, and will appear to be of infinite Moment and Concern to us, <hi>if we conſider their important Deſign, to inſtruct and direct, rule and govern us, according to his holy and ſovereign Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that the <hi>glorious God</hi> ſays and does in his Word and in his Works, is agreable to the Perfection of his Nature: And ſo far forth as they refer to us, they are for our <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Direction, Rule</hi> and <hi>Government</hi>; that we may know God and our Duty, and be kept from the abominable Things which his Soul hates, and be preſerved in his Love and Favour; which muſt needs render theſe Things of infinite Moment to us. <hi>But in a Word, for I can but juſt mention what might be enlarg'd upon,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe Things are of the laſt Concern to us, and will appear to be ſo, if we conſider <hi>their End; the Glory of God, our Comfort here, and our Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>grand End,</hi> which the <hi>great God propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in all the <hi>Exertments</hi> of himſelf, viz. <hi>his own Glory,</hi> He made all Things, he upholds all Things, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and diſpoſes of all Things as he pleaſes, and all for the Advancement of his own Honour; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation which he hath made of himſelf in his written Word, is in the firſt Place for the ſame glorious Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for God can have no higher End than himſelf, who is the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and the End. <hi>And ſubordinately</hi> he <hi>propoſes</hi> the <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>his Creatures,</hi> and will make every Thing to work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Good of his Choſen. They ſhall conſpire for their Advancement in Grace, and to prepare them for the Life of Glory, which he will beſtow upon all ſuch, <hi>who by patient Continuance in Ways of Well-doing, ſeek for Glory, Honour and Immortality.</hi> God's Word and his providential Diſpenſations have all a Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to this, with reſpect to thoſe who make a right

Improvement of them; wherefore they muſt needs be of infinite Moment and Concern to us, and upon that Account demand our moſt careful and diligent Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Theſe Things</hi> are <hi>Weighty,</hi> and <hi>deſerve our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> God<hi>'s Word</hi> is ſo, his <hi>Works</hi> are ſo, and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be ſought out of all them that take Pleaſure in them</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we <hi>Infer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How reaſonable it is, that we yield Obedience to the Demands of God, in giving the moſt earneſt Heed to the Inſtructions and Admonitions, given us from his Word and Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is conſiſtent with the higheſt Reaſon, and we can have nothing to object againſt it. We are depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Creatures, and accountable Creatures, and our chiefeſt Intereſts are much concerned in our yielding ſuch Obedience. Wherefore it is highly reaſonable that we ſhould ſo do.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Hence how pleaſant and delightful ſhould it be to us to give ſuch Attention to the Inſtructions and Admonitions of God's Word and Works</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhould do it with all Chearfulneſs and readineſs of Mind. Our Submiſſion to the glorious God in ſuch an important Article, ſhould be the Joy and Rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Hearts, for in nothing can we take wiſer Meaſures, nor more directly conſult our own preſent Comfort and future Peace</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence how profitable ſuch an Attention to the Word and Works of God would be to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Way to engage the favourable Preſence of God with us, in which alone our Safety, Comfort, and Succeſs is comprehended; and this is the Way to be receiv'd to the Rewards of Grace, in which is the Life of our Souls, and the Happineſs of Eternity: See the Reaſonableneſs, Pleaſure, and Profit of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Hence alſo the Folly and Abſurdity of diſregarding the Calls of God from his Word and Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Folly</hi> is bound up in the Hearts of ſuch as do ſo they take the moſt direct Steps to their own Ruin. <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

            </p>
            <p>They were the Monuments of Antiquity, dark Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of old, <hi>which we have heard and known, and which our Fathers have told us</hi> They are Things of undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certainty, <hi>We have heard them and known them</hi>; and there is no Room left to queſtion the Truth of them.</p>

            <p>The Honour we owe to our <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> obligeth us to attend to that which our Fathers have told us, and as far as it appears to be true and good, to receive it with ſo much the more Reverence and Regard.

There is both <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in being inform'd of Things of ancient Date, that are of <hi>undoubted Verity,</hi> and of <hi>Moment</hi> and <hi>Importance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may obſerve this Note of <hi>Doctrine, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is a very agreable and uſeful entertainment to refreſh our Minds with the Remembrance of what God has done for us in our Day, and with his Dealings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Anceſtors, which were perform'd in the Days of old; in the Times of ancient Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is exceeding pleaſant to ingenious and inquiſitive Minds to reflect upon the <hi>Obſervables of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> within the Compaſs of their <hi>own Knowledge</hi>; and alſo to be entertain'd with thoſe of <hi>ancient Date,</hi> which were remark'd in the <hi>Days</hi> of their <hi>Fore Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſay any Thing to demonſtrate the Pleaſure that there is herein, the bare repeating the Text car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries its own Evidence along with it to all ſuch whoſe Minds are of this Stamp; and <hi>Herculean</hi> Labour would be but Labour loſt, to endeavour to form a reliſhing Idea thereof in the Minds of ſuch as are of another Mould.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I paſs to ſay, that it may be a very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and profitable Entertainment to reliſh our Minds with what God has done for us in our Day, and with his Dealings towards our Anceſtors, which were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in the Days of old; and to ſhow that in ſeveral Ways, and for ſeveral Ends and Purpoſes it may be ſo.</p>
            <p>Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To fix in our Minds a juſt Remembrance of the great and good Things, God hath done for us, and for our Progenitors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ſays the inſpir'd Penman in our Text, ver 4. <hi>Shewing to the Generation to come, the Praiſes of the Lord, and his Strength, and the wonderful Works that he hath done.</hi> We ſhould not preſently forget the merciful Appearances of God for us, or ours, it is an Argument of Ingratitude if we do; neither ſhould we ſoon let ſlip the awful Tokens of God's Diſpleaſure in any Inſtance, <hi>by Means of which our Fleſh has been made to tremble</hi>; but we ſhould lay up the remarkable

            <p n="2">2 <hi>To ſtir up in us a holy Fear of God and a Dread of his Wrath</hi>

            <p>Among the Purpoſes of Heaven in the Diſcoveries of the divine Diſpleaſure, in the Executions of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, this is one, <hi>that others may hear and fear,</hi> may thereby be admoniſh'd and take Warning. We ought to fear that holy and dreadful Name, the LORD OUR GOD. We ſhould have ſuch an Aw of the Majeſty of Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch a Dread of his Wrath, as to make us very cautious of doing any Thing to provoke him to come forth againſt us in Anger Now a <hi>ſerious Reflection</hi> upon what God has done, either in our own Day, or in ancienter Times, to puniſh his People for their Rebellions againſt him, may have, and ſurely it ought to have this <hi>Influence</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> upon us, thro' a holy Fear of God, to <hi>avoid</hi> thoſe <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> which were ſo provoking to the God of Heaven, that for the Honour of his great Name, he hath viſited his People with ſore Judgments and Calamities. This is particularly intimated to us in our Text, ver. 8. — <hi>and might not be as their Fathers, a ſtubborn and rebellious Generation, a Generation that ſet not their Heart aright, and whoſe Spirit was not ſtedfaſt with God.</hi> Further,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This may be of Uſe and Service to excite our Love, and increaſe our Gratitude to the ever bleſſed God</hi>

            <p>The many kind Things that Heaven has done for us and for our Fathers, ſhould influence us to love our moſt gracious and bountiful Benefactor, and ſhould enlarge our Hearts in Gratitude to him <hi>Every Day is a Witneſs for God that he is good, and does good</hi>; and calls for our conſtant and perſevering Returns of Love and Gratitude.

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004236_0019_1004281FA1E75A10"/>
Appearances</hi> of divine Favour, call for more <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>enlarged Returns</hi>: And many ſuch there have been, if we did but duly attend to them in our own <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and in the Days of our Fathers, which are very loud Calls to us, to love the Lord our Preſerver and Benefactor, and to render to him, our grateful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, according to the Benefits done unto us And a <hi>due Reflection</hi> upon theſe Things may have a <hi>ſpecial Tendency</hi> to ſtir us up to our Duty herein, and thereby greatly turn to our Advantage. Ver. 4 <hi>We will not bide them from their Children ſhewing to the Generation to come the Praiſes of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>To encourage us to put our Truſt in God, and to make him our Hope and Confidence at all Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that has deliver'd can deliver, and if our Ways pleaſe him he will yet deliver He has been, and is, the <hi>Hope of his Iſrael, and their Saviour in Times of Trouble</hi>; great and marvellous have been his Works of Salvation; and the Lord Jehovah is ſtill an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Fountain of Goodneſs, and in him there is everlaſting Strength. And this is one End of ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, particularly pointed at in our Text, ver. 7. <hi>That we might ſet our Hope in God.</hi> If we make God's Commandments our Rule, we may make his Covenant our Stay, for he is never unmindful thereof.</p>
            <p>Further,</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Such a Reflection may be of great Uſe and Service, to awaken in us a ſuitable Care, to conform our Tempers and Manners to the holy Will and Law of God, that we may engage his gracious Preſence with us, and obtain his Bleſſing upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This has been God's Manner, he will be with his People in a Way of Mercy and Bleſſing, while they adhere to him in a Way of Duty and Obedience. This we are aſſur'd of, from the Declarations of God's Word, and from the Hiſtory and Method of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Diſpenſations: thus we read, 2 Chron. 15 1, 2. <hi>And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the Son of Obed, and he went out to meet Aſa, and ſaid unto him,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004236_0020_1004282565AA3E10"/>
Hear ye Aſa, and all Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you while you be with him, and if you ſeek him, he will be found of you.</hi> Wherefore if we regard the Favour of Heaven, and in that our own Intereſt, ſuch a ſerious Reflection will have a Tendency to engage our Regards to the Will and Law of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to which are thoſe Paſſages in our Text, v. 5.6. and 7. <hi>For he eſtabliſhed a Teſtimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Iſrael, which he commanded our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they ſhould make them known to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. That the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which ſhould be born: Who ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and declare them to their Children. That they might ſet their Hope in God, and not forget the Works of God; but keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>A ſuitable Review of the great and good Things which the ever bleſſed God hath done in our Day, and in the Days of our Fathers, may be of Uſe and Benefit to our Poſterity, that they may inform'd of the Works of God, and call'd upon, not to forget the Hope of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor be unmindful of his Law</hi>; which for Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement duly to obſerve, he has ſo ſignally appear'd in Ways of Mercy; and for the Breach of which, he hath come forth in Anger, and marched thro' the midſt of his People in Indignation.</p>
            <p>But this Advantage of a due Notice of the Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables of Providence, is to be the Subject of a diſtinct Head, and therefore may be more particularly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by and by.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore only add here, upon the whole of what has been offer'd under this Note of Doctrine, That for ſuch ſacred Purpoſes as the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> of the <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>ſucceeding Generations,</hi> in the Fear, and Love of God, and Obedience to his Law; we have many Inſtances in our Bibles, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing the wonderful Works of God both preſent and former.</p>

Bounds: I ſhall therefore, only direct you to the Paſſages, and deſire that you would read and peruſe them at your Leiſure.</p>
            <p>To this Purpoſe is <hi>Moſes</hi>'s divine Song, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. when Iſrael triumph'd over their Enemies who were drowned in the Red Sea. And a great Part of the Book of Duteronomy is taken up with ſuch Accounts, and with ſolemn Calls and Exhortations there from to Obedience, particularly the 3d, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 29th Chapters, and to the ſame End is the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 32 Chap. which ſetteth forth God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Vengeance, and concludes with this Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Set your Hearts unto all the Words which I teſtify among you this Day, which ye ſhall command your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to obſerve and do, all the Words of this Law: For it is not a vain Thing for you becauſe it is your Life, and thro' this Thing ye ſhall prolong your Days in the Land whether ye go over Jordan to poſſeſs it.</hi> With the ſame pious Deſign, <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Captain and Leader of Iſrael, exhorting the People of God before his Death, and gave them a Narrative of God's Dealings with them. See <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23 and 24 Chap This alſo is the Run and this the Intention of the Teſtimony of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Lord's Prophet, againſt Iſrael, after they had ask'd a King. See 1 Sam. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chap. And many other Inſtances of the like Nature we have in the Book of Pſalms: Thus the Pſalm of which our Text is a Part, and to which Piece of Church Hiſtory it is a ſolemn Preface: And ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. in which we are directed to praiſe God for his ſpecial Favours to his Church, an Enumeration of which is therein given; and to the ſame Purpoſe is Pſal. 136.</p>

            <p>But I leave theſe Things of a general Purport, and paſs to conſider ſome Things more immediately refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>According to the Account which I have receiv'd, The Town of DEDHAM was the 16th or 18th Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the firſt Beginning of the Country.</p>
            <p>It was petition'd for as a Townſhip in 1636, and deſir'd that it might be call'd CONTENTMENT, which Name I doubt not was ask'd for <hi>ſome ſpecial Reaſon,</hi> and likely enough to denote the <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the then Inhabitants. <hi>However</hi> when the Grant was made, it was call'd by its preſent Name.</p>
            <p>Our Church Records ſay, "The Townſhip of <hi>Dedham</hi> conſiſting of about 30 Families, reſiding there 1637, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come together by divine Providence from ſeveral

Parts of <hi>England</hi>; few of them known to one another before."</p>
            <p>And being thus incorporated into a <hi>civil Society,</hi> and inveſted with the ſame Privileges that others enjoyed, they ſoon bethought themſelves about a <hi>Church State,</hi> for it was that, that their Hearts were principally upon.</p>
            <p>Agreably it is added in our ancient Records.</p>
            <p>"It was thought meet and agreed upon, that all the Inhabitants that affected Church Communion, or pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come, ſhould meet every 5th Day of the Week at ſeveral Houſes, in order lovingly to <hi>diſcourſe</hi> and <hi>conſult</hi> together of ſuch Queſtions as might further tend to ſtabliſh a peaceable and comfortable civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and prepare for ſpiritual Communion in a Church State. <hi>Partly</hi> that we might be further acquainted with the <hi>Tempers,</hi> Spirits and Gifts of one another; and <hi>partly</hi> that we might gain further Light in the Ways of Chriſt's Kingdom, and the Government of his Church." &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in the Purſuit of this Method, they prepar'd for, and at length came into a Church State in a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſolemn Manner.</p>
            <p>A particular Account of the Meaſures taken and of the Manner of their Combination is preſerv'd to us by the Care and Pains of that Rev. and venerable Genleman Mr. JOHN ALLIN, your firſt Paſtor: And whoever reads it, muſt allow, that there is in it a full Diſcovery of a ſincere Regard to the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, and to their own <hi>ſpiritual Edification</hi> in the Ways of God, (according to a Judgment of Charity) a ſtrict Regard to <hi>Holineſs</hi> of Life, and a great Care to maintain the <hi>Unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> in the Bond of Peace.

            <p>Of late Years, God's People in this Land, and we in this Place, have been under a <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>providential Diſpenſations,</hi> and have Reaſon to ſing both of <hi>Mercy</hi> and of <hi>Judgment.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And great has been the <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> of the <hi>bleſſed God</hi> to us; as in the <hi>Continuance</hi> of our <hi>precious Privileges</hi> both <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>ſacred</hi>; ſo in our <hi>ſpecial Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, Protections</hi> and <hi>Proviſions</hi>: In our <hi>Succeſſes</hi> againſt the <hi>Indian</hi> Enemy in the laſt War, tho' with the Loſs of much Treaſure, and many a valuable Life: In the <hi>Peace</hi> that we have of late Years enjoy'd: In the <hi>Salvations</hi> that we have hitherto been favour'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al from threatned Ruin and Deſtruction.

            <p>I entreat you to bear with my Plainneſs and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Speech; and <hi>ſuffer</hi> me to add, <hi>O let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> to <hi>recover</hi> that Spirit of <hi>Family Government</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> which our Fathers had: They <hi>rul'd</hi> their <hi>Houſes well,</hi> and <hi>had</hi> their <hi>Houſholds</hi> in good <hi>Subjection; Children and Servants</hi> knew their <hi>Places,</hi> and kept their <hi>Diſtances</hi>: But how is it now?

            <p>But in a Word,</p>

And therefore, as God provided for a Succeſſion of Miniſters in the <hi>Tribe of Levi,</hi> and the <hi>Houſe of Aaron,</hi> ſo he appointed that Parents ſhould train up their Children in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Law; and when they are grown up, they muſt <hi>ariſe and declare them to their Children</hi>; that as one Generation of God's Servants and Worſhippers paſſeth away, another Generation may come, and <hi>the Church,</hi> as <hi>the Earth,</hi> may <hi>abide forever.</hi> And thus GOD's Name among Men may be as the <hi>Days of Heaven.</hi> And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>The Rehearſal of God's memorable providential Diſpenſations to our Children, and ſuitably acquainting them therewithal, may have a happy Tendency thus to impreſs the Law of God upon them.</hi> His Providences both of Mercy and Judgment.</p>
            <p>It is requiſite that <hi>God's Works</hi> ſhould be <hi>made known</hi> to Poſterity, together with his <hi>Laws</hi>; the fulfilling of his Promiſes made to the Obedient, and his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings denounced againſt the Diſobedient: Let theſe be told to our Children, and to our Children's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:004236_0043_10042872891A4E98"/>And hence they may <hi>take Encouragement,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves to the <hi>Will of God,</hi> that not <hi>forgetting the Works of God</hi> wrought in former Days, or later Times, they may <hi>ſet their Hope in God,</hi> and <hi>keep his Commandments,</hi> may make his Command their Rule, and his Covenant their Stay. And thoſe only may with Confidence <hi>hope for God's Salvation,</hi> that make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of <hi>doing his Commandments.</hi> The <hi>Works of God,</hi> duly conſidered, will very much ſtrengthen our Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, both to <hi>ſet our Hope in him,</hi> and to <hi>keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, hence may Children <hi>take Warning,</hi> to conform to thoſe <hi>Examples of their Fathers</hi> which have not been good, and for which God hath viſited them with his ſore Rebukes, <hi>that they might not be as their Fathers, a ſtubborn and rebellious Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Character of Fathers is, that they are <hi>ſtubborn and rebellious,</hi> that they walk contrary unto God, who tho' they profeſs Relation to him, yet do not ſet their Hearts aright; are not cordial in their Engagements to God, nor inward with him in their Worſhip of him, and therefore their <hi>Spirits are not ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with him,</hi> but upon every Occaſion fly from him: Children ſhould <hi>take Warning</hi> not to follow <hi>their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And verily thoſe that are deſcended from wicked and ungodly Anceſtors, if they will but conſider the Word and Works of God, will ſee Reaſon enough not to tread in their Steps: 'Twill be no Excuſe for <hi>a vain Converſation,</hi> that it was <hi>receiv'd by Tradition</hi> from our Fathers, for what we know of them that was ill, and the Puniſhments that they receiv'd therefor, ſhould be an Admonition to us, that we dread that which was ſo pernicious to them.</p>
            <p>In fine. Such an Acquaintance with the Dealings of Heaven, may have a Tendency <hi>to fill</hi> our <hi>Children</hi> with an <hi>holy Awe</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> of the <hi>divine Majeſty</hi>; with a <hi>chearful Hope</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in him; with <hi>earneſt Deſires</hi> and a <hi>ſteady Care</hi> to pleaſe him. by obeying his Will; with <hi>awful Fears</hi> of offending

him, by any Inſtances of Diſobedience; <hi>and in a Word,</hi> this may inſtruct and quicken them <hi>to fear, love, ſerve,</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> that God who was <hi>their Father's God,</hi> and is <hi>their God,</hi> and who they deſire may be <hi>the God</hi> of their's after them.</p>
            <p>Hence by Way of <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We learn the Duty of Parents to inſtruct their Children in the knowledge of God's Word and Works; of His Law and Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhould teach them diligently to our Children: We ſhould talk of them when we ſit in the Houſe, when we walk by the Way, when we lye down and when we riſe up. We ſhould acquaint our Children with what God hath done for his People, for his Churches, for our Families, for ourſelves, and for them. What Senſe they ſhould have of divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and how they ſhould reſent the Tokens of divine Diſpleaſure. What Improvement they ſhould make of ſuch Things to ſtir them up to Holineſs of Life, and to direct their Hearts into the Love of God, and a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Waiting for the Mercy of God, thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence we learn the Duty of Children to hearken to and receive Inctructions; to regard God's Works and obey his Will.</hi> And to lay up ſuch Things as a ſacred Depoſitum to be tranſmitted down to their Poſterity; and to have their own Hearts ſuitably impreſs'd, and their Lives influenc'd to an agreeable Converſation by the Examples of God's Mercies, and Judgments. His <hi>Smiles</hi> upon <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and his <hi>Frowns</hi> upon <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Diſhoneſty.</hi>

            <p>In a Word,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let what has been offer'd upon this Subject, have this Influence and Effect upon us; to quicken us to regard the Works of the Lord, and to conſider the Operation of his Hands in the Methods of his Providence towards us, and towards our Venerable and Renowned Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

            <p>"We promiſe alſo (by the Help of Chriſt) to walk before God in our Houſes with an upright Heart, taking Care that God be conſtantly call'd upon by Prayer, and that the Scriptures be frequently read in them, and that we will endeavour to perform all Duties required of us towards our Children, for their ſpiritual Good, both by our Example, Inſtruction, and Government, and Prayers for them."</p>
            <p>"We do further engage (the Lord helping of us) to endeavour that we may be pure from the Sins of the Times, ſuch as neglect or Profanation of the Worſhip and Inſtitutions of Chriſt, Sabbath-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, vain and ſinful Company-keeping, miſpending of Time, exceſſive Drinking, wanton and looſe Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, failing in Truth, uncharitable and unrighteous Cenſuring, ſinful Tale-bearing, corrupt Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Pride, Covetouſneſs, and the like; and in our Places to endeavour the ſuppreſſion of them.
