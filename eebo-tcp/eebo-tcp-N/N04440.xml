            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>1 THESSALONIANS iv. 11.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>And that ye ſtudy to be quiet, and to do your own Buſineſs.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apoſtle in theſe Words exhorts the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to two important and difficult Duties, <hi>viz. Quietneſs</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> in their own Buſineſs. By being <hi>Quiet</hi> we are to underſtand a meek and peaceable Temper and Behaviour, which is oppos'd to a turbulent and wrangling Spirit, to ſinful and needleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about civil or religious Matters; all that tumultuous Behaviour is hereby forbid, whereby the Right of others is unjuſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring'd, and their Peace cauſeleſsly diſturb'd.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle exhorts them to <hi>ſtudy</hi> to be quiet. The original Word tranſlated <hi>Study,</hi> ſignifies to be Ambitious, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that we ſhould purſue Quiet with the like Degree of Eſteem, Deſire and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as Men do Honour, Dignity and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which are the Objects of Ambition. <hi>Study to be quiet,</hi> i. e. often think on the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005498_0003_10183FFEB82AAD68"/>
Value and Importance of it, endeavour to find out, ponder upon, and purſue after the Meaſures that are neceſſary to attain and preſerve it. Me thinks the Apoſtles Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion plainly ſpeaks the Neceſſity, the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and Excellency of Quiet. It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary upon many Accounts to be calm and compos'd, meek and peaceful, as I ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards labour to evince. It is alſo a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Temper of Mind which deſerves our Study and Care, and indeed it is as difficult to be attain'd and maintain'd as it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and excellent, becauſe of the many Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Temptations we meet with in this World, which are apt to put our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into an irregular Ferment, and call forth our angry Reſentments before we are aware.</p>
            <p>The next Duty the Apoſtle recommends is <hi>Diligence</hi> in our proper Buſineſs, <hi>do your own Buſineſs,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, manage Things that are proper for you, things that are ſuitable to your Capacity and Character, things you have a call to negociate, and do not needleſsly intermedle in others Affairs to the prejudice of their Quiet.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle preſcribes Diligence in our own Buſineſs as an excellent Mean to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005498_0004_10184000A6A616B8"/>
Peace and Quiet. And indeed ſo it is, for if People were as diligent as they ſhould be in managing their own Affairs with Diſcretion, they would find little Leaſure or Inclination to enter upon the Buſineſs of others that dont belong to them, without either Invitation or Neceſſity, and then act the Part of a ſevere Critick, a ſour Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, or imperious Judge.</p>
            <p>Contention certainly often ſprings from a needleſs and imperious intermedling with the Buſineſs of others. This the Apoſtle ſharply reproves the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> for in his ſecond Epiſtle to them iii. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11, and 12 <hi>Ver. For we hear</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that there are ſome who walk among you diſorderly, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not at all but are Buſy-bodies. Now them that are ſuch, we command and exhort by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that with Quietneſs they work and eat their own Bread.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> Word tranſlated <hi>walking among,</hi> in the preceeding Verſe, ſignifies to go round about. It ſeems there were ſome idle People among the <hi>Theſalonians,</hi> who went round about from Houſe to Houſe making Miſchief, by their tatling and intermedling with other Peoples Affairs. The Apoſtle deals roundly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005498_0005_10184003A32479A8"/>
with thoſe Peſts of Society, and ſolemnly exhorts them to Diligence and Quiet.</p>
            <p>It is true to ſeek our own Things only, is a great evil, and as ſuch the ſame Apoſtle bewails it, Phil. ii. 21. <hi>All ſeek their own and not the Things that are</hi> JESUS CHRIST'S. When we are call'd to it no doubt we ſhould concern ourſelves with the Affairs of others, but not otherwiſe, and then we may reckon them our own. Hence it is the Apoſtle elſewhere obſerves, <hi>that we ſhould not only ſeek our own, but every Man anothers Wealth,</hi> i. e. We ſhould not only avoid building our own Intereſt upon the Ruin of another Mans, which is as natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as it is cruel and malignant; but we ſhould, when called thereto, endeavour to aſſiſt others in promoting their temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as far as we have Opportunity and Capacity.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing farther upon our Text, I ſhall
<list>
                  <item>I. <hi>Speak more largely of the Duties therein expreſſed.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>Of the Evil imply'd,</hi> viz. <hi>medling in other folks Buſineſs without a Call.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Point therefore to be conſidered is, <hi>Quietneſs. Study to be quiet.</hi> In ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005498_0006_10184005615F1F10"/>
upon which, I ſhall 1ſt. Point to the Hindrances of it. 2d. Repreſent the Means which are needful to acquire and preſerve it. 3d. Shew the Excellency and Importance of ſuch a temper of Mind and Behaviour.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. I am to <hi>point out the Hinderances of quiet, which ſhould be avoided.</hi> Now they are theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Pride, high and overweening Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of ourſelves, when we imagine that we are much wiſer, and much better than we are, and of greater Importance in the World. This inclines us to deſpiſe others, who are perhaps our Superiors in real worth This makes us impatient of Contradiction, and diſpoſes Perſons to aſſume a magiſterial Air in their Behaviour, uſurping an Atho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over others which they have no right to. This Evil the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt in the 3d. Chap. of his Book, and 1ſt. and 2d. Verſes. <hi>My Brethren be not many Maſters, knowing that we ſhall receive the greater Condemnation; for in many Things we offend All.</hi> Now to get the Pride of our Hearts broken, let us conſider for God's ſake how unreaſonable and dangerous it is. Pray what Cauſe has any Man living to be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005498_0007_1018400D23147030"/>
Proud? who conſiders the Meanneſs of his Original, the Tranſitorineſs of his Abode upon the Stage of Time, together with the ſtrict Account he muſt give of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Stewardſhip at laſt. before God's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Tribunal? Have we not ſprung from degenerate Parents? (ſurely our Father was an <hi>Amorite</hi> and our Mother a <hi>Hitite.</hi>) Are we not ſinful and dependant Creatures, liable to a thouſand Accidents, and haſting faſt on the Torrent of Time to the Grave: (the Place appointed for all living.) In which, after a few Moments expire, we muſt be reduc'd to Duſt and Rottenneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to Oblivion? What if any of us have Gifts, natural, acquir'd or Gracious, do not theſe put us more in Debt to God, from whom we receive them? And ſhall we be proud of our Debts? What is there in the Honours of this World that can reaſonably incite our Arrogance? Can they confer any real worth? No, ſurely; they are more likely to diminiſh any Thing that is praiſe worthy in us, by flattering our Pride. And are they not as variable as the Wind: Are not Praiſe and Diſpraiſe (generally) rather the Fruits of Humour, Affection or Prejudice, than
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005498_0008_1018400F19B4A488"/>
the Reſult of a Sober Judgment? As to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Pleaſures are they not Common to us with the Bruits? Do they not die in the Enjoyment, and if ſinful are they not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd with a Remorſe which exceeds in Bitterneſs the Comfort they yield? As to Wealth it can neither make us Good or Happy, it often flies from our Embraces, but can never content our Minds, being of a groſs and limitted Nature; but becauſe ſome are proud of their Knowledge it ſhould be remembred, that unleſs it be ſanctify'd it makes us but more like the Devils who are knowing, but wicked, Spirits: <hi>Surely he that knows his Maſters Will, and does not perform it, ſhall be beaten with double Stripes!</hi> And ſhall any who have obtain'd the free Grace of God boaſt as tho' they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it, and ſacrifice to their own Nett? O how Monſtrous and Inconſiſtent is this! Dear Sirs, conſider that God reſiſts the Proud, and gives Grace to the Humble. <hi>Surely Pride goes before Deſtruction, and a high Mind before a Fall.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Another Hindrance of <hi>Quiet</hi> is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt our Brother, which inclines Men to hard Thoughts, hard Speeches, as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005498_0009_10184010D1A56CF0"/>
well as to unjuſt and ungenerous Actions. Unreaſonable Jealouſes, raſh judging of the States of others, becauſe of their Difference in Sentiment about leſſer Things in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or ſuch Infirmities in Practice as may (agreeable to Scripture Inſtances) conſiſt with a gracious State, are of dreadfull Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to deſtroy the Peace and Quiet of Societys. Whatever Fears we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corning the States of others towards God they ſhould not be expreſs'd, unleſs ſome valuable End can be thereby anſwer'd; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I ſee not how ſuch a proceeding can be clear'd of the Charge of Back-biting. It is lamentable to think how ready ſome ignorant Novices in Religion, are to take the Bench, and pronounce Sentence againſt the Spiritual States of others raſhly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſufficient Foundation; but ſuch Perſons are generally paid in their own Coin before they leave the World; agreeable to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of our Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 1.2. Such as are moſt enclin'd to enter upon the difficult Province of judging, concerning the States of others, are generally leaſt fit for it. The longer Gracious Perſons live, and the more they know of the Deceits
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005498_0010_101840154703CE90"/>
of their own Hearts, the more ſenſible they will be of their unfitneſs to judge of the States of others, and the leſs inclin'd they will be to it. I may farther obſerve that all the Sins of the Tongue, particularly Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Detraction, are Hindrances to quiet, and as ſuch ought to be avoided.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Another Hindrance of Quiet is, taking up evil reports againſt our Brethren without ſufficient Evidence, and ſpreading of them with Delight; both which are expreſly forbid by the Almighty, <hi>Pſa.</hi> xv. 3. <hi>Lev.</hi> xix. 16. <hi>Thou ſhalt not go up and down as a Tale bearer among thy People: We ſhould be as tender of our Neighbours good Name, as of his Body and Eſtate,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. It likewiſe mars Quiet when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons rigorouſly inſiſt upon their civil Right in ſmall Matters; the loſs of which they can endure without much injury to themſelves or Families. This the Apoſtle reproved the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for, 1 Cor. vi. 7. <hi>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you becauſe ye go to Law one with another; why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather ſuffer your ſelves to be defrauded?</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005498_0011_101840172659C790"/>5thly. Another Hindrance is angry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, or Revenges for real and ſuppos'd Injuries, doing Evil for Evil, and rendering Reviling for Reviling. O Sirs, was this the Practice of Chriſt? Or is it agreeable to his Religion? Shall we profeſs the Name of Chriſt, and yet come ſhort of the Good Temper that appear'd in ſome of the Pagans. I have read of one whom his Neighbour revil'd all Day, to whom he made no reply till the Evening came on, when it was Time for his Neighbour to go Home, he then ſpoke to him in the following Strain: <hi>Neighbour,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhall my Man light you Home?</hi> It is likewiſe ſtoried of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that once when he was attempting to beat his Servant, but finding himſelf Angry, he held out his Arm for a conſiderable Time, as a Puniſhment upon himſelf, without ſtriking a Blow, and told his Servant that <hi>he would beat him but that he was Angry.</hi> Sirs if we are habitually bent on Revenge, what will our Profeſſion avail us? What do we more then others, yea the very worſt of Men? But to proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Means conducive to Quiet are theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005498_0012_10184019167511B8"/>1ſt. A humble Mind. We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be cloth'd with Humility; and truly this is one of the nobleſt Ornaments, without which we are naked and deform'd: To preſerve which it is needful to take a frequent View of the Plague Sore of our Hearts, as well as of our Blunders in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Another excellent Mean to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Quiet, is Love to our Neighbour. This will diſpoſe us to kind Thoughts, courteous Speeches, juſt and generous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Charity or Love,</hi> as the Apoſtle obſerves, 1 Cor. 13. <hi>thinketh no Evil, it believes all Things and hopes all Things, i. e.</hi> Thoſe that are poſſeſſed of it are thereby inclin'd to the moſt favourable Sentiments of the Speeches and Actions of others, that their Nature and Circumſtances can i Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon admit of, ſo that it is no Sign of the Depth of our Judgment to be ſevere and cenſorious, but of the Weakneſs or Want of Charity. The Apoſtle farther obſerves in the forecited Chapter, That Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſuffereth Long, and is Kind, That Charity is not eaſily provok'd, and rejoyceth not in Iniquity: Such as are endu'd with it,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005498_0013_1018401CEE8F1140"/>
are not pleas'd at their Neighbours miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. Surely that Wiſdom that is from above is firſt Pure, then peaceable, gentle and eaſie to be entreated, without Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and without Hypocriſy. I may add that real Love conſiſts not in Word and Tongue only, but expreſſes itſelf in Deed and in Truth. As Juſtice and Generoſity directly tend to Quiet, ſo the Contrary thereof are fatal Sources of Diſcord and Debate: The Practice of Injuſtice, under a religious Maſk, is ſo big with Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Miſchief, that no Words or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours can ſufficiently repreſent it!</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Another Mean of Quiet, is to bear with the Weakneſſes of our Brethren, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 1.2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Brethren if any Man be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in a Fault, ye which are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch a one, in the Spirit of Meekneſs, conſidering thy ſelf leaſt thou alſo be tempted. Bear ye one anothers Burthens,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle elſewhere, <hi>and ſo fulfil the Law of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Another Mean of Quiet, is a ſpeedy forgiving of Injuries: And hence we are forbid <hi>to let the Sun go down on our Wrath,</hi> and enjoyn'd in Caſe <hi>we have brought
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005498_0014_1018402531C7CE10"/>
our Gift to the Altar, and remember that our Brother hath ought againſt us, to leave there our Gift, and be firſt reconcil'd to our Brother, Mat.</hi> v. 23.24. And indeed without forgiving thoſe that Treſpaſs againſt us, we cannot pray the Lords Prayer without virtually praying for a Curſe upon ourſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. If we deſire Quiet, our Words ſhould be few, James i. 19. <hi>Wherefore my beloved Brethren, let every Man be ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak, ſlow to Wrath: For in a Multitude of Words, there wanteth not Sin, but he that refraineth his Lips is Wiſe, Pro.</hi> x. 19 And elſewhere <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, That <hi>he that hath Knowledge ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Words. Pro.</hi> xvii. 37. It is likewiſe neceſſary to allow Perſons their Liberty of ſpeaking out what they have to ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interruption: The Contrary hereof, namely teaching and dictating in common Converſation, where we have no Authority, and interrupting others in their Diſcourſe, are very offenſive, they argue Vanity of Mind, and involve in them a Kind of Perſecution and robbing Mankind of that Priviledge which they have a right to by the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005498_0015_10184028AD027600"/>
Laws of Society. And here I cannot but take Notice of another Practice which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually offenſive to modeſt and humble Minds, viz. <hi>praiſing of Perſons in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi> It is grievous in ones hearing to be ſet upon the Stage, and made an object either of Commendation, or Sport and Ridicule.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to ſhew <hi>the Excellency and Importance of a quiet Temper and Behaviour,</hi> which appear from the following Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. A quiet temper of Mind is pleaſing to God, <hi>A meek and quiet Spirit is in the ſight of God of great Price,</hi> 1 Pet iii. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is ornamental to Religion, when thoſe that profeſs CHRIST imitate his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>and learn of him to be meek and lowly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It is many Ways profitable to our ſelves; this is the Way to obtain the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God upon our Perſons and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Mat. v. 5. <hi>Bleſſed are the Meek for they ſhall inherit the Earth.</hi> Tho' they may have but little of the World, yet they ſhall have the Comfort and Reliſh of what they poſſeſs. A quiet Behaviour tends to preſerve the Tranquility of our own Minds,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005498_0016_1018402AEA53A9B0"/>
for he that does not come in anothers Way is like to be let alone himſelf: But the Buſy-Body creates Trouble to himſelf, for others will be as apt to cenſure his Proceedings as he is theirs. And hence the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> adviſeth to beware of <hi>Suffering as a Thief, Murderer or Buſy-Body in other Mens Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> 1 Pet. iv. 15. And <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves juſtly, Pro. xxvi. 17. <hi>That he that paſſeth by and medleth with Strife, belongeth not to him, is like one that taketh a Dog by the Ears,</hi> which its difficult to do, when they are Quarrelling, without being bit.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Quietneſs is profitable to others, it preſerves the general Order of Things, and keeps Men within their proper Ranks and Spheres, and thus it is the Guardian of Concord and Amity; for no Man is hereby provok'd or rob'd of his juſt Liberty of thinking and acting for himſelf: And ſurely ſuch as are well inclin'd towards us. are moſt like to receive Good by our Councils and Examples, O! therefore <hi>let us ſtudy to be Quiet.</hi> Our Lord has recommended this Virtue by his own Example, <hi>he was led as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005498_0017_1018402C9EDA0688"/>
before the Shearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his Mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly a <hi>meek and quiet</hi> Diſpoſition is in itſelf a noble Atcheivement, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>He that is ſlow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</hi> This oppoſes Tumult and Arrogance, and all that unkind uſage which ſprings from Paſſion and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. This is fitted to every honourable Purpoſe of human Life, and adorns every valuable Character in it. This checks the Pride of the Rich, and the Envy of the Poor. This diſpoſes Superiors to temper their Rule with Diſcretion and Tenderneſs, and teaches Inferiors Reverence and Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. By this younger Perſons are inclin'd to give Place to their Seniors, and riſe up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hoary Head!</p>
            <p>Surely as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>He who is ſlow to anger is of great Underſtanding, but be that is haſty of Spirit exalteth folly.</hi> What agonies of Mind and extravagancies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour does raſh Anger plunge its unhappy Votaries into? whereby they become Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of pity or contempt!</p>
            <p>When this preſent tranſitory Scene of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005498_0018_1018402EF2387DB8"/>
Things has come to its final Period, how diſmal will be the Caſe of the Envious? Then they ſhall be conſign'd to a perpetual abode with Spirits of their own Complection, there to waſte a whole Eternity in unceaſing Jars and Conteſts! While in the mean time the Sons of Peace and Quiet, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the Regions of perfect, endleſs Love, and embrac'd in the Boſom of the bleſſed JESUS, who in our Nature, has ſet us an Example of this noble Vertue, that we might follow his Steps.</p>
            <p>But the Second Duty recommended by the Words of our Text, <hi>is Diligence in our own Buſineſs.</hi> And <hi>to do your own Buſineſs.</hi> Here let us enquire 1ſt. What Buſineſs we have to do? 2d. How it ſhould be done? And 3d. Why?</p>
            <p>Now the Buſineſs we have to do is two-fold, namely, of our <hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> Calling. The former concerns us as Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, the latter as Members of a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; as ſuch we ſhould have ſome Office Civil or Religious, which may profit Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; the Duties of which we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly perform. It is a baſe Thing to live like a Drone upon the Fruits of others
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005498_0019_101840328E7E6B30"/>
Labours, without doing any Thing for our Support, while we have a Capacity!</p>
            <p>The Buſineſs of our <hi>general Calling,</hi> which is to ſecure the Salvation of our Souls, ſhould be done in the following Manner, viz. <hi>early, earneſtly, humbly, regularly, perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly.</hi> And hence our Lord enjoins us, <hi>to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God—and to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate.</hi> And hence it is that he pronounces a Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the poor in Spirit,</hi> and aſſures us, <hi>that theirs is the Kingdom of God.</hi> Whatever carneſtneſs we have in Religion, yet if we depend upon it as Meritorious, we are like to looſe our labour; <hi>for thoſe that ſeek Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as it were by the Works of the Law, ſhall not obtain it.</hi> Moreover if we do not begin at the right End of Religion, and try to lay the Foundation firſt, by ſeeking a Change of the State and of the Heart, by Juſtification and Converſion, in order to the Superſtructure of a good Life, our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are vain and to no purpoſe, but to deceive our own Souls! We ſhould likewiſe Remember, that Perſeverance in Goodneſs muſt Crown the Scene, or certain ruin will enſue. It is only ſuch as perſevere to the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005498_0020_10184039AA078968"/>
End that ſhall be ſaved; and hence we are commanded <hi>to work out the Work of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Buſineſs of our <hi>particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> it ſhould be done with <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> Pſal, cxii 5. With <hi>Reſolution</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> (if we be ſcar'd at every Cloud we ſhall neither ſow nor reap) with <hi>earneſt Application;</hi> whatever our Hand finds to do, we ſhould do it with all our might. Again, the Buſineſs of our <hi>particular Calling</hi> ſhould be done with <hi>humble Dependance</hi> upon Gods Providence for Succeſs, with <hi>chearful Reſignation</hi> to his <hi>Will,</hi> with <hi>thankful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi> for his Mercy in ſmiling upon our <hi>Eſſays,</hi> without which they are all abortive. It is an Inſtance of great Impiety and Ingratitude to ſacrifice to our own Net, and to ſuffer our <hi>particular Calling</hi> thro' our miſmanagement to hinder our <hi>general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Woe to thoſe that poſtpone the Buſineſs of their <hi>general Calling</hi> from time to time; that have that abſolutely neceſſary Work to begin, when the Day of Life is expiring! O Bretheren! wherefore do ye ſtand all the Day Idle? Have ye not Work to do of the moſt noble and important kind? And have
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005498_0021_1018403B84734070"/>
ye not been often call'd in the moſt ſolemn Strains, by a variety of God's faithful Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to the Performance of it? Is not God the beſt of Maſters? And is not the Reward of Grace he propoſes ſo great and glorious as may juſtly excite your moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe Deſire and vehement Labours? O Sirs! what apology can ye frame for your ſtupid indifference and ſordid Negligence, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Matters of infinite and inexpreſſible Moment?</p>
            <p>But becauſe our Text eſpecially recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Diligence in temporal Buſineſs, I ſhall therefore more generally repreſent its Excellencies and Advantages, which contain the Reaſons <hi>why we ſhould do our own Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here obſerve that Diligence is the guard of Virtue; it keeps off thoſe Temptations which otherwiſe would enſnare us: An aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Example of this we have in <hi>David</hi> who by loytering on the Houſe top, when he ſhould have been at the head of his Army, was enſnar'd to the great ſcandal of Religion. But on the Contrary, when a Perſon is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied about his lawful Employment, his Mind is engaged, and ſo wants leiſure to daly with tempting Objects; and being poſſeſs'd of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005498_0022_1018403D37AABB80"/>
honeſt Amuſements, has no room for baſe Deſigns. In particular, Diligence is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative from vain Curioſity, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with other People's Buſineſs, as our Text inſtructs us; ſuch as do their own Buſineſs are diſpos'd to be quiet, but ſuch as work not at all are buſy-Bodies, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> iii 11. The Apoſtle farther deſcribes in ſtrong and lively Colours, the Character and Courſe of ſuch unhappy People, in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> the 5th Chap. and 13th Verſe, <hi>Thus, and with all, they learn to be idle, wandring about from Houſe to Houſe; and not only idle, but tatlers alſo, and buſie Bodies, ſpeaking Things which they ought not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as neglect their own Affairs, are apt to intrude into other Peoples to their Shame. Idlers are apt to be full of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and ſometimes invideous Chatt. Theſe Tale bearers and Tattlers are like Powder-Monkey's in an Army, incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to Miſchief; who try, by their Tongues, which are emphatically Worlds of Iniquity, to ſet Neighbourhoods and Societies in a Flame. They are the Peſts of Society, and Bane of Converſation. The Word <hi>Tale-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> mention'd <hi>Levi.</hi> xix. 16. <q>ſignifies a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005498_0023_101840409C553838"/>
Pedler, or Pettty-Chapman: Theſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopers—pick up ill natur'd Stories at one Houſe, and utter them at another; and commonly barter Slanders by Way of Exchange.</q> 
               <hi>Where no Wood is the Fire goeth out, ſo where there is no Tale-bearer, the Strife ceaſeth, Pro.</hi> xxiv. 20. <hi>But as the North Wind driveth away Rain, ſo doth an angry Countenance a back-biting Tongue, Pro.</hi> xxv. 23.</p>
            <p>But to return. Diligence is Neceſſary in every Condition of Life, it is needful to preſerve Wealth and Honour, and improve them to a valuable Deſign. It is needful to remove Poverty and Diſgrace, and prevent our deſponding under their Preſures.</p>
            <p>Without this we cannot diſcharge with Honour any Truſt in Life from the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Spade.</p>
            <p>Diligence manifeſts a noble Temper of Mind that diſdains to be ſupported at the Expence of anothers Care and Labour, without a Compenſation. Such who are poſſeſs'd of this Vertue, will not like Rats, or other noxious Animals, ſteal their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the publick Granary, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething worthy of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005498_0024_1018404472E1F488"/>Dilligence is in itſelf pleaſant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: This Tempers our Troubles, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwages the Pains that attends our Labours, by bringing the Mind from an uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Suſpenſe, and fixing of it upon lawful Objects, as well as by opening the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Proſpect of a future Good.</p>
            <p>This frees us from the Trouble of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleneſs, which is a Burthen to it ſelf, and cauſes uneaſie Reflections upon our loſs of Time, and abuſe of Talents!</p>
            <p>Diligence gives a greatful Guſt to the Enjoyments which have been thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd more eſpecially: And hence <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, That <hi>the Subſtance of a diligent Man is precious; and that his Sleep is ſweet.</hi> And certainly as the Fruits of Diligence taſte ſweeteſt, ſo they are like to laſt longeſt, becauſe of the Bleſſing of God upon them.</p>
            <p>Diligence produces Eaſe and prevents Trouble. It was a Noble ſaying of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Philoſopher, <q>Whether <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be to be choſen Labour, or whether it be to be eſchewed, labour that thou mayeſt not labour; for by not labouring Labour is not eſcaped, but is rather purſued.</q> Sloth looſes the Eaſe it deſires, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005498_0025_1018404B027ECB40"/>
the Diſquiet it dreads, by expoſing thoſe that are guilty of it to a Train of impertinent and perplexing Thoughts, as well as to Want and Ignominy, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be endur'd without Diſquiet: But on the contrary, Diligence tends to Honour and Plenty, and ſerves to ſupport every Station of Life with Reputation; whereas Sloth intimidates the Mind with cauſeleſs Fears. <hi>The Way of the ſlothful,</hi> ſays Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>is a Hedge of Thornes, and he is apt to ſay there is a Lyon before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what, my Brethren, but Diligence, can we aſcribe all the Works of Art, all the curious Structures and ſtately Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which we behold the World beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with? And iſn't it this that has adorn'd the human Mind with the nobler Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Science? I may add, that Diligence is commended to our Imitation by all Sorts of Examples. Univerſal Nature is a Glaſs in which we may behold the Neceſſity and Excellency of this Duty; the inanimate Parts of the Creation, are in a Courſe of their conſtant Labour to anſwer the Deſign of their Being; the Luminaries of Heaven ceaſe not to perform their diſtin'd Travels, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005498_0026_1018404FC9CC4918"/>
to ſend down their wanted Influence to aſſiſt the pregnant Earth in its Productions; which the late Mathematicions aſſure us has its conſtant Motion, both Diurnal and Annual The Plants grow; the Winds bluſter variably round the Globe; the Sea does not forget its wonted Ebs and Flows, and often roars and ſwells Mountains high; the Rivers run reſtleſly their retrograde meandrine Courſes until they meet the Oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from whence they derive their Original, and ſo return the Waters they borrow by a conſtant Circulation: By theſe liquid Veins the Body of the Earth is refreſh'd and fitted for Increaſe. And do not the animate Creation labour likewiſe? A noble Example of which we have in the <hi>Ant,</hi> to which the Sluggard is advis'd by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>to repair for Inſtruction,</hi> Pro. vi. 6.</p>
            <p>We have likewiſe many Examples of Diligence in the rational Creation, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and watchings often; yea Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Prince of Prophets labour'd while the Day laſted.—</p>
            <p>But if we paſs this lower Globe, and fix our Thoughts on the angelick Throng,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005498_0027_10184051A5749B98"/>
are not theſe winged Inhabitants of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who wait on the Throne of God, in a Courſe of Continual Action, celebrating the divine Praiſe, and executing the divine Pleaſure?</p>
            <p>Yea, my Brethren, the great the glorious God himſelf, who is the Fountain of Being, of Excellency and Bleſſedneſs, is, as Divines juſtly obſerve, a ſimple Act.</p>
            <p>And ſhall we be only idle while all Things are buſy round about us, above us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath us; God forbid.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken of the Duties expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in our Text. I proceed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the Sin therein tacitly oppos'd; which is that of intermedling in other Mens Buſineſs, while we are exhorted <hi>to be quiet and do our own Buſineſs;</hi> it is imply'd, that it is ſinful and tending to diſquiet, needleſly to medle with other Peoples Buſineſs. In diſcourſing upon this point, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew, 1ſt. Negatively, what is not ſinful intermedling. 2d. Poſitively, ſhew what it is. And 3d. Speak of the Evil thereof. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Negatively. It is not ſinful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling when we hear God Name Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005498_0028_10184053DA156DE0"/>
his Truths oppos'd and People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, to ſtand up in Vindication of them, if we have a Capacity, ſo that the Truth is not like to ſuffer thro' our weak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, at leaſt we ſhould ſhew our Diſlike by our Behaviour or withdrawing from the Company: Every Diſciple of Chriſt is bound to ſhew his Diſſatisfaction, in the Caſe aforeſaid, by his Allegiance to God.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſinful intermedling, to interpoſe when the publick ſafety is endangered, or the Character, Life or Eſtate of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon is unjuſtly aſſaulted; nay it is ſo far from this, that Juſtice and Charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires our Defence. When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw one of his Bretheren ſuffer wrong, he defended him and ſmote the oppreſſor.</p>
            <p>Farther, for Superiors, viz. Magiſtrates, Parents, Maſters, and Miniſters to inſpect into the Conduct of thoſe that are under their Care and Charge, and to admoniſh and reprove them as they find Occaſion, is ſo far from ſinful intermedling, that it is a great Duty, (<hi>Pro.</hi> xxvii. 23.) it is their proper Province.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be reaſonably reckon'd ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful intermedling, for us to defend our own
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005498_0029_10184057DBDF1DD8"/>
Names, Eſtates and Lives againſt unjuſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, for this the Law of Nature teaches, and if we do not ſo, we are acceſſary to our own Injury and Death.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe far from criminal intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to embrace opportunities that preſent, to do Service to the Souls of our fellow Creatures, eſpecially when there is any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of our Pains being Succeſsful. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Poſitively.</hi> It is ſinful intermedling,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. When we invade the Office of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ordinary Caſes, without a regular Call, <hi>e. g.</hi> when a private Man preſumes to do the Magiſtrates proper Buſineſs, or a common Soldier takes upon him the Officers authority; or a lay-man intrudes into the peculiars of the Miniſterial Function. 1. Cor. vii. 20. <hi>Let every Man abide in the ſame calling, wherein he was called.</hi> Heb. v. 4. <hi>And no Man taketh this Honour unto himſelf, but he that was called of God, as was</hi> Aaron.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is ſinful intermedling when in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Caſes (without clamant Cauſe) we obtrude our Advice upon others, eſpecially our Superiors, not being ask'd; for this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively a claiming ſuperiority over
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005498_0030_1018405A0A33CD18"/>
them, and an implicit Declaration that we have a high Conceit of our own Judgment, and a mean Opinion of theirs; which does not well accord with Modeſty, Juſtice and Charity, and indeed when our Council is ask'd, it ſhould be offered with Diffidence, and not impos'd; we ought to be ſatisfy'd with doing our Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It is likewiſe ſinful intermedling, when Perſons of a private Character autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritively reprove their Superiors, and raſhly cenſure others acting in a Province, which they have no Buſineſs with, and do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. We ſhould not rebuke an Elder, but intreat him as a Father; and indeed when we do reprove our inferiors we ſhould be careful reſpecting the Manner of it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will ſerve only to inflame the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe inſtead of curing it. The Fact for which we reprove, ſhould be true and bad, otherwiſe we are guilty of Slander and Tyranny: Such as condemn their Brethren for that which is no Crime, they ſpeak evil of the Law, and interpretatively judge it to be an inſufficient Rule of human Actions. (<hi>James</hi> iv. 11.) Reproof ſhould not be miniſtred for every infirmity that flows from
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005498_0031_1018405F5E8C1180"/>
inadvertency or miſtake, (theſe Charity ſhould caſt a Veil over, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv, 8.) but for groſſer faults, otherwiſe they are like to looſe their End. It is alſo needful that they be well tim'd and dipp'd in Sugar; neither ſhould they be offered in publick Company, (at leaſt at firſt) or to People in a Paſſion. Our Lord's reproof to the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd with a Commendation; (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.) Neither ſhould we reprove Scorners, leaſt we get to ourſelves a Blot; or affect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves Place, for that is a Sign of ill Nature and Arrogance.</p>
            <p>It is lamentable to think, that many ſeem to incline to know, the Duty of Perſons of other Stations, rather than their own! It is an awful Sign of Pride and ill Nature, to meddle with Things that are too high for us, and to condemn theſe Things in others which we underſtand not, and which do not concern us, or belong to our judicial Notice. <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 4. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Servant, to his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Another Inſtance of ſinful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling is when we interpoſe in conteſts without a Call, or any probability of doing
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005498_0032_1018406169D872B8"/>
Good thereby. If we do interpoſe in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, as mediators of Peace, we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of making ourſelves Parties in the Fray, and of puting Fuel to the Flame, by diſcloſing the Secrets of one to the other, or by hard Conſtructions on the Words of either Party: On the Contrary we ſhould endeavour to aſwage their Paſſions by mild Interpretations, pungent Arguments, and affectionate Entreaties; in the mean Time waving the Expreſſion of our Judgment, who is moſt in the fault, otherwiſe our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts are like to fail of Succeſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. It is likewiſe faulty intermedling when we are inquiſitive into Mens deſigns, and labour to diſcover their Secrets; if they diſcover them, it is with Regret, and if not they are like to offend us without a Cauſe; and indeed to cenſure Men as guilty of a bad Deſign, when their Actions are good, is a Breach of the Law of Charity, and an unjuſt Encroachment upon the Province of the Almighty, whoſe Prerogative it is alone to ſearch the Hearts and try the Reigns of the Children of Men. Again,</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. We go out of our proper Sphere when in Matters of an indifferent Nature,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005498_0033_101840662D4C15A8"/>
we infringe upon the Liberty of others, and croſs their Humour by trying to impoſe our Opinions upon them. We may mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly propoſe the Reaſons of our Judgment to our equals in diſcourſe with them, but to preſs farther is uncivil, and like to have no good Effect.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. Idle tatlers are eſpecially guilty of this Evil of Criminal intermedling, who, at their Goſſopings and Teatables, judge Peoples States, and aſperſe their Characters: The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome Women in his Time who learned <hi>to be idle wandring about from Houſe to Houſe; and not only idle, but tatlers alſo, and buſie Bodies, ſpeaking things which they ought not,</hi> 1 Tim. v. 13. It is much to be lamented that that Evil has not expir'd with the Apoſtolick Age, but is Flagrant at this Time and in this Place! And tho' Females are peculiarly Guilty of it, poſſibly in a greater Degree, becauſe of the Talkativeneſs natural to the Sex, and their quicker Paſſions; yet the Males are far from being clear of it. Do not ſome raſhly cenſure the Management of others, in a Sphere which does not belong to them, and which indeed they do not underſtand?
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005498_0034_10184069B5E7B2A8"/>
Hereby medling with Things too high for them, contrary to the Pſalmiſts Practice, Pſ. cxxxi. 1. <hi>Lord my Heart is not haughty, nor mine Eyes lofty; neither do I exerciſe my ſelf in great Matters, or in Things two high for me.</hi> And are not ſome guilty of judging Caſes before they hear them fully? Alas for the Partiality and Prejudice, the Enmity and Raſhneſs that obtain in the World and appear too much in ſome Profeſſors, of whom better Things might be expected.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to ſpeak of the Evil of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling in others Affairs. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is unmannerly to intermedle without an Invitation, or urgent Neceſſity.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. It is unjuſt, it is a robing another of his Liberty of acting for himſelf with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and what we woudn't have another do by us.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It is needleſs, People generally know their own (ſecular) Affairs beſt, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a View of all their Circumſtances, and bending their Thoughts much that Way.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Such a Practice manifeſts great Pride and Vanity in ſuch as are guilty of it, as well as criminal Neglect of their own Buſineſs. And</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:005498_0035_1018406FC48FA5F8"/>5thly. It tends to a general Diſquiet and Confuſion. 2 Cor. xii. 20. <hi>For I fear leaſt when I come, I ſhall not find you ſuch as I would, and I ſhall be found unto you, ſuch as ye would not; leaſt there be Debates, Envyings, Wraths, Strifes, Back-bitings, Whiſperings, Swellings, Tumults.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Sirs! Let us therefore <hi>ſtudy to be quiet, and do our own Buſineſs.</hi> O let us ſeek more Love to our Brethren, and ſpeak Evil of no Man, let us walk in Love, as Chriſt alſo has loved us, and given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God of a ſweet ſmelling Savour. Our ſevere cenſuring and cruel judging is no Evidence of the Keenneſs of our Underſtandings, but rather of the Groſsneſs of our Ignorance of God's Word and our own Hearts. Such doings are a ſign of little or no Grace; for Hypocrits are like Strumpets, who love to be much abroad: But ſincere Souls are like honeſt Women, who keep at home and mind their own Buſineſs. Our Profeſſion of Religion gives no lawleſs Looſe to our Tongues, but lays us under greater Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to reſtrain them, and he who does not ſo, his Religion is Vain. (<hi>Jam.</hi> i. 26.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:005498_0036_10184074DD897A48"/>O how is God's honourable Name wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his precious Truths ſtabb'd as it were by the Conteſts, Wranglings, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings of Profeſſors! Alas! where are Mercy, Forbearance, and brotherly Love fled away? O! has love taken its final Flight to Heaven, and utterly left the Earth? Do we profeſs my Brethren, that God has forgiven us Ten Thouſand Talents, and yet take our poor Brother by the Throat for a few Pence? O awful inconſiſtent Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! Shoudn't we be merciful as our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is merciful. Let us Sirs either reſtrain our Tongues, and reform our Lives, or lay down our Profeſſion of Religion alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that ſo the noble Intereſts of Piety, may not bleed thro' our inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Conduct. I ſhall conclude this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> 3d. Chap. from the 13th to the 18th Verſe. <hi>Who is a Wiſe Man, and endu'd with Knowledge amongſt you? Let him ſhew out of a good Converſation his Works with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Wiſdom. But if ye have bitter En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying and Strife in your Hearts, glory not, and lie not againſt the Truth. This VViſdom deſendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005498_0037_10184076816EC688"/>
develiſh. For where Envying and Strife is, there is Confuſion, and every evil VVork. But the Wiſdom that is from above is firſt Pure, then peaceable, gentle and eaſie to be entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypocriſy. And the the Fruits of Righteouſneſs is ſown in Peace of them that make Peace.</hi>
