            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A few words to the <hi>Reader,</hi> by way of PREFACE</head>
                  <p>MY intent is to say little, either of the Book it self, or by what impulse I took the pains to compile and publish it, but rather let nimble Time, that over-runs all things, manifest the Effects of both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even so also let it manifest my Opponents, which hath been the fate of publick Writers heretofore.</p>
                  <p>And lest that in this promiscuous Generation of men, this little Book might appear as a promiscuous Composition of Authors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is therefore distinguished in two parts.</p>
                  <p>Now then as to the first part I say, that most of what the diligent Searcher and Enquirer shall find dispersed in the whole Works or Writings of <hi>Jacob Behme,</hi> he will here find collected, contracted and comprised in a little room, it being chiefly the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial or affirmative part that is here delivered, and not the circumstantial; for otherwise it could not be contained in so few Sheets. For <hi>Jacob</hi> throughout his Writings hath much used Tautology as himself confesseth, by reason (as he saith) of his slow and dull Apprehension.</p>
                  <p>And yet what is here immitted to thy view is his own words and sentences, in his own phrase and sense, as I found them dispersed as aforesaid; for
<pb facs="unknown:000447_0003_0FA5AE79470397E0"/>
no otherwise durst I deal by him; God forbid I should: only this know, that I have in about half a dozen places added a Parenthesis instead of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, which yet is his own expressions of the same thing else-where, thereby the more unfolding the matter to the understanding. All which [consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my many years acquaintance with his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings] may very well be, notwithstanding the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Revelation and deep sight and knowledge this man had in heavenly Mysteries; for in his time the eternal day was but, as it were, dawning, and the day-star beginning to appear; but now the glorious Sun is arisen and arising, and shines forth in its splendor, and gives a clearer discerning of things that differ.</p>
                  <p>Not that I boast my self so greatly illuminated thereby, or so highly graduated in discerning more than others: O no, I am as subject to be obscured by the clouds of Sin and Error as other men, and am so frail and subject to fall, that no man needs the hand of divine Protection more than I; and never had more need than now to call to mind and retain a lively sence of the day of my first inward Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I once knew, which was a Day of Anguish and Sorrow, and that from no external cause, when I sought secret places to bewale my woful state, because of inward Sin (for no man could outwardly accuse me of evil) and yet that day, even that day of Mourning was a day of Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, in which I can in Truth say,</p>

                     <pb facs="unknown:000447_0004_0FA5AE7A0D016FF0"/>
As Showers of Rain do cause the Earths Increase,</l>
                  <l>So streams of Tears did bring my Soul true Peace.</l>
                  <p>And in that day of my first love and zeal for Holiness, the reading all Books was a burthen to me, yea, even the holy Scriptures also, and instead of receiving comfort therefrom, I was only wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in spirit by them, witnessing that saying, <hi>The Letter kills, but it is the Spirit that quickens.</hi> But now I shall come to the matters themselves.</p>

                     <hi>Jacob Behme</hi> to the Doctors and Schollars, and Readers of his Writings</head>
                  <p>COme on ye Doctors, if ye are in the right, then give answer to the Spirit; What do you think stood in the place of this world before the time of the World? 2<hi>ly,</hi> Out of what do you think the Earth and Stars came to be? 3<hi>dly,</hi> What is that in man that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth God so much, that he tormenteth and afflicteth man so, being he hath created him? And 4<hi>thly,</hi> That he imputeth Sin to man, and condemneth him to eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? 5<hi>thly,</hi> Why hath he created that wherein or wherewith Man committeth sin? 6<hi>thly,</hi> What is the cause or the beginning, or the birth and geniture of Gods fierce Wrath, out of or from which Hell and the Devil are come to be? 7<hi>thly,</hi> Or how comes it that all Creatures in this world do bite, scratch, strike beat and worry one another, and yet sin is imputed only to man? 8<hi>thly,</hi> Out of what are the venomous and poysonous Beasts, and Worms and all manner of Vermine come to be? 9<hi>thly,</hi> Out of what are the holy Angels come to be? 10<hi>thly,</hi> What is the Soul of man? And <hi>lastly,</hi> What is the great GOD himself, and how is he in Love and Wrath?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:000447_0006_0FA5AE7BA556E238"/>If you can demonstrate that God is not in the Stars, Elements, Earth, Men, Beasts, Worms, Leaves and Grass, also in Heaven and Earth; also, that all this is not God himself, &amp; that my Spirit is false and wicked, then I will be the first that will burn my Book in the fire, and recall and recant all whatsoever I have written, and will accurse it, and in all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence willingly submit my self to be instructed by you.</p>
                  <p>I do not say, that I cannot err at all; for there are some things which are not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, and are described, as it were, from a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>impse of the great God, when the Wheel of Nature whirled about too swiftly, so that man with his half dead and dull capacity or apprehension cannot sufficiently compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it.</p>
                  <p>Now it concerns every one that will speak or teach of divine Mysteries, that he have the Spirit of God, and know in the Light of God those matters which he will give forth for true, and not suck or draw them from his own reason, and so without divine knowledge run upon the bare Letter in his opinion, and drag the Scriptures (as it were) by the hair of the head, to prove it, as is usually done by reason.</p>
                  <p>From this, so exceeding many Errors are arisen, in that the divine knowledge hath been
<pb facs="unknown:000447_0007_0FA5AE80B9C16680"/>
sought in mens own wit and art, and so men are drawn from the Truth of God in their own Reason.</p>
                  <p>And though I search sublimely and deep, and shall set it down very clearly, yet this must be said to the <hi>Reader,</hi> that without the Spirit of God it will be a Mystery to him and hidden from him: Therefore let every one take heed how he judgeth, that he fall not into the judgment of God.</p>
                  <p>Every one will not understand my Writings according to my meaning and sense, but every one according to his gift for his benefit, one more than another, according as the Spirit hath its property in him.</p>
                  <p>For the spirit of God is often subject to the spirits of men, if they will that which is good or well, and seeth or looketh after what man willeth, that his good work be not hindred, but that every where above all, Gods will or willing, or desiring be done.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. And though <hi>Moses</hi> writes, <hi>I am an angry zealous God</hi>; Yet the meaning of it is not that God is angry in himself, and that there ariseth a Fire of Anger in the holy Trinity: No, that cannot be, for it is written <hi>Against those that hate me:</hi> In that same Creature the Fire of Anger riseth up.</p>
                  <p>For if God should be angry in himself, then the whole Nature would be on fire, which will come once to pass in the last day in Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not in God. But in God the triumphing Joy will burn; it was never otherwise from Eternity, nor will it ever be otherwise.</p>

Now the elevating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> springing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> triumphing Joy in God, maketh Heaven triumphing and moveable, and Heaven maketh the Stars and Elements moveable, and the Stars and the Elements make the Creatures move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; out of the Powers of God are the Heavens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, out of the Heavens are the Stars, out of the Stars are the Elements, out of the Elements are the Earth, and the Creatures come to be.</p>
                  <p>Thus all had its beginning, even to the Angels and Devils, which before the Creation of Heaven, Stars and the Earth, were proceeded out of the same Power, out of which the Heaven, the Stars, &amp; the Earth were proceeded.</p>

                  <p n="8">8. The Essence of this Vvorld consisteth in evil and good, and the one cannot be without the other. But this is the great Iniquity of this Vvorld, that the evil-over-powereth the good, that the Anger is stronger then the Love, and this by reason of the Sin of the Devils and Men, who have disturbed Nature by the false Desire, that it mightily and effectually worketh in the wrath as a Poyson in the Body.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. VVe see very clearly, that there is nothing in this Vvorld so evil, but it hath a good in it; the good hath its rise originally out of the heavenly Property, or light Vvorld, and the evil hath its Property out of the dark Vvorld, for both VVorlds are in each other as one.</p>

                  <p>These three Kingdoms together contain such a deep, as is not of any human number, nor can be measured by any thing; yet you must know, that these three Kingdoms have a beginning and end; but that God that hath made these three Kingdoms out of himself, is infinite and hath no end.</p>
                  <p>And the three Kingdoms are circular, round about the Son of God, neither of them is further or nearer to the Son of God, for the one is equally as near about the Son of God as the other.</p>

                  <p>Neither have I any purpose to consider of it further, much less to write; but my Revelation reacheth even into the three Kingdoms, like an Angelical Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Here you must know, that the <hi>Angels</hi> are not all of one Quality, neither are they equal or alike one to another in Power and Might: Indeed every Angel hath the Power of all the seven qualifying or fountain, Spirits. But in every one there is somewhat of one Quality more predominant and strong then another, and according to that Quality he is glorified also.</p>
                  <p>As the Flowers in the Meadows do every one receive their Colour from their Qualities, and are named also according to their Qualities; so are the holy Angels also But the King is the Heart of all the Qualities, and hath

his Court or Residence in the midst or centre, like a Fountain; and as the Sun standeth in the midst among the Planets, and is King of the Stars, and the Heart of Nature in this World, so great also is a Cherubim or King of Angels.</p>
                  <p>VVe are not to understand, that the holy Angels dwell only above the Stars without the place of this VVorld: Indeed they dwell without the Dominion and Source of this world, but in the place of this world; albeit there is no place in Eternity, the place of this world, and also the place without this world is all one to them.</p>
                  <p>VVe men see not Angels and Devils with our Eyes, and yet they are about us, and among us, the reason is because they dwell not in the Source and Dominion of our world.</p>
                  <p>VVe understand that evil and good Angels dwell near to one another, and yet there is the greatest immense distance [between them] for the Heaven is in Hell, and the Hell is in Heaven, and yet the one is not manifest to the other; and although the Devil should go many Millions of Miles, desiring to enter into Heaven, and to see it, yet he would be still in Hell, and not see it; also the Angels see not the Darkness, for their sight is meer Light of divine Power; and the Devils sight is meer Darkness of God's Anger: The like also is to be understood of the Saints, and again of the VVicked.</p>
                  <p>Their agillity or nimbleness is as swift as the Thoughts of a man yea as the divine Power it self is, yet one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is more swift then another, and that answerable accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Quality—Now upon the seventh Spirit of God their Foot doth stay, which is solid like a Cloud, and clear and bright as a Christaline Sea, where they walk upward and downward which way soever they please.</p>
                  <p>In that seventh Spirit also riseth up the heavenly Fruits and Colours, and whatsoever is apprehensible.</p>

                  <p>The Devil was indeed an Angel, and <hi>Adam</hi> an Image of God, they had both the Fire and the Light, as also divine Wit, Ingenuity or understanding in them: Why did the Devil imagin according to the Fire, and <hi>Adam</hi> according to the Earth?

                  <head>Whether is the Soul of a new-born Child without Sin?</head>
                  <p>HOw can a Soul be born pure, it cannot be, it bringeth the <hi>Turba</hi> with it into the World, and is sinful in the Mother's Womb.</p>
                  <p>Yet the Soul is not wholly forsaken of God, so far as the Father and Mother are honest, and in God, for it cometh from the Soul of the Father and Mother: And although a Child dye in the Mothers womb without Baptism, yet it is baptized with the Spirit of the Father and of the Mother, <hi>viz.</hi> with the holy Ghost, which dwelleth in them, and the <hi>Turba</hi> is destroyed in Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Faith's part passeth through to God.</p>
                  <p>But the matter is far otherwise with wicked Parents, if the Child dye in the Mother's Womb, the Soul of it falleth into the <hi>Turba,</hi> and reacheth not God to Eternity, it also knoweth nothing of him, but it is a Life, according to the Essence and Property of the Parents.</p>
                  <p>And yet it doth not by this reach to the Inflamation, for that Soul it self hath not yet committed Sin, but it is a Spirit in the Source, quite void of Self-desire; it is like burning Brimstone, like the <hi>Ignus Fatui,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach God, but remain between Heaven and Hell in the Mystry, until the Judgment of God, which will at last put every thing apart in its own place.</p>
                  <p>Thus no Soul is born into the World without Sin, be it begotten by holy or unholy Parents; for it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the earthly Seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bringeth the <hi>Turba</hi> of the Body with it, which also hath begrit the Soul.</p>
                  <p>And as the Abiss, and the anger of God, and also the earthly Life depend wholly on God the Father, and yet cannot comprehend and touch his Heart and Spirit; so it is also with the Child in the Mother's womb, if it be begotten by godly Parents, then each Principle standeth in its own part.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Turba</hi> taketh the earthly Body, then the Heaven taketh the Spirit, and the Majesty filleth the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000447_0049_0FA5AEBBD9B8D6C0"/>
Spirit, and then the Soul is in God, it is free from pain. But while the Soul remaineth in the earthly Life, it is not free, because the earthly Spirit doth with its Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination always bring its Abominations into it, and the Spirit must be continually in Strife against the earthly Life.</p>

                  <p>And although many a Soul is held a sufficient while, yet the Anger cannot devour that small Faith, but must at last let it go: But I leave it to him to try what this is, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully persevereth in Sin till his end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then first desireth to be saved, and then the <hi>Pope</hi> forsooth, must save him, he shall find it by woful experience.</p>

                  <p>Yet we confess, and acknowledge readily, that the Church of Christ hath great power to ransom such a Soul, if with fervency and earnestness it do it as it was done in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, when they had holy People, and holy Priests, who performed their Ministry in real earnestness.</p>

                  <p>And this we see in <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, whom the King of <hi>Israel</hi> raised up, that he might make his Will known to him, though it seem otherwise to some, of whom we may well say, that they are blind, and void of Knowledge, for they speak but their own scholastick Fables, and frame Opinions about that they have no knowledge of in the Spirit.

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Eye of Fire: The burning Fire in the Source signifieth the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and the Life; yet the Fire is not the Life, but the Spirit of the Source which ariseth from the Fire, and goeth forth from the Fire like Air. That is the true Spirit of the Source of the life of the Fire, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bloweth the Fire up again, and maketh it burn.</p>
                  <p>Now the Fire shineth and giveth light out of the Source where it shineth, and the source comprehendeth at the light; and this signifieth the second Principle wherein God dwelleth.</p>
                  <p>For we know that the Power is in the Light, and not in the Fire, the fire only giveth Essence to the light, and the life or the light produceth meekness and substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, <hi>viz.</hi> Water.</p>
                  <p>Now we understand, that there is a meek life in the light without Source, and yet it self is an insensible Source, it is nothing but a longing or desire of Love.</p>
                  <p>VVhich Source we account a Tincture, in which the budding and blossomings hath its original, yet the fire is the cause of it, and the meekness is a cause of the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000447_0065_0FA5AEC8CA8B8DF0"/>
Substantiality; for the desire of Love in the Light, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth it, and keepeth it, so that it becometh a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but the desire of fire consumeth the Substantiality.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Image dwelleth in the fire of the Soul, as Light dwelleth in the fire, but it hath another Principle, as the Light is such a Source, as is different from the fire.</p>
                  <p>And so the true Image of God dwelleth in the Light of the fire of the Soul; which Light, the fiery Soul must create in the Fountain of the Love of God, in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, by putting and yielding its Imagination into it.</p>
                  <p>But if the Soul do not so, but putteth its Imagination into it self, into its wrathful form of the Source of the fire, and not into the fountain of Love, into the Light of God, then its own Source of forceness, astringency and bitterness riseth up, and the Image of God becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a <hi>Turba,</hi> and swalloweth up the similitude of God in the wrath.</p>
                  <p>And then the astringent <hi>Fiat</hi> in the fiery Essence of the Soul figureth for the Soul an Image of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that is, in its Will: VVhatsoever the essential fire of the Soul desireth, that will be the figure in the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> earthly Figures, that which the will of the Heart casteth it self into, that image the <hi>Fiat</hi> of the Soul will make, that is, as far as the third Principle, and the spirit of the Stars and Elements hath power.</p>
                  <p>So that if the will of the Soul do cast it self into the Kingdom of this world, then the outward Kingdom hath power to bring its imagination into the inward Principle, and if the inward <hi>Fiat</hi> perceive that in the fire of the Soul, then it becometh pregnant with it, and keepeth it.</p>
                  <p>And then the Soul hath the image of a Beast in the third Principle, and that cannot be destroyed forever, except the will of the <hi>soul</hi> return again out of the <hi>earthly Lust,</hi> and pierce into the Love of God again, and then it getteth the image of God again, which may be done only in this Life, while the Soul is essentially in its <hi>Ether,</hi> in the growing of its Tree, but after this Life it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:000447_0066_0FA5AECA90ECD320"/>Thus you may understand what the Soul, Spirit, Image and Turba are; the Soul dwelleth in it self, and is an essential Fire, and its image standeth in it self in the imagination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the light of the Soul, if it cleave to God, if not, then it is an Anxiety in the wrath of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and is an abominable Image, or an image of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turba</hi> of the Soul which destroyeth the divine Image, is the essential wrathfulness, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If the will of the Soul, change it self, then its form will be also changed: For if the source of the Soul be fiery, then it hath also a fiery Image, if the Soul turn its ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination into the centre, into the strong Astringency and Bitterness, then its fair Image is also captivated in the dark Astringency, and infected with astringent wrath. And then this wrath is a <hi>Turba,</hi> which possesseth the Image, and destroyeth the similitude of God; for in God there is Love, Light and Meekness; but in this Image there is darkness, astringency and bitterness.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Soul in its real Life and Understanding, consists in three Kingdoms: The 1<hi>st</hi> is, the eternal nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the potent Might of Eternity, the dark &amp; fire-world, according to which God calleth himself <hi>a strong zealous angry God, and a consuming Fire,</hi> in which the Devil hath wholly plunged and diabolized himself.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> is the holy light world, where the eternal understanding hath displayed it self through the Fires sharpness, in the light of the great fiery Love-desire, and turned the wrathful Darkness and fiery Property, to a Kingdom of Joy, which is the true manifestation of the Deity, and is called the holy Heaven of the angelical delight and bliss.</p>

                  <p>Therefore men should better consider the Scripture, as to such Terms or Expressions; for it often speaketh out of the eternal Mouth, which beginneth every moment.</p>
                  <p>For when the Scripture saith, <hi>he hardneth their Hearts that they believe not, and so come not to be saved</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, then it speaketh of those who would be saved by their own Ability, and their evil Will and Life, those he suffereth to go on in their purpose or predistination, for they will do it.</p>

                  <p>And when he had eat the forbidden Fruit, then God's anger elected him to the damnation of Death, and God's love spoke against it, saying, <hi>The Seed of the Woman shall bruise or crush the Serpent's Head</hi>; and that was also the eternal Election, and yet it was also a beginning tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Election; for how can an Election pass upon a thing when as yet it hath no Root?</p>

                  <p>NOw that which is out of the Eternal, as the Soul of man, that hath also free-will to manifest it self in the Light or in the Darkness; not that it hath the Light or Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in its power, but it hath ability to work in good or evil, that is in the power of the Light or of the Darkness, and in which soever it worketh, that manifesteth it self in it.</p>
                  <p>The might or power is God's, and the Soul is his Child, a branch in the Tree, proceeded out of God's Mouth, out of Love and Anger; all that lieth in it, and is its own property; who will then take away the Free-will from it, being it is a branch of the eternal Tree, &amp; hath Love and Anger in it self?</p>
                  <p>For the Fire-Soul is a Root proceeded from the divine Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, and therefore it hath Free-will, and nothing can deprive it, and therefore it may conceive either in the Fire or Light.</p>
                  <p>The Souls free-will is as thin as a nothing, and though it be in its Body indeed, encompassed with the something, yet its amassed or conceived something is in a false distinguished Essence by reason of the original of Sin.</p>
                  <p>Now if the free-will would approach to God with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, then it must depart out of its false something; and if it now doth so depart, then it is bare and impotent, for it is again in the first nothing: For if it would come to God then it must dye to its false self-hood, and forsake it, and if it forsakes the same, then it is barely and meerly as nothing, and so it cannot go work or move: if it will shew its Might, then it must be in something wherein it doth imaginate and form it self. But when a man will say, man cannot turn his Will towards that which is good, <hi>viz.</hi> towards Grace, that is groundless; Grace indeed standeth in the <hi>Abiss</hi> of the Creature in all wicked m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="unknown:000447_0070_0FA5AED122701DC8"/>Can the Will be obedient to a worldly Lord and Master, and for that end stand still for which he would have him? wherefore not also to God, especially when the Ability is as soon given, as a man doth but incline his Will to stand still?</p>
                  <p>It is better to know nothing, then to Will according to self, for that which knoweth nothing, the will of that passeth away, with the Creaturely Life, and its strife hath an end, and hath no more source of Torment, as we may understand in irrational Creatures.</p>
                  <p>For it is the Source and Torment of all the damned that are wishing and woulding, <hi>viz.</hi> they would that which is Self, and in their woulding they generate Ideas, Species and Formations, <hi>viz.</hi> contrary Wills and Desires, the Will being at strife, so that one thing is manifested in multiplicity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is at enmity with it self; but when it is one with the eternal One, then can no enmity be therein.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is man's last proof or tryal when he standeth still to God in all things, then in him Light proceeds out of Darkness, Life out of Death, and Joy out of Sorrow, for God is in, and with him in all things.</p>

                  <p>Therefore Christ took his Soul from a Woman, <hi>viz.</hi> from a Virgin, and yet was a Man; so that he rightly stood in the <hi>Adamical</hi> Image, and brought the averted severed Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Life, in which our Will had broken it self off from God, again into the temperature and union, <hi>viz.</hi> into that one.</p>

                  <p>Also it is plain and clear enough, that [as Jesus ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Heaven, so] he will come again in the same Form at the last Day with a divine and glorified Body, as a Prince of the holy Angels, which shall be the men Angels.</p>
                  <p>Also, we know the becoming Man, or Incarnation of Christ to be natural, as of all the Children of men, the Lord gave himself to be under the Servant, that the Servant might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came living, and is in like manner in nine Months become a perfect man, and also continueth a true God—become born into the world through that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Had he not had a natural Soul, then he had not in the Person had all the three Principles: What should he then have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Hands of his Father at that present when he dyed on the Cross?

                  <p>The earthly part which he took to himself out of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mary,</hi> that is, to or upon the divine Substance, dyed away on the Cross.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the Soul in the Substantiality of God, and as a victorious conquering Prince went into the Hell of Devils, that is into God's Anger, and quenched it with God's Love and Meekness of the divine Substantiality.</p>
                  <p>For the Love-Fire came into the Anger-Fire, and drowned

the Anger, wherein the Devil would be God; thus was the Devil taken captive with the Darkness, and lost his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: The Spirit of Christ took the Devil captive, and drove him out of the Fire of the Soul, and cast him into Darkness, and shut him up under darkness out from the Fire of the Soul, and out from God's fire into the wrathful harshness and bitterness in Cold.</p>
                  <p>Consider the first four Forms of Nature, and you will understand what the Devil's Mansion is; for before Christ came, he kept the Soul captive in the <hi>Turba</hi> with the Fire, and though he had not the Spirit of the Soul, yet he had the Root of it in the <hi>Turba,</hi> but then he was commanded to cease.</p>
                  <p>While the earthly man liveth, the Soul is continually in hazard or danger, for the Devil hath enmity with, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually casteth forth his streams, with false and wicked Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations into the Stary and Elementary Spirit, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or graspeth therewith after the Soul's fire, and willeth continually to infect the same with earthly Devils longing and malady.</p>

                  <p>O thou Cross of Christ! how heavy art thou often-times! how doth the Heaven hide it self, but so the noble Grain is sown, when that is sprung up, then it brings forth much fair Fruit in Patience.</p>
                  <p>Thus every little Sprout groweth in the Soul out of the divine Wisdom: It must all press forth out of the Anguish-Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a Sprout out of the Root of a Tree, it is all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in the Anguish.</p>

                  <p>All this was given [man] for his play, he had the

                  <p>But Metals are in themselves nothing else but a Water and Oyl, which are held by the wrathful Properties, <hi>viz.</hi> by the astringent austeer desire, that is, by a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine martial fiery Property in the compaction of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> to be one Body [or congealed bulk] but if I wholly destroy this Body, and severize each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its own Property, then I clearly find therein the first Creation.</p>
                  <p>Gold, Silver and precious Mettals, are indeed out of the heavenly <hi>Magia</hi> thus inclosed and shut up, by or with the kindling: They are another thing then Earth, man loveth that well, and useth it for his Maintenance, but he knoweth not its ground and original; it is not in vain loved by the Mind, it hath a high original, if we would consider of it.</p>
                  <p>But we are justly silent of it here, seeing man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, loveth it too much, and thereby withdraweth himself from the Spirit of God: One should not love the Body more then the Spirit, for the Spirit is its Life; this we give you to understand in a Similitude, and are silent of the matter, with the ground and original thereof.</p>

                  <p>When the Tincture of the outward Body was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Devils evil longing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the Metalline Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture hid it self from the human, &amp; became an enemy to it; for it is purer then the perished in the outward Man.</p>

                  <p>Therefore I say, God's Love is as great as his Anger, his Fire as great as his Light, and his Darkness as great as either of the other; it is all alike eternal, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it beginneth it self from Eternity with or

                  <p>Observe now, God's anger maketh the dark mind full of God's Love, maketh the Light mind full. For whosoever hath, to them it will be given.</p>
                  <p>But now all standeth in Strife, the Light against the Darkness, and the Life against the Death, and the Death against the Life: But Man is out of the great Substance of all Substances, and in him is the Strife.</p>
                  <p>Dost thou say, <hi>God can make of me what he will, he is Omnipotent:</hi> He maketh of thee what thou wilt, his Love is omnipotent, and also his Anger; that which getteth thee, holdeth thee. The Wicked is to God a good savour to Death; and the Saint or Holy is so to the eternal holy Life as thou growest; so thou art such Sap as thou drawest into thy self, such Fruit thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est: It is not said, God will not be mine, but thou wilt not be his, and so you are parted.</p>
                  <p>But he cannot make himself a Child, he goeth only with the Will into the Matrix, and then the divine <hi>Fiat</hi> apprehendeth him, and maketh him one; indeed he cannot make himself a Devil, the hellish <hi>Fiat,</hi> according to the dark world's Property maketh him one, when he doth but give his Will up thereto.</p>
                  <p>Therefore rightly saith the Apostle. <hi>To whom you give your selves Servants in obedience, his Servants you are whether of God's Love or Anger.</hi> Here the Apostle speaks of man's Election, that man can give up himself, and be given

up; and though indeed of himself he cannot take or receive, yet God giveth him the taking or receiving, for he hath promised it him.</p>
                  <p>We believe a Resurrection of our Bodies which we had here; it is not the earthly Body that is the Image, which shall live eternally, but the Heavenly, which the earthly body here holdeth captive in Death; but if Christ become born therein, then it is no more in death, but liveth in Christ, and is only covered with the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body.</p>
                  <p>It is not the Husk, <hi>viz.</hi> the beastial Flesh that shall arise, but the Life in the outward Mystery with the wonders, that shall be comprised in the holy Element, and be united with the Body of Christ [even] of the new man, and in Eternity stand with its wonders in it.</p>
                  <p>Seek not Christ's flesh in the four Elements in the Spirit of the outward world, but in the Root of them, <hi>viz.</hi> in the holy Element, a Principle deeper then this world is; not absent from the outward body.</p>

                  <p>It is then necessary that we convert with our Wills,

and enter again into the New-Birth, and Christ giveth us his Body to eat, and his Blood to drink, but not to the man of Sin, but to the man in Christ new born to Life, <hi>viz.</hi> that from the divine world's substance to the <hi>Paradisical</hi> man, which hath a heavenly Mouth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with.</p>

                  <p>Our whole Life should be a continual Repentance, for it is even a continual sinning; and though indeed the noble Lilly-branch new generated or born in Christ's spirit sinneth not; yet the earthly man in Soul and Body sinneth, and willeth continually to break or destroy the noble Rose-bud again, and altogether ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure it.</p>

                  <p>But seeing he knew that there was such a Tincture in the Serpent, and the Serpent being created out of the beginning of Time; therefore he insinuated with his desire into the Serpent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and took possession of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's Tincture, and wrought forth his desire through the Serpent against Man, to introduce him to long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Serpent's property; for the Serpent's tincture was from both Originals, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the deadly <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>

The other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thou walkest in, is in the outward world, the Air, wherein thou dwellest in the vain corrupt Flesh and Blood, where the pleasure of the world, &amp; the assaults of the Devil pass over thee every hour, thou mayst perhaps in thy great Joy bring earthliness again into my Beauty, and darken my Pearl: thou mayst also perhaps, grow proud as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did, when he had the Pearl in his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,

                     <p>I will keep my Pearl in my self, and dwell in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in thee, in thy extinguished, but now in me revived Humanity, and reserve my Pearl for <hi>Paradise,</hi> until thou puttest away this Earthliness from thee, and then I will give it thee to possess. But I will readily afford and present my Countenance to thee, and the sweet Rayes of the Pearl, during the time of this earthly Life. I will dwell with the Pearl in the inner Quire, and be thy faithful loving Bride: I will not espouse my self with thy earthly Flesh, for I am a heavenly Queen, my Kingdom is not of this world, yet I will not cast thy outward Life away, but visit it often with my rayes of Love, for thy outward Humanity shall return again; but I will not have the Beast of Vanity, neither did God create it in <hi>Adam,</hi> with a purpose to have it so gross and earthly, but in <hi>Adam</hi> thy desire through Lust form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this beastial groseness from, and with all the Essences of the awakened Vanity of the earthly Property, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Heat and Cold, Pain, Enmity and Desolution consisteth.</p>

                     <p>I will bring a Garland for thee out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> with me, for a token of my Love, and put it upon thee, in which thou shalt rejoyce: But I give thee not my Pearl for a possession during this time: Thou must continue in Resignation, and hearken what the Lord playeth in thy Harmony in thee: Moreover thou must give Sound and Essence to thy tune out of my strength and virtue, for thou art now a Messenger of his Mouth, and must set forth his praise and glory.</p>
                     <p>O kiss me with thy desire in thy Strength and Power, and then I will shew thee all my Beauty, and will rejoyce and delight my self with thy sweet Love and shining Brightness in thy fiery Life; but the Crown of Pearl wherewith I crowned thee, I have laid that aside for thee, thou must wear it no more till thou art become pure in my sight.</p>

                  <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <p>MAn is the greatest <hi>Arcanum,</hi> or secret Mistery that God ever wrought, he hath the figure and is the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, shewing how the Deity hath exgenerated it self from Eternity out of the fierce Wrath out of the Fire, by the sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through Death into another Principle, of another Source or Quality.</p>
                  <p>For thus is he also exgenerated out of Death again, and groweth out of Death again into another Principle, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Source and Quality, and Virtue, or Power, wherein he is quite free from Earthliness.</p>
                  <p>And it is very good that we are with the earthly part fallen home to the Earth, inasmuch as we also retain the divine part; for so we are wholly pure, and come wholly perfect without any Lust, Suggestion or Infection of the Devil into the Kingdom of God again; and are a much greater <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or secret Mistery then the Angels.</p>
                  <p>We shall also, as to the heavenly Substantiality, excel them, for they are flames of Fire throughly illustrated with the Light, but we attain the great Source or Quality of the Meekness and Love, which floweth forth in God's holy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality.</p>
                  <p>Therefore they do very wrongfully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fasly, who say, God willeth not to have all men in Heaven; He willeth that all should be saved or helped, the Fault is in man himself, that he will not suffer himself to be saved or helped.</p>
                  <p>And although many be of an evil Inclination, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not from God, but from the Mother of Nature; if they lay the blame on God, they lye, God's Spirit with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self from no man.</p>
                  <p>The noble Jewel in them standeth hidden in the noble centre in the divine Principle; and they can very well with their willing, go forth out of the earthly Substance and Malice, or Wickedness, into the willing of God.</p>
                  <p>But they wilfully and obstinately let the fierce Wrath hold them; for the proud stately self-honouring Life pleaseth them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oo well, and that holdeth them also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="unknown:000447_0100_0FA5AF33498F0D50"/>After this time there is no remedy more; but in this time, while the Soul swimeth and burneth in the Blood, it may well be, for the Spirit of God goeth upon the Wings of the Wind, God is become Man.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of God goeth with the willing into the Soul, it desireth the Soul, it setteth its <hi>Magia</hi> towards the Soul, the Soul needs only to open the Door, and so it goeth voluntarily in, and openeth the noble Grain to the Tree of the Christian-Faith.</p>
                  <p>Cast away your Evil or Wickedness, and enter into meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, press into the Truth and Love, and yield thy self up to God, and so thou wilt be saved or helped.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt say, <hi>I am kept back that I cannot.</hi> Yes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that is right, thou willest to have it so; the Devil also would have it so.</p>
                  <p>Art thou a Champion? why dost thou not strive or fight against the Evil? But if thou strivest or fightest against the good, thou art an enemy to God. Art thou an Enemy? then thou art no Friend; if thou be a friend, then forsake thy enmity and hatred, and go to the Father, and so thou art a Son.</p>
                  <p>If thou sayest, <hi>I am of an evil Source or Quality, and cannot, I am kept back.</hi> Very well, let the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>vil Source or Quality be as it is, but go thou with thy Will-Spirit into God's Love-Spirit, and give up thy self into his Mercy: Thou wilt once well be freed from the evil Source, or Quality.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the evil Body, which sticketh full of evil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, there is not much to be done; if it be inclined to evil, do it the less good, give it no occasion to wantonness.</p>
                  <p>To keep it in subjection, is a good Remedy; to be sober, and to lead a temperate Life, is a good Purgation for the evil Ass; not to give it that it lusteth after, to let it fast often, so that it may not hinder Prayer, that is good for it; it is not willing, but the Vnderstanding must be Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it beareth God's Image—This <hi>Latine</hi> doth not relish well to the rational world in the Lusts of the Flesh.</p>

similitude of God, which God highly loveth and manifesteth himself in this similitude, as in his own; God is in man the middlemost.</p>
                  <p>But he dwelleth only in himself; and if it be so, that the Spirit of man become one Spirit with him, then he manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself in the Humanity, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Mind, Thoughts and Desirings, so that the mind feeleth him.</p>
                  <p>Else in this World he is very much too subtil to be beheld by us, only the Thoughts behold him in the Spirit, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, in the willing Spirit; for the Will sendeth the Thoughts into God, and God giveth himself into the Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>And then the Thoughts bring the Power of God to the Will, and the Will receiveth them with joy, but with trembling [or quaking] for it acknowledgeth it self unworthy, seeing it proceedeth out of a rough Lodging, <hi>viz.</hi> out of a wavering mind; and therefore it receiveth the Power in the sinking down before God.</p>
                  <p>Thus out of its triumph, cometh a soft gentle Meekness to be, that is, God's true Substance, and it apprehendeth that very Substance: And that conceived or apprehended Substance is in the willing, the heavenly Body, and is called the true and right Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Will hath received in the Power of God, the same sinketh or demerseth it self into the mind and dwelleth in the Fire of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Image of God is entire or total, and God see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>When the Soul eats of God's word, the Complexion, according to the outward Life, becomes powerful, and as it were captive, though it live in it self.

                  <p>IF the inward anguish or terror of Soul be not accompanyed with a kind of (outward) terrifying astonishment, then is the Devil not there present, but 'tis the Souls amazement which is affrighted at the inward risings of the dark Abiss<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Principle of God's wrath in it. It thinks oft, when the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi> Complexion is kindled by some angry sower Influence of the Stars, that the Devil is there, when indeed there is no such matter. When he comes 'tis either with vehement astonishing Terrors, or in an Angels behaviour, or rather in a flattering posture like a fawning Hound.</p>
                  <p>All Temptation comes not from the Devil, especially with <hi>Melancholy</hi> men; but the most part of that afflicting Sad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness comes from the Imagination of the Soul, which being necessitated to dwell in dark Melancholy Habitations, no wonder if it be easily surprised with heaviness, so as to think God hath forgotten it, and will have none of it.</p>
                  <p>For the Melancholy Complexion is dark, and hath no light of its own, as the other Complexions have; yet is not this Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness essential to the Soul, but is only its lonesom Tabernacle

during its Pilgrimage here on Earth; nor doth the Soul's Holiness and Righteousness consist at all in the Complexion, but in the inward heavenly Principle where God dwells: For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Our Conversation is in Heaven.</hi> Now this Heaven wherein God dwells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not manifest in the outward Complexion, but only in it self, <hi>viz.</hi> in the second Principle.</p>
                  <p>It oft happens that the holiest Souls are in this manner overwhelmed with Sadness, and this not without Gods special permission, to the end they may be proved, and strive the more earnestly after that heavenly Crown of Victory, which is given them in this Life as a pledge of their everlasting Felicity.</p>
                  <p>For when the Soul takes Heaven as it were by Storm, and wins her Crown [the Gift of the holy Ghost] after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant persevering stedfastness in the fiery Conflict, her Crown of triumph is much more noble and pretious then that which is not obtained till after the bodily Death; for the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jesus Christ saith, <hi>To him that overcomes will I give to sit with me upon my Throne, as I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and am seated on my Father's Throne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore let no man thus tormented with anguish, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with himself in the assaults of the Complexion, that it comes from God's wrath, and want of mercy in him, which is a meer fancy of his own Complexion in the Stars. For we well see, that the vilest fatted Swine of the Devil's herd, that wallow and bathe themselves day and night in the filth of Sin, are not so full of Sadness, not so assaulted with this kind of Temptations, the reason is because they have an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward light in the Complexion, wherein they dance before the Devil in an Angels likeness. So, as long as there is but one little spark of Light glimmering in a man's Heart, which desires God's Grace, and would gladly pertake of Salvation, the Door of Gods Grace stands yet open. For he who is given over by God, whose Sin is come to the full measure, he is not at all solicitous after God, Man or Devil, but is stone-blind, runs on carelesly in a course of lightness without fear, rests himself upon a customary practice of some outward

For to believe is not to be filled with Joy in the flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heart and outward Complexion, that the fleshly mind and spirit be so jocond, that the very Heart and Reins leap for joy; this is not Faith, but these are only some Love-emanations

from the holy Ghost within, a divine lightning which hath no stability, but after a short resplendance disappears. For God dwells not in the outward Heart or Complexion, but in himself, in the second centre, in the Jewel of the noble Image of God's likeness, which is hidden in this outward world.</p>
                  <p>Dear Soul, think no other, when the anxious property of thy Complexion, thus kindled by the Stars begins to move, but that thou then stands as a Labourer in God's Vineyard; thou must not stand idle, but b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> working; thou dost God herein a great and very considerable piece of Service, and thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is this, that thou overcome the Temptation by an unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Faith, however no comfort appear in the outward Heart to support it; be not deceived, 'tis not Faith to give assent to what I see and feel; but this is Faith, to trust the hidden Spirit, and believe the truth of its words, maugre all the Contradictions of blind Nature.</p>
                  <p>The Soul that is lockt up in the dark Chamber of the <hi>Melancholy</hi> Complexion, should not dwell long or scarce at all in Speculations about the wrath of God, nor give it self much to, solitude, but rather spend its time in Godly Conferences. For so the matter of those friendly and profitable yielding sufficient entertainment to the working Phansie; 'tis by this means handsomly diverted from its torturing Cogitations. For no deep speculation is in this state profitable for it, which seeing it cannot turn it to its health and comfort, 'tis better let it alone.</p>
                  <p>Also, the <hi>Melancholy</hi> Mind should with great care avoid Drunkenness: for when the Body thus loads it self with Drink, then the earthly power of the Drink taketh the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion Chamber totally in; then doth the Soul, with the Imagination, to its great hurt, feed upon the earthly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, kindles its Fire therewith, and rejoyceth for a short time in it.</p>
                  <p>But when that man becometh sober again after his Drink. then stands the poor Soul as most desolate, and more then ever forsaken of God, for it loses in the overflowing of the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:000447_0115_0FA5AF479AAD3170"/>
earthly Property the divine Imagination and Desire; for the Spirit of God will not have his dwelling in the earthly Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: I speak it as a most certain truth which I have a well grounded knowledge of in the centre of Nature, and deepest Principle of Life.</p>
                  <p>The Soul must be content to remain in Sorrow for a little time: for while it sits contentedly in the House of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is not in the House of Sin. But alas! what is it? How soon will it be at liberty from its sorrowful Prison, and have the victorious Crown of everlasting Joy set upon its Head? O Eternity! thy duration is of vast extent! What is it for a Soul to be a small moment in sadness, and after that to rejoyce everlastingly? <hi>For God will wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, let a man behave himself as becomes a man, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the dominion of his Life to the manly Reason and Light of God shining therein, and not suffer himself to be hurried on by the bruitish Instincts of the Complexion: For there is no Complexion so noble and pure in Nature, but if a man live according to the Stars, the Devil hath his pleasure and pastime therein. Therefore it is rightly said by St. <hi>Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be sober and watchful, for the Devil your Adversary goeth about as a roaring Lyon, seeking whom he may devour.</hi>

The will of the Devil can also enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that whereinto man bringeth the desire of his Soul [which is also from the eternal] in wickedness.</p>
                  <p>For the original of the Soul, and of Angels, out of the Eternal is the same. But the Devil hath no power more over the time [or temporary condition] of this world, but in the great <hi>Turba</hi>; wheresoever that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it self in the eternal and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> natural wrath, there he is busie, as in Wars, Fighting and Strife, as also in great Tempests without Water: In the Fire he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth as far as the <hi>Turba</hi> goeth in great Showers, and Tempests of Thunder, Lightning, and Hail, but he cannot direct them, for he is not Lord or Master in them, but Servant.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Creature stirreth up, with the desire, good and evil, life and death. The human angelical Desire standeth in the centre of the eternal Nature [which is without beginning] and wherein it kindleth it self, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in good or evil, it accomplisheth its work in that.</p>
                  <p>Now God created every thing for, and in that,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:000447_0118_0FA5AF4B58C8C5B8"/>
wherein it should be the Angels for and in Heaven, and Man for and in <hi>Paradise.</hi> If therefore the desire of the Creature go forth from its own Mother, then it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the contrary Will, and into Enmity, and it is tormented with the contrariety therein, and so a false will ariseth in a good, and thence the good will entreth into its nothing again, <hi>viz.</hi> into the end of Nature and Creature, and so leaveth the Creature in its own [evil or] wickedness, as appeared by <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and also by <hi>Adam</hi>; and had not the will of the Love of God met with him, and of meer mercy entred into the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity again, there could be no good will in man.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all speculation and searching about God's will is a vain thing, without the mind be converted: For when the mind standeth captivated in the self-desire of the earthly Life, it cannot comprehend [what] the will of God [is] it runneth on but in self, from one way to another, and yet findeth no rest; for self-desire evermore bringeth disquietness.</p>
                  <p>The Light shineth in Darkness, and the Darkness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth not the Light, and yet they both dwell in one another. The four Elements is also an example of this, which in their original are but one Element, which is neither hot, cold, dry nor moist, and yet by its stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring severeth it self into four Properties, <hi>viz.</hi> into Fire, Air, Water and Earth.</p>

                  <p>But we must here distinguish; if the Zeal of God should awaken it self in an holy man, without his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Will, and give him the Sword of God's Anger, such a one desires much from those who in their own thoughts contrive and plot in the wrath, and introduce the conceived or purposed Will into the Serpent's <hi>Ens,</hi> and make it to Substance, for that is Sin; yea, though the most holy man [Prophet or Apostle] should do it. Therefore Christ so empathetically, and punctually teacheth us in the new-birth. Love, Humility and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and would that a <hi>Christian</hi> should not at all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, also not be Angry; for he saith, <hi>Whosoever is angry with his Brother, is guilty of the Judgment.</hi> For anger is a conception in the Serpent's <hi>Ens,</hi> which must be cut off by the Judgment of God from the good beeing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="unknown:000447_0121_0FA5AF4D899304F0"/>All War, howsoever blanched over, and under what pretence soever, taketh its original out of God's Anger. It doth not belong to any true <hi>Christian,</hi> born of Christ, to raise the Sword of the <hi>Turba,</hi> unless the zealous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God do stir it up in him, who often will rebuke Sin: whatsoever exalts its self in the wrath about its own Honour and Pride, and brings it self to Revenge [or Blood-shed] is from the Devil—Earthly Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Government hath its original from the fall in the Serpent's craft.</p>
                  <p>All War and Contention doth arise out of the nature and property of the dark world, <hi>viz.</hi> from the four Elements of the Anger of God, which produceth in the Creature Pride, Covetousness, Envy and Anger; these are the four Elements of the dark world, wherein the Devils and all evil Creatures live, and from these four Elements ariseth VVar.</p>
                  <p>For although God bad the People of <hi>Israel</hi> drive out the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and wage VVar; yet the command was wholly from the angry zealous God, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Fire's Property; for the <hi>Heathen</hi> had stirred up the VVrath and Indignation, which would devour them. But God so far as he is called God, wills not any VVar, but the kingdom of Nature in Gods Anger willeth it.</p>

Neither is it great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but good-will that joyns men to God—It shall not then be needful so violently to labour to season our Minds with the so long, so tedious, so difficult, so unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able learning of all sorts of Sciences, but only to give our self to what is more easie and common to all, the Contemplation of the most noble object of all things, God; which common act of Contemplation, so easie to all men, is not obtained by Syllogism and Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by Belief and Adoration. Where then is the great Felicity of enjoying the Sciences? Where is the praise and beautitude of the wise <hi>Philosophers,</hi> that make so much noise in the Schools, sounding with the Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums of those men, whose Souls perhaps in the mean time are at that instant suffering the Torments of Hell?

So that if we may be bold to confess the truth, the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all Sciences are so dangerous and inconstant, that it is far safer to be ignorant then to know: <hi>Adam</hi> had never been ejected out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> had not the Serpent been his Master, to teach him Good and Evil. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have them thrown out of the Church that would know more than they ought—The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all Sciences is so difficult, if I may not say, impossible, that the Age of man will not suffice to learn the perfection of one Art, as it ought to be: Which <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> seems to intimate, when he saith, <hi>Then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the whole Work of God, that man cannot find out, the work that is wrought under the Sun, for the which man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to seek it, and cannot find it; yea, and though the wise man think to know it, he cannot find it.</hi> Nothing can happen more pestilential to man than Knowledge: This is that true Plague that invades all mankind with so much Confusion, that subverts all Innocence, subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to so many Clouds of Sin and Error, and at length Death. This is that that hath extinguished the Light of Faith, casting our Souls into profound Darkness, which condemning the Truth, has mounted Error to a Throne —To a Common-wealth there can be nothing more pernitious than Learning and Science, wherein if some happen to excell the rest, all things are carried by their determination, as taking upon them to be most knowing, who thereupon laying hold upon the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Unskilfulness of the multitude, usurp all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to themselves, which is oft the occasion of the changing popular States into <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> which dividing into Factions, is at length easily oppressed by single Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Furthermore, all Sciences are but the Opinions and the Decrees of private men, as well those that are of use, as those that are prejudicial; as well those that are wholsom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as those that are pestiferious; as well the bad as the good, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But in brief, this Syderial or Starry influence is called <hi>Astrology,</hi> of which many desire to be satisfied of the effects, but he is wise that knows them: For so manifold are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations, so perpetual the Mixtures, so various the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Scituations of the Stars, that as they are placed at this or any other moment of time, so they never were, nor never will be again, whence their operation upon Mankind is the same: So that 'tis impossible for an <hi>Astrologer,</hi> by the Rules of Art [though founded upon the truest ground] to give any certain Judgment of their Effects, but only in a general way.</p>

                  <p>TWo things especially I intreat thee to consider in these following Poems—First, thou art to know that the Works of the Author <hi>G. W.</hi> are here very much Abreviated [And although his own Words expressed for the most part upon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals] nevertheless if thou art one that hath been acquainted with his Works at large, yet thou wilt find this small Abstract so pithily to express and contain the whole matter [some particulars ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted] that thou mayst hereby receive as much satisfaction, as by reading the Book at large.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To let the Publisher hereof have Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian censures from thee; and that too in respect to the latter part, the which although it may seem somewhat too light in the Ballance of the more serious modern Christian, yet he intends it not to be a means to draw the mind from better, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from worse things: And he doubts not but that will be the effects of it, considering the Constitution of Youth, on whom it may have most influence; all which he hopes thou wilt find ground enough to believe in the perusal hereof: And the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as he hath endeavoured throughout to pass by particular Circumstances, the more immediately to come to the Matter. So also hath he every where omitted what seems more Airy, and less consisting with the present time of Day.</p>

                  <l>That every Passion's natural and good;</l>
                  <l>But we must make a difference of it then,</l>
                  <l>And grant that two-fold Passions are in men,</l>
                  <l>One sort unto the noblest things aspiring,</l>
                  <l>And such as what are meerly good desiring.</l>
                  <l>But this is rather by Gods Inspiration,</l>
                  <l>Then bred within us at our Generation.</l>

                  <l>Doth by our own corrupted Nature grow;</l>
                  <l>For it is head-strong, rash, insatiate,</l>
                  <l>Wonderous disordered and immoderate.</l>

                     <l>CHildren owe much, I must confess 'tis true,</l>
                     <l>And a great Debt is to the Parents due;</l>
                     <l>But yet my Parents should not be so cruel.</l>
                     <l>As to take from me that high priz'd Jewel,</l>

                     <l>The main contentment that Heaven here lends.</l>

                     <l>For I do think, it is not only meant,</l>
                     <l>Children should ask, but Parents should consent,</l>

                  </head>
                  <p>MEn fear Death, as Children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural Fear in Children is increased with Tales, so is the other. Certainly, the fear of Death, is Contemplation of the cause of it, yet the fear of it for it self, is weak. You shall read in some of the Fryers Books, of Mortification, That a man should think with himself, what the the pain is, if he have but his Fingers end pressed or tortured, and thereby imagin what the pains of Death are, when the whole Body is corrupted and dissolved; when many times Death passeth wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h less pain, then the torture of a Limb. For the most Vital parts, are not the quickest of sence. Grones and Convulsions, and a discoloured Face, and Friends weeping and Blacks, and Obsequies and the like, shew Death terrible. It is worthy the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, that there is no Passion in the mind of Man so weak, but masters the Fear of Death; and therefore Death is no such Enemy, when a man hath so many Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers about him, that can win the combat of him. Revenge triumphs over Death; Love esteems it not; Honour aspireth to it; delivery from Ignominy, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it; Grief flyeth to it; Fear pre-occupateth it. It is no less worthy to observe, how little alteration in good Spirits the approaches of Death make: but they are the same till the last. It is as natural to dye, as to be born, and to a little Infant, perhaps the one is as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the other.</p>

                  <p>THe greatest Trust between man, is the Trust of giving Counsel. For in other Confidences, men commit the parts of their Life, their Lands, their Goods, their Child, their Credit, some particular Affair. But to such as they make their Counsellors, they commit the whole; by how much the more they are obliged to all Faith and Integrity. The wisest Princes need not think it any deminution to their Greatness, or derogation to their Sufficiency to relie on Counsel. God himself is not without, but hath made it one of the great Names of his blessed Son. The Counsellor <hi>Solomon</hi> hath pronounced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>That in Counsel there is safety</hi>· Things will have their first or second Cogitations: If they be not tossed upon the Arguments of Counsel, they will be tossed upon the Waves of Fortune, and be full of Inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, doing and undoing, like the reeling of a drunken man. <hi>Solomon's</hi> Son found the force of Counsel, as his Father found the necessity of it. For the beloved Kingdom of God was first rent and broken by ill Counsel: Vpon which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel there are set for our Instruction, the two marks, whereby had Counsel is forever best discerned, that is, young Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel for the Persons, and violent Counsel for the Matter. There is, that are in their Natures faithful, and sincere, and plain, and direct, not crafty and invalued: Let Princes above all, draw to themselves such Natures. The true composition of a Counsellor is to be rather skilful in his Masters business, then in his Nature; for then he is like to advise him, and not to feed his Humour. It is of singular use to Princes, if they take the opinion of their Council, both seperately, and together; for private Opinion is more free, but Opinion before others, is more reverent. In private, men are more bold in their own Humours; and in Consort, men are more Obnoxious to others Humours. Therefore it is good to take both; and of the inferior sort rather in private, to preserve Freedom: Of the greater, rather in Consort, to preserve
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:000447_0192_0FA5AFA26189B568"/>
Respect.

For there was never proud man thought so absurdly well of himself, as the Lover doth of the Person loved; and therefore it was well said, That it is impossible to love and to be wise.

They do best that make this Affection keep Quarter, and sever it wholly from their serious Affairs and Actions of their Life; for if it check once with Business, it troubleth mens Fortunes, and maketh men that they can be no way true to their own ends.</p>

For it is a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret both in Nature and State, that it is safer to change many things, then one. To be free minded, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully disposed at hours of Meat, and of Sleep, and of Exercise, is the best Precept of long lasting. Despise no new accident in your Body, but ask opinion of it. In Sickness respect Health principally, and in Health Action. For those that put their Bodies to endure in Health, may in most Sicknesses, which are not very sharp, be cured only with Dyet and tending.</p>

It is good to vary and mix Speeches to the present occasion with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Tales with Reasons, asking of Questions, with telling of Opinions, and Jest with Earnest. But some things are priviledged from Jest, namely Religion, matters of State, great Persons, any man's present Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of Importance, and any case that deserveth Pity; and generally men ought to find the difference between Saltness and Bitterness. Certainly, he that hath a Satyrical Vein, as he maketh others afraid of his VVit, so be had need be afraid of others Memory. He that questioneth much, shall learn much, and content much:

                  <p>I Cannot call Riches better then the baggage of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for as the Baggage is to an Army, so is Riches to Virtue: it cannot be spared, nor well left behind, but it hindreth the march; yea, and the care of it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times loseth or distributeth the Victory. Of great Riches there is no real use, except it be in the distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the rest is Conceit. <hi>O,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, where much is, there are many to consume it; and what hath the Owner, but the sight of it with his Eyes?</hi> The personal Fruition of any man cannot reach to feel great Riches; there is a Custody of them, or a power of Dole or Donative of them, or a Fame of them, but no solid use to the Owner. Do you not see what feigned Prices are set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on little Stones and Rarities, and what works of Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation are undertaken, because there might seem to be
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000447_0197_0FA5AFA624F65378"/>
some use of great Riches? But then they may be of use to buy men out of Dangers or Troubles. As <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Riches are as a Strong-hold in the Imagination of the Rich man.</hi> But this is excellently expressed, that it is in the Imagination, and not always in Fact. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, great Riches have sold more men, then they have bought out. Seek not proud Riches, but such as thou mayst get justly, use soberly, distribute cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and leave contentedly; yet have no abstract or Fryerly contempt of them. Neither trust thou much others, that seem to despise Riches; for they despise them that dispair of them, and none worse when they come to them. Be not Penny wise; Riches have wings and sometimes they fly away of themselves: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they must be set flying, to bring in more. Men leave their Riches either to their Kindred or to the Publick, and moderate Portions prosper best in both. Measure not thy Advancements by Quantity, but frame them by Measure; and defer not Charities till Death; for certainly if a man weigh it rightly, he that doth so is rather liberal of another man's, than of his own.</p>

But yet certainly again, if it light well, it makes Vertues shine, and Vices blush. The Poet saith,

Stars of natural Inclination are sometimes obscured by the sun of Discipline and Virtue. Therefore it is good to consider of Deformity, not as a sign, which is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable, but as a cause, which seldom failteh of the Effect. Deformed persons are extream bold; first, as in their own defence, as being exposed to scorn; but in process of time by a general Habit. Also it stirreth in them Industry, and specially of this kind, to watch and observe the weaness of others, that they may have somewhat to repay. They will, if they be of Spirit, seek to free themselves from Scorn, which must be either by Virtue or Malice; and therefore they prove either the best of People, or the worst, or strangly mixed.</p>

                  <p>MEn's Thoughts are much according to their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Discourse and Speech according to their Learning, and infused Opinions; but their Deeds are after as they have been accustomed. The ingagement of Words are not so forceable as Custom: A man would wonder to hear men profess, protest, engage, give great Words, and then do just as they have done before, as if they were dead Images and Engines, moved only by the Wheels of Custom. Therefore since Custom is the principal Magistrate of man's Life, let men by all means seek to obtain good Customs. Certainly, Custom is more perfect when it begins in young Years, this we call Education, which is nothing but an early Custom. For it is true, that late Learners cannot so well take the ply, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in some Minds that have not suffered themselves to fix, but have kept themselves open and prepared to receive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the most frequent of external Causes, is that the Folly of one man is the Fortune of another; for no man prospers so suddainly as by others Errors. If a man look sharply and accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, he shall see Fortune; for though she be blind, yet she is not invisible.

Therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream lovers of their Country or Masters, were never fortunate, neither can they be.

All wise men, to decline the envy of their own Virtues, use to ascribe them to Providence and Fortune, for so they may the better assume them. And besides, it is greatness in a man, to be the care of the higher Powers—The Poet speaks of Fortune thus,

To attain good Forms, it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth not to despise them, for so shall a man observe them in others; and let him trust himself with the rest. For if he care to express them, he shall lose their grace; which is to be natural and unaffected. Not to use Ceremonies at all, is to teach others not to use them again, and so diminisheth Respect; especially they be not to be omitted to Strangers, and formal Natures. Amongst a man's Peers, a man shall be sure of Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and therefore it is good a little to keep state. Amongst a man's Inferiors one shall be sure of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and therefore it is good a little to be familiar. He that is too much in any thing, so that he giveth another occasion of Society, maketh himself cheap. It is a good Precept generally in seconding another; yet to add somewhat of one's own; as, if you will grant his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, let it be with some distinction; if you will follow his motion, let it be with condition; if you allow his Counsel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let it be with alledging further Reason.

                  <p>IT is generally better to deal by Speech, then by Letter, and by the mediation of a third, then by a man's self; Letters are good when a man would draw an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by Letters back again, or when it may serve for a man's Justification, afterwards to produce his own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or where it may be danger to be interrupted, or heard by pieces. To deal in Person is good, when a mans Face breeds regard; as commonly with Inferiors, or in tender cases, where a mans Eye, upon the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of him with whom one speaketh, may give him a direction how far to go; and generally, where a man will reserve to himself Liberty, either to disavow or to expound. It is better to sound a Person with whom one deal afar off, then to fall upon the Point at first, except you mean to surprise him by some short Question. It is better dealing with men in Appetite, then with those which are where they would be. In choice of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments [for dealing] it is better to chuse men of plainer sort that are like to do that that is committed to them, and to report back again faithfully the Success, then those that are cunning, to contrive out of other mens Business somewhat to grace themselves, and will help the matter in Report for satisfaction sake. All Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is to discover, or to work. Men discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Trust, in Passion, at unawares and of necessity when they would have somewhat done, and cannot find

an apt Pretext. If you would work any man, you must either know his Manner and Fashions, and so lead him or his ends, and so perswade him or his weakness, or disadvantage, and so awe him, and so govern them. In dealing with cunning Persons, we must ever consider their Ends, to interpret their Speeches; and it is good to say little to them, and that which they least look for.</p>

them. Certainly, a little Philosophy inclineth man's mind to Atheism, but depth in Philosophy bringeth men about to Religion. For when the mind of man looketh upon second Causes scattered, sometimes it resteth in them; but when it beholdeth them confederate and knit together, it flyes to Providence and Deity. For it is a thousand times more credible, that four Elements and one immutable fifth Essence, duly and eternally placed need no God, then that an Army of an infinite small Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Seeds unplaced, should have produced this order &amp; Beauty without a divine Marshal. The Scripture saith, <hi>The Fool hath said in his Heart, There is no God:</hi> It is not said, the Fool hath thought in his Heart. So as he rather saith it by roat to himself, as that he would have, then that he can throughly believe it, or to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of it. For none deny there is a God, but those for whom it maketh that there were no God: But in vain doth he strive utterly to alienate or put out that sparkle of our Creation-Light, whereby men acknowledge a Deity, burning still within—Again, whoso laboureth earnestly to prove an Opinion to another, himself di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust it?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> of the West have Names for their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Godds, though they have no Name for God; as if the <hi>Heathen</hi> should have had the Names <hi>Jupiter, Mars, Apllo,</hi> &amp;c. but not the word <hi>Deus,</hi> which shews yet they have the notion, though not the full extent. So that against <hi>Atheists</hi> the most barbarous Savages take part with the subtillest Phylosophers. They that deny a God, destroy man's Nobility: For certainly Man is of kin to the Beast by his Body; and if he be not of kin to God by his Spirit, he is a base and ignoble Creature. It destroys likewise Magnaminity, and the raising of human Nature: For take an example of a Dog, and mark what a generosity and courage he will put on when he finds himself maintained by a man, which to him is instead of a God, or <hi>Melior Natura</hi>; which cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:000447_0219_0FA5B06CCF958850"/>
is manifestly such, as that Creature without that confidence of a better Nature than his own could never attain. So man when he resteth and assureth himself upon divine Protection and Favour, gathereth force and faith, which human Nature in it self could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Therefore as <hi>Atheism</hi> is in all respects hateful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so in this, that it depriveth human Nature of the means to exalt it self above human Frailty.
