            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>NEW-ENGLAND has formerly been a place famous for religion in general, and for family worſhip in particular; but of late, the neglect of this, as well as of other religious duties, has evidently been growing upon us; which has cauſed much grief to pious ſouls: yet I have not heard that any diſcourſe has been publiſhed upon this ſubject here, theſe many years: and as there have lately heen numbers remarkably a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

            <p>THE inſpired author of this epiſtle, having ſpoken of the <hi>living ſtone,</hi> which is <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed indeed of men, but choſen of God, and precious</hi>; on whom the ſaints, <hi>as living ſtones, are built up a ſpiritual houſe</hi>: and having ſhewn that tho' many ſtumbled, and took offence at this glorious rock, yet that he is precious to believers, who are a <hi>peculiar people; that they ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light:</hi> He then proceeds to lay down many inſtructions and exhortations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a right behaviour in their ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and relations; and among the reſt. he ſpeaks particularly to huſbands and wives, concerning how they ought to act towards each other; and gives this as a weighty conſideration to move them to a right walk together, namely, <hi>That your prayers be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010232_0004_0F7DB5D5AFA8B2E8"/>
not hindered:</hi> As if he had ſaid,
<q>You are to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a conſtant trade of <hi>coming</hi> to that <hi>living stone,</hi> and as you are heads of a family, you are daily to practice ſocial worſhip: But if relative duties are neglected, and the adverſary can prevail to make a breach between you, that will have a dreadful ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to hinder your daily united prayers.</q>
For, that <hi>family prayer</hi> is here intended, I think is plain from this conſideration, viz. Injurious treatment, even from near friends, is ſo far from hindering pious ſouls from <hi>perſonal</hi> addreſſes to the throne of grace, that it often makes them more forward and earneſt therein. In the prophet <hi>Micah</hi>'s time, when corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ſo far prevailed, that no faithful friend was to be ſeen, and the caution is given, <hi>Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy boſom</hi>; and when <hi>a man's enemies</hi> were <hi>the men of his own houſe,</hi> then he ſays, <hi>Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my ſalvation: My God will hear me.</hi> Micah vii. 5—7. Thus you may <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e that the ill behaviour of wife or family may excite, inſtead of hindering ſecret prayer. (<hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>For my love, they are my adverſaries: But I give myſelf unto prayer.</hi> Pſal. cix 4.) But there muſt be agreement in order for ſocial worſhip: From whence it appears plain that family prayer is here intended; which I ſhall attempt to ſay ſomething farther upon, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner:
<list>
                  <item>I. I ſhall endeavour to open ſomething of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of prayer in general.</item>
                  <item>II. Produce ſome ſcripture evidences for the daily practice of family prayer in particular.</item>
                  <item>III. Labour to remove ſome hinderances that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010232_0005_0F7DB5D5B74C18F0"/>
ſeem to lie in the way of this duty: And then cloſe with addreſſes to ſeveral ſorts of perſons.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall endeavour to open ſomething of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of prayer in general.</p>
            <p>And I conceive that prayer is the ſoul's approach to God through a glorious Mediator, by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Holy Spirit, to preſent our ſupplications, praiſes, &amp;c. unto him. David calls it a <hi>pouring out our hearts before him.</hi> Pſal. lxii. 8. Which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as comprehending the ſoul's expreſſing its views of him, its regards to him, its deſires of help from him, and its returns of gratitude for favours received. Here obſerve, it is <hi>heart exerciſe.</hi> Many draw near with their mouths, while their hearts are far from God: But the prophet ſays, <hi>With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night; yea, with my ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me will I ſeek thee early.</hi> Iſai. xxvi. 9. And in true prayer, the heart is <hi>poured out</hi>; the inmoſt griefs, burdens and deſires of the ſoul are laid open before God: Sins are confeſſed, wants and miſeries are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, help is requeſted, arguments are uſed of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds: Petitions and requeſts are alſo brought for others, at home and abroad, in all places and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. There is likewiſe in a right performance of this exerciſe, a ſelf dedication and ſurrender of our all unto God: As in Pſal. cxix. 94. <hi>I am thine: Save me, for I have ſought thy precepts.</hi> See alſo Iſai. lxiv. 8, 9. Yea, the very nature of prayer implies in it an engagement to receive and improve what favours the Lord ſhall grant, to his glory, and in a way of conformity to his will. Hence the work of praiſe is twice called by the ſweet pſalmiſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a <hi>paying his vows,</hi> in Pſal. cxvi. and in Pſal. lxi. 4, 5, 8. he
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010232_0006_0F7DB5D6713A7290"/>
ſays, <hi>I will trust in the covert of thy wings, for thou, O God, haſt heard my vows.—So will I ſing praiſe unto thy name forever, that I may daily perform my vows.</hi> Here take good notice, that this duty was not to be performed only once in a year, month or a week; but it was his daily exerciſe; which leads me,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To produce ſome ſcripture evidences for the daily practice of family prayer in particular.</p>
            <p>And the firſt ſhall be taken from our relation to God as his children.</p>
            <p>He is the father of all fleſh, as he gave them their exiſtence, and gives all their enjoyments: And he is the covenant-father in Jeſus Chriſt, to all regenerate ſouls. Now children, eſpecially little ones, as ſaints are often called, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matth. xviii. 3. John xiii. 33. 1 Joh. ii. 1.12, 13. and iv. 4. and v. 21.</note> are bound both by duty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination very often to come to their parents: And as it is not their buſineſs to provide for themſelves, or to be anxious about their future ſupport, but to come to their parents for whatever they need; ſo it is their duty, daily to come for inſtructions about what they ſhould do, and faithfully to obſerve the ſame. And how loudly does this ſpeak forth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of daily prayer? Hence, as our Saviour hath informed us that our Father knows what we need; ſo he has taught us to pray after this manner, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. vi. 9—13.</note> Which words have been very juſtly expounded as a leſſon that
<q>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to draw near to God with all holy reverence and confidence, as children to a father, able and ready to help us, and that we ſhould pray <hi>with</hi> and <hi>for</hi> others.</q>
And that he intended we ſhould come
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010232_0007_0F7DB5D8D85C2138"/>
in <hi>this manner</hi> unto our heavenly father, <hi>every day,</hi> appears exceeding plain from the fourth petition, which is, <hi>Give us</hi> THIS DAY <hi>our daily bread:</hi> For as bread (take it in a natural or ſpiritual ſenſe) is what we need every day, and as it is <hi>the living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy</hi>; <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi. 17.</note> ſo what can we do leſs than to aſk him for what we need, and give him thanks for what we receive? Chriſt does not ſay, give us this week, or this year, but give us <hi>this day</hi> our <hi>daily</hi> bread:—And tho' the father of our ſpirits needs no information about our caſe, yet he will <hi>be enquired of</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ezek. xxxvi. 37.</note> by us:—He will have us own our dependance on him, and our obligations to him. And as we have not only perſonal, but alſo family neceſſities and mercies, and as we are taught to ſay, <hi>Our</hi> father, give <hi>us this</hi> day <hi>our</hi> daily bread, I think the evidence appears very clear from hence for the daily practice of family worſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſpiritual prieſthood of the ſaints will afford further evidence for this duty. Our apoſtle in chap. ii. 5, 9. calls them <hi>a holy,</hi> and <hi>a royal prieſthood</hi>: And John ſtiles them <hi>kings and prieſts unto God.</hi> Rev. i. 6. Now the main buſineſs of the prieſts was to miniſter in God's ſanctuary, and offer ſacrifice upon his altar. Deut. xxxiii. 10. The high prieſt was an eminent type of Jeſus Chriſt, who is now entered, not <hi>into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Heb. ix. 24. All the <hi>levitical</hi> ſacrifees of atonement pointed out that <hi>one offering,</hi> by which he <hi>hath perfected forever them that are ſanctified.</hi> Heb. x. 14. He alone has anſwered
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010232_0008_0F7DB5DA5EF50C80"/>
for all our ſins: But their thank offerings and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will-offerings were a figure of the gracious exerciſes of the ſaints. It is their <hi>reaſonable ſervice</hi> to <hi>preſent their bodies a living ſacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.</hi> Rom. xii. 1. And their liberality is called, <hi>an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable, well-pleaſing to God.</hi> Phil. iv. 18. Heb. xiii. 16. Tho' what comes more directly to our preſent purpoſe, is that their prayers and praiſes are ſo called. David under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them ſo in his day: <hi>Let my prayer</hi> (ſays he) <hi>be ſet forth before thee as incenſe; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening ſacrifice.</hi> Pſal. cxli. 2. And John ſpeaks repeatedly of <hi>odours</hi> and <hi>incenſe</hi> which came <hi>with the prayers of the ſaints.</hi> Rev. v. 8. and viii. 3, 4. Thoſe ſacrifices were to be preſented at God's altar, which ſanctified the gift: Hence the ſacred writer to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in explaining and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the ſpiritual deſign of thoſe ancient cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſays, <hi>We have an altar whereof they have no right to eat, which ſerve the tabernacle.</hi> Heb. xiii. 10. i. e. They that ſtill held to the ſhadow when the ſubſtance was come, by their unbelief excluded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the benefits of this glorious altar, from whence the prayers of all ſaints aſcend up before God.

            <p>Now as he was writing to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> there is abundant reaſon to conclude that in this he has a particular reference to their <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>evening ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi>

for in the firſt appointment thereof, they were told that it was what they ſhould offer upon the altar <hi>day by day continually</hi>; and that it ſhould be a <hi>continual</hi> burnt-offering throughout their generations.

            <p>It might be farther obſerved, that the word <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,</hi> is repeatedly explained by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to mean the ſame as <hi>every day.</hi> Iſai. li. 13. and lii. 5. And it is uſed in three places in ſcripture for perſons daily diet. <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Mephiboſheth, Thou ſhalt eat bread at my table</hi> continually. 2 Sam. ix.. 7. (See alſo 2 King. xxv: 29. Jer. lii. 33.) with which compare Pſal. lv. 17. <hi>Evening and morning, and at noon, will I pray and cry aloud, and he ſhall hear my voice:</hi> By which it appears that his addreſſes to God, were as frequent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as his ſtated meals: and that was according to the divine command in Deut. viii. 10. <hi>When thou haſt eaten, and art full, then thou ſhalt bleſs the Lord thy God, for the good land which he hath given thee.</hi> And the cuſtom of looking to God for a bleſſing on their food was ſo well known in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s time, that the <hi>young maidens</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> and his ſervant met, could tell them concerning <hi>Samuel</hi>'s going up to the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (or feaſt, as the margin reads it) that, <hi>The people will not eat until he come, becauſe he doth bleſs the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and afterwards they eat that be bidden.</hi> 1 Sam ix. 13. Which cuſtom we have ſo fully confirmed by
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010232_0010_0F7DB5DBC5DC3E80"/>
the example of our Lord and Maſter, that we have the accounts of his practiſing of it, mentioned in no leſs than ſeven places by the evangeliſts;<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. xiv. 19. and xv. 36. Mar. vi. 41. and viii. 6, 7. Luke ix. 16. John vi. 11, 23.</note> and the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> not only imitated this example of his divine maſter,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts xxvii. 35.</note> but alſo declares, that the meats which ſeducers would command men to abſtain from, <hi>God hath created to be received with thankſgiving of them which believe and know the truth: for</hi> (ſays he) <hi>every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refuſed, if it be received with thankſgiving: for it is ſanctified by the word of God, and prayer.</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 3—5. What can be plainer than this is to ſhew that we ought to practice prayer to God that he would <hi>ſanctify</hi> our food to us when we partake of it, and give thanks to him for it. Nay the language of the text plainly ſhews that we have no right to receive the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without <hi>thankſgiving:</hi> for the apoſtle holds forth that God created them for that end, namely, <hi>to be received with thankſgiving</hi>: and he ſays, that nothing is to be refuſed, IF <hi>it be received with thankſgiving</hi>: q. d. They are all God's creatures, and we have no right to any of them without leave: well they are <hi>ſanctified by the word of God and prayer</hi>; i. e. the word gives us war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to receive them in the way of prayer for a bleſſing on them, and thankſgiving for them; and in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. For if we take them without this, what do we better than pilfering or robbing; as God charged the <hi>Jews</hi> with doing of old, <hi>Ye have robbed me, even this whole nation, therefore they had a curſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on their bleſſings, becauſe they would not lay it to heart to give glory to</hi> God<hi>'s name.</hi> Mal. ii. 2. and iii. 9.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010232_0011_0F7DB5DC712711A0"/>
This duty was ſo well known in the primitive times of chriſtianity, that Paul founds his argument upon it, and gives it as a good reaſon why the weak belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who ſtill thought ſome meats to be unclean, ſhould not judge him that believed they were clean, and ſo partook of them, viz. becauſe, <hi>he that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks.</hi> Rom. xiv. 6. By which it is plain that he did not ſuppoſe that any believer would eat of God's good creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving him thanks. To the ſame purpoſe he ſpeaks to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when he aſks, <hi>Why am I evil ſpoken of for that for which I give thanks?</hi> And then adds this command, <hi>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> 1 Cor. x. 30, 31. Should any ſay, that we may give thanks in our hearts, when it is not openly expreſſed, I readily grant it; yet where a number make a meal together, out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ought to ſpeak; and they muſt have ſtrange notions indeed, who can hold that all theſe ſcripture inſtructions and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples refer only to the ſecret exerciſes of the heart!</p>
            <p>Thus by the way I thought it proper to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the right manner of receiving our food. Our</p>
            <p n="3">3. Evidence for family prayer, ſhall be drawn from ancient example. The Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was called of God out of his own country, into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; his heavenly friend firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in the plain of <hi>Moreh,</hi> and there he builded an altar to him. Then he removed to the Eaſt of <hi>Bethel,</hi> and there built another, <hi>and called upon the name of the Lord.</hi> The like he did at <hi>Hebron:</hi> and ſo did <hi>Iſaac</hi> at <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> both ar <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:010232_0012_0F7DB5DEECB213E0"/>
and <hi>Bethel.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. xii 7, 8. and xiii. 18. and xxxiii. 20. and xxxv. 7.</note> Thus theſe three eminent fathers, as they removed from place to place, in the place where they pitched their tents, and where their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies dwelt, there they erected altars, and called on the name of the Lord: which ſpeaks forth family prayer ſtrongly indeed. And that <hi>David</hi> did the like, ſeems to be clear from Pſal. cxli. 2. So did our Lord with his diſciples. Luk. xi. 1. Theſe are ſome of the <hi>footſteps of the flock,</hi> which we are directed to <hi>go forth by.</hi> Sol. Song i. 8. To which we may add,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That many poſitive precepts, which we have in the New-Teſtament, plainly include family prayer; ſuch as that, <hi>Pray without ceaſing: In every thing give thanks; for this is the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus, concerning you</hi> 1 Theſ. v. 17, 18 And that in Eph. vi. 18. <hi>Praying always with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and ſupplication for all ſaints.</hi> None will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that to <hi>pray without ceaſing,</hi> and to <hi>pray always,</hi> intends that we ſhould do nothing elſe but pray; yet ſurely it implies the <hi>daily</hi> practice thereof: And we are here expreſly required to give thanks, not only for ſome things, or upon ſome occaſions, but <hi>in every thing</hi>; which muſt include family favours as well as others: yea, we are commanded to pray <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> with <hi>all prayer</hi>; and who dare ſay, that <hi>all prayer</hi> does not intend family prayer, as well as that which is ſecret, and that which is public? And theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are to be obſerved, not only for a ſeaſon; but we are required to <hi>watch</hi> thereunto with <hi>all perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi> Other paſſages might be mentioned to the ſame purpoſe; but I ſhall omit them, and haſten to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010232_0013_0F7DB5E005349C70"/>5. And laſtly, That this exerciſe is one character by which God's people are diſtinguiſhed from all others. When the prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> would diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the <hi>Heathen,</hi> which knew not God, from his people, he marks them out by this, that they were <hi>families</hi> that <hi>called not on God's name.</hi> Jer. x. 25.— Here let none miſtake, and think that an external obſervation of this duty is enough. Men may do that, and yet be in a miſerable ſtate: but it is with this, as it is with morality; though a perſon may have outward morality without ſaving grace, yet an immoral man is a wicked man: So here, they may pray in their families and cloſets too, whoſe hearts are not right with God; but prayerleſs families are called <hi>heathen</hi> families.</p>
            <p>Thus I have touched upon ſome of the evidences from ſcripture, that we have for this practice, which are ſo plain, that it may well ſeem ſtrange that any, who hold to the ſcriptures, ſhould neglect it; but ſince many do, I ſhall proceed,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To labour to remove ſome hinderances that ſeem to lie in the way of this duty. And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, I have known ſome who would allow that family prayer was a good cuſtom enough, but deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there being any command for it. But if Chriſt has required us to come with the language of <hi>Our father,</hi>—to aſk that he would give us <hi>this day our daily bread,</hi> which ſo ſtrongly implies that we ſhould come thus <hi>every day</hi>; and if we are commanded to offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God <hi>continually,</hi> which word is ſo often uſed for the morning and evening ſacrifice; and if <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced calling on the name of the Lord, wherever their
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010232_0014_0F7DB5E03B7ABAF8"/>
families dwelt; if <hi>David,</hi> and alſo Chriſt himſelf did the like; are we commanded to pray <hi>alway,</hi> with <hi>all prayer,</hi> and are huſbands and wives required to walk ſo together that their prayers may not be hindered; and have we ſo many precepts and examples for this exerciſe at meal-times; and are ſuch called heathen families, that call not on God's name, (as has been proved above) what would mortals deſire more to prove to them that God requires them thus to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? Should any (to evade the force of this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) ſay, That theſe prieſts, altars and ſacrifices that have been ſo often mentioned, refer to old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, that have been long out of date: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, I would deſire to aſk ſuch perſons a few queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.—Were not thoſe ancient ceremonies of God's appointment? And had he not ſome wiſe deſign therein? Were they not ſhadows of good things to come? Yea, and were they not a part of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that were written for <hi>our learning</hi>? Where is the chriſtian that dare deny theſe things? Surely then, inſtead of diſregarding of them, we ought to give the <hi>more earneſt heed</hi> to theſe things which were firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by ſuch lively figures, and that have been ſo clearly explained to us in the new-teſtament. But,</p>
            <p>I ſhall come, ſecondly, to that which I take to be the greateſt hinderance of this duty, and that is, <hi>the want of a frame and inclination for it.</hi> "Prayer (ſay many) ſhould be heart exerciſe, and when the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites hearts were not right with God,</hi> their prayers were looked upon as <hi>flatteries</hi> and <hi>lies.</hi>" Pſal. lxxviii. 36, 37. But is it not ſtrange that thoſe ſinners <hi>crimes</hi> are now brought for others <hi>excuſe</hi>? They <hi>refuſed to walk in</hi> God's <hi>law</hi>; and inſtead of taking a thankful no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010232_0015_0F7DB5E149056708"/>
of his dealings, they <hi>forgot his works, and his wonders that he had ſhewed them.</hi> Ver. 10, 11. And inſtead of ſeeking to him for their food, they rather queſtioned whether he was able to ſupply them or not: they ſaid, <hi>Can God furniſh a table in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs?</hi> ver. 19. And when he had given them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evidence of his power and goodneſs, and alſo ſome awful rebukes for their wickedneſs; yet, <hi>for all this, they ſinned ſtill: and believed not for all his wondrous works.</hi> Ver. 32. They ſtood it out 'till death ſtared them in the face, and then they would pray. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him.</hi> Ver. 34. This is the old way that wicked men have trodden. And, O ſoul, doſt thou chuſe their path! They, it ſeems, would not mock God while they thought they could do without him: no, then they <hi>turned their back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and not their face: but in the time of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they will ſay, Ariſe and ſave us</hi>! Jer. ii. 27.</p>
            <p>One dreadful ingredient in this excuſe, is, making our own inclination, inſtead of the divine precept, our rule: for though the command is to <hi>pray always with all prayer,</hi> yet the import of this objection is, "Becauſe I have not an inclination to ſuch exerciſes, therefore I am excuſed from regarding of them." Horrid excuſe with a witneſs! Yet horrid as it is, a great deal of pains has been taken to dreſs it up, ſo that its odiouſneſs may not appear. Some will plead that ſaints are called to liberty; but that to pray when they have not freedom of mind for it, would be to work under a yoke of bondage: but ſuch greatly miſtake the nature of the ſaints liberty, a great part of which, is their open acceſs to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through Jeſus Chriſt, in all their wants. Eph.

ii. 18. Heb. iv. 16. <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come. Iniquities prevail againſt me: as for our tranſgreſſions, thou ſhalt purge them away.</hi> Pſal. lxv. 2, 3. Here note well, that what many bring as an excuſe to keep away, he takes as an errand to come upon: q. d.
<q>I find riſing corruptions, and wrong diſpoſitions to be too ſtrong for me; therefore I come to thee, who art able and ready, both to pardon, and alſo to ſubdue them all.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">See alſo Micah vii. 19. &amp; 1 Joh. i 9.</note> Our Saviour often bids us <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> that we enter not into temptation: but this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe would rather teach us to yield to temptation, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when we are <hi>drawn away of our own luſts, and enticed.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Jam. i. 14.</note> Little do many ſee where this would lead them to. <note n="*" place="bottom">I once met with a man who ſoon began to talk of the great liberty that he ſaid ſaints were coming into, and not to go on in ſuch bondage as they uſed to do, that they muſt pray in their families night and morning, let them feel how they would: but ſaid he,
<q>When I get up in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if I feel a ſpirit of prayer, I will pray in my family; if not, God does not call me to pray then, &amp;c.</q>
and ſo ſpake much about <hi>liberty,</hi> which ſoon brought to my mind that paſſage in 2 Pet. ii. 19. And it was not long after, before that <hi>liberty</hi> lead him into baſe company, and to ſwear, cheat and lie, and he became one of the worſt of men.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Others will plead that this inſiſting upon daily prayer, will build people up upon works. But to this, it may be replied, that though there is a great propenſity in mankind, like the Phariſee, to bring in an account of what they have done; and like the Jews of old, to think to <hi>exact</hi> of God, pay for all their <hi>labour</hi>; <note n="‖" place="bottom">Luk. xviii. Iſai. lvii. 3.</note> yet the true nature of prayer, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010232_0017_0F7DB5E4D0539C78"/>
contrary to any ſuch thing. Prayer is for a needy creature to come to God for what it wants, and thank him for what it receives: and ſurely there is a great difference between a guilty or miſerable creature that comes to <hi>beg</hi> for pardon and help, and a merchant that comes with his goods to <hi>trade</hi> for more. The <hi>beggar,</hi> the more deſtitute he finds himſelf, the more earneſt and inceſſant are his cries: but the <hi>trader,</hi> if his goods fail, he draws off 'till he can get more. And <hi>Mary</hi> ſays, that the Lord <hi>hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath ſent empty away</hi> Luk. i. 53. Hence it appears that this very plea ſprings from a proud, ſelf-righteous diſpoſition. It implies as much as this, that if I feel in a good frame of mind, and have ſomething that is good to bring, then I will come, and if not, I will ſtay away. David once got into ſuch a frame that he <hi>kept ſilence,</hi> 'till God's hand was ſo heavy upon him that he could hold in no longer; then he confeſſed his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Lord forgave his ſins: and he adds, <hi>for this ſhall every one that is godly, pray unto him.</hi> Pſal. xxxii. 3—6. But leaſt any ſhould imagine that this was the right way to hold in 'till they were thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowered, he proceeds to ſay, <hi>I will inſtruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou ſhalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye: be ye not as the horſe, or as the mule which have no underſtanding: whoſe mouth muſt be held in with bit and bridle,</hi> ver. 8, 9. Which plainly ſhews that this keeping <hi>ſilence,</hi> and holding back 'till we are overcome, is acting more like ſtupid beaſts, than like rational ſouls, who have a father in heaven, who is able and ready to ſupply all our wants. The regard that he ſhews to the prayer of the deſtitute, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010232_0018_0F7DB5E5A9F31ED8"/>
to the cry of the publican, may well encourage nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy creatures to come to him. Pſal. cii. 17. Luk. xviii. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>A juſt view of our ſtanding before God, and of our obligations to him, would ſilence a thouſand ſuch objections: for we cannot <hi>live, move,</hi> nor draw a <hi>breath</hi> without him, whether we acknowledge it or not; and <hi>all things are naked, and opened unto</hi> his <hi>eyes.</hi>

leſs than ſixteen times in this paſſage, in a ſenſe that aſcribes all his enjoyments and performances to God, both temporal and ſpiritual: yea he ſpeaks of it with thankful wonder, that they ſhould be <hi>able</hi> to offer ſo <hi>willingly</hi> as well as that they ſhould be allowed to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſo many of their maſter's goods, and lay them at his feet; <hi>for,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of thine own have we given thee.</hi> This is a pattern worthy of our moſt conſtant regard.

If ſo, pray then review the caſe again, and in the fear of God, ſearch his word, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well if there is not as plain evidence for it, both by precept and example, as there is for almoſt any point of chriſtian practice. And conſider alſo, if it is not our <hi>reaſonable ſervice,</hi> that we <hi>ſhould ſeek the Lord,</hi> and that daily, ſince it is <hi>in him we live, move, and have our being</hi>; <note n="‡" place="bottom">Act. 27, 28.</note> yea, and whether ſuch as neglect it,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010232_0021_0F7DB5E7DDA6E970"/>
don't act more abſurdly than irrational animals: for we are told, that the <hi>young lions roar after their prey, and ſeek their meat from God:</hi> and that, <hi>He giveth to the beaſt his food, and the young ravens that cry.</hi> Pſal. civ. 21. and cxlvii. 9. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is your neglect owing to a want of a diſpoſition to ſuch exerciſes? Surely the thought of that might well alarm thy ſoul; <hi>for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> It is a great truth, that God is a ſpirit, and is to be worſhiped ſpiritually; yet this truth is held in unrighteouſneſs, while it is held as an excuſe from our daily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements of his favours: <hi>for</hi> (ſays the apoſtle) <hi>the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power, and God-head; ſo that they are without excuſe: becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, NEITHER WERE THANK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FUL.</hi> Rom. i. 18, 20, 21. And the following part of the chapter, ſhews, that <hi>for this cauſe</hi> they were given up to the moſt amazing blindneſs, and awful abominations that mortals ever knew. Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doſt thou alledge the ill behaviour of any that practice family prayer, as an excuſe for thine neglect, as I have known ſome to do? Methinks thou wilt be aſhamed, in open daily light, to ſtand in this one minute. Who ever acted more abominably about prayer, than the <hi>Phariſees</hi>? Yet how far was that from hindering the abundant practice of it by Chriſt and his followers?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is this neglect cauſed by things being out of order in thy family? O then reſt not without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010232_0022_0F7DB5E899856AB0"/>
thoſe diſorders rectified: for a family that will not admit of the worſhip of God in it, muſt be a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place; and one may juſtly ſay of it, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi, O my ſoul, come not thou into their ſecret: unto</hi> ſuch a family, <hi>mine honour be not thou united. Joſhua</hi>'s reſolution with regard to himſelf and family, deſerves our warmeſt regard. <hi>As for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Joſh. xxiv. 15. Nor is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s example leſs worthy of notice. When he ſet up houſe-keeping, inſtead of letting in vanity and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as many do, he invites God home with him, ſaying, <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my houſe with a perfect heart: I will ſet no wicked thing before mine eyes.</hi> Pſal. ci. 2, 3. But doſt thou ſay, I have no gracious perſons in my houſe to join with me? That is indeed a ſorrowful caſe; yet, as our warrant for ſocial worſhip depends not on our cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowing that we have gracious ſouls preſent with us, and as all are God's creatures, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der manifold obligations to acknowledge him, we may boldly come to the throne of grace, where the general aſſembly of the firſt born, which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heaven, all meet; and may there preſent our praiſes and requeſts. Heb. iv. 16. and xii. 22—24.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Do any excuſe themſelves becauſe of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their gifts? I would only aſk ſuch, whether that prevented them from coming in their childhood to their earthly parents for what they wanted? if not, then why ſhould it hinder us from coming to him who knoweth what we have need of before we aſk him? Mat. vi. 8.</p>
            <p>Before I take my leave of you who profeſs religion, and yet neglect the daily practice of ſocial worſhip.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010232_0023_0F7DB5E96F20F100"/>
I would earneſtly deſire you to view the inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that there is between your profeſſion and practice. It is generally allowed, that a leading point in the profeſſion of chriſtianity, is the ordinance of baptiſm, notwithſtanding men's different judgments about the time and manner of adminiſtering of it. And thoſe who hold to infant baptiſm, often bring this as a great argument therefor, viz. That their children will be <hi>heathens</hi> if they are not baptized: while ſome others can hardly look upon any to be <hi>christians</hi> that have not been baptized by immerſion. Now, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, art thou of either of theſe ſentiments, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency can there be between thy profeſſion and thy conduct? If of the former, then how canſt thou prove that thy family are <hi>chriſtians,</hi> when they have the very badge of <hi>heatheniſm</hi> that the prophet diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes them by? And if thou art of the latter ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, how can thy character be any better ſecured, while ſo important an article of chriſtian behaviour is neglected. Baptiſm is a <hi>putting on Chriſt,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an engagement to <hi>walk in newneſs of life.</hi> Rom. vi. 4. But if we think that one act, without living ſuch a life, will anſwer, ſhall find ourſelves greatly miſtaken. No doubt but thou wilt find that many outward difficulties, and inward ſtruggles will riſe againſt prayer; as well as other duties: but if you will neglect them becauſe of that, I leave you to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to him, who has ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever doth not hear his croſs, and come after me, CANNOT be my diſciple.</hi> Luk. xiv. 27.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I would ſay a few words to them that practice family worſhip: and my addreſs to you ſhall be by way of advice and exhortation. And,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:010232_0024_0F7DB5E9F173E598"/>1. Reſt not in the mere external performances of this duty. <hi>James</hi> tells us that while many receive not, becauſe they aſk not; others aſk, and receive not, becauſe they aſk amiſs, that they may conſume it upon their luſts; and he ſays, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</hi> And among other things which he advances on this ſubject, he brings in the example of <hi>Elias,</hi> who though a man of like paſſions with us, yet he prayed <hi>earneſtly,</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly obtained his requeſt. He prayed <hi>earneſtly,</hi> or as it is in the margin, <hi>He prayed in his prayer.</hi> Jam. iv. 2, 3, 6. and v. 17, 18. So, my friends, if we pray in our prayers, we ſhall find it not to be in vain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take good heed to your walk. Obedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will come to their parents, not only for food, but for inſtruction about what they ſhould do, and will be as much concerned to obey their commands, as to obtain their help. So ſays our apoſtle, <hi>As obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children, not faſhioning yourſelves according to the former luſts</hi> in <hi>your ignorance: but as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And as many are ready to catch hold of any evil behaviour that they can diſcover in any who profeſs this, as well as other duties of religion, that they neglect, as an excuſe for them: So he tells us, it <hi>is the will of God, that with well doing, ye put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 14, 15. and ii. 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Content not thy ſelf with family prayer alone. We are to pray always with all prayer, and watch thereunto with all perſeverance. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Beware of turning back from theſe ways; for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010232_0025_0F7DB5ED382CC878"/>
if any man draw back, Chriſt's ſoul will have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in him: which is ſet in a very ſtriking light in the 81ſt Pſalm, where God reminds his people of the wonders which he had done for them, and ſays, <hi>Thou calledſt in trouble, and I delivered thee.—Hear, O my people, and I will teſtify unto thee:—There ſhall no ſtrange god be in thee; I am the Lord thy God:— open thy mouth wide and I will fill it.</hi> As if he had ſaid,
<q>Thou haſt found me to be a God hearing prayer, and I am ever the ſame; therefore regard no others, but open thy mouth wide, enlarge thy deſires to me as much as thou wilt, and I will fill them.</q>
But inſtead of continuing their regard to him, he goes on to ſay, <hi>my people would not hearken to my voice; and Iſrael would none of me, ſo I gave them up unto their own hearts luſts; and they walked in their own counſels.</hi> v. 7, 12. O tremendous caſe! to be given up to one's hearts luſts is one of the greateſt judgments on this ſide of hell. What need have we then to cry daily, <hi>lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil!</hi> My</p>
            <p n="3">III. Addreſs ſhall be to young perſons. And what I have at preſent to ſay to ſuch is, learn the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of ſetting out, as well as travelling through the world with God. This was the way that the firſt man took who got to heaven without ſeeing death. <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. v, 24.</note> And this is the command of our divine Lord, <hi>Seek ye</hi> FIRST <hi>the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> Matth. vi. 33. To the ſame purpoſe is the language of <hi>David,</hi> to you; <hi>Come,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ye children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What man is he that deſireth life, and loveth many days, that he may ſee good?
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010232_0026_0F7DB5EDE5867DB8"/>
Depart from evil,</hi> &amp;c. Pſa. xxxiv. 11, 12. Take heed, dear youth! you are called upon from two very different quarters: Satan promiſes you the kingdoms and glories of this world, if you will take his ways of deceit, vanity, and iniquity: and on the other hand, here are theſe calls from heaven to chuſe the way of truth and holineſe, and the promiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon of all bleſſings, both in this life, and that which is to come: and which wilt thou believe? which wilt thou regard? As ſurely as God ſpeaks true, the way to enjoy <hi>good days</hi> here, is to walk in the way of truth, peace, and holineſs; and every ſoul which yields to the contrary inticements, practically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that God is a liar, and that the Devil is to be believed before him!—Be aſtoniſhed, O heavens, at this!—What conduct can be more abſurd, than for a creature, who wants to enjoy the good things of the Creator, to take a courſe of contrariety to him-to obtain them? And, in particular, for one that wants an agreeable companion, and to get comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſettled in the world, to give himſelf up to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and iniquity then, even more than at other times. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>A prudent wife is from the Lord.</hi> Prov. xix. 14. How then can any expect to obtain ſuch an one in a way of diſregard to him?<note n="*" place="bottom">This matter is ſet in a clear and ingenious light, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tract, entitled, <hi>The advantages and diſadvantages of the marriage ſtate, as entered into with religious or irreligious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; repreſented under the ſimilitude of a dream.</hi> By Mr. <hi>John Johnſon.</hi> Which has been printed both at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Boſton.</hi>
               </note> Thoſe who take ſuch a courſe, do what they can, as it were, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Divine Being to <hi>hedge up their way with thorns</hi>; and ſtrip them of their enjoyments, in order
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010232_0027_0F7DB5EE733B6310"/>
to bring them to a right ſenſe of things. Hoſ. ii. 6—15. Or elſe to let them have the <hi>waters of a full cup,</hi> and an <hi>increaſe in riches,</hi> for a little ſpace, until they <hi>ſtip into deſtruction in a moment,</hi> and are <hi>conſumed with terrors.</hi> Pſal lxxiii. 10, 12, 18, 19. You would pity a ſlave, or criminal, that was obliged to labour all day to collect a <hi>bed of thorns</hi> to lie down upon it at night; or to gather a large quantity of <hi>fuel</hi> for <hi>his own burning:</hi> Yet this is the ſinner's own choice; whilſt he hardens his heart againſt God, and abuſeth his goodneſs, he is ſpending his life in <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> Rom. ii. 4, 5. O! how different from this, is the caſe of an old grey-headed ſaint, who can appeal to God that he has been his <hi>truſt from his youth,</hi> and that he has gone in his ſtrength, and truſted in his righteouſneſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Pſal. lxxi. 5, 16, 18. And can ſay, when the time of his departure is at hand,
<q>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe.—Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the Lord the righteous judge ſhall give me in that day.</q>
2 Tim. iv. 6—8. This is a happineſs worth ſtriving for indeed!</p>
            <p>And as every ſoul is purſuing after happineſs, tho' moſt of the children of men take the way that leads directly from it; therefore take a brief deſcription of a truly happy man, in the following lines, with which I ſhall conclude.</p>
