            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE I have been so repeatedly charged by Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> with indecent and injurious Treatment of Mr. <hi>STODDARD</hi> (whom doubtless I ought to treat with much Respect) I may expect, from what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Disposition this Way, to be charged with ill Treatment of <hi>Him</hi> too. I desire therefore that it may be justly considered by the Reader, what is, and what is not, injurious or unhandsome Treatment of an Author in a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy. And here I would crave Leave to say, that I humbly conceive, a Distinction ought to be made between opposing &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing a <hi>Cause,</hi> or the <hi>Arguments</hi> used to defend it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching <hi>Persons.</hi> He is a weak Writer indeed, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to confute an Opinion, but dares not expose the Nakedness and Absurdity of it, nor the Weakness or Inconsistence of the Methods taken and Arguments used by any to maintain it, for fear he should be guilty of speaking Evil of these Things, and be charged with reproaching Them. If an Antagonist is angry at this, he thereby gives his Readers too much Occasion of Suspicion towards himself, as chargeable with Weakness, or Bitterness.</p>
            <p>I therefore now give Notice, that I have taken full Liberty in this Respect; only endeavouring to avoid pointed and exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating Expressions. If to set forth what I suppose to be the true Absurdity of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Scheme, or any Part of it, that it may be viewed justly in all it's Nakedness; withal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the <hi>Weakness</hi> of the Defence he has made, not fearing to shew <hi>wherein</hi> it is weak, and how the Badness of his <hi>Cause</hi> obliges him to be <hi>inconsistent</hi> with himself, inconsistent with his own professed Principles in Religion, and with Things conceded
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:006839_0003_102A65CE5CDCF638"/>
and asserted by him in the Book especially under Consideration; and declaring particularly wherein I think his Arguments fail, whether it be in <hi>begging the Question,</hi> or being impertinent and <hi>beside</hi> the Question, or arguing in Effect against himself; also observing wherein Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has made <hi>Misrepresentations</hi> of Words or Things; I say, if to do these Things be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Him,</hi> and injurious Treatment of Him then I have injured Him.— But I think I should be foolish, if I were afraid to do <hi>that</hi> (and to do it as thoroughly as I can) <hi>which must be the Design</hi> of my Writing, if I write at all in Opposition to his Tenets, and to the Defence he makes of them.</p>
            <p>Indeed if I misrepresent what he says, in order to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the worst Colours; altering his Words to another Sense, to make them appear more ridiculous; or adding other Words, that carry the Sense beyond the proper Import of his Words, to heighten the supposed Absurdity, and give me greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to exclaim; if I set my self to aggravate Matters, and strain them beyond Bounds, making mighty Things of meer Trifles; or if I use Exclamations and Invectives, instead of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; then Mr. <hi>W.</hi> might have just Cause to complain, and the Reader would have just Reason for Disgust. But whether I have done so, or not, must be judged by the Reader; of whom I desire nothing more than the most impartial and exact Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Merits of the Cause, and Examination of the Force and Weight of every Argument. I desire, that no bitter reproachful Invectives, no vehement Exclamations, no superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious assuming Words and Phrases may be taken for Reasoning, on either Side. If the Reader thinks he finds any such in what I have written, I am willing he should set 'em aside as nothing worth; carefully distinguishing between them, and the Strength of the Argument. I desire not, that the Cause should be judged of by the Skill which either Mr. <hi>W.</hi> or <hi>I</hi> do manifest, in fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one at another.</p>
            <p>If in Places where the Argument pinches most, and there is the greatest Appearance of strong Reason, in Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Book, I do (as some other Disputants) instead of entring thoro'ly into the Matter, begin to flounce and fling, and go about to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and drown the Reader's Attention to the Argument, by the Noise of big Words, or magisterial and disdainful Expressions; let the Reader take it (as justly he may) for a shrewd Sign of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Consciousness of the Weakness of my Cause in that Particular, or at least of a Distrust of my own Ability to defend my self well in the Reader's Apprehension, and to come off with a good Grace any other Way.</p>
            <p>In this Case, I shall not think it any Injustice done me by the Reader, tho' he suspects that I feel my self press'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and begin to be in Trouble, for fear I should not seem to come off like a Champion, if I should trust to meer Reasoning. I can uprightly say, I never have endeavour'd by such Means to evade a proper Consideration of any Part of Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Reasoning; nor have designedly contrived, in this or any other Method, to free my self from the Trouble of a just Answer to any Thing material in his Book; and I have been especially careful to speak most particularly to the main Parts of his Scheme, and such of his Reasonings, as I could suppose those of his Readers who are on his Side, would be most likely to have their chief Dependance on, and to think most difficult to be answered.</p>
            <p>With Regard to my <hi>Method</hi> in this Reply, I judged it most convenient to reduce my Remarks on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Principles, and the Parts of his Scheme, and Kinds of Arguing, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly appear in various Parts of his Book, to their <hi>proper Heads.</hi> I thought, this tended to give the Reader a clearer and more comprehensive View of the whole Controversy, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Arguments made Use of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it also would make my Work the Shorter. For, otherwise, I must have had the same Things, or Things of the same Nature, to have observ'd often, as I found them repeated in different Parts of his Book, and the same Remarks to make over and over again.—And that the Reader mayn't be without any Advantages which he might have had in the other Method, of keeping, in my Reply, to the Order in which Things lie in the Book replied to, following my Author from one Page and Paragraph to another, I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore subjoined a <hi>Table,</hi> by which the Reader may readily turn to what is said on each Particular, that is wont to be brought into this Debate, on one Side or the other.</p>
            <p>With Regard to my <hi>Citations</hi> from Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Book, I have never designedly altered his Words: And where I have for Brevity's sake referred to any Sentiment of his, without citing the Words at Large, I have used Care not to change or heighten the Sense, or in any Respect to vary from the just Import
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:006839_0005_102A65D2E22DF060"/>
of what he delivers. And that the Reader may himself more easily and readily judge of the Fairness of my Citations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, I have mentioned the <hi>Page,</hi> and the <hi>Part</hi> of the Page, where the Thing referd to is to be found: Supposing each Page to be divided into five equal Parts, I have noted the several Parts of the Page by the Letters <hi>a. b. c. d. e.</hi> So that when I have refer'd to the <hi>Top</hi> of the Page, or the first fifth Part of it, I have mentioned the Number of the Page, and added the Letter <hi>a.</hi> to the Number: And if the <hi>Middle,</hi> or third fifth Part, then I have added the Letter <hi>c.</hi>—and so of the rest, as the Reader will see. I have ever done thus, unless the Thing refer'd to is to be found through the Whole or great Part of the Page. I have also done the same very often, where I have Occasion to cite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors. Only when I have <hi>before</hi> quoted the same Thing, I am not always so exact and particular in noting the Place again, in my <hi>second</hi> Quotation or Reference.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. <hi>Williams</hi> asserts it to be my profess'd and declared <hi>Design,</hi> in writing the Book, which he has undertaken an Answer to, to oppose Mr. STODDARD. He has taken a great Liberty in this Matter. He charges Me with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Design of writing in Opposition to Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> no less than nine or ten Times in his Book. And he don't content himself meerly with saying, there are Passages in my Preface, or elsewhere, whence this may be <hi>infer'd</hi>; but he says expresly, That <hi>I profess to be disputing against Mr.</hi> Stoddard<hi>'s Doctrine.</hi> P. 14. <hi>d.</hi>—That I <hi>tell my Readers, I am disputing against Mr.</hi> Stoddard<hi>'s Question.</hi> P. 37. <hi>d.</hi>—That I <hi>tell 'em so in my Preface,</hi> P. 107. <hi>d.</hi>—That I <hi>often declare
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006839_0007_102A65D70567E940"/>
that I am opposing Mr.</hi> Stoddard<hi>'s Opinion,</hi> P 132. <hi>d.</hi>— And on this Foundation he charges Me with <hi>blotting a great Deal of Paper, disserving the Cause of Truth by changing the Question, and putting it in such Terms as Mr.</hi> S. <hi>expresly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims, and then confuting it as Mr.</hi> S—d<hi>'s Principle; unfair Treatment of Mr.</hi> S. P. 2. <hi>d. e.— surprizingly going off from Mr.</hi> S—d<hi>'s Argument to cast an Odium upon it, treating Mr.</hi> S. <hi>and his Doctrine in such a Manner as to reproach Him and his Principles, tending to render them odious to the unthinking Multitude,</hi> and <hi>telling a manifest Untruth.</hi> P. 14. <hi>d.</hi> &amp; 15. <hi>c. d.</hi> Whereas, I never once signified it to be the Thing I aim'd at, to oppose Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> or appear as <hi>his</hi> Antagonist. But the very Reverse was true; and meddling with Him, or what he had said, I studied to avoid, as much as the Circumstances of the Debate with my People would allow, who had been taught by Him, and who so greatly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually alledged against Me the Things which He had said. Nor is there any Appearance in those Passages Mr. <hi>W.</hi> cites from my Preface, as tho' this was the Thing I sought or aim'd at. Nay, one of those Passages which he produces to prove it, shews the contrary: as it shews, that its being so (as I supposed) that what I wrote was not consistent with, but opposite to what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had maintain'd, was an unsought for and unpleasing Circumstance of that Publication. My Words are,
<q>'Tis far from a pleasing Circumstance of this Publication, that 'tis against what my honoured Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father strenuously maintain'd, both from the Pulpit and the Press.</q>
Certainly my <hi>regretting</hi> and <hi>excusing</hi> such an unavoidable Circumstance was a Thing exceeding diverse from giving Notice to the World, that the Thing I aim'd at was to set myself up as Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Antagonist, and to write an Answer to, and confute what he had written. It will, at first Sight, be manifest to every impartial Reader, that the Design of my <hi>Preface</hi> was not to state the Subject and Intention of the Book: This is done professedly, and very particularly, afterwards, in the first Part of the Essay itself. And if I might have common Justice, surely I might be allowed to tell my own Opinion, and declare my own Design, without being so confidently &amp; frequently charged with <hi>misrepresenting</hi> my own Thoughts and Intentions.</p>

                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:006839_0008_102A65DD9D82B3E8"/>The very <hi>Nature of the Case</hi> is such as must lead every impartial Person to a Conviction, that the Design of my Writing must be to defend my self, in that Controversy, which I had with my People at <hi>Northampton</hi>; as it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and publickly known, that <hi>That Controversy</hi> was the Occasion of my Writing; and that therefore my Business must be to defend that Opinion or Position of <hi>mine</hi> which I had declared to them, which had been the Occasion of the Controversy, and so the grand Subject of Debate between us; whether this were exactly agreable to any Words that might be found in Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Writings on the Subject, or not. Now this Opinion or Position was the same with that which I express'd in the first Part of my Book. In such Terms I express'd my self to the Committee of the Church, when I first made that Declaration of my Opinion, which was the Beginning of the Controversy, and when writing in Defence of my Opinion was first proposed: And this was the Point continually talked of in all Conversation at <hi>Northampton,</hi> for more than two Years, even 'till Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Book came out. The Controversy was, <hi>Whether there was any Need of making a credible Profession of Godliness, in Order to Person's being admitted to full Communion; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they must profess saving Faith, or whether a Profession of common Faith were not sufficient; whether Persons must be esteemed truly godly, and must be taken in under that Notion, or whether if they appear'd morally sincere, that were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?</hi> And when my Book came abroad, there was no Objection made, that I had not truly express'd the Subject of Debate, in my stating the Question: But the Subject of Debate afterwards, in Parish-Meetings, Church-Meetings, and in all Conversation, was the Question laid down in my Book. No Suggestion among them, that the Profession Persons made in Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Way, was taken as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fession of <hi>real</hi> Godliness, or Gospel-Holiness; or that they were taken in <hi>under a Notion of their being truly pious Persons,</hi> as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would have it: No Suggestion, that the Dispute was only about the <hi>Degree of Evidence.</hi> But the Dispute was, What was the Thing to be made <hi>evident</hi>; whether <hi>real Godliness,</hi> or <hi>moral Sincerity?</hi> It was constantly insisted on, with the greatest Vehemence, that it was not saving
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006839_0009_102A65E010B1BE20"/>
Religion, which needed to be <hi>profess'd,</hi> or <hi>pretended to</hi>; but another Thing, Religion of a lower Kind. — The publick <hi>Acts</hi> of the Church and Parish, from Time to Time, shew, that the Point in Controversy was, <hi>Whether the Professors of Godliness, only, ought to be admitted</hi>? Publick Votes, of which I made a Record, were several Times to know the Church's Mind concerning the Admission of <hi>Those who are able and willing to make a Profession of Godliness</hi>; using these Terms. And once it was pass'd, That <hi>such should not be admitted in the Way of publickly making such a Profession.</hi> And at another Time the Vote pass'd, <hi>That the Admission of such Persons in such a Way</hi> (described in the same Words) <hi>should not be refer'd to the Judgment of certain neighbouring Ministers.</hi> At another Time, it was insisted on by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, in a Parish-Meeting, That I should put a Vote in the Church, in these Words, <hi>Whether there be not a Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr.</hi> Edwards <hi>Pastor of the Church, and the Church, respecting the Question he hath argued in his Book last publish'd</hi>? And accordingly the Vote was put &amp; affirmed, in a Church-Meeting, in the same Terms.—And this was the Question I insisted on in my publick Lectures at <hi>Northampton,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the giving the Reasons of my Opinion. My Doctrine was in these Words, <hi>'Tis the Mind &amp; Will of God, that none should be admitted to full Communion in the Church of Christ, but such as in Profession, and in the Eye of a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judgment, are truly Saints, or godly Persons.</hi> The Town was full of Objections against those Sermons: but none, as ever I heard, objected, that my Doctrine was <hi>beside the Controversy.</hi>—And this was all along the Point of Difference between me and the neighbouring <hi>Ministers.</hi> This was the grand Subject of Debate with them, at a Meeting of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, appointed on Purpose for Conference on the Subject. It was wholly concerning the <hi>Matter</hi> of Profession, or the <hi>Thing</hi> to be exhibited and made evident or visible; and not about the <hi>Manner</hi> of professing, and the <hi>Degree</hi> of Evidence.— And this was the Doctrine directly opposed by Mr. <hi>A—y,</hi> one of the neighbouring Ministers, whom my People had got as their Champion to defend their Cause in the Pulpit at <hi>Northampton.</hi> Thus one of the Corollaries he drew from his Doctrine (as it was taken from his Mouth in Writing)
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006839_0010_102A65E1D9C6A200"/>
was, That
<q>A Man may be a visible Saint, and yet there be no sufficient Grounds for our Charity, that he is rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</q>
Quite contrary to what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> maintains Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Corollaries was in these Words,
<q>A Minister or Church may judge a Man a Saint, and upon good Grounds, and not have Grounds to judge him regenerate.</q>
He proposed this Enquiry,
<q>Do not such as join them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Church, covenant not only to be visible Saints, but Saints in Heart?</q>
The Answer was in the <hi>Negative</hi>; quite contrary to Mr. <hi>W.</hi>—Another was,
<q>
                        <hi>Does not a visible Saint imply a Visibility of Grace, or an Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it</hi>?</q>
The Answer was, "Not always." Quite contrary to Mr. <hi>W.</hi>—Another was,
<q>Is it not Hypocrisy in any Man, to make a Profession of Religion, and join himself to the Church, and not have Grace?</q>
The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was in the <hi>Negative</hi>; also quite contrary to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> —But these Sermons of Mr. <hi>A—y,</hi> were highly approved by the generality of the People of <hi>Northampton,</hi> as agreable to their Minds.</p>
                  <p>And the Controversy, as I have stated it in my Book, was the Controversy in which the Church and I appeared before the <hi>Council,</hi> who determin'd our Separation, when we each of us declared our Sentiments before them: The Point of Difference was entirely the <hi>Matter</hi> of Profession, and the <hi>Thing</hi> to be made <hi>visible</hi>; not the <hi>Degree</hi> of Evidence or <hi>Visibility.</hi> No Hint was given as tho' we both agreed, that true Piety or Gospel-Holiness was the Thing to be made visible, and that such only should be received as are truly godly Persons in the Eye of the Church's Judgment (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> holds) and that we only differ'd about the proper Grounds of such a Judgment.</p>
                  <p>And therefore 'tis apparent, it was this Controversy, and it's Consequences, that were the Ground of my Separation from my People; and not any Thing like the Controversy which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> professes to manage in his Answer. This Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, when it came out in Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Book, was new in <hi>Northampton,</hi> and entirely aliene from all the Dispute which had fill'd that Part of the Country, and a great Part of <hi>New-England,</hi> with Noise and Uproar, for about two Years and an half. The Thing which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> over and over al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006839_0011_102A65E387B00868"/>
to be true, was the very same, both in Effect and in Terms, which the People had been most vehemently fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against, from Week to Week, and from Month to Month, during all this Time: And therefore the Design of my Writing led and obliged me to maintain that Position or Doctrine of mine, which was the Occasion of this Debate.</p>
                  <p>And, be it so, that I did suppose this Position was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Opinion, and was opposed by Him,<note n="†" place="bottom">Whether I was mistaken in this, will appear in the Sequel.</note> and therefore thought fit in my <hi>Preface</hi> to excuse my self to the World for differing from Him; did this oblige Me, in all that I wrote for the maintaining my Position, to keep my self strictly to the Words which he had express'd <hi>his Question</hi> in, and to regulate and limit my self in every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument I used, and Objection I answered, by the Terms which he made use of in proposing his Opinion and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? And if I have not done it, do I therefore deserve to be charged before the World with <hi>changing the Question,</hi> with <hi>unfair Treatment of Mr.</hi> Stoddard, with <hi>surprizingly going off from his Argument,</hi> with <hi>disserving the Cause of Truth,</hi> &amp;c!</p>
                  <p>It would have been no great Condescension in Mr <hi>W.</hi> if he had allow'd that <hi>I</hi> knew what the Question was, which was disputed between Me and my People, as well as <hi>He,</hi> in a distant Part of the Country: Yea, if he had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that I was as likely as He, to understand Mr. <hi>Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi>'s real Sentiments and Practice; since I was in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry two Years with Him, as Co-Pastor of the same Church, and was united with Him in ecclesiastical Administrations, in admitting Members, and in examining them as to their Qualifications, and have stood for more than 23 Years in a Pastoral Relation to his Church, most intimately acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Nature of it's Constitution, it's Sentiments and Method of Administration, and all its religious Concerns, have my self been immediately concern'd in the Admission of more than three Quarters of its present Members, and have had the greatest Occasion to look into their Way of Admission, and have been acquainted with every living Member that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had admitted before my coming; and have been particularly informed, by many of them, of the Manner of Mr. <hi>S—d</hi>'s Conduct in admitting them, their

own Apprehensions concerning the Terms of their Admission, and the Profession they made in Order to it; and also the Sentiments of the whole of that large Town, who were born and brought up under his Ministry, concerning his constant Doctrine and Practice, relating to the Admission of Members, from their Infancy.—Whereas, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> from his Youth had lived in another Part of the Country, at 70 Miles Distance.</p>

                  <p>MR. <hi>W.</hi> does very greatly misrepresent the Opinion I am of, and the Principles I maintain in my Book, in many Respects.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. He says, P. 5. <hi>d.</hi>
                     <q>The whole Argument, and indeed the whole Controversy turns upon this single Point, <hi>viz.</hi> What is that <hi>Evidence,</hi> which by divine Appointment the Church is to have, of the <hi>Saintship</hi> of those who are admitted to the outward Privileges of the Covenant of Grace? Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> seems to suppose, this must be the <hi>highest</hi> Evidence a Man can give of Sincerity; and I apprehend to be the <hi>lowest</hi> Evidence the Nature of the Thing will admit.</q>
—But this is very strange, since I had particularly declared in my <hi>Stating of the Question,</hi> (P. 5.) that the Evidence I insisted on, was <hi>some outward Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ordinarily render'd the Thing probable.</hi> Which shews, that all I insisted on, was only, that the Evidence should amount to <hi>Probability.</hi> And if the Nature of the Case will admit of some <hi>lower</hi> Kind of Evidence than this, or if there be any such Thing as a Sort of Evidence that don't so much as amount to <hi>Probability,</hi> then 'tis possible that I may have some Controversy with Him and others about the Degree of Evidence: Otherwise 'tis hard to conceive, how he should contrive to make out a Controversy with me.</p>

                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:006839_0013_102A65E9CBF5A158"/>But that the Reader may better judge, whether Mr. <hi>W.</hi> truly represents me as supposing that the Evidence which should be insisted on, is <hi>the highest Evidence a Man can give of Sincerity,</hi> I would here insert an Extract of a <hi>Letter</hi> which I wrote to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Peter Clark</hi> of <hi>Salem-Village,</hi> a Twelve-Month before Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Book was published: The Original is doubtless in Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>'s Hands. In that Letter, I declared my Sentiments in the following Words:
<floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>It don't belong to the Controversy between Me and my People, how particular or large the Profession should be that is required. I should not chuse to be confined to exact Limits as to that Matter. But rather than contend, I should content my self with a few Words, briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the cardinal Vertues, or Acts implied in a hearty Compliance with the Covenant of Grace; the Profession being made (as should appear by Inquiry into the Person's doctrinal Knowledge) understandingly; if there were an external Conversation agreable thereto. Yea, I should think that such a Person, solemnly making such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, had a Right to be receiv'd as the Object of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Charity, however he himself might scruple his own Conversion, on Account of his not remembring the Time, not knowing the Method of his Conversion, or finding so much remaining Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And (if his own Scruples did not hinder <note n="*" place="bottom">I added this, because I supposed that such Persons as judge themselves unconverted, if of <hi>my</hi> Principles, respecting Qualifications for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, would scruple coming, and could not come with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: But if they were of Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Men might lawfully come, neither a Man's being of that Opinion, nor his judging himself unconverted, would hinder my receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him who exhibited proper Evidence to the Church of his being a Convert.</note>) I should think a Minister or Church had no Right to debar such a Professor, tho' he should say, he did not think himself converted. For I call that a Profession of Godliness, which is a Profession of the great Things wherein Godliness consists, and not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his own Opinion of his good Estate.—</p>

                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006839_0014_102A65EDDEB72CA8"/>In like Manner, I explain'd my Opinion, very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and expresly, before the <hi>Council</hi> that determin'd my Separation from my People, and before the Church, in a very publick Manner in the Meeting-House, many People being present, near a Year before Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Book was publish'd; and to make it the more sure, that what I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd might be well observed, I afterwards sent in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Extract of my Letter to Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> of <hi>Salem-Village,</hi> into the Council. And, as I was informed, it was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly taken Notice of in the Council, and handed round among them, to be read by them.</p>
                  <p>The same <hi>Council,</hi> having heard that I had made certain Draughts of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> or Forms of a publick <hi>Profession</hi> of Religion, which I stood ready to accept of from the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for Communion, they, for their further Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, sent for 'em. Accordingly I sent them four distinct Draughts or Forms, which I had drawn up about a Twelve-Month before, (near Two Years before the publishing of Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Book) as what I stood ready to accept of (any one of them) rather than contend and break with my People.— The two shortest of those Forms were as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>One of them was;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I hope, I do truly find a Heart to give up my self wholly to God, according to the Tenor of that Covenant of Grace which was seal'd in my Baptism, and to walk in a Way of that Obedience to all the Commandments of God, which the Covenant of Grace requires, as long as I live.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The other,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I hope, I truly find in my Heart a Willingness to comply with all the Commandments of God, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire me to give up my self wholly to Him, and to serve Him with my Body and my Spirit; and do accordingly now promise to walk in a Way of Obedience to all the Commandments of God, as long as I live.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Reader is left to judge, whether I insist, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> represents, that Persons must not be admitted without the <hi>highest</hi> Evidence a Man <hi>can</hi> give of Sincerity.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:006839_0015_102A65F1EB2FBD88"/>II. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is abundant in suggesting and insinuating to his Readers, that the Opinion laid down in my Book is, That Persons ought not to be admitted to Communion without an absolute and peremptory Determination in those who admit them, that they are truly godly; because I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it to be necessary, that there should be a <hi>positive</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Favour.</p>
                  <p>Here I desire the Reader to observe, that the Word <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> is used in two Senses. (1.) Sometimes it is put in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to <hi>Doubtful,</hi> or <hi>Uncertain:</hi> And then it signifies the same as <hi>Certain, Peremptory,</hi> or <hi>Assured.</hi> But (2.) The Word <hi>Positive</hi> is very often used in a very different Sense; not in Opposition to <hi>Doubtful,</hi> but in Opposition to <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi> And so understood, it signifies very much the same as <hi>Real,</hi> or <hi>Actual.</hi> Thus, we often speak of a <hi>negative Good,</hi> and a <hi>positive Good.</hi> A <hi>negative Good</hi> is a meer Negation or Absence of <hi>Evil.</hi> But a <hi>positive Good</hi> is something more, 'tis some <hi>real, actual Good,</hi> instead of Evil. So there is a <hi>negative Charity,</hi> and a <hi>positive Charity.</hi> A <hi>negative</hi> Charity is a meer Absence of an ill Judgment of a Man, or forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to condemn him. Such a Charity a Man may have towards any Stranger he transiently sees in the Street, that he never saw or heard any Thing of before. A <hi>positive Charity</hi> is something further than meerly not condemning, or not judging Ill of a Man; it implies a <hi>good Thought</hi> of a Man. The Reader will easily see that the Word <hi>Positive,</hi> taken in this Sense, is an exceeding different Thing from <hi>Certain</hi> or <hi>Peremptory.</hi> A Man may have something more than a meer <hi>negative</hi> Charity towards another, or a meer forbearing to condemn him, he may actually entertain some <hi>good Thought</hi> of him, and yet there may be no proper <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptoriness,</hi> no Pretence of any <hi>Certainty</hi> in the Case.</p>
                  <p>Now 'tis in this Sense I use the Phrase, <hi>positive Judgment, viz.</hi> In Opposition to a meer <hi>negative Charity</hi>; as I very plainly express the Matter, and particularly &amp; fully explain my self in <hi>stating the Question.</hi> In my <hi>Inquiry</hi> (P. 5.) I have the following Words:
<q>By <hi>Christian Judgment,</hi> I intend something further than a Kind of meer <hi>negative</hi> Charity, implying that we forbear to censure and condemn a Man, because we don't know but that he may be godly, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006839_0016_102A65F48FFE8B20"/>
therefore forbear to proceed on the Foot of such a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or Judgment in our Treatment of Him; as we would kindly entertain a Stranger, not knowing but, in so doing, we entertain an Angel, or precious Saint of God: But I mean a <hi>positive Judgment,</hi> founded on some <hi>positive</hi> Appearance or Visibility, some outward Manifestation that ordinarily renders the Thing <hi>probable.</hi> There is a Difference between suspending our Judgment, or forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to condemn, or having some Hope that possibly the Thing may be so, and so hoping the best, and a <hi>positive</hi> Judgment in Favour of a Person. For a having some Hope, only implies, that a Man is not in utter Despair of a Thing; tho' his prevailing Opinion may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, or he may suspend his Opinion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here, I think, my Meaning is very plainly and carefully explain'd. However, in as much as the Word <hi>Positive</hi> is sometimes used for <hi>Peremptory</hi> or <hi>Certain,</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> catches at the Term, and lays fast Hold of the Advantage he thinks this gives him, and is abundant, all over his Book, in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting as tho' I insisted on a <hi>positive Judgment</hi> in this Sense. So he applies the Word, referring to my Use of it, from Time to Time. Thus, P. 69. <hi>b.</hi>
                     <q>If there be any Thing in this Argument, I think it must be what I have observ'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Christian must make a <hi>positive Judgment</hi> and Determination, that another Man is a Saint, and this Judgment must have for it's Ground something which he supposes is, at least ordinarily, a <hi>Certain</hi> Evidence of his Saintship, and by which gracious Sincerity is <hi>Certainly</hi> distinguish'd from every Thing else.</q>
And P. 141. <hi>a.</hi>
                     <q>The Notion of Men's being able and fit to determine <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively</hi> the Condition of other Men, or the <hi>Certainty</hi> of their gracious State, has a direct Tendency to deceive the Souls of Men.</q>
And thus Mr. <hi>W.</hi> makes mention of a <hi>positive Judgment</hi> above forty Times in his Book, with Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to my Use of it, and to my declared Opinion of the Necessity of it; and every where plainly uses the Phrase in <hi>that</hi> Sense, for <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>peremptory,</hi> in Opposition to <hi>Doubtfulness</hi>; continually insinuating, that this is what I professedly insist on. Whereas, every <hi>Act</hi> of the Judgment whatsoever, is a <hi>Positive</hi> Judgment in the Sense in which I
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006839_0017_102A65F782476F60"/>
have fully declared I use it, <hi>viz.</hi> in Opposition to <hi>Negative</hi>; which is no <hi>Act,</hi> but a meer with-holding of the Act of the Judgment, or forbearing any actual Judgment. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>John Glas,</hi> in his <hi>Observes upon the original Constitution of the Christian Church,</hi> (P. 55, 56.) says as follows.
<q>You seem to have a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice at what you call <hi>positive Evidences,</hi> and judging upon them in the Admission of Church-Members. And I am at some Loss to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what you mean by them, tho' I have heard the Expression frequently, among People of your Opinion, used to express some very ill Thing. If you mean by <hi>positive Evidences,</hi> infallible Evidences of a Thing that none but God infallibly knows, and can assure a Man's own Conscience of, with Respect to a Man himself; I think, it would be a very great Evil for a Man to require such Evidence to found his Judgment of Charity, concerning another Man's Faith and Holiness, or concerning his being an Object of <hi>brotherly Love.</hi> And I think, he is bound by the Law of Christ to form his Judgment in this Matter upon less Evidence. But if you mean <hi>positive Evidence</hi> in Opposition to <hi>negative,</hi> which is no Evidence, I must own, I know not how to form a Judgment of Charity without some <hi>positive</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And is not a <hi>credible Profession</hi> something <hi>positive?</hi>— Is not a credible Profession of the Faith, Love, and Hope that is in Christ, or of Christianity, a <hi>positive Evidence</hi> of a Man's being an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>brotherly Love,</hi> which Evidence ought to be the Ground of my <hi>Judgment of Charity</hi> concerning Him, that He is a Christian, a Believer in Christ, a Brother for whom Christ died? If it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and if there be no Evidence upon which I can charitably judge, that a Man is a Brother for whom Christ died, then tell me, how I can evidence my Love to Jesus Christ, in the Labour of Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Brother, whom I have seen; and my Love to God, in my Love to them that are begotten of Him.</q>
                     </note> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself does abundantly suppose, that there must be a <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Judgment in <hi>this</hi> Sense: He grants the very Thing, tho' he rejects the Term: For he holds, there must be such a <hi>Visibility as makes Persons to appear to be real Saints.</hi> P. 5. <hi>b.</hi>—He allows, that <hi>the moral Image of God or Christ must appear, or be supposed to be in them, as the Ground and Reason of our Charity</hi>; and that <hi>there must be some Apprehension, some Judgment of Mind, of the Saintship of Persons, for it's Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> P. 68. <hi>c. d. e.</hi> &amp; 69. <hi>a.</hi> &amp; 71. <hi>d.</hi>—That they <hi>must have such a Character appearing in them.</hi> P. 55. <hi>e.</hi> — That there must be a Judgment founded on <hi>moral Evidence of Gospel-Holiness.</hi> P. 139. <hi>d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> to make my Scheme appear the more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, does more than once represent it as my Opinion, that in Order to Persons being admitted into the Church, there
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006839_0018_102A65FA8096F0A0"/>
must be a Judgment of their being regenerate, founded on such a Degree of Evidence, as that it shall not be liable to be mistaken more than <hi>once in ten Times.</hi> Thus, P. 63. <hi>c.</hi>
                     <q>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> himself supposes, in his own Scheme, when he has made a positive Judgment that every one singly whom he admits into the Church is regenerate; yet, when taken collectively, it is probable <hi>one in ten</hi> will be an Hypocrite?</q>
So, P. 71. <hi>b.</hi>
                     <q>If any Thing be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Purpose for which this Argument is brought, I conceive, it must mean, that there must be such a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Judgment</hi> of the real Holiness of Persons, as is <hi>not mistaken more than once in ten Times.</hi>
                     </q>
—Now, I desire the Reader to observe what is the whole Ground, on which he makes such a Representation. In explaining my Opinion, in the Beginning of my Inquiry (P. 6.) I desired it might be observed, that I did not suppose we ought to expect any such Degree of <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Godliness of those who are admitted into the Church, as that when the whole Number admitted are taken collectively, or considered in the Gross, we should have any Reason to suppose every one to be truly godly; tho' we might have Charity for each one that was admitted, taken <hi>singly,</hi> and by himself. And to shew, that such a Thing was possible, I endeavoured to illustrate it by a Comparison, or supposed Case of <hi>Probability of ten to one,</hi> in the Example of certain Stones, with such probable Marks of a <hi>Diamond,</hi> as by Experience had been found not to fail more than <hi>once in ten Times.</hi> In which Case, if a particular Stone were found with those Marks, there would be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of <hi>ten to one,</hi> with Respect to that Stone, singly taken, that it was genuine: But if ten such were taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there would not be the same Probability that every one of them was so; but in this Case, 'tis as likely as not, that some one in the Ten is spurious. Now 'tis so apparent, that this particular Degree of Probability of <hi>ten to one</hi> is mentioned only as a <hi>supposed Case,</hi> for Illustration, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, in a particular Example, some Number or other must be mention'd, that it would have been an Affront to the Sense of my Readers to have added any Caution, that he should not understand me otherwise. However, Mr. <hi>W</hi> has laid hold on this, as a good Handle by which he might
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006839_0019_102A65FD55673F80"/>
exhibit my Scheme to the World in a ridiculous Light; as tho' I had declared it my real Opinion, that there must be the Probability, of just <hi>ten to one,</hi> of true Godliness, in Order to Persons Admission into the Church. He might with as much Appearance of Sense and Justice, have asserted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all the supposed Cases in Books of Arithmetick, that the Authors intend these Cases should be understood as real <hi>Facts,</hi> and that they have written their Books, with all the Sums and Numbers in them, as Books of <hi>History</hi>; and if any Cases mention'd there only as Examples of the several Rules, are unlikely to be true Accounts of Fact, therefore have charg'd the Authors with writing a <hi>false</hi> &amp; <hi>absurd</hi> History<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Another Thing, yet further from what is honourable in Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is This; That, whereas I said as above, that there ought to be a prevailing Opinion concerning those that are admitted, <hi>taken singly, or by themselves,</hi> that they are truly godly or gracious, tho' when we look on the whole Number in the Gross, we are far from determining that every one is a true Saint, and that not one of the Judgments we have pass'd, has been mistaken; Mr. <hi>W.</hi> because I used the Phrase <hi>singly taken,</hi> has laid hold on the Expression, and from thence has taken Occasion to insinuate to his Readers, as if my Scheme were so very extravagant, that according to this, when a great Multitude are admitted, their Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters must be confident of EVERY ONE's being <hi>regenerated.</hi> Hence he observes, (P. 98. <hi>c.</hi>)
<q>There is no Appearance, that <hi>John</hi> made a positive Judgment that <hi>every one</hi> of these People were regenerated.</q>
Plainly using the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression as a very strong one; leading the Reader to suppose, I insist the Evidence shall be so clear, that when such a vast Multitude as <hi>John</hi> baptized are viewed, the Admitter should be peremptory in it, that his Judgment has not fail'd so much as in a <hi>single</hi> Instance; the very <hi>Reverse</hi> of what I had express'd. In like Manner, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> treats the Matter from Time to Time. As in P. 55. <hi>a.</hi>
                     <q>The Thing to be proved from hence is, that the Apostles and primitive Christians, not only thought that these Persons were Christians, by Reason of their external Calling, &amp; profess'd Compliance with the Call; but had formed a positive Judgment concerning EVERY ONE OF THEM
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006839_0020_102A65FEF3435A20"/>
SINGLY, that they were real Saints.</q>
Here the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is plainly used as a very strong one; as implying much more than esteeming so great a Multitude, when taken in the Gross to be generally true Saints, and with a manifest Design to carry the same Idea in the Mind of the Reader as was before mention'd. See another like <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>ance P. 62. <hi>c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. However, my Opinion is not represented bad enough yet; but to make it appear still worse, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is bold to strain his Representation of it to that Height, as to suggest that what I insist on, is a <hi>Certainty</hi> of others Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: tho' this be so diverse from what I had largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in stating the Question, and plainly expressed in other Parts of my Book, <note n="*" place="bottom">In stating the Question, P. 5. <hi>b.</hi> I explain'd the requisite Visibility, to be <hi>some outward Manifestation, that ordinarily renders the Thing probable.</hi> To the like Purpose, is what I say in P. 10. <hi>e.</hi> &amp; P. 11. <hi>a. b. e.</hi> &amp; P. 12. <hi>a. b. e.</hi> And in P. 106. <hi>e.</hi> I say expresly,
<q>Not a <hi>Certainty,</hi> but a Profession and Visibility of these Things, must be the Rule of the Church's Proceeding.</q>
                     </note> and also inconsistent with his own Representations in other Places. For if what I insist on be a Probability that <hi>may fail once in ten Times,</hi> as he says it is, P. 63. <hi>a.</hi> then it is not a <hi>Certainty</hi> that I insist on; as he suggests, P. 141. <hi>a.</hi>—Speaking of the evil Consequences of my Opinion, he says,
<q>The Notion of Men's being able and fit to determine positively the Condition of other Men, or the Certainty of their gracious Estate, has a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Tendency to deceive the Souls of Men.</q>
So again in P. 69. And he suggests, that I require more than <hi>moral Evidence,</hi> in P. 6. <hi>c.</hi> &amp; P. 139. <hi>d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> represents Me as insisting on some Way of judging the State of such as are admitted to Communion, <hi>by their inward &amp; spiritual Experiences,</hi> diverse from judging <hi>by their Profession and Behaviour.</hi> So, P. 7. <hi>b.</hi>
                     <q>If <hi>their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profession &amp; Behaviour</hi> be the Ground of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then it is not <hi>the inward Experience of the Heart.</hi>
                     </q>
"— P. 55. <hi>b.</hi>
                     <q>Which Judgment must be founded on something beyond and beside their external Calling, and <hi>visible Profession</hi> to comply with it, and to be separated for God: And therefore this Judgment must be founded, either upon Revelation, or a personal Acquaintance with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006839_0021_102A660085D3BEB8"/>
                        <hi>their Experiences.</hi> &amp;c.</q>
In like Manner he is abundant, from one End of his Book to the other, in representing as tho' I insisted on judging of Men <hi>by their inward &amp; spiritual Experiences,</hi> in some peculiar Manner. Which is something surprizing, since there is not so much as a Word said about <hi>relating, or giving an Account of Experiences,</hi> or what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly so called, as a Term of Communion. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (P. 6. <hi>a.</hi>) pretends to quote two Passages of mine, as an Evidence, that this is what I insist on. One is from the 5th Page of my Book. 'Tis true, I there say thus,
<q>It is a Visibility to the Eye of the publick Charity, and not a private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that gives a Person a Right to be received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a visible Saint by the Publick.</q>
And I there say,
<q>A pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and serious Profession of the great and main Things wherein the Essence of true Religion or Godliness consists, together with an honest Character, an agreable Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and good Understanding of the Doctrines of Christianity, and particularly those Doctrines that teach the grand Condition of Salvation, and the Nature of true saving Religion; this justly recommends Persons to the good Opinion of the publick; whatever Suspicions and Fears any particular Person, either the Minister, or some other, may entertain, from what He in particular has observed; perhaps the Manner of his expressing Himself <hi>in giving an Account of his Experiences,</hi> or an Obscurity in the Order and Method of his <hi>Experiences,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
—But the Words don't imply, it may be demanded of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate, that he should give an Account of his Experiences to the Minister, or any Body else, as the Term of his Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Church; nor had I Respect to any such Thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I knew it was the Manner in many Places for those who hoped they were godly Persons, to converse with their Neighbours, and especially with their Minister, about their Experiences; whether it was required of them in Order to their coming into the Church, or no; and particularly, I was sensible, that this was the Manner at <hi>Northampton,</hi> for whose Sake especially I wrote; and I supposed it the Way of many Ministers, and People, to judge of others State, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and publickly, by the Order and Method of their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, or the Manner of their relating them. But this I
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006839_0022_102A6603A828B748"/>
condemn in the very Passage that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes; and very much condemn, in other Writings of mine which have been publish'd; and have ever loudly condemned, and born my Testimony against.</p>
                  <p>There is one Passage more, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> adds to the preceding, and fathers on me, to prove that I require <hi>an Account of Experiences</hi> in order to Admission; pretending to rehearse my Words, with Marks of Quotation, saying as follows, (P. 6. <hi>a.</hi>)
<q>And as he further explains himself else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;</q>
                     <q>The proper Visibility which the Publick is to have of a Man's being a Saint, must be on some Account of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of those Doctrines which teach the Nature of true saving Religion.</q>
I have made long and diligent Search for such a Passage in my Writings, but cannot find it. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, <hi>I thus explain my self elsewhere:</hi> But I wish he had mention'd in what Place.</p>
                  <p>If there be such a Sentence in some of my Writings (as I suppose there is not) it will serve little to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Purpose.—If we take the Word <hi>Experience</hi> according to the common Acceptation of it in the English Language, <hi>viz.</hi> a Person's perceiving or knowing any Thing by Trial or Experiment, or by immediate Sensation or Consciousness within himself: In this Sense, I own, it may from what I say in my Book be infer'd, that a Man's Profession of his Experience should be required as a Term of Communion: And so it may be as justly and as plainly infer'd, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself insists on a Profession of Experience as a Term of Communion; Experience of <hi>a deep Conviction of a Man's undone State without Christ</hi>; Experience of a <hi>Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Judgment and Conscience, that there is no other Way of Salvation</hi>; Experience of <hi>unfeigned Desires to be brought to the Terms of the Covenant:</hi> For such Things as these, he says, must be professed: So P. 75. <hi>d. e.</hi> and in innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble other Places. There is no such Thing possible as a Man's professing any Thing within himself or belonging to his own Mind, either good or bad, either common or sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unless it be something that he <hi>finds,</hi> or (which is the same Thing) <hi>experiences,</hi> within himself.</p>
                  <p>I know, the Word <hi>Experience</hi> is used by many in a Sort of peculiar Sense, for the particular Order and Method of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006839_0023_102A6608E31137F8"/>
what passes within the Mind and Heart in Conversion. And in this Sense, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> knows, I disclaim the Notion of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Experiences</hi> a Term of Communion. I say, he knows it, because (in P. 6, <hi>a.</hi>) he quotes and rehearses the very Words wherein I do expresly disclaim it. And I am very large and particular in testifying against it in my Book on <hi>Religious Affections:</hi> A Book, I have good Reason to think Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has seen and read, having been thus informed by a Man of his own Principles, that had it from his Mouth. There, in P. 300. <hi>e.</hi> &amp; 301. <hi>a.</hi> I say as follows:
<q>In order to Persons making a proper Profession of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, such as the Scripture directs to, and such as the Followers of Christ should require in Order to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Professors with full Charity, as of their Society, 'tis not necessary they should give an Account of the particular <hi>Steps</hi> and <hi>Method,</hi> by which the Holy Spirit, sensibly to them, wrought, and bro't about those great essential Things of Christianity in their Hearts. There is no Footstep in the Scripture of any such Way of the Apostles, or primitive Ministers and Christians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring any such Relation in order to their receiving and treating others as their Christian Brethren, to all Intents and Purposes; or of their first examining them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the particular Method and Order of their <hi>Experiences.</hi> They required of them a Profession of the Things wrought; but no Account of the Manner of working was required of them. Nor is there the least Shadow in the Scripture of any such Custom in the Church of God, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Death of the Apostle <hi>John.</hi>
                     </q>
To the same Purpose again I express my self in P. 302. <hi>d.</hi> And in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the Book that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> writes against, I make particular mention of this Book <hi>on Religious Affections,</hi> wherein these Things are said; and there declare expresly, that when I wrote that Book, I was of the same Mind concerning the Qualifications of Communicants that I am of now.—But,</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. To make my Scheme still more obnoxious &amp; odious, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> once and again insinuates, that I insist on an Account of <hi>such inward FEELINGS, as are by Men supposed to be the certain discriminating Marks of Grace</hi> (So P. 7. <hi>b.</hi> &amp; 141. <hi>e.</hi>) tho' I never once used the Phrase any where in my Book.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006839_0024_102A660A686B6598"/>
I said not a Word about <hi>inward Feelings,</hi> from one End of it to the other: Nor is any <hi>inward Feeling</hi> at all more implied in my Scheme, than in his. But however, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> knew that these Phrases, <hi>Experiences</hi> and <hi>inward Feelings,</hi> were become odious of late to a great Part of the Country; and especially the latter of them, since Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> used it so much: And he well knew, that to tack these Phrases to my Scheme, and to suggest to his Readers that these were the Things I professed to insist on, would tend to render me and my Scheme contemptible. If he says, tho' I use not that Phrase, yet the Things I insist on, are such as are <hi>inwardly felt</hi>; such as saving Repentance, Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I answer, These Things are no more <hi>inward Feelings,</hi> than the Things he himself insists on; such as a <hi>deep Conviction</hi> of a Man's undone State, <hi>unfeigned fervent Desires</hi> after Christ, a <hi>fixed Resolution</hi> for Christ, <hi>Engagedness</hi> for Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> abundantly, in almost all Parts of his Book, represents my Principles to be such as suppose <hi>Men</hi> to be the <hi>SEARCHERS of others Hearts.</hi> For which I have given no other Ground, than only supposing that some such Qualifications are necessary in Order to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which have their Seat <hi>in the Heart,</hi> and so not to be intuitively seen by others; and that such Qualifications must, by Profession and Practice, be made so visible or credible to others, that others may rationally judge they are there. And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes the same Thing as much as I. In P. 111. <hi>c.</hi> he expresly speaks of the Qualifications necessary to Communion, as being <hi>in the Heart,</hi> and not possible to be known any other way than by their being <hi>seen</hi> there: and also often allows, that these Qualifications must be exhibited, and made <hi>visible,</hi> by a credible Profession, and answerable Practice: yea, He goes further, He even supposes that those who admit them to Sacraments, ought to be <hi>satisfied</hi> by their Profession, that they <hi>really have these Qualifications.</hi> Thus he says, P. 54. <hi>c.</hi>
                     <q>The Baptizer <hi>ought to be satisfied</hi> by a Person's Profession, that he <hi>really believes the Gospel,</hi> and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Saviour.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is not contented with all these Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my Scheme, but will have it appear more absurd and monstrous still; and therefore represents me as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006839_0025_102A660C6B14B3A8"/>
that 'tis not the <hi>visible Profession of Experiences,</hi> that I suppose the Ground of the Church's Judgment; but these <hi>Experiences and inward Feelings Themselves,</hi> by having <hi>the Heart turned inside out,</hi> and viewing them immediately <hi>in the Heart itself,</hi> and <hi>judging upon the next and immediate Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Heart.</hi>—Here, I only desire the Reader to read down Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s 7th Page, and make his own Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Whereas, in P. 16. of my Book, I observed it to be the Opinion of some, that,
<q>Altho' the Members of the visible Church are Saints in Profession and Visibility, and in the Acceptance of others, yet this is not with Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to saving Holiness, but to quite another Sort of Saintship, viz. <hi>moral Sincerity</hi>; and that this is the <hi>real Saintship, Discipleship,</hi> and <hi>Godliness,</hi> that is profess'd and visible in Them,</q>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (P. 4, 5.) says, He <hi>don't remember that he ever heard of this, or that any Body tho't of it, before he saw it in my Book</hi>; and represents it as <hi>a poor Man of Straw,</hi> of my own framing: and he insists upon it, that <hi>'tis allow'd on all Hands,</hi> that the Visibility must be <hi>with Reference to saving Holiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not say, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> knew it to be a false Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation which he here makes: But this I will say, that he ought to have been better informed, before he had thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ridiculed this as a Fiction of <hi>mine</hi>; especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Opportunities and Advantages he has had to know otherwise: This being the Notion that had been (as was before observed) so loudly and publickly insisted on, for more than two Years, by the People of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and by the neighbouring Ministers, and those of them that were Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s near Relatives; as he has had abundant Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be fully informed, having withal had great Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to inquire. Besides, that this has been the universal Opinion of all that Part of the Country (who tho't Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Followers) for more than 20 Years, is a Fact as notorious, as that the People there generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Doctrine of the Necessity of a Work of Conversion in order to get to Heaven. — And this is the Opinion professedly maintain'd in a Pamphlet publish'd in <hi>Boston</hi> (Anno 1741) Intitled, <hi>A Right to the Lord's Supper
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006839_0026_102A661245A4D300"/>
consider'd:</hi> A Piece which has long been well known among Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s nearest Relatives, and in good Repute with them; as I have had Occasion to observe. This Pamphlet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists expresly &amp; abundantly, that <hi>moral Sincerity</hi> is the <hi>REAL Discipleship</hi> &amp; <hi>Holiness,</hi> with Respect to which visible Christians are called <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> in Scripture. Particularly see <hi>Pages</hi> 9, 10, 13, <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.—And which is more strange yet, Mr. BLAKE, the great Author Mr. <hi>W.</hi> makes so much Use of, and in a Book which I know he has long been the Possessor of, speaks much of a Profession of Religion that has Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect only to a <hi>dogmatical, historical Faith,</hi> a <hi>common Faith,</hi> a <hi>Faith true indeed</hi> (as he says) <hi>in its Kind, but short of that which is justifying and saving,</hi> and a <hi>Profession which goes no further,</hi> as that which entitles to sealing Ordinances. Thus he does expresly. See <hi>Blake</hi> on the Covenant, P. 241, 244, 245.—The same Author again and again distinguishes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>justifying Faith</hi> and <hi>Faith of Profession</hi>; as in P. 284, 285, 286.— And which is more than all this, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (as will appear in the Sequel) abundantly contends for the same Thing himself, tho' against himself, and altho' he charges me in P. 35. <hi>d.</hi> with a great Misrepresentation, in supposing that according to the Scheme of my Opposers, the Profession required in those that are admitted, don't imply a Pretence to <hi>any Thing more than moral Sincerity and common Grace.</hi>

                     <note n="|" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Words (P. 55. <hi>d. e.</hi>) are pretty remarkable:
<q>The Reader (says he) will judge, whether the Manner of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s treating the Question, and representing the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in the Words I have quoted above, be not <hi>unaccountable</hi>; tho' this is neither the first nor the last Time of his treating the Matter in such a Manner: As if Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> and his Adherents supposed Persons were to be admitted without any Notion of their being god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or any Respect to such a Character, appearing on them; and that they themselves are without such a Pretence.</q>—Whereas, Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> expresly maintains, that Men may be <hi>duly qualified,</hi> and <hi>fit Matter</hi> for Church-Membership, without saving Grace. (<hi>Appeal,</hi> P. 15, 16.) And that they <hi>may</hi> and <hi>ought to come, tho' they know themselves to be in a natural Condition. (Doct. of instituted Churches,</hi> P. 21. See also his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> on the Subject, P. 13.) And according to Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants are not so much as <hi>supposed</hi> godly Persons. This (<hi>Appeal</hi> P. 43) He says expresly, That <hi>by the Institution Communicants at the Lord's Supper are not supposed to be real Saints.</hi> And also asserts (<hi>Appeal</hi> P. 76.) That we are not obliged to <hi>believe</hi> visible Saints to be real Saints. And it seems by what he says in his <hi>Appeal</hi> (P. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) the Church may admit Persons to Communion, when at the same Time <hi>they are aware that they are Hypocrites.</hi> For there, in Answer to Dr. <hi>Mather,</hi> who had cited certain Texts to prove, that when Hypocrites do come into the Church, they come in <hi>unawares</hi>; He says, <hi>But neither of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he cites prove that</hi> all <hi>Hypocrites come in unawares.</hi> And in the next Page he says, <hi>The Discovery of Men's Hypocrisy is not the Reason of their being cast out.</hi> Still evidently on the same Foundation, that some known Hypocrites are <hi>fit</hi> to be admitted; for he says, (P. 15. <hi>d.) Such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted may not be cast out, are fit to be admitted.</hi> And these Things are agreable to what I know Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Church and Congregation have universally supposed to be his constant Doctrine and Practice among them. Thus it was, without one dissenting Voice among them, during the 24 Years that I lived with them. And now the Reader is desired to judge, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would have him, Whether my representing it to be the Opinion of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and his Adherents, that Persons might <hi>be admitted into the Church without any Notion of their being godly, or any Respect to such a Character appearing on Them,</hi> be unaccountable.— By these Things it is evident, Mr. <hi>S—d</hi>'s Scheme was far from being what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> represents it to be, and pretends to maintain as his. And if the Question he had to controvert with me, were Mr. <hi>S—d</hi>'s Question, as he asserts; yet he greatly mistakes <hi>the true State of the Question,</hi> tho' that be given as the Title of his Book.</note> P. 132. <hi>a. c. d. e.</hi> P. 136. <hi>d.</hi> P. 143. <hi>c.</hi>

So he allows, that they must not only be endowed with Christian Piety in Appearance; but that <hi>they must be so in Profession.</hi> (P. 3. <hi>a.</hi> P. 41. <hi>e.</hi> P. 44. <hi>d.</hi>) That <hi>they make a Shew of being wise Virgins by the Nature and Purport of their Profession.</hi> (P. 42. <hi>b.</hi>) And he insists with great Strenuousness, over and over, upon its being their Scheme, <hi>That they ought to make a Profession of real Saintship.</hi> (P 132. <hi>a. c. d.</hi>) Yea, he holds, that there must be not only some Visibility and Profession of real Piety, but <hi>moral Evidence of it.</hi> (P. 139. <hi>d.</hi>) He often uses Notes of Distinction, distinguishing between <hi>moral Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>real Piety</hi>; and insists much upon it as belonging to their Scheme; that there must be a Visibility of the latter, as thus distinguish'd from the former. So, he rejects with great Contempt any Suggestion of it's being the Scheme of my Opposers, that <hi>moral Sincerity</hi> is that Saintship, which is to be profess'd and made visible; and in Distinction from this, he asserts, that it is <hi>real Holiness.</hi> (P. 4. <hi>d. e.</hi> &amp; P. 5. <hi>a. b.</hi>) And again (P. 35. <hi>c.</hi>) he uses a Note of Distinction, and insists that the Opposers of my Opinion hold, that Communicants <hi>must make a Profession of something <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>a. d</hi>) he uses Notes of Distinction or Discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and says, that <hi>they must exhibit a credible Profession of Gospel-Holiness, and NOT MEERLY of moral Sincerity</hi>; and says, <hi>It is NOT the Visibility of moral Sincerity, BUT the moral

Evidence of Gospel-Sincerity, which God's Word makes the Rule of judging.</hi> — And as he holds, that Communicants must profess Gospel-Holiness, so he seems to suppose that these Professors must judge this of themselves; several Things He says, seem plainly to imply it. This appears evidently implied in that Interrogation put by Mr <hi>W.</hi> (P. 35. <hi>e.</hi>)
<q>Mr. S. rightly supposes all visible Saints who are not truly pious, to be Hypocrites; and the Scripture supposes and calls them so too: <hi>But will it therefore follow, that all Hypocrites know they are so?</hi>
                     </q>
And He in Effect asserts, that Men should <hi>look at such a Qualification,</hi> as sanctifying Grace, <hi>in themselves, and enquire whether they have it, or no, in Order to determine whether they should present themselves to Gospel-Ordinances:</hi> for he greatly finds Fault with me for suggesting, as if those of a different Opinion from me sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that Persons have no Manner of Need to look at any such Qualification in themselves, or at all inquire, whether they have it, in order to present themselves to Sacraments. He refers to that Passage in my Book (P. 55. <hi>d.</hi>)
<q>I can't conceive what should move <hi>Philip</hi> to utter those Words, or what he should aim at in them, if he at the same Time supposed that the <hi>Eunuch had no Manner of Need to look at any such Qualification in himself, or at all to inquire whether he had such a Faith, or no, in order to determine whether he</hi> MIGHT <hi>present himself as the Subject of Baptism.</hi>
                     </q>
'Tis plain, the Qualification I have Respect to, is <hi>Grace,</hi> or <hi>saving Faith.</hi> And so Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself understands me; as appears by his Reflections, P. 49. <hi>c. d. e.</hi> Where, after quoting this Passage, he consigns me over to <hi>another Judgment,</hi> for sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting that my Opposers hold what I had there express'd, and for "<hi>representing the Matter, as if they look'd on it as no Matter whether a Person coming to Gospel-Ordinances had any GRACE or no, and that He had no Manner of Need to inquire any Thing about his Sincerity.</hi>" <note n="†" place="bottom">Now let all that have been acquainted with the Controversy between Me and my People at <hi>Northampton,</hi> consider these Things, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> earnestly insists do belong to <hi>his</hi> Scheme; and judge whether they be agreable to the Scheme which my Opposers <hi>there</hi> have so vehemently and long contended for; yea, whether they are not very opposite to it; or whether in these Things Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has not intirely yielded up, yea, vehemently asserted, the chief Things concerning which they contested with Me; and so, whether He has at all helped <hi>their</hi> Cause by writing his Book, or rather, on the contrary, has fought against them.</note>

                  <head>SECTION II. Some of the plain <hi>Consequences</hi> of the foregoing Concessions of Mr. <hi>WILLIAMS.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. IF it be as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, that <hi>The Church ought to admit none to their holy Communion, in special Ordinances, but visible Saints, and that this Visibility must be such as to a Judgment of rational Charity, makes 'em appear as real Saints, and those that are admitted must be such as profess real Saintship, Gospel-Holiness, in Distinction from moral Sincerity</hi>; then the whole of my <hi>first</hi> Argument, from the Nature of a <hi>Visibility</hi> and <hi>Profession</hi> of Christianity, is allowed by him, in both <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> and <hi>Consequence.</hi> And indeed Mr. <hi>W.</hi> don't only do thus consequentially, but He is express in it. In P. 4. <hi>c.</hi> taking Notice of this Argument, he says,
<q>The Sense and Force of it wholly lies in this Compass; a <hi>visible Saint</hi> is one that to the View, Appearance and Judgment of the Church, is a <hi>real Saint</hi>; and since none but <hi>visible Saints</hi> are to be admitted by the Church, therefore none are to be admitted but such as <hi>appear</hi> to the View and Judgment of the Church to be <hi>real Saints.</hi>
                     </q>
But these Things, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Himself allows as the Sum of the Argument, both Premises and Consequence, are expresly allowed by Him in what there follows.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there must be a Visibility and Profession of <hi>real Piety,</hi> in Distinction from <hi>moral Sincerity,</hi> so that it can be truly said, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says with discretive Terms, and Notes of <hi>Discrimination,</hi> that <hi>NOT MEERLY the one must be profess'd, BUT the other; and that MORE than moral Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity must be professed,</hi> &amp;c.—Then it follows (or rather it is the same Thing) that Men must profess Religion with some <hi>Discrimination,</hi> or Marks of Difference in their Words, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing what is profess'd from moral Sincerity; contrary to what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> strenuously and frequently asserts. (P. 6. <hi>c. d.</hi> &amp; P. 9. <hi>c.</hi> &amp; many other Places) For if the Profession is made in Words that signify no <hi>Difference,</hi> then nothing <hi>different</hi> is signified or professed by those Words; and so nothing MORE; contrary to what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> also asserts.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="27" facs="unknown:006839_0032_102A662280B198D8"/>3. If it be as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, that <hi>the Scripture has deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd none ought to be admitted, but such as make an open Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and Declaration of an hearty Consent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, such as covenant with God with their whole Hearts, and profess Gospel-Holiness:</hi> Then the whole of my <hi>second</hi> Argument, concerning <hi>explicit Covenanting with God,</hi> is expresly allowed, in both <hi>Premises</hi> &amp; <hi>Consequence</hi>; Tho' Mr. <hi>W.</hi> seems at the same Time, with so much Labour and Earnestness, to militate against it. For the <hi>Premises</hi> are, that <hi>all ought openly and explicitly to own God's Covenant, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Terms of it:</hi> This is the same Thing that he asserts, as above. And the <hi>Consequence,</hi> or Thing which I infer'd from it, was, that all that are admitted ought to make a Profession of real Godliness: and this also he expresly and often allows.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Since 'tis supposed, that in order to Admission, Men <hi>ought to profess real Friendship to Christ, and Love to Him above the World, and to profess a proper Respect to Christ in their Hearts, as well as a true Notion of Him in their Heads</hi>; and that <hi>they ought to profess Gospel-Holiness, and not meerly moral Sincerity:</hi> Therefore the whole of what belongs to my <hi>third</hi> Argument, is allowed, both <hi>Premises</hi> &amp; <hi>Consequence.</hi> The <hi>Premises</hi> were, that <hi>the Nature of Things affords as much Reason for professing a proper Respect to Christ in the Heart, as a true Notion of Him in the Head:</hi> This he allows. What I endeavoured to <hi>infer</hi> from hence, was, that <hi>therefore Men ought to profess true Piety, and not only moral Sincerity:</hi> and this is also allowed by him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It appears, that the whole of my <hi>fourth</hi> Argument, both <hi>Premises</hi> and <hi>Consequence,</hi> is allowed. The <hi>Premises</hi> were that <hi>the Scripture reckons all visible Saints who are not truly pious, to be Hypocrites:</hi> This Mr <hi>W.</hi> expresly allows. (P. 25. <hi>e.</hi>) The <hi>Consequence</hi> I infer'd, was, that visible Saints are such as make a Profession of true Godliness, and not only moral Sincerity: This also is very fully allowed by him. (P. 139. <hi>a.</hi>)</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Since 'tis suppos'd, that when Christ's Rules are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, they that come to Sacraments, <hi>don't know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Hypocrites,</hi> but must <hi>look at such a Qualification in themselves,</hi> as Grace, and make such a <hi>Pretence,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Gospel Holiness</hi>; Therefore all is in Effect allowed, that
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006839_0033_102A66246FDF5F00"/>
I endeavoured from the latter Part of the 7th Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> which was to shew, that professing Christians in general, all those that said, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> both those that built on the <hi>Sand,</hi> and those that built on a <hi>Rock,</hi> were such as imagined themselves to have a saving Interest in Christ, and <hi>pretended</hi> to be his real Disciples, and made such a <hi>Profession.</hi> The same was what I endeavoured to shew from the Parable of the <hi>ten Virgins.</hi> And therefore All that I argued from thence is in like Manner allowed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Hence, in vain is all the Opposition Mr. <hi>W.</hi> makes to what I alledge from the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> from Chap. II. from the Story of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and other Parts of that Book, concerning the Manner &amp; Circumstances of the Admission of Members into the primitive Christian Church, and the Profession they made; seeing he grants the main Point I endeavoured to prove by it, <hi>viz.</hi> That they <hi>did make,</hi> and all adult Persons that are admitted into the Church, <hi>must make,</hi> a Profession <hi>of something</hi> MORE <hi>than moral Sincerity,</hi> even <hi>Gospel-Holiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. Hence, in vain is all he says in Opposition to my <hi>eighth</hi> Argument, taken from the Manner of the Apostles treating and addressing the primitive Churches in their <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles</hi>; since he does either expresly or virtually grant each of those three Things, which he himself reckons up as the Sum of what I intend under that Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) <hi>That the Apostles speak to the Churches, and of them, as supposing and judging them to be gracious Persons.</hi> (2.) <hi>That the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of these Churches had such an Opinion of Themselves.</hi> (3.) <hi>That they had this Judgment one of another.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> allows all these. He abundantly allows and asserts, that the Members of Churches are such as <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> supposed &amp; judged, and rationally judged, to be gracious Persons, by those that admit them; that they are taken in <hi>under that Notion,</hi> and <hi>from Respect to such a Character appearing on them</hi>; and that they are <hi>rationally judged to be so</hi> by their Fellow-Christians; and that they must <hi>look at such a Character in themselves,</hi> and must <hi>make such a Pretence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Since Mr. <hi>W.</hi> abundantly allows, that visible Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, must <hi>be believed in Charity to be truly pious</hi>; and that <hi>they are such as have the moral Image of Christ appearing in
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006839_0034_102A662924BCA5D8"/>

                  <p n="10">10. In like Manner, vain and to no Purpose is the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition He makes to my <hi>tenth</hi> Argument, from the Nature of <hi>Sacramental Actions,</hi> supposed in their Intent &amp; Signification to be a solemn Profession of those Things wherein real Piety consists, <hi>viz.</hi> a cordial Acceptance of Christ and his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; from thence arguing, that a Profession of these Things is necessary; and so inferring, that those who perform these Actions, should suppose themselves truly to accept of Christ: Since both these Things are in Effect granted, that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants must judge that they have sanctifying Grace, and also that they must profess Gospel-Holiness, a Compliance with the Call of the Gospel, and falling in with the Terms of Salvation proposed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="11">11.

Since Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself plainly supposes this very Thing, That <hi>Men ought to look at such a Qualification in Themselves,</hi> as Grace, and to <hi>inquire whether they have it, in order to determine whether they may present themselves to Christian Sacraments.</hi>

When it is so apparent, that there is no Pretence to any proper Discerning in the Case, nor any other Distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pleaded, than what is made by a Judgment of Charity: And when according to Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s own Scheme, Churches are obliged to make a Distinction, in the rational Judgment they pass, and to admit none, but what they judge to be true Saints; so that those who are <hi>Wheat,</hi> in the Eye of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only are to be admitted, and such as are <hi>Tares,</hi> in the Eye of their Judgment, are to be excluded.</p>

                     <hi>School,</hi> they must be supposed, in a reasonable Judgment, to have this Attainment already, and make a Pretence to it, and a solemn Profession of it, and must give moral Evidence that they have it, and must be admitted into the School under no other Notion than that of their being already pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd of it.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. If it be as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> expresly says, <hi>That Persons are not visible Saints without a credible Profession, Visibility and moral Evidence, not only of moral Sincerity, but true Holiness</hi> (P. 139.) Then all is wholly insignificant &amp; vain, that is said to prove, that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were visible Saints without any Evidence of such Holiness, by Reason of the Idolatry and gross and open Wickedness of vast Multitudes of 'em, who are yet called God's People: And so likewise, all that is said to prove, that the Members of the primitive Christian Church had no other Visibility of Saintship than they, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are grafted into the same Olive:</hi> And also all that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has said to prove, that many of the Members of the primitive Churches were as grossly wicked as they.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Since according to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> the Terms of Admission to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ordinances, were <hi>the same as to Christian Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, the like Profession and the same Visibility of Saintship required, and no other</hi>; as He strenuously asserts (P. 57. <hi>e.</hi> P. 61. <hi>e.</hi> &amp; P. 65. <hi>c</hi>) it will therefore follow from his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Concessions and Assertions, That none were, by God's Appointment, to come to the <hi>Passover,</hi> and to have their Children <hi>circumcised,</hi> but <hi>such as openly profess'd and declar'd that they were convinced of the Truth of God's Word, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it with all their Hearts</hi>; and <hi>profess'd a hearty Consent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace: such as covenanted with God with their whole Hearts, and gave up all their Hearts and Lives to Christ; such as subjected themselves to Christ with their whole Hearts, and gave up themselves to Him to be ruled, taught and led by Him; such as with all their Hearts cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the Mercy of God to enable them to keep Covenant; such as profess'd to love God above the World, and professed more than common Faith and moral Sincerity, even true Holiness, real Piety; and who gave moral Evidence, that they had such a Qualification; and were received to</hi> the Passover, &amp;c. <hi>under that Notion, and with Respect to such a Character appearing in

them,</hi> and <hi>apprehended</hi> to be in them.—And if these Things are so, what is become of the Argument from the Passover and Circumcision, against the Necessity of the Qualifications I have insisted on!</p>
                  <p n="20">20. To what Purpose does Mr. <hi>W.</hi> insist (P. 98. <hi>a.) That we read not a Word in Scripture about</hi> John the Baptist's <hi>making any Inquiry, whether the People he baptized made a credible Profession of true Piety?</hi> when He himself insists, that in Order to Admission to Christian Sacraments, <hi>Men must make a credible Profession of true Piety.</hi> And why does He urge (P. 96. <hi>e.</hi> &amp; P. 97.) That the Profession the People made which <hi>John</hi> baptized, did not imply that they had saving Repentance, but only an Engagement to repent, hereafter? when He himself holds, that in Order to Admission to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Men must <hi>profess something more than common Grace,</hi> and not only promise it hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. It makes nothing to any Point in Controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and Me, whether <hi>Judas</hi> partook of the Lord's Supper or no, since according to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s own fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Principles, as well as mine, he could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there <hi>under any other Notion than that of being truly pious, &amp; from Respect to such a Character appearing on Him, &amp; a credible Profession of Gospel-Holiness</hi>; and since he might not lawfully come without some Qualifications He had not, <hi>viz. Such a Friendship for Christ, as is above Lukewarmness,</hi> and above <hi>serving two Masters,</hi> Christ and Mammon, and <hi>a giving up all his Heart and Life to Christ,</hi> and <hi>a real Determination of his Judgment and Affections for Christ's Word,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. If it be true, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> allows, that Ministers and Churches ought not to admit adult Persons to Sacraments, without <hi>a pious Character appearing on them, and their professing and exhibiting moral Evidence of Gospel-Holiness,</hi> then no good Argument can be brought against such a Way of Admission, from the Success of Ministers in another Way, or in any Way whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Besides these plain and obvious Consequences of Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Concessions, some other Consequences will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be observed under particular Heads.</p>
                  <p>Thus Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has not only abundantly given up the main Point in that Controversy I have lately been engaged in,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006839_0039_102A66393B2DE700"/>
and the main Point which I have written in Defence of; but he has in Effect given up every Point belonging to the whole Controversy, every Thing material insisted on through that whole Book which he undertakes to answer. He has established every Part of the Scheme I have appear'd in, and every particular Argument I have used to confirm it; and answered, or overthrown every Argument which He brings, or pretends to support, against it. And I should have no further Occasion to say any Thing in Reply to Him, if He had not really, thro' great Part of his Performance, argued for other Things, opposite to those that have been rehears<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which He so strenuously insists belong to his Scheme; which arguing may seem to support another Scheme, tho' nothing akin to his, any otherwise than as his Scheme is indeed a Mixture of many Schemes, one clashing with, and destroying another; as will appear in the ensuing Part of this Reply.</p>

                  <head>SECTION III. The <hi>Inconsistence</hi> of the foremention'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions with the Lawfulness of <hi>unsanctified</hi> Persons coming to the Lord's Supper, and their Right to Sacraments in the Sight of God.</head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>W.</hi> in the Book under Consideration, which He entitles <hi>The true State of the Question,</hi> insists upon it that the Question to be debated is the Question Mr. <hi>Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi> debated in his Dispute with Dr. <hi>Mather</hi>; in whose Scheme Mr. <hi>W.</hi> declares himself to be. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> asserted, <hi>That it was lawful for some unsanctified Men to come to the Lord's Supper, and that they had a Right so to do in the Sight of God.</hi> And He declares that this was the Point in Dispute between Him and Dr. <hi>Mather</hi>; as in <hi>Appeal,</hi> P. 20.
<q>That which I am to shew is, that some unsanctified Men have a Right before God to the Lord's Supper.</q>
So Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> (who is so great an
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006839_0040_102A663AC4175148"/>
Author with Mr. <hi>W.</hi>) says in his Treatise <hi>on the Covenant,</hi> P. 244.
<q>That Faith which is the Condition of the Promise, is not the Condition <hi>in Foro dei</hi> [before God] of a Title to the Seal.</q>
And there (in the next P.) He insists, that <hi>'Tis a common Faith, that is believed by Men not justified,</hi> which gives this Title. Agreable to these Things Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says (P. 132. <hi>d.</hi>) Some Men have <hi>a lawful Right to the Sacrament without Sanctification.</hi> Which is the same Thing as to say, <hi>They have a Right in the Sight of God.</hi> For if they have <hi>no Right in the Sight of God</hi> to come to the Lord's-Supper, then <hi>it is not lawful in the Sight of God</hi> that they should come.</p>
                  <p>Here I would lay down this as a Maxim;</p>
                  <p>There is some inward Religion and Vertue or other, some Sincerity of Heart, either moral or saving, that is necessary to a Right to Sacraments in the Sight of God, and in Order to a lawful Coming to 'em. No Man, I trust, will say, that a Man has a Right in God's Sight, who has no Sort of Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Mind; and that meerly outward Sounds &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions give Him this Right in God's Sight, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any Property or Quality of Mind, and tho' this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Shew is join'd with the most horrid &amp; resolved secret Irreligion and Wickedness. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in particular utterly disclaims such Doctrine as this, in the 3 &amp; 4. Pages of his Preface, and always maintains that in Order to Men's law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Coming, they must be <hi>morally sincere</hi>; as there in his Preface, and also in P. 25. <hi>d. e.</hi> P. 27. <hi>c.</hi> P. 30. <hi>d</hi> P. 35. <hi>e.</hi> P. 111.—In P. 115. he supposes, that if a <hi>Man makes a Doubt of his moral Sincerity, no Divine will advise Him to come 'till he knows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having observed this, I now desire it may be considered, whether it be reasonable to suppose, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> does, that God would give Men that are without Grace, a lawful Right to Sacraments, so that this Qualification it self should be nothing necessary to a proper and rightful Claim to these Ordinances; and yet that he would wholly forbid 'em to come, and others to admit 'em, without their making some Pretence to it, and exhibiting moral Evidence that they have it: That moral Sincerity is the Qualification which by God's own Appointment invests Persons with a lawful Right to Sacraments, and that by his Institution nothing more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006839_0041_102A663EC4468B20"/>
to a lawful Right; and yet that He has commanded them not to come, nor others to allow 'em to come, without making a Profession of something <hi>more</hi> than moral Sincerity, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes that God requires us, before we admit Persons, to seek credible Evidence of true Piety, and to see to it that we have reasonable Ground to believe they have it; otherwise, not to allow 'em to come: and yet that God don't look on such a Qualification requisite in it self, when all is done, and that He has given 'em as true and lawful a Right to come without it, as with it. If God insists upon it, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes, that Members should be admitted <hi>under no other Notion</hi> than of their being truly godly, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> from Respect to such a Character appearing on them,</hi> is it not plain, that God looks on such a Character in itself requisite, in Order to a Person's being a rightful Subject of such a Privilege? If the Want of this Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion don't in the least hinder a Person's lawful Right to a Thing, on what Account can the Want of an Appearance of it and Pretence to it, warrant and oblige others to hinder his taking Possession of that Thing?</p>
                  <p>That we should be obliged to require a credible Pretence and Evidence of the Being of a Thing, in Order to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Purpose, the Being of which is not requisite to that Purpose; Or that some Evidence of a Thing should be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and yet withal no Necessity there should be any Foundation of such Evidence, in the Being of the Thing to be made evident; That it should be necessary for us to seek Evidence that something is true, and yet there be no Need in Order to the intended Purpose, that there be any such Truth to be made evident; — If these Things are the Dictates of common Sense, I am willing all that are possessed of any Degree of common Sense should be Judges.</p>
                  <p>If God has plainly reveal'd, that Gospel-Holiness is not necessary in it self in Order to Men's lawful Right to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> greatly insists, then his Churches need not <hi>believe it to be necessary</hi>; yea, 'tis their Duty <hi>to believe that 'tis</hi> not <hi>necessary,</hi> as 'tis their Duty to believe what God says to be true. But yet Mr. <hi>W.</hi> holds, that God forbids his Churches to admit any to Sacraments, unless they first have some rational Evidence obliging 'em <hi>to believe that
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006839_0042_102A6641F1B05640"/>
they have Gospel-Holiness.</hi> Now how palpable is the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, that we must be obliged to believe Men have a Qualification in Order to our suffering them to come, which yet at the same Time we need not believe to be necessary for 'em to have in Order to their Coming, but which God requires us to believe to be unnecessary? Or in other Words, that God has made it necessary for us to believe or suppose Men are truly pious, in Order to our lawfully allowing them to take the Sacraments, &amp; yet at the same Time requires us to believe no such Thing as their being pious is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in Order to their lawfully taking the Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> (whose Principles Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in Preface P. 3. <hi>a.</hi> declares himself to be fully establish'd in) not only says, that some unsanctified Men have <hi>a Right before God to the Lord's-Supper,</hi> but strongly asserts, over and over, <hi>that they are FIT to be admitted to the Lord's Supper, that they are DULY QUALIFIED, FIT MATTER for Church-Membership</hi> (Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. P. 15, 16.) and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> argues that <hi>such Qualifications as some unsanctified Men have, are SUFFICIENT to bring 'em into the Church.</hi> Now if it be so, what Business have we to demand Evidence or a Pretence of any Thing further? What Case in the World can be mention'd parallel to it, in any Nation or Age? Are there any such Kind of Laws or Regulations to be found in any Society, Nation, City or Family, Civil Society, military or academick, stated Society or occasional, that the Society should be required to insist on some credible Pretence and Evidence of a certain Qualification, in Order to Persons being admitted to the Privileges of the Society; prohibiting their being admitted <hi>under any other Notion</hi> than as Persons possess'd of that Qualification, or <hi>without a Respect in their Admission to such a Character ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing on them:</hi> and yet at the same Time, by the Laws of that very Society, or the Head of it, that Qualification is not necessary; but Persons are declared, without any such Qualification, to have a LAWFUL RIGHT, to be FIT MATTER, to be DULY QUALIFIED, and to have SUFFICIENT Qualifications to be admitted to these Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, without that Qualification?</p>

it, his Sight, and by his Institution, and yet the Church must not admit them unless they are truly pious in their Sight; then the Eye of Man must require higher Terms, than the infinitely holy Eye of God himself; they must look for something that the Eye of God looks not for, and which he judges them duly qualified without.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> when speaking of the Evidence, on which He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the Church ought to judge Persons to be real Saints, from Time to Time adds, that on such Evidence
<q>The Church is obliged, in their external Carriage, <hi>to treat 'em as Saints,</hi> and admit 'em to the external Privileges of the Church.</q>

If <hi>Sinners</hi> have as much of a lawful Right to these Privileges, as <hi>Saints,</hi> then why is giving them these Privileges a treating them <hi>as Saints,</hi> any more than as <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</hi> If it belongs to an ignorant Child, to be admitted into School, as much as one that is learned, then how is it treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him as one that is learned, to admit Him? Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> (P. 11. <hi>d. e.</hi>) giving a Reason why He that professes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the Truth of the Gospel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Sacraments, says,
<q>Tho' this Conviction may be only by moral Evidence and common Illumination, yet —the Church know not but 'tis done on a divine &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Discovery.</q>
But how can this be a Reason? What if the Church <hi>did know</hi> that it was not on a gracious Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, if the Man has a Right in the Sight of God without, and God has made it his Duty to come to Sacraments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out?

                  <head>SECTION IV. Concerning Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Notion of a publick Profession of Godliness in Terms of an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate</hi> and <hi>double</hi> Signification.</head>
                  <p>ACcording to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> the Profession of Godliness must be in Words not of a determinate Meaning, or <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Discrimination in the Meaning of the Words, obliging us to understand them of saving Religion.</hi> (P. 6. <hi>c. d.</hi>) They must make an <hi>open Declaration of their sincere Consent to the Terms of the Covenant, without any Discrimination, by which it can be determined, that the Consent signified by the Words is a gracious Consent.</hi> (P. 9. <hi>c.</hi>) And <hi>without any Marks of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or any Distinction in the Words, whereby we can be enabled to judge when they mean a saving Faith, and when a different one.</hi> (P. 10. <hi>c. e.</hi> P. 50. <hi>e.</hi> &amp; 53. <hi>c.</hi>) That <hi>nothing should be express'd in the Words of the Profession, but what some unsanctified Men may say, and speak true.</hi> (P. 47 <hi>e.</hi>) He supposes, that the primitive Christians in the Profession they made of Faith, did not <hi>speak only in that Sense, viz.</hi> so as to signify justifying Faith; and that <hi>the Persons admitted</hi> did not <hi>understand that their Profession was understood</hi> by those that admitted 'em, <hi>only in that Sense.</hi> (P. 58. <hi>c.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Agreable to this Notion of making a Profession in Words of indiscriminate Meaning, and professing Godliness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Godliness, and yet speaking true, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (in P. 44. <hi>d. e.</hi>) allows, <hi>that Men must be by Profession godly Persons, in order to come to the Sacrament</hi>; and yet in the next Sentence he denies, <hi>that Christian Grace it self is requisite in the Person who is to come to the Sacrament, or that the Dictate of his Conscience that he has it, is the Thing that gives him a Right to offer himself.</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="unknown:006839_0045_102A664924A10788"/>
And agreable to this last Clause, Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> (of whose Opinion Mr. <hi>W.</hi> professes himself fully to be) expresly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that a Man <hi>may and ought to come to the Lord's-Supper, tho' he knows himself to be in a natural Condition. (Doc. of Inst. Churches.</hi> P. 21. See also his Sermon on this Controversy. P. 13.) So that putting these Things together, it must be agreable to Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Scheme, that a Man has a Right to make a Profession of Godliness, without having Godliness, and without any Dictate of his Conscience that he has the Thing he professes, yea, tho' he knows he has it not! And all this is made out by the Doctrine of professing Godliness in Words that are ambiguous, and of two Meanings.</p>
                  <p>This Notion of a solemn Profession of Godliness, in Words of a double Meaning, <hi>without any Marks of Difference in their Signification,</hi> is the great Peculiarity of Mr <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Scheme; and in all his Controversy with me, this appears to be the main Hinge, the Crisis of the whole Affair. Therefore I would particularly consider it.</p>
                  <p>And for the greater Distinctness and Clearness, I will lay down certain Positions, as of most evident Truth; observing some of their no less plain and evident Consequences.</p>
                  <p>Position I. Words declare or profess nothing any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by their Signification: For to declare or profess something by Words, is to signify something by Words — And therefore if nothing is signified by Words of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Profession, nothing is really professed; and if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be professed, no more is professed than the Words of the Profession signify or import.</p>
                  <p>Posi. II. If a Man goes about to declare or profess any particular Thing by Words which have no distinguishing Signification, or without any Signs or discriminating Marks by which Men may be enabled to distinguish what he mean, his Words are vain to the pretended Purpose, and wholly fail of answering the End of Words, which is to convey the Thing meant to others Understanding, or to give Notice to others of the Thing that is to be supposed or understood <note n="*" place="bottom">The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> says, 1 Cor. xiv.7. <hi>Even Things without Life, giving sound, whether Pipe or Harp, except they give a Distinction in the Sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</hi> — Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> says, <hi>Hum. Und.</hi> Vol. 2. Edit. 7. P. 103.
<q>He that uses Words of any Language without DISTINCT Ideas in his Mind, to which he applies them, does so far as he uses them in Discourse, only make a Noise without any Sense or Signification.</q>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:006839_0046_102A664AF3E16AF8"/>Therefore to use Words thus in common Conversation, is to act in a vain trifling Manner, more like Children than Men: But to use Words thus in the s<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>red Services of God's House, and solemn Duties of his Worship, is something much worse than Children's Play. But thus Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly declares, Words are to be used in a publick Profession of Religion. He says (P. 10. <hi>c.</hi>)
<q>And these Words are so used in such Cases, without any Marks of Difference, whereby we are enabled to judge when they mean a sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, and when a different one.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Posi. III. A Profession made in Words that are either equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal, or general, equally signifying several distinct Things, without any Marks of Difference or Distinction, by which we are enabled to judge which is meant, is not a Profession or Siginfication of <hi>any one</hi> of those several Things; nor can they afford any rational Ground of understanding or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending any <hi>particular Thing.</hi> Thus for Instance, if a Man using an equivocal Term, should say, that such an Evening a King was in that Room, without any Marks of Difference or Discrimination whatsoever, by which Others could discern whether by a <hi>King,</hi> he meant the Ruler of a Kingdom, or a King used in a Game of Chess: The Word thus used would be no Declaration, that the Head of a Kingdom was there at such a Time; nor would they give any Notice of any such Thing to those to whom he spoke, or give them any rational Ground to understand or judge any such Thing.</p>
                  <p>Or if a Man should use a <hi>general</hi> Term, comprehending various particular Sorts, without at all distinguishing or pointing forth any one particular Sort, he thereby professes no one particular Sort. Thus if a Man professes that he has Metal in his Pocket, not saying what Sort of Metal, whether Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron, Lead, or Tin; his Words are no Profession that he has Gold.</p>
                  <p>So if a Man professes Sincerity or Religion, designedly using Terms of double Signification, or (which comes to the same Things) of general Signification, equally signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006839_0047_102A664F580EC870"/>
two entirely distinct Things, either <hi>moral Sincerity,</hi> or <hi>real Piety,</hi> His Words are no Profession of real Piety; he makes no credible Profession, and indeed no Profession at all of <hi>Gospel-Holiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Posi. IV. If a Man who knows himself to be destitute of any certain Qualification, yet makes a Profession or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in Words of double Meaning, equally signifying that Qualification, and something else very different, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to recommend himself to others Judgment and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, as possess'd of that Qualification, he is guilty of deceitful Equivocation. This is the Notion of deceitful Equivocation, <hi>viz.</hi> the using Words of double Meaning, or capable of double Application, with a Design to induce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to judge something to be true, which is not true. But he that goes about to recommend himself by such Terms to others Opinion or Judgment, as being what he at the same Time knows he is not, endeavours to induce 'em to believe what he knows is not true, which is to deceive 'em.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q>To advance a dubious Proposition, knowing it will be understood in a Sense different from what you give it in your Mind, is an <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> in Breach of good Faith &amp; Sincerity.</q>
                        <hi>Chambers's</hi> Dictionary under the Word <hi>Equivocation.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Scheme which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> undertakes to defend, were true, it would follow that such a Kind of Equivocation as this (be it far from us to suppose it) is what the infinitely wise and holy God has instituted to be publickly made use of in the solemn Services of his House, as the very Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Persons Admission to the external Privileges of his People! For Mr. <hi>W.</hi> abundantly asserts, that Persons must be <hi>esteemed</hi> in the <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Apprehension</hi> of Others to have true Piety; and that one Thing that must <hi>be done in Order to it,</hi> one Thing pertaining to the moral Evidence that <hi>recommends</hi> 'em to this Judgment, is the Profession they make of Religion. (P. 5. P. 139. P. 47, <hi>b, c.</hi> P. 132. P. 44. <hi>d.</hi>) In P. 42, speaking of the Profession of visible Christians, he has these Words,
<q>And 'tis from the Nature and Purport of this Profession, we say, the Church is to judge the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to be wise Virgins or what they make a Show of.</q>
And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> insists upon it, that according to Christ's Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, this must be in Words equally signifying true Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006839_0048_102A66525E6A4140"/>
and something else, without any Discrimination or Marks of Difference.—This is the Scheme! And certainly such a Doctrine of deceitful Equivocation in the publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Religion, is more agreable to the Principles and Practices of a Religion I am loth to name, than the true Religion of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, (P. 35. <hi>d.</hi>)
<q>I am at a Loss to conceive how it will help the Cause of Truth to represent those who are of Mr. <hi>S—'s</hi> Opinion, as teaching Men that they may enter into Covenant with God with known and allowed Guile.</q>
Supposing I had made such a Representation, I can tell him how it would have helped the Cause of Truth (as i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> would be speaking nothing but the Truth) if he be one of Mr. <hi>Stoddard's</hi> Opinion (as he says he is) and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents his own Opinion truly.</p>
                  <p>But let the Unreasonableness of this Notion of professing Gospel-Holiness in Words of two Meanings, without any Discrimination or Mark of Difference, be a little further considered. Since 'tis allowed, that <hi>Gospel-Holiness</hi> is the Thing which is to be exhibited in the Profession, and there are Words which signify this by a determinate Meaning, why must they needs be avoided, and Words of doubtful and double Signification only be made use of? <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (P. 6. <hi>d. e.</hi>) speaks of a Profession in Terms of indiscriminate Signification, when not contradicted in Life, as <hi>The sole, entire Evidence, which the Church, as a Church, is to have, by divine Appointment, in Order to that publick Judgment it is to make of the Saintship of Men.</hi>
                     </note> Since the Design of the Profession is to exhibit to others Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that very Thing; if the proper &amp; distinguishing Names of that must nevertheless be avoided in the Profession, and this, for that very Reason, that they point forth to others Understanding that very Thing by a determinate Meaning; then we are brought to this gross Absurdity, <hi>viz.</hi> That the End of a Profession is to exhibit to others Understanding and reasonable Judgment a <hi>particular Qualification</hi>; but at the same Time such Words only must be made Use of as do not distinctly point forth to others Understanding &amp; Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <hi>particular Qualification.</hi> The Church are to seek and demand a Profession, that shall <hi>determine their rational Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; but yet are designedly to avoid such a Profession, as
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006839_0049_102A665673572870"/>
shall <hi>determine their Understandings.</hi>— Be it far from us to attribute to the alwise God any such absurd &amp; inconsistent Constitution.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, <hi>Charity obliges the Church to understand the Words of the Professors in the most favourable Sense.</hi> But Charity does not oblige us to understand their Words in any other Sense than that in which they professedly use them. But in Churches which professedly act on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Scheme (if any such there be) the Professors who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, professedly use ambiguous Words, or Words equally signifying two entirely distinct Things, without Discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Marks of Difference; and therefore Charity obliges us to understand their Words no otherwise, than as signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that they have one or other of those two Things; and not that they have One in particular: for their Words don't signify this, in the Sense they professedly use them. If a Man that is indebted to me, professes that he has either Gold or Brass, which he promises to pay Me; or if he uses an equivocal or general Term, that equally, and without Marks of Difference, signifies either one or the other; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may oblige Me to believe what he says, which is that he has either Gold or Brass: But no Charity obliges me to believe that he has Gold, which he does not say.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Description of such a Profession as Christ has instituted, in Order to Admission to Sacraments, often mentions two Things, <hi>viz.</hi> A Profession of something <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> a present <hi>believing in Christ, and cordial Consent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> &amp;c. And a Promise of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>future.</hi> And with Regard to the latter, he is very full in it, that what is promised for Time to come is <hi>sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, Repentance and Obedience.</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Pref. (P. 3. <hi>d. e.</hi> &amp; 5. <hi>d.</hi> P. 24. <hi>b.</hi> 25. <hi>b.</hi> 22. <hi>d.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>d.</hi>
                     </note> Now what Reason can be given why we should use Words of double Meaning in the former Part of the Profession more than in the latter. Seeing Mr. <hi>W.</hi> allows that we must <hi>profess</hi> Gospel-Holiness as well as <hi>promise</hi> it, and seeing we may and must make Use of Words of indiscriminate &amp; double Meaning in professing present Gospel Holiness, why should not we do so too in promising what is future; and so equivocate in our solemn Vows and Oaths as the Papists do? If Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, 'tis
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006839_0050_102A66590530CFC8"/>
very hard for Men to discern the Discrimination between moral Sincerity and Gospel-Holiness; I answer, there is as much Need to discern the Difference in Order understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to promise Gospel-Holiness with Discrimination, as to profess it with Discrimination.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says (P. 8. <hi>b. c.</hi>)
<q>'Tis a received Rule among Mankind, in all publick Judgments, to interpret Words in the most extensive and favourable Sense, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Words or Expressions will bear.</q>
I know not what he means: But if he means (as he must, if he means any Thing to the Purpose) that 'tis a received Rule amongst Mankind, to trust, or accept, or at all regard any Professions or Declarations that Men make, with professed Design, in Words of double and indiscriminate Meaning, without any Marks of Difference by which their Meaning can be known, for that very End that they may be used with a safe Conscience, tho' they have no Dictates of their own Consciences, that they have that which others are to believe they have; I say, if this be a received Rule among Mankind, 'tis a Rule that Mankind has lately received from Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Heretofore Mankind, Societies or particular Persons, would have been counted very foolish for regarding such Professions. Is this the Way in earthly Kingdoms, in Professions of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to temporal Princes, in Order to their Admission to the Privileges of good Subjects? Do they choose equivocal Terms to put into their Oaths of Allegiance, to that End that Men may use 'em and speak true, tho' they are secret Enemies? — There are two Competitors for the Kingdom of this World, <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi>; The Design of a publick Profession of Religion is, to declare on which Side Men are. And is it agreable to the Custom of Mankind in such Cases, to make Laws that no other than ambiguous Words shall be used, or to accept of such in Declarations of this Kind? There are two Competitors for the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> King GEORGE, and the <hi>Pretender:</hi> Is it the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of King <hi>George</hi> and the <hi>British</hi> Parliament, that Men should take Oaths of Allegiance, contrived in Words of indeterminate Signification, to the End that Men who are in their Hearts Enemies to King <hi>George,</hi> and Friends to the <hi>Pretender,</hi> may use them and speak true? And certainly
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006839_0051_102A665BA2240938"/>
Mankind, those of 'em that have common Sense, never in any Affairs of Life look on such Professions worth a Rush. Would Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself, if tried, in any Affair wherein his temporal Interest is concerned, trust such Professions as these? If any Man that he has Dealings with, should profess to him that he had pawn'd for him, in a certain Place, an <hi>Hundred Pounds,</hi> evidently, yea professedly using the Expression as an ambiguous one, so that there is no understanding by it, what is pawn'd there, whether an <hi>Hundred Pound</hi> in Money, or an 100 Weight of Stones: If he should inquire of the Man what he meant, and he should reply, you have no Business to <hi>search my Heart,</hi> or to go to <hi>turn my Heart inside out</hi>; you are obliged in Charity to understand my Words <hi>in the most favourable Sense</hi>; would Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in this Case stick to his own <hi>received Rule?</hi> Would he regard such a Profession, or run the Venture of one <hi>six-Pence</hi> upon it? Would he not rather look on such a Man as affronting Him, and treating Him as tho' He would make a Fool of Him? And would not he know, that every Body else would think him a Fool, if he should suffer himself to be gull'd by such Professions, in Things which concern his own private Interest? And yet it seems, this is the Way in which he thinks he ought to conduct himself as a Minister of Christ, and one intrusted by him in Affairs wherein his Honour and the Interests of his Kingdom are concerned.</p>
                  <p>And now I desire it may be judg'd by such as are possess'd of human Understanding, and are not disabled by Prejudice from exercising it, whether this Notion of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. <hi>W—ms's,</hi> of making a solemn Profession of Gospel-Holiness in Words of indiscriminate Meaning, ben't too absurd to be received by the Reason God has given Mankind. — This peculiar Notion of his is apparently the Life &amp; Soul of his Scheme; the main Pillar of his Temple, on which the whole Weight of the Building rests; which if it be broken, the whole falls to the Ground, and buries the Builder, or at least his Work, in its Ruins. For if this Notion of his be disprov'd, then, in as much as 'tis agreed, that true Godliness must be profess'd, it will follow, that it must be profess'd in Words properly signifying the Thing by a determinate Meaning, which therefore no ungodly Men can use,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006839_0052_102A665D6C6858E0"/>
and speak true; and that therefore Men must have true Godliness in order to a Right in the Sight of God to make such Profession, and to receive the Privileges depending thereon: which implies and infers all those Principles of mine which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> opposes in his Book, and confutes all that he says in Opposition to them.</p>

that continues in a natural Condition, who throughly believes that Truth</hi>; i. e. that Men may be saved by Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. (<hi>ibid.</hi> P. 4. <hi>d.</hi> &amp; P. 5. <hi>d, e.</hi>) That <hi>common Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination don't convince Men of the Truth of the Gospel.</hi> (Benef. of the Gosp. P. 148, 149.) How then could it be the Doctrine Mr. <hi>S.</hi> taught, that natural Men may really and with all their Hearts believe and be convinced of the Truth of the Gospel?</p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself in his Sermons on <hi>Christ a King and Witness.</hi> (P. 114, 115.) says,
<q>Man since the Fall is naturally ignorant of divine Truth, and an Enemy to it, and full of Prejudices against the Truth:</q>
and says further, (<hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 114.)
<q>The renewing of the Holy Ghost makes an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Change of the Heart and Life.—He knows the Doctrine contain'd in the Bible in a new Manner. —Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He had a View of the Truth as a <hi>doubtful uncertain Thing</hi>; He received it as a Thing which was probably true;—and perhaps for the most Part it appeared some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing likely to answer the End proposed.—But now the Gospel appears to him <hi>divinely true</hi> and <hi>real,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
But how do these Things consist with Men's being before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, sincerely and with all their Hearts convinced of the divine Truth of the Gospel? Can that be, and yet Men <hi>view it as a doubtful uncertain Thing,</hi> it not yet appearing to 'em <hi>divinely true and real?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes, that some unsanctified Men may speak true, and profess <hi>an hearty Consent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, a Compliance with the Call of the Gospel, Submission to the Proposals of it, Satisfaction with that Device for our Salvation that is reveal'd in the Gospel, and with the Offer which God makes of himself to be our God in Christ Jesus, A fervent Desire of Christ and the Benefits of the Covenant of Grace, and an earnest Purpose and Resolution to seek Salvation on the Terms of it,</hi> (P. 11. <hi>c) and a falling in with the Terms of Salvation proposed in the Gospel, with a renouncing of all other Ways</hi> (which He speaks of as agreable to Mr. <hi>Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi>'s Opinion. P. 32. <hi>b. c.</hi>) Quite contrary to the current Doctrine of Calvinistic Divines; contrary to the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Guthrie</hi> whom he cites as a Witness in his Favour (<hi>Pref.</hi> P. 4.) who insists on Satisfaction with that Device for our
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006839_0054_102A6661DD61BE68"/>
Salvation which is revealed in the Gospel, and with the Offer which God makes of himself to be our God in Christ, as the peculiar Nature of saving Faith. And contrary to the Principles of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> (another Author he quotes as his Voucher) deliver'd in these very Words, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> cites in the present Point (P. 11.)
<q>That a Desire of the Favour and Mercy of God in Christ, and the Means to attain that Favour, is a special Grace of God, and hath the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Blessedness:—That wicked Men can't sincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire these Means of eternal Life, <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, Reconciliation, &amp;c.</q>
And exceeding contrary to the constant Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> (tho' He says it was his Opinion) Who ever insisted, that all unconverted Sinners under the Gospel are so far from heartily consenting to the Covenant of Grace, and complying with the Call of the Gospel, and falling in with the Terms of Salvation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in it, renouncing all other Ways, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes, That they are willful Rejecters of Christ, Despisers of the Gospel, and obstinate Refusers of offered Mercy. So He says,
<q>The Man that has but common Grace—sets himself against the Way of Salvation which God prescribes.</q>
(<hi>Nat. of Sav. Conv.</hi> P. 10. <hi>b.</hi>)
<q>In awakened Sinners, 'tis not meerly from Weakness, but from Pride and Sturdiness of Spirit, that they don't come to Christ.</q>
(<hi>Safety of Ap.</hi> P. 229. <hi>c. d.</hi>) And in other Places he says, That it is <hi>from the Hardness and Stubbornness of natural Men's Hearts,</hi> that they don't comply with the Gospel: That <hi>there is a mighty Opposition in their Hearts to believe in Christ,</hi> because it is <hi>cross to their haughty Spirit:</hi> That they are <hi>Enemies to this Way of Salvation</hi>: That they <hi>are dreadfully averse to come to Christ.</hi> (See Book <hi>of</hi> 3 <hi>Sermons.</hi> P. 84. <hi>Guide to Christ.</hi> P. 55. <hi>c. Safety of Ap.</hi> P. 106. &amp; 194. <hi>e.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>And this Scheme of our Author is in a no less glaring Manner contrary to the Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> himself, in his Sermon on <hi>Isai.</hi> xlv.11. (P. 25, 26, 27.) Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to those <hi>whose Natures remain unrenewed &amp; unsanctified</hi> (See his Words P. 25. <hi>d.</hi>) he says, P. 27. <hi>b. c.</hi>
                     <q>You are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all the Means of your own Deliverance &amp; Salvation. The Offers of Grace, the Allurements &amp; Invitations of the great Saviour of the World, have all been ineffectual to persuade you to accept of Deliverance from a Slavery
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006839_0055_102A6666C9528538"/>
you are willingly held in. Nay, you strive against the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Sons of God, and labour to find out all Manner of Difficulties and Hindrances in the Way of it. If you pray for it, you don't desire it should yet come, but would stay a While longer.</q>
And are these the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who can truly profess, that they comply with the Call of the Gospel, and submit to the Proposals of it, and are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Device for our Salvation, and with the Offers of the Gospel, and consent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace <hi>with all their Hearts,</hi> renouncing all other Ways?— 'Tis not much more easy to make these Things consist with what he says in his Answer to Mr. <hi>Croswell.</hi> (P. 26. <hi>b. c.</hi>) He there says,
<q>There is not a Son nor Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> excluded from Salvation, who will accept Christ upon God's Offer, and take him in his Person and Offices, and whole Work of Redemption, to be their Saviour, and they find themselves willing to accept of Christ as so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them, and PLEASED WITH THAT DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VICE for their Salvation, and heartily chusing Him to be to them and in them, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Redemption.</q>
(See also to the same Purpose, <hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 32. <hi>e.</hi> &amp; P. 33. <hi>a. b.</hi> &amp; P. 94. <hi>c.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> tho' he holds, that 'tis lawful for some unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Men to come to Sacraments, yet supposes it not to be lawful for those that are <hi>Lukewarm</hi> in Religion to come. (P. 35. <hi>d. e.</hi>) So that according to his Scheme some unsanctified Professors are above <hi>Lukewarmness:</hi> that is to say, their Hearts within 'em are truly hot or fervent with Christian Zeal, and they such as Christ will never spue out of his Mouth; in a great Inconsistence with the Scripture. He suggests, that it is an Injury done to the Cause of Truth, in Me, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> as being of another Opinion. (P. 35 <hi>c. d. e.</hi>) But let us see whether such a Representation be an Injury to Truth or no. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> taught, that natural Men have <hi>no Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in 'em.</hi> (Guide to Christ. P. 60.61.) That <hi>their Hearts are dead as a Stone, that there is no Disposition or Inclination to any Thing that is good, but a total Emptiness of all Goodness.</hi> (Ibid. P. 63. <hi>b.</hi>) That <hi>some of them have considerable Shews of Goodness, there is an Appearance of good Desires,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but there is nothing of Goodness in all this; that all they do is in Hypocrisy.</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="unknown:006839_0056_102A6668B9A6CDE8"/>
Benef. of the Gos. P. 73. <hi>d. c.</hi>) That <hi>they are acted by a Lust of Self-love in all their Religion;—If they are swept &amp; garnish'd, they are empty: There may be some Similitude of Faith &amp; Love, but no Reality, not a Spark of Goodness in their Hearts; tho' Corruption may be restrain'd, yet it reigns.</hi> He speaks abundantly to the same Purpose in his Sermon, entitled, <hi>Natural Men are under the Government of Self-Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> himself in his Sermon on <hi>Psal.</hi> xci.1. describing carnal Men, by which He means the same with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Men (as is evident thro' the Book, particularly P. 36. <hi>c.</hi>) he says, P. 27, 28. That to such
<q>Religion looks like a dull unpleasant Kind of Exercise, and so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the sensual Joys and Pleasures which they chuse, that they <hi>hate</hi> to set about it, as long as they dare let it alone; and would do as <hi>little</hi> as ever they can at it: — That when they durst not let it alone any longer, they set about it, but would fain dispatch it as <hi>soon,</hi> and as <hi>easily</hi> as they can; because it seems to them a <hi>miserable uncomfortable</hi> Sort of Life. Ask your own Conscience (say, He) see if this be not the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Case.</q>
—Now let the Reader judge, whether this be a Description of Persons whom it would be injurious to represent as having nothing above <hi>Lukewarmness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Thing, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes must be professed in Order to come to Sacraments, and therefore according to Him is what an unsanctified Man can profess, and speak <hi>true,</hi> is, "That they <hi>with all their Hearts cast themselves upon the Mercy of God,</hi> to help 'em to keep Covenant." (P. 31. <hi>e.</hi> &amp; P. 32. <hi>a.</hi>) And yet elsewhere He mentions a depending on Christ for Things of this Nature, as a discriminating Mark of a true Christian. (Ser. on <hi>Christ a King &amp; Witness.</hi> P. 19. <hi>c.</hi>) Under a Use of Examination, he there says,
<q>Do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Christ to protect you from all your spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to restore you to Holiness, to subdue all your Heart to the Will of God, to make you Partakers of his Image and moral Perfections, and in that Way to preserve and lead you to your true Perfection &amp; eternal Happiness?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes (P. 36. <hi>a, b, c.</hi>) that the Profession Men must make in Order to come to Sacraments, implies <hi>real Friendship</hi> to God, <hi>loving God more than his Enemies, loving
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:006839_0057_102A666CB864DBF0"/>
Him above the World</hi>; and therefore according to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Men may make this Profession also, <hi>and speak true:</hi> Contrary to the whole Current of Scripture, which represents unsanctified Men as <hi>the Enemies of God, those that have not the Love of God in them,</hi> under the Power of a <hi>carnal Mind,</hi> &amp;c.—And contrary to the unanimous Voice of all sound Divines, yea, of the whole Christian World. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in the foremention'd Place blames Me, that I had intimated (as He supposes) that the Profession which Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> taught to be necessary, did not imply <hi>real Friendship, and loving God above his Enemies, and above the World.</hi> Let us then compare this with Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> Doctrine, as that is extant in his Writings. He speaks of it as a <hi>Property of saving Grace, wherein it specifically differs from common Grace, that a true Love to God prizes God above all the World.</hi> (Nat. of Sav. Conv. P. 7. <hi>b. c.) That every natural Man prefers. vain and base Things before God.</hi> (Ibid. P. 96. <hi>b.) That they are all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, and the very Being of God.</hi> (Ibid. P. 5. <hi>c. d.</hi> and P. 97.) <hi>That their Hearts are full of Enmity to God.</hi> (Ibid. P. 55. <hi>e) That they have an Aversion to those gracious Actions of loving God, and trusting in Christ, and are under the Dominion of a contrary Inclination.</hi> (Ibid. P. 67.) <hi>That those of 'em whose Consciences are enlightn'd, and are reforming their Lives, have no Love; and that it is a Burden to 'em that they suspect there is such a God, that they wish there was not such an One.</hi> And <hi>that they are Haters of God, and are so addicted to their own Interest, that they have a bitter Spirit towards God, have an ill Affection to Him, and are Adversaries to his Felicity.</hi> (Ibid. P. 97. Three Serm. P. 38, 39.) <hi>That they are govern'd by a Spirit of Self-Love, and are wholly destitute of Love to God; That some of 'em do confess that they have but little Love to God; but indeed they have not one Spark of Love to God in their Hearts.</hi> (Three Serm. P. 48) <hi>That they set their Interest at the Right Hand of God's Glory,—as if God's Honour were not to be regarded, compared with their Interest,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. (Ibid. P. 62, 63.)</p>
                  <p>So Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself (<hi>Christ a King and Witness,</hi> P. 145. <hi>e.</hi>) plainly supposes, that before Conversion Men love the World more than God. For, speaking of the Nature of the Change wrought in Conversion, he says, <hi>Things are quite turn'd about, God and Christ are got into the Place the World
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006839_0058_102A666E436BB798"/>
had before.</hi> Again (<hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 18. <hi>b.</hi>) he says,
<q>You must know that there is no Man who is not either a true Subject to Christ, or his Enemy. That Man who don't submit to Christ as his King and Lord, by bearing true Faith and Allegiance to him, is the Enemy of Christ &amp; his Kingdom. Such are all they who will not depend on him, believe in him, give up themselves, and all to him.</q>
And again, (P. 106. <hi>e.</hi> 107. <hi>a.</hi>)
<q>Man since the Fall has a natural Unlikeness to God, and <hi>hates</hi> the Holiness and Purity of the Divine Nature.</q>
And in his Sermon on <hi>Isa.</hi> xlv.11. He says to his Hearers, <hi>If your Nature remain unrenewed and unsanctified,—you are the Enemies of God and Christ by wicked Works, and an impure Heart.</hi>—But yet now it seems, some of these may profess <hi>real Friendship to Christ, and loving him above the World,</hi> and speak true.</p>
                  <p>And these Things are no less inconsistent with what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says in the very Book under Consideration. He here says, (P. 36.)
<q>Why should any Divine now tell us, that these same Professions don't imply that there are any Pretences of any real Friendship, that they import no Pretence of loving God more, yea, not so much as his Enemies, no Pretence to love God above the World?</q>
When He himself is the Divine that tells us so, or plainly supposes so in this very Book of his. For, in P. 8, 9. having mention'd the Profession Communicants may be required to make, he then says, that <hi>such a Profession contains all that is essential to true Religion in it; And if this is the Fruit of the Love of God, it is true Godliness:</hi> Plainly supposing, that Persons may have these Things without the Love of God; as the Reader will see more evidently if he views the Place. So that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession must imply real Friendship, and Love to God, even above the World; and yet must contain only such Things as may be with or without the Love of God, indiscriminately.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> allows, that in Order to come to Sacraments Men ought to profess a <hi>Subjection to Christ with all their Hearts,</hi> (P. 10. <hi>d.) &amp; to be devoted to the Service of God,</hi> (P. 49. <hi>d.) &amp; to give up themselves to Christ, to be taught, ruled &amp; led by Him in a Gospel-Way to Salvation.</hi> (P 31. <hi>e</hi> &amp; P. 32. <hi>a.</hi>) And tho' He and Mr <hi>Stoddard</hi> taught, that it is lawful for some unsanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men to come to Sacraments, yet Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes it to be
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:006839_0059_102A667100592068"/>
unlawful for any to come to Sacraments <hi>serving two Masters</hi>; and says, Mr. S. <hi>taught that they ought to covenant with God with their whole Hearts, and give up all their Hearts &amp; Lives to Christ.</hi> We are therefore to understand Mr. <hi>W.</hi> that some unsanctified Men can profess all these Things, <hi>and speak true.</hi> Strange Doctrine for a Christian Divine! Let us see whether Mr. <hi>S.</hi> taught such Doctrine. He taught, that <hi>Faith in Christ is the first Act of Obedience, that any Sinner does perform; that it is by Faith that a Man first gives himself to be God</hi>'s <hi>Servant.</hi> (Safety of App. P. 228. <hi>e.</hi> P. 229. <hi>a.</hi>) That <hi>all those that are not converted, are under the Dominion of Sin, Enemies to</hi> God. (<hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 5. <hi>c. d.</hi>) That <hi>there is no Obedience to God in what they do,</hi> who have only common Grace; That <hi>they don't attend the Will of God. (Ibid.</hi> P. 7. <hi>d.</hi>) That <hi>all ungodly Men are Servants of Satan, and live in a Way of Rebellion against God.</hi> (Ibid. P. 94. <hi>b.</hi>) That <hi>they are Enemies to the Authority of God; to the Wisdom, Power &amp; Justice of God, yea, to the very Being of God; they have a Preparedness of Heart to all Wickedness that is committed in the VVorld, if God did not restrain 'em; that if they were in the Circumstances that the fallen Angels are in they would be as the very Devils</hi>; (Ibid. P. 95.) That <hi>their Hearts are like the Hearts of Devils, as full of Sin as a Toad is full of Poison, having no Inclination to any Thing that is good.</hi> (Guide to Christ, P. 68. See also Benef. of the Gos. P. 130. <hi>a. b.</hi>) That <hi>they utterly neglect the End they were made for, and make it their Business to serve themselves; they care not whether God's Glory sinks or swims.</hi> (Three Sermons P. 62.) That <hi>they hate God, because God crosses them in his Laws.</hi> (Ibid. P. 38. <hi>c.</hi>) These are the Men, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes must, and may (some of 'em) truly profess a Subjection to Christ with all their Hearts, and to be devoted to Christ; and the Men which he would bear us in Hand, that Mr <hi>S.</hi> taught, might co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God with their whole Hearts, and give up all their Hearts and Lives to Christ. Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> taught, that <hi>Men that have but common Grace, go quite in another Path than that which God directs to,</hi>—That <hi>they set themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Way of Salvation God prescribed</hi>; (Safety, P. 10.) That <hi>Man in his natural State is an Enemy to the Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>; That <hi>he is an Enemy to the Law of God, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</hi> (Ibid. P. 106. <hi>b. c.</hi>) But yet these, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006839_0060_102A6673C308CF48"/>
Mr. <hi>W.</hi> may <hi>truly</hi> profess a Subjection to Christ with all their Hearts, and give up themselves to him, to be taught ruled and led by him in a Gospel-Way of Salvation. Yet if we believe him, we must have the Trouble of disbelieving him again; for in these Things he is as inconsistent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as he is with Mr. <hi>S.</hi>—For in his Serm. on <hi>Isai.</hi> xlv.11. (P. 26, 27.) he says to those whose Natures are <hi>unrenewed and unsanctified,</hi>
                     <q>If you are without Christ, you are in a State of Slavery to Sin, led about of divers Lusts, <note n="†" place="bottom">And yet now it seems, some such do serve but one Master, and give up themselves to Christ to be led by Him.</note> and under the reigning Power and Dominion of your Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which debase your Souls, and bring them down from the Dignity of their Nature, to the vilest, most shameful and accursed Bondage.— And by Means of Sin, ye are in Bondage to the Devil, the most hateful and accursed Enemy of God and your own Souls;—And are opposing all the Means of your own Deliverance The Offers of Grace, the Calls and Invitations of the Gospel have all been ineffectual to persuade you to accept of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from a Slavery you are willingly held in. Nay, you strive against the Liberty of the Sons of God.</q>
And yet some of these are (if we believe what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> now says) such as are subject to Christ with all their Hearts, give up all their Hearts and Lives to Christ, and give up themselves to be taught, ruled and led by him in a Gospel-Way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Sermons on <hi>Christ a King and Witness,</hi> (P. 81.) under a Use of Examination, giving Marks of Trial, says,
<q>Have you unreservedly given up your Souls and Bodies to Him? [<hi>viz.</hi> Christ] You must be all Christ's, and have NO OTHER MASTER. You must be given to him without Reserve, both in Body &amp; Spirit, which are His</q>
But now it seems, these are no discriminating Evidences of true Piety: He says, (<hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 118.)
<q>A Man naturally hates God should Reign.</q>
And (P. 119. <hi>c.</hi>) speaking of the natural Man, he says,
<q>He hates to be controul'd, &amp; in all Things subjected to God;—he really owns no God but himself</q>
But if so, then certainly he is not subject to God with all his Heart.</p>
                  <p>Our Author in the Book more especially attended to, says, (P. 31. <hi>d, e.</hi>) He <hi>knows of no Body who has any Controversy
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006839_0061_102A667591272CA0"/>
with me in</hi> what he calls <hi>my loose Way of arguing,</hi> in my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<q>The Nature of Things seems to afford no good Reason why the People of Christ should not openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess a proper Respect to him in their Hearts, as well as a true Notion of him in their Heads.</q>
And then, in that and the following Page, proceeds to shew what Respect Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and those that think with him, suppose Men must profess in Order to come to the Lord's Supper; and (in P. 33. <hi>a.</hi>) speaks of such a Profession as equally honourable to Christ, with a Profession of saving Grace. And as according to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> no Profession discriminating what is profess'd from common Grace, can be required, so common Grace must be supposed to be a <hi>proper Respect to Christ in the Heart.</hi> Now let us see what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> says.
<q>There is (says he) an Opposition between saving and common Grace; — they have a Contrariety one to another, and are at War one with the other, and would destroy one the other.— Common Graces are LUSTS, and do oppose saving Grace.</q>
(<hi>Nat. of Sav. Conv.</hi> P. 9. <hi>d, e.</hi>)
<q>Men that are in a natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, — such of 'em as are addicted to Morality and Religion, are serving their LUSTS therein. The most orderly natural Men do live an <hi>ungodly</hi> Life;—yea, their <hi>very Religion is Iniquity.</hi>
                     </q>
(Ibid. P. 96, 97.)—
<q>Their best Works are not only sinful, but <hi>properly Sins</hi>; they are acted by a SPIRIT OF LUST in all that they do.</q>
(<hi>Saf. of App.</hi> P. 168. <hi>d.</hi>) —
<q>Moral Vertues don't render Men acceptable to God; for tho' they look like Vertues, yet they are LUSTS.</q>
(<hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 81.)— Now the Question plainly is, Whether <hi>Lust</hi> can be <hi>a proper Respect to Christ in the Heart?</hi> And, Whether a <hi>Profession</hi> which implies <hi>no more</hi> in it, be equally honourable to Christ, as a credible Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a <hi>gracious</hi> Respect to Him?</p>

<pb n="57" facs="unknown:006839_0062_102A667761CA4C90"/>
                        <hi>many</hi> that had not a thorough Work of Regeneration. Indeed by the <hi>Rule</hi> that God has given for Admissions, if carefully attended, <hi>more</hi> Unconverted Persons will be admitted, than Converted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Passage I took Notice of in my Book, where I say,
<q>I would humbly inquire, How those visible Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be the Ground of a rational Judgment, that a Person is circumcised in Heart, which nevertheless at the same Time, we are sensible, are so far from being probable Signs of it, that they are more frequently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, than with it, &amp;c.</q>
This seems to be a terrible Thing in Mr. <hi>VVilliams's</hi> Way, which he strikes at from Time to Time; and is an Impediment he boggles at ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. One while he pretends, he can give a sufficient Answer: (P. 7, 8.) At another Time he pretends, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Difficulty my self: (P. 12.) Then again, in the same Page, he pretends to solve the Difficulty; and then in the next Page pretends, that if the Case be as I say, <hi>That we can't form a rational Judgment that a Thing is, which at the same Time, and under that Degree we then stand in, it's more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is a mistaken one, than not,</hi> yet it can argue Nothing to the Case; seeing the Judgment we do form, is directed by a Rule which is appointed for us. But still as if not satisfied with these Answers &amp; Remarks, he seems afterward to suggest, that Mr. <hi>S</hi> did not express this as <hi>his own</hi> Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as Mr. <hi>Cotton's,</hi> as a Gentleman of the same Principles with Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> using it as <hi>Argumentum ad Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem.</hi> (See P. 33.)</p>
                  <p>In P. 34. <hi>a.</hi> he expresly says,
<q>Mr. <hi>S.</hi> does not say, That when the Rule which God has given for Admissions is carefully attended, it leaves Reason to believe, that the greater Part of those who are admitted, are <hi>Enemies to God,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
[True, he does not say this in Terms; but he says,
<q>More <hi>unconverted</hi> Persons will be admitted, than convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</q>
— which is equivalent.] And in P. 134, <hi>a.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> presumes confidently to affirm, that <hi>Mr</hi> S. <hi>says this</hi> [the Thing forementioned] <hi>not with peculiar Relation to his own Scheme, but only as an</hi> Application <hi>of a Saying of Mr.</hi> Cotton's, <hi>who was of a different Opinion, and said upon a different Scheme; to shew, that upon their own Principles, the Matter will not be
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006839_0063_102A667BD3E5CFA0"/>
mended.</hi> But this is contrary to the most plain Fact. For Mr. <hi>S.</hi> having said, <hi>The Apostles admitted many</hi> unconverted, he immediately adds the Passage in Dispute, <hi>Indeed by the Rule,</hi> &amp;c. plainly expressing his own Sentiment; tho' he <hi>backs</hi> it with a Saying of Mr. <hi>Cotton's.</hi> So, Mr. <hi>Cotton's</hi> Words come in as a Confirmation of Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi>; and not Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> as an <hi>Application</hi> of Mr. <hi>Cotton's.</hi>—However, Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> delivers the same Sentiment <hi>as his own,</hi> once and again, in his Book: He delivers it as his own Sentiment (P. 34.) That <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly many more Hypocrites, than real Saints, do make such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> as that which must be accepted. He delivers it as his own Sentiment (P. 61. <hi>e.</hi>) That <hi>the Apostles judged it likely, that of the Christians taken into the Church</hi> under their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>as many were Hypocrites in Proportion to their Number,</hi> as of those that were taken into the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church. And as to the latter, He delivers it as his Sentiment (P. 24. <hi>a.</hi>) That <hi>the Body of the People were not regenerate.</hi> So that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Sentiments, when the apostolical Rule of taking in is observed, the Body of those who are admitted will be Hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, I desire that this Matter may be examined to the very Bottom.— And here let it be considered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Truth of the following Things ben't incontestable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If <hi>indeed by the Rule God has given for Admissions, when it is carefully attended, more unconverted Persons will be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than converted</hi>; then it will follow, That just such a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility or visible Appearance of Saintship as the <hi>Rule requires,</hi> is more frequently <hi>without</hi> real Saintship, than <hi>with</hi> it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had just Reason from the Holy Scripture, and divine Providence, to <hi>think thus,</hi> and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish such a Sentiment, and the Christian Church has good Reason to believe 'em; then God has given the Christian Church in its present State (dark and imperfect as it is) good Reason to <hi>think so</hi> too</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Christ by the Rule he has given for Admissions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires his Churches to receive such a Visibility or Appearance, which he has given the same Churches at the same Time Reason to judge to be an Appearance that <hi>for the most Part</hi> is without Godliness, or more frequently connected with Ungodliness; then he requires 'em to receive such an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:006839_0064_102A667F5C0727D8"/>
as he at the same Time has given 'em Reason to think does not imply a <hi>Probability</hi> of Godliness, but is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended rather with a Probability of Ungodliness. For that is the Notion of Probability; <hi>An Appearance, which so far as we have Means to judge, is for the most Part connected with the Thing.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> thus defines <hi>Probability. (Hum Und.</hi> 7th Edit. 8 vo. Vol. 2 P. 273.)
<q>Probability is Nothing but the Appearance of such an Agreement or Disagreement, by the Intervention of Proofs, whose Connection is not constant and immutable, or at least is not perceived to be so; but is, or appears FOR THE MOST PART to be so and is enough to induce the Mind to judge the Proposition to be true, or false, ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther than the contrary.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself (P. 139.) says,
<q>Tis <hi>moral Evidence</hi> of Gospel-Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, which God's Word makes the Church's <hi>Rule,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
Now, does such an Appearance, as we have Reason at the same Time to think is <hi>more frequently</hi> without Gospel-Holiness than with it, amount to moral Evidence of Gospel-Sincerity?</p>
                     </note> Therefore the Sign or Appearance, let it be what it will, implies a <hi>Probability</hi> of that, which we have Reason to think it is <hi>for the most Part</hi> connected or attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. Where there is only Probability without Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there is a <hi>Peradventure</hi> in the Case on both Sides; or in vulgar Language, the Supposition on each Side stands a Chance to be true: But that Side which most commonly proves true in such a Case, stands the best Chance; and therefore properly on that Side lies the <hi>Probability.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That cannot be a <hi>credible</hi> Visibility or Appearance, which is not a <hi>probable</hi> Appearance. To say, a Thing is <hi>credible</hi> and not <hi>probable,</hi> is a Contradiction. And 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible rationally to judge a Thing true, and at the same Time rationally to judge a Thing most probably not true. Therefore 'tis absurd (not to say worse) to talk of any <hi>divine Institution</hi> thus to judge. It would be to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that God by his Institution has made that Judgment rational, which he at the same Time makes improbable, and therefore irrational.</p>
                  <p>This Notion of admitting Members into the Church of Christ without and against <hi>Probability</hi> of true Piety, is not only very inconsistent with it self, but very inconsistent with what the common Light of Mankind teaches in their Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings one with another. Common Sense teaches all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in Admission of Members into Societies, at least So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006839_0065_102A6682EF3426F8"/>
formed for very great and important Purposes, to admit none but those concerning whom there is an <hi>apparent Probability,</hi> that they are the hearty Friends of the Society, and of the main Designs and Interests of it; and especially not to admit such concerning whom there is a greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of their being habitual fix'd Enemies. But thus it is, according to Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> and Mr <hi>W—ms's</hi> Doctrine, as well as the Doctrine of the Scripture, with all <hi>unsanctified</hi> Men, in Regard to the Church of Christ: They are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Head of the Society, Enemies to his Honour and Authority, and the Work of Salvation in the Way of the Gospel; the upholding and promoting of which is the main Design of the Society. The Church is represented in Scripture as the <hi>Houshold of God,</hi> that are in a peculiar Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner intrusted with the Care of his Name and Honour in the World, the Interests of his Kingdom, the Care of his Jewels, and most precious Things: And would not common Sense teach an earthly Prince not to admit into his <hi>Houshold</hi> such as he had no Reason to look upon so much as <hi>probable</hi> Friends &amp; loyal Subjects in their Hearts; but rather Friends &amp; Slaves in their Hearts to his Enemies &amp; Competitors for his Crown &amp; Dignity? The visible Church of Christ is often represented as his <hi>City</hi> and his <hi>Army.</hi> Now would not common Sense teach the Inhabitants of a besieged-City to open the Gates to none, but those concerning whom there is at least an <hi>apparent Probability</hi> of their not being Enemies? And would any imagine, that in a militant State of Things it is a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Way to promote the Interest of the War, to fill up the Army with such as are more likely to be on the Enemies Side in their Hearts, than on the Side of their lawful and rightful Prince, and his faithful Soldiers and Subjects?</p>

                  <head>SECTION VII. Concerning the Lord's Supper's being a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> Ordinance.</head>
                  <p>THO' Mr. <hi>W.</hi> holds, that none are to be admitted to the Lord's Supper, but such as make a credible Pretence or Profession of <hi>real Godliness,</hi> and are to be admitted under
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:006839_0066_102A668486F96298"/>
that <hi>Notion,</hi> and with <hi>Respect</hi> to such a Character appearing on them; yet he holds at the same Time, that the Lord's Supper is a <hi>converting Ordinance,</hi> an Ordinance designed for the bringing of some Men that have not such a Character, to be of such a Character. (P. 14. <hi>c, d.</hi> P. 15. P 35. <hi>a, b.</hi> P. 83. <hi>b.</hi> P. 100. <hi>e.</hi> 101. <hi>a.</hi> 126, 127.) 'Tis evident, that the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those Divines who speak of the Lord's Supper as a converting Ordinance, is not meerly that God in his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Providence will use it as an <hi>Occasion</hi> of the Conversion of some; but that 'tis a converting <hi>Means by his Institution given to Men,</hi> appointing them to use it for this Purpose. Thus Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> expresly declares, <hi>That the Lord's Supper is INSTITUTED to be a Means of Regeneration,</hi> (Doct. of inst. Churches, P. 22. <hi>a.) INSTITUTED for the Conversion of Sinners, as well as the Confirmation of Saints</hi>; (Appeal P. 70. <hi>c.</hi> P. 71. <hi>a.) That the direct End of it is Conversion, when the Subject that it is administer'd unto, stands in Need of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</hi> (Ibid. P. 73, 74.) And thus Mr. <hi>W.</hi> after Mr. <hi>S.</hi> speaks of the Lord's Supper <hi>as by Christ's</hi> APPOINTMENT <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means of the Conversion</hi> of some that are unconverted; (P. 100. <hi>e.</hi> 101. <hi>a.</hi>) So he speaks of it as <hi>instituted</hi> for the Conversion of Sinners, thro' P. 126, &amp; 127.</p>
                  <p>Now if so, what Need of Men's being to rational Charity converted already, in Order to their Coming to the Lord's Supper? Is it reasonable to suppose God would <hi>institute</hi> this Ordinance <hi>directly for that End,</hi> that Sinners might be <hi>converted</hi> by it; and then charge his Ministers and Churches not to admit any that they had not reasonable Ground to think were converted <hi>already?</hi>— Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (in P. 83. <hi>b.</hi>) sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses two Ends of Christ's appointing the Communion of the Christian Church; <hi>That such as have Grace already should be under proper Advantages to gain more,</hi> and <hi>that those who have none, should be under proper Advantages to attain Grace.</hi> But this ill consists with other Parts of his Scheme.— If a King should erect a <hi>Hospital</hi> for the Help of the Poor, and therein has two Ends; <hi>One,</hi> the nourishing of such as are in Health, and the <hi>Other,</hi> the healing of the Sick; and furnishes the Hospital accordingly, with proper Food for the Healthy, and proper Remedies for the Sick: But at the same Time charges the Officers, to whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006839_0067_102A668763E9EC88"/>
the Care of the Hospital, by no Means to <hi>admit</hi> any, unless it be <hi>under a Notion</hi> of their being in Health, and <hi>from Respect to such a Qualification in them,</hi> and unless they have <hi>reasonable Ground and moral Evidence,</hi> to induce 'em to believe that they are well: And if this Pretence should be made to justify such a Conduct, that the Hospital was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed designed for the Healing of the <hi>Sick,</hi> yet it was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confer this Benefit only on <hi>such</hi> diseased People as were <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and made a <hi>Profession and Pretence</hi> of being in Health; will any Man presume to say, that such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is agreable to the Dictates of the Understanding of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Beings? And to suppose, that such should be the Conduct of the infinitely wise GOD, is as unscriptural, as it is unreasonable. We often read in God's Word, of Men's being convinced of their Wickedness, and confessing their Sins, as a Way to be heal'd and cleansed from Sin: But where do we read of Men's pretending to more Goodness than they have, and making an hypocritical Profession and Show of Goodness, in order to their becoming good Men?<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> (P. 42.) owns, that Persons must make a <hi>Profession where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they make a Shew of being wise Virgins,</hi> in order to come into the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church. And (P. 35. <hi>e.</hi>) He owns, that <hi>all visible Saints who are not truly-pious, are Hypocrites.</hi> Again, it may be observed, he abundantly insists, that Men who have <hi>no more</hi> than common Grace and moral Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, may lawfully come to Sacraments; and yet by what he says (P. 35. <hi>c.</hi>) they must <hi>profess more.</hi> So that Men who <hi>have</hi> no more must <hi>profess</hi> more; and this, it seems, according to divine Institution!— Again he says (P. 35. <hi>a, b, c.</hi>) That one End God designed by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Men to be brought into the Church, is, that thro' divine Grace they might effectually be brought to Christ, <hi>to give him the whole Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of their Hearts</hi>; and [yet in the very next Paragraph (P. 35. <hi>e.</hi> and 36. <hi>a.</hi>) he speaks of it as unlawful for Men to come to Sacraments 'till they <hi>give up all their Hearts to Christ.</hi>
                     </note> Where have we a divine Institution, that any who are <hi>Wolves</hi> should put on <hi>Sheeps Clothing,</hi> and so come to his People, that they may believe 'em to be <hi>Sheep,</hi> and under <hi>this Notion</hi> receive 'em into the Flock, to the End that they may truly become <hi>of his Sheep?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to examine this Matter, of the Lord's Supper being a converting Ordinance to ungodly Men professing Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a little more exactly.— If Christ has appointed the Lord's Supper to be a converting Ordinance to some such
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006839_0068_102A6689D6936B40"/>
as these, then he has appointed it either only for such of them as are <hi>mistaken,</hi> and think themselves <hi>godly</hi> when they are not; or he has appointed it not only for such, but also for such as are <hi>sensible they are ungodly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the former, if it be appointed as a converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance only for such as are <hi>mistaken,</hi> &amp; think themselves god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or converted; then here is an Institution of Christ, which never can, in any one Instance, be made use of to the End for which he has appointed Men to use it. It can't be made Use of for this End by <hi>those who admit</hi> Members, and administer the Ordinance: For they, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, must admit none but such as they are bound by the Rule of Christ to look upon as godly Men already, and to administer the Sacrament to 'em <hi>under that Notion, and with Respect to such a Character.</hi> Neither can it be made Use of to such a Purpose by any of the <hi>Communicants:</hi> For by the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, they must be all such as think they are converted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and also come <hi>under that Notion.</hi> So that by this Scheme of Things, here is an Institution appointed to be upheld and used in the Church, which the Institution itself makes void and impossible. For, as was observed before, the Notion of a converting Ordinance has not a Reference to any secret Decree of God, how <hi>He</hi> in his sovereign Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>will sometimes use it:</hi> But to his <hi>Institution given to Men,</hi> appointing the End for which <hi>they should use it.</hi> Therefore, on the present Supposition, the Institution appoints the Lord's Supper to be used in some Cases for the Conversion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but at the same Time forbids its being either given or received under any other Notion than that of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant's being converted already: Which is in Effect to forbid its being either given or received for the Conversion of the Communicant, in any one Instance. So that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution effectually destroys and disannuls it self.— But God forbid, that we should ascribe any such inconsistent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions to the divine Head of the Church!</p>
                  <p>Or if the other Part of the Dis-junction be taken, and it be said, the Lord's Supper is appointed for the Conversion of some <hi>that are sensible they are ungodly</hi> or <hi>unconverted,</hi> the Consequence is no less absurd, on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Principles. For then the Scheme is this. The Institution requires some
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:006839_0069_102A668D0D0FCFA0"/>
Men to make a Pretence of <hi>real Piety,</hi> &amp; to make a publick solemn Profession of <hi>Gospel-Holiness,</hi> which at the same Time they are <hi>sensible</hi> they have none of; and this, to the End that others may look upon them to be <hi>real Saints,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 'em to the Lord's Supper <hi>under that Notion:</hi> Not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a Disguise, and making a Shew of what they have not, through Mistake, but doing it consciously &amp; wilfully, to the Honour and Glory of God: And all this strictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of 'em, as the <hi>instituted Means</hi> of their becoming real Saints, and the Children of God!</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says (P. 14. <hi>d.</hi>)
<q>Since 'tis <hi>God's Will,</hi> that his Church should admit all such visible Saints [<hi>viz.</hi> such as He had been speaking of] it follows, that the Lord's Supper is a <hi>converting</hi> Ordinance to such of them as are <hi>unconverted.</hi>
                     </q>
— But Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is mistaken as to his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. The Lord's Supper is not instituted to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance to <hi>all</hi> unconverted Men, whom it is <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Will</hi> the Church should admit. For it may be the Church's Duty, and so God's Will, to admit those that live <hi>secretly</hi> in the grossest Wickedness, as Adultery, Buggery, Deism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— Such Men as these may make a fair Profession, and the Church may be ignorant of their secret Wickedness, and therefore may have no Warrant to reject them: But yet it will not follow, that God by his Institution has given <hi>such</hi> a lawful Right to the Lord's Supper, having appointed it to be a <hi>converting</hi> Ordinance to them.</p>

                  <head>SECTION VIII. The Notion of <hi>moral Sincerity's</hi> being the Qualification, which gives a lawful Right to Christian Sacraments, examined.</head>
                  <p>THO' our Author disdains the Imputation of any such Notion, as that of Men's being called visible &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Saints from Respect to a Visibility and Profession of <hi>moral Sincerity:</hi> Yet 'tis manifest, that in his Scheme (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consistently or no, others must judge) <hi>moral Sincerity</hi> is the Qualification which entitles, and gives a lawful Right,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:006839_0070_102A668EB0B23790"/>
to Sacraments. For he holds, that 'tis lawful for unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Men, who have this Qualification, to come to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that it is not lawful for 'em to come without it. Therefore I desire this Notion may be thoroughly examined.</p>
                  <p>And for the greater Clearness, let it be observed what <hi>Sincerity</hi> in general is. Now <hi>Sincerity,</hi> in the general Notion of it, is <hi>An honest Conformity of some Profession or outward Shew of some inward Property or Act of Mind, to the Truth and Reality of it.</hi> If there be a Shew or Pretence of what <hi>is not,</hi> and has <hi>no real Existence,</hi> then the Pretence is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vain; it is only a Pretence, and nothing else: And therefore is a Pretence or Shew without any <hi>Sincerity,</hi> of any Kind, either moral or gracious.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to offer the following Arguments against the Notion of <hi>moral Sincerity</hi>'s being the Qualification, which gives a lawful Right to Sacraments.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. There is no such Thing as moral Sincerity, in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> distinct from gracious Sincerity. If any Sincerity at all be requisite in Order to a Title to the Seals of the Covenant of Grace, doubtless 'tis the Sincerity which belongs to that Covenant. But there is only one Sort of Sincerity which belongs to that Covenant; and that is a gracious Sincerity: The Covenant or Grace has nothing to do with any other Sincerity. There is but one Sort of Faith belonging to that Covenant; and this is saving Faith in Jesus Christ, called in Scripture <hi>unfeigned Faith.</hi> As for the Faith of Devils, it is not the Faith of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Here the Distinction of an <hi>internal</hi> &amp; <hi>external</hi> Covenant, will not help at all; as long as the Covenant, of which the Sacraments are Seals, is a <hi>Covenant of Salvation,</hi> or a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant proposing Terms of eternal Salvation. The Sacraments are Seals of such a Covenant: They are Seals of the <hi>New-Testament in Christ's Blood,</hi> (Matth. xxvi.28. <hi>Luk.</hi> xxii.28.) <hi>a Testament which has better Promises than the Old,</hi> (Heb. viii.6.) and which the Apostle tells us, <hi>makes us Heirs of the eternal Inheritance</hi> (Heb. ix.15.)—Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself speaks of the Covenant seal'd in Baptism, as <hi>the Covenant proposing Term of Salvation.</hi> (P. 23. <hi>b. c.</hi>) So he speaks of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant enter'd into by a visible People, as the Covenant <hi>in which God offers everlasting Happiness.</hi> (P. 24, 25.)— But

there is no other Religion, no other Sincerity, belonging to this Covenant <hi>of Salvation,</hi> but that which <hi>accompanies Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> or is <hi>saving Religion and Sincerity.</hi> As it is written (Psal. li.6.) <hi>Behold, thou desirest Truth in the inward Parts.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>There is such a Thing, as what may be called a <hi>moral Sincerity,</hi> in distinction from saving, in many moral Things; as in loving our Friends and Neighbours, in loving our Country, in choosing the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion before the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish,</hi> in a conscientious Care to do many Duties, in being willing to take a great Deal of Pains in Religion, in being sorry for the Commission of such and such Acts of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But there are some Duties, which, unless they are done with a <hi>gracious Sincerity,</hi> they can't be done at all. As Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> observes (<hi>Safety of Ap.</hi> P. 216.)
<q>There are some Duties which cannot be done but from a <hi>gracious Respect to God.</hi>
                     </q>
Thus, there is but one Sort of Sincerity in loving God as God, and setting our Hearts on Him as our highest Happiness, loving him above the World, and loving Holiness above all the Objects of our Lusts. He that don't do these Things with a gracious Sincerity, never really doth them at all: He that truly does them, is certainly a godly Man; as we are abundantly assured by the Word of God. So, there is but one Sort of <hi>sincere and cordial Consent to the Covenant of Grace,</hi> but one Sort of <hi>giving all our Hearts to Jesus Christ</hi>; which Things Mr. <hi>W.</hi> allows to be necessary, to come to Sacraments. That which a Man's Heart is full of reigning Enmity to, he can't with any Reality at all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially consent to and comply with: But the Hearts of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified</hi> Men are full of reigning Enmity to the Covenant of Grace, according to the Doctrine of Scripture, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> too, as we have seen before.</p>
                  <p>However, if there were any such Thing, as a being heartily willing to accept of Christ, and a giving all our Hearts to Christ, without a saving Sincerity, this would not be a complying with the Terms of a Covenant of Salvation. For it's Self-evident, that 'tis only something which is <hi>saving,</hi> that is a Compliance with the Terms of <hi>Salvation.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself often allows (as has been observed) that Persons must comply with the Terms of the Covenant of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:006839_0072_102A669542728A88"/>
Grace, in Order to come to Sacraments.— Yet because he also in Effect denies it, I shall say something further in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) The Sacraments are <hi>Covenant Privileges.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself calls them so. (P. 5. <hi>a. b.</hi>) Covenant-Privileges are Covenant-Benefits, or Benefits Persons have a Right to by the Covenant. But Persons can have no Right to any of the <hi>Benefits</hi> of a Covenant, without Compliance with its <hi>Terms.</hi> For that is the very Notion of the Terms of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>viz.</hi> Terms of an Interest in the Benefits of that Covenant. 'Tis so in all Covenants whatsoever; if a Man refuses to comply with the Conditions of the Covenant, he can claim nothing by that Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) If we consider the Sacraments as <hi>Seals</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the same Thing is evident, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Man can have no Right to 'em without a Compliance with the Terms. The Sacraments are not only Seals of the Offer <hi>on God's Part,</hi> or Ordinances God has appointed as Confirmations of the Truth of his Covenant, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> seems to insist. (P. 74, 75.) For considered meerly as Seals and Confirmations of the Truth of the Gospel, they are (as Miracles and other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Christian Religion) Seals equally given to <hi>Christians, Jews, Deists,</hi> moral and vicious, and the whole World that knows of 'em. Whereas, 'tis manifest, in the Nature of the Thing, Sacraments are Seals of the Covenant <hi>to be applied to the Communicant,</hi> and of which he is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Subject, in a peculiar Manner, <hi>as a Party in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> Otherwise, what Need would there be of his being one of God's <hi>Covenant-People,</hi> in any Sense whatsoever?</p>
                  <p>But now 'tis not reasonable to suppose, that the Seal of the Covenant belongs to any Man, <hi>as a Party in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> who will not accept of and comply with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. He that rejects the Covenant, and won't comply with it, has no Interest in it: And he that has no Interest in the Covenant, has no Right to the Seals: For the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and it's Seals go together. 'Tis so in all Covenants among Mankind; after a Man has come into a Bargain proposed and offered by another, yielding to the Terms of it, he has a Right to have the Bargain <hi>seal'd,</hi> and confirmed to Him, as a <hi>Party in the Covenant</hi>; but not before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="unknown:006839_0073_102A6699DD4948B0"/>And if what the Communicant does, be a Seal <hi>on his Part</hi> also, as the Nature of the Thing demonstrates, seeing he is active in the Matter, and as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> seems willing to allow (P. 75.) it will follow, with equal Evidence, that a Man can't lawfully partake, unless he yields to, and complies with the Covenant. To what Purpose is a Man's sealing an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument or Contract, but to confirm it <hi>as his own Act and Deed,</hi> and to declare his Compliance with his Part of the Contract. As when a Servant seals his Indenture, 'tis a Testimony and Ratification of his Compliance to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Contract with his Master. And if a Covenant of Friendship be proposed between two Parties, and they both put their Seal to it, hereby they both testify and declare their mutual Friendship.</p>
                  <p>It has been already observed, that <hi>unsanctified</hi> Men, while such, can't with any Sincerity at all testify a <hi>present</hi> cordial Compliance with the Covenant of Grace: And as they can't do this, so neither can they with any Sincerity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise a <hi>future</hi> Compliance with that Covenant. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> often allows, that in Order to Christian Communion Men must <hi>promise</hi> a Compliance with the Covenant, in it's spiritual and saving Duties; that they <hi>will believe and repent in the Sense of the Covenant,</hi> willingly accept of Christ and his Salvation, love him and live to him, and will do it <hi>immediately, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, from this Moment.</hi> (P. 25. <hi>c. e.</hi> P. 26. <hi>a.</hi> P. 28. <hi>a. c.</hi> and P. 76. <hi>a. b.</hi>) But how absurd is this! when at the same Instant, while they are making and uttering these Promises, they are intirely <hi>averse</hi> to any such Thing; being <hi>then Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Christ, willingly rejecting Him, opposing his Salvation, striving against it, labouring to find out all Manner of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Hindrances in the Way of it, not desiring it should come yet,</hi> &amp;c. which our Author, in a Place forecited, says is the Case with <hi>all unsanctified</hi> Men.</p>
                  <p>And when unsanctified Men promise, that they will spend the rest of their Lives in universal <hi>Obedience</hi> to Christ, there is no Sincerity in such Promises; because there is not <hi>such a Heart</hi> in them. There is no Man but a true Disciple of Christ, that is willing thoroughly to <hi>deny himself</hi> for Him, and <hi>follow Him</hi> in a Way of Obedience to all his Commands, unto the End, through all Difficulties which Christ has given
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:006839_0074_102A669C5DB69140"/>
his Followers Reason to expect, or commanded 'em to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for; as is evident by Christ's frequent Declarations. (<hi>Luk.</hi> xiv.25,—33. <hi>Matth.</hi> x.37, 38, 59. Chap. xiii.44, 45, 46. and many parallel Places.) If an unsanctified Man thinks he is willing, he don't know his own Heart: If he professes to be willing, he don't know what he says. The Difficulty &amp; Cost of it is not in his View; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has no proper Willingness to comply with the Cost and Difficulty. That which he is willing for, with a moral Sincerity, is something else that he conceives of, which is a great Deal easier, &amp; less cross to Flesh &amp; Blood. If a King should propose to a Subject his building him such a Tower, promising him a certain Reward. If the Subject should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, <hi>not counting the Cost,</hi> thinking with himself that the King meant another Sort of Tower, much cheaper; and should be willing only to build that cheap one, which he imagined in his own Mind; when he would by no Means have consented to build so costly a Tower as the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, if he had understood him right: such a Man could not be said properly to be willing to comply with his Prince's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, with any Sincerity at all. For what he consents to with a moral Sincerity, is <hi>not the Thing</hi> which the King proposed.</p>
                  <p>The Promises of unsanctified Men are like the Promises of the Man we read of (<hi>Luk.</hi> ix.57, 58.) who said, <hi>Lord, I will follow thee whither soever thou goest.</hi> To whom Christ replied, <hi>The Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Air have Nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head.</hi> When he made his Promise, he probably quite mistook the Thing, and did not imagine, that to follow Christ wherever he went, would be to follow him in such Poverty &amp; Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. I suppose, the rich <hi>young Man</hi> we read of (<hi>Mark</hi> x.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) might have what is called <hi>moral Sincerity.</hi> But he had no Sincerity in <hi>the Covenant of Grace.</hi> When he came to Christ to know <hi>what he should do to have eternal Life,</hi> 'tis probable he ignorantly thought himself willing to yield himself to Christ's Direction. Yet when it came to a Trial, and Christ told him he must <hi>go and sell all that he had, and give to the Poor,</hi> it proved that he had no Sincerity of Willingness at all for any such Thing.—So that it is evident, however unsanctified Men may be morally sincere
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:006839_0075_102A669F0A9A62D0"/>
in some Things, yet they have no Sincerity of any Sort in <hi>that Covenant,</hi> of which the Sacraments are Seals; and that moral Sincerity, distinct from gracious, in <hi>this Covenant,</hi> is a meer Imagination, there being indeed no such Thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Another Argument against this Notion of moral Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity's giving a Right to Church-Communion, is this: A Quality that is <hi>transient</hi> &amp; <hi>vanishing,</hi> can be no Qualification or Fitness for a <hi>standing</hi> Privilege. Unsanctified Men may be very serious, greatly affected, and much engaged in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: But the Scripture compares their Religion to a <hi>Lamp</hi> not supplied with <hi>Oil,</hi> which will go out, and to a <hi>Plant</hi> that has <hi>no Root</hi> nor <hi>Deepness of Earth,</hi> which will soon wither; and compares such unsanctified Men to the <hi>Dog</hi> that will <hi>return to his Vomit,</hi> and to the <hi>Sow</hi> which tho' wash'd ever so clean, yet her Nature not being chang'd, will <hi>return to her wallowing in the Mire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> allows, that Persons in Order to come to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments must have <hi>deep Convictions, an earnest Concern to obtain Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. Now every one who is in any Degree ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with religious Matters, knows that such Convictions are not wont to last a great while, if they have no sa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing Issue. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in his Sermon on the Danger of speedy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy (P. 11.) says,
<q>Unconverted Men <hi>will grow weary</hi> of religious Duties.</q>
And our Author himself (P. 78. <hi>c.</hi>) speaking of those Professors in the primitive Churches, that fell away to Heresy and other Wickedness, takes Notice that the Apostle <hi>observes,</hi> IT WILL BE SO,— <hi>that they which are approved, might be made manifest:</hi> And says Mr. <hi>W.</hi> upon it, <hi>Evil and unsanctified Men, by such Sins, will discover their Hypocrisy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now seeing this is the Case with moral Sincerity and common Religion, how can it be a Qualification for a standing Privilege? Nothing can be a Fitness for a <hi>durable Privilege,</hi> but a <hi>durable Qualification.</hi> For no Qualification has any Fitness or Adaptedness for more than it extends to; as a short Scabbard can't be fit for a long Sword. If a Man going a Journey in the Night, needs a Lamp to light him in his Way, who will pretend that a flaming Wick without Oil, which will last but a few Rods, is fit for his Purpose? Or if a Man were building an House for himself and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:006839_0076_102A66A0E8F156A8"/>
should he put into the Frame, Pieces of Timber known to be of such a Nature as that they would probably be rotten in a few Months; or should he take Blocks of Ice, instead of hewn Stone, because during a present cold Season they seem'd to he hard &amp; firm; and withal should for a Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put only Leaves that will soon fade away, instead of Tiles or Shingles, that are solid and lasting; would not every Spectator ridicule his Folly!</p>
                  <p>If it should be said, that unsanctified Men, when they <hi>lose</hi> their moral Sincerity, may be <hi>cast out</hi> again: This is far from helping the Case, or shewing that such Men were ever <hi>fit</hi> to be admitted. To say, a Piece of Timber, though not of a durable Nature, is <hi>fit</hi> to be put into the Frame of a Building, because when it begins to rot, it may be pull'd out again, is so far from proving that it was ever fit to be put in, that the speedy Necessity of pulling it out rather proves the contrary. If we had the Power of constituting a human Body, or it were left to us to add Members to our own Bodies, as there might be Occasion; we should not think such a Member was <hi>fit</hi> to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> added to the Frame, that had already radically seated in it a Cancer or Gangrene, by which it could last but a little While it self, and would endanger the other Members; tho' it were true, that when the Disease should prevail, there were Surgeons which might be procured to cut that Member off.</p>
                  <p>But to consider a little further this Point of <hi>moral Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>'s qualifying Persons for the Privileges of the Church. I would lay down this Proposition as a Thing of clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: <hi>Those Persons have no Fitness in themselves to</hi> come <hi>to the Privileges of the Church, who, if they were</hi> known, <hi>would not be fit to be</hi> admitted <hi>by others.</hi> For to say, they are <hi>fit</hi> to be Members, and yet <hi>not</hi> fit to be allowed to be Members, is apparently absurd. But they who have no better Fitness than moral Sincerity, if that were <hi>known,</hi> would not be fit to be admitted by others: as is allowed by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> For he holds, that in Order to be fit to be admitted by others, they must credibly appear to them to have something <hi>more</hi> than moral Sincerity, even Gospel-Holiness. And 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in it self, as well as allowed by Mr <hi>W.</hi> that if such were <hi>known,</hi> they would not be <hi>fit</hi> to be admitted, <hi>only</hi> on
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:006839_0077_102A66A39808F828"/>
their moral Sincerity, and the Profession and Promises they make from such a Principle: And that for this Reason, because such a Principle alone <hi>would not be fit to be trusted.</hi> God himself has taught his Church, that the Religion of unsanctified Men is not fit to be trusted; as a Lamp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Oil,</hi> and a Plant without <hi>Root,</hi> are Things not to be trusted. God has directly taught his Church to expect, that such Religion will fail; and that such Men, having no higher Principle, will return to their Wickedness. Job. xxvii.8, 9, 10.) <hi>The Hypocrite—will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?</hi>—Dan. xii.10. <hi>The Wicked will do wickedly.</hi> And therefore God do's not require his Church to accept their Profession and Promises. If he has taught us not to credit their Profession and Promises, then certainly he has taught us not to accept them.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Another Argument against this supposed Rule of allowing and requiring unsanctified Men with moral Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to come to Sacraments, is this. <hi>That Rule,</hi> which if fully attended, would naturally bring it to pass, that the <hi>greater Part</hi> of Communicants would be <hi>unfit,</hi> even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that very Rule, cannot be a <hi>Divine</hi> Rule: But this supposed Rule of <hi>moral Sincerity</hi> is such a Rule. For if this Rule be universally attended, then all unsanctified Men, who have present Convictions of Conscience sufficient to make 'em <hi>morally sincere,</hi> must come into the Communion of the Church. But this Conviction &amp; common Religion, if it don't issue in Conversion (as has been observed) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vanishes away in a short Time: And yet still these Persons, if not convicted of open Scandal, are left in the Communion of the Church, and remain there, <hi>without even moral Sincerity.</hi> — Experience gives us abundant Reason to think, that of those who some Time or other have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Convictions of Conscience, so as to make 'em for the present to be what is called <hi>morally sincere,</hi> but few are saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted. <note n="*" place="bottom">How small a Proportion are there of the vast Multitudes, that in the Time of the late religious Commotion through the Land had their Consciences awaken'd, who give hopeful abiding Evidences of a saving Conversion to God!</note> And if all these must be admitted (as they must, if this Rule be fully attended) then their Convictions
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:006839_0078_102A66A51FAACBD8"/>
going away, and their Sincerity vanishing with it, it will hereby be bro't about, that the Lord's Table is chiefly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with the <hi>worst</hi> Sort of morally insincere Persons, <hi>viz.</hi> stupid Backsliders, that are in themselves far <hi>worse</hi> than they were before, according to the Scripture-Account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> xii.45. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii.20.— And this as the natural Consequence of the foremention'd Rule, appointing <hi>moral Sincerity</hi> to be the Qualification for Communion. Thus this supposed Rule supplants its own Design.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Another Argument, that moral Sincerity is not the Qualification to which God has annexed a lawful Right to Sacraments, is, That this Qualification is <hi>not at all inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> with a Man's living at the same Time in the most <hi>hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Wickedness,</hi> in a superlative Degree contrary to the Christian Religion.</p>
                  <p>It was before observed to be a Thing evident in itself, and allowed by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> That there are some <hi>Sins,</hi> which, while wilfully continued and lived in, tho' secretly, do wholly <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualify</hi> Persons for Christian Sacraments, and make it <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for Men to partake of them.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be thus with some Sins, doubtless it is because of the <hi>Heinousness</hi> of those Sins, the high Degree of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness which is in them. And hence it will follow, that those Sins which are in themselves most heinous, and most contrary to the Christian Religion, do especially disqualify Persons for Christian Sacraments, when wilfully lived in.</p>
                  <p>Let it therefore now be considered, whether it won't fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from these Premises, That for Men to live in Enmity against God and Christ, and in wilful Unbelief and Rejection of Christ (as the Scriptures teach, and as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>W.</hi> too assert, is the Case with all unsanctified Men under the Gospel) wholly <hi>disqualifies</hi> Men for Christian Sacraments. For 'tis very manifest, by Scripture and Reason, that to live in these Things, is to live in some of the <hi>most heinous</hi> Kinds of Wickedness; as is allowed by <hi>Calvinistick</hi> Divines in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in particular, who says (<hi>Safety of Ap.</hi> P. 224. <hi>d.</hi>)
<q>You <hi>cannot anger God more by any Thing,</hi> than by continuing in the Neglect of Christ. This is the <hi>great Controversy</hi> God has with Sinners; not that they have been guilty of these and those particular Transgressions,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:006839_0079_102A66A9D7CDAC78"/>
but that they abide in the Rejection of the Gospel.</q>
Again, he says, (<hi>Ibid.</hi> P 249. <hi>e.</hi>)
<q>
                        <hi>The great Sin,</hi> that God is angry with you for, is your <hi>Unbelief.</hi> Despising the Gospel is <hi>the great provoking Sin.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Man's continuing in Hatred of his <hi>Brother,</hi> especially a Fellow-Communicant, is generally allowed to be a Thing that disqualifies for Communion: The Apostle compares it to <hi>Leaven</hi> in the Passover, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v.6, 7, 8. But now certainly 'tis as bad, and as contrary to the Nature &amp; Design of Christian Sacraments, for a Man to live in Hatred of CHRIST, and to remain a <hi>hateful and accursed Enemy</hi> (if I may use Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s own Language) to the glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Head of the Christian Church.</p>
                  <p>None will deny, that <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Perjury</hi> are very gross and heinous Sins, and (if known) very scandalous; and therefore it follows from what was observed before, that such Sins, if lived in, though secretly, do disqualify Persons for Christian Sacraments in God's Sight. But by our Author's own Account, all unsanctified Men that partake of the Lord's Supper, live in <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Perjury,</hi> and go on to renew these Crimes continually; in-as-much-as while they continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Men, they live in a constant Violation of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and Oath. For Mr. <hi>W.</hi> often lays it down, that all who enter into Covenant with God, do promise spiritual Duties, such as Repentance, Faith, Love, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> And that they promise to perform these <hi>hence-forward,</hi> even from the <hi>present Moment,</hi> unto the <hi>End of Life</hi>; (See P. 25. <hi>c, e.</hi> 26. <hi>a.</hi> 28. <hi>a, c.</hi> 76. <hi>a, b.</hi>) And that they don't only promise, but <hi>Swear</hi> to do this. (P. 18. <hi>d.</hi> 100. <hi>c.</hi> 101. <hi>a.</hi> 129. <hi>a.</hi> 130. <hi>c.</hi> 140. <hi>b.</hi>) But for a Man to violate the Promises he makes in covenanting with God, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> once &amp; again speaks of it as <hi>Lying.</hi> (P. 24. <hi>d, e.</hi> P. 130. <hi>c.</hi>) And if so, doubtless their breaking the Oath they swear to God, is <hi>Perjury.</hi> — Now lying to <hi>Men</hi> is bad; but lying to GOD is worse.

But if unsanctified Men, when they enter'd into Covenant with God, promised and swore, that they would <hi>immediately</hi> &amp; <hi>thence-forward</hi> accept of Christ as their Saviour, and love him, and live to him; then while they continue in a wilful Rejection of him (which according to
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:006839_0080_102A66AB5BA38408"/>
Mr. <hi>W.</hi> all unregenerate Men do) they live continually in the Violation of their Promise and Oath. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Here I would observe, that not only in the general do unsanctified Men, notwithstanding their moral Sincerity, thus live in the most heinous Wickedness; but particularly, according to Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s own Doctrine, their very Attendance on the outward Ordinances and Duties of <hi>Worship</hi> is the <hi>vilest, most flagrant, and abominable Impiety.</hi> In his Sermons on <hi>Christ a King and Witness</hi> (P. 77, 78.) He says,
<q>If a Man could perform all the outward Acts of Worship and Obedience, which the Bible requires, from the Beginning to the End of it, and not do them from <hi>Faith in Christ, and Love to God,</hi> and not express by them the Thoughts, Desires and Actings of his Soul; They would be so far from being that Obedience which Christ requires, that they would be a <hi>mocking of God,</hi> and <hi>hateful to him.</hi> These outward Acts ought to be no other, and in Religion are design'd to stand for nothing else, but to be Representations of a Man's Soul, and the Acts of that: And when they are not so, they are in their own Nature a LIE, and false Pretence of something within, which is not there: Therefore the Lord abhors them, and reckons these false Pretences the VILEST WICKEDNESS. — Now when a Man performs all outward Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Worship, but it does not come from his <hi>Heart,</hi> he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally denies the Omniscience of Christ, while he puts before him a Shew and Pretence of something for the Reality; and so he belies his own Profession. And all this, be it more or less, whatever it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be of Religion, instead of being that which Christ requires, is <hi>entirely different</hi> from it, yea, INFINITELY CONTRARY TO IT. And those same Actions, which when they are the Language of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and flow from it, are <hi>pleasing</hi> &amp; <hi>acceptable</hi> to God &amp; Jesus Christ, are true Obedience to him; when they do <hi>not,</hi> are reckon'd the MOST FLAGRANT AND ABOMINABLE IMPIETY, &amp; threaten'd with the SEVEREST DAMNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF HELL.</q>
— Now, who can believe, that God has, by his own holy Institution, made that Sort of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> which is nothing better than what is consistent with such a <hi>lying, vile, abominable, flagrantly wicked Pretence and Show of Religion as this,</hi> the very Thing that gives a Right, even in his Sight, to Christian Sacraments!</p>
                        <p>I might here also observe, that if moral Sincerity or common Grace gives a Right to Sacraments in the Sight of God, then that which (according to Mr. <hi>S—d</hi>'s Doctrine before observed) is a SPIRIT OF LUST, that which is <hi>contrary to, and at War with, and would destroy saving Grace,</hi> is the Thing which gives a Right in the Sight of God to Christian Sacraments.</p>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would observe one Thing further under this Head, <hi>viz.</hi> That ungodly Men which live under the Gospel, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any moral Sincerity they may have, <hi>are worse, and more provoking Enemies to God, than the very Heathen,</hi> who never sin'd against Gospel-Light &amp; Mercy. This is very manifest by the Scriptures, particularly <hi>Matth.</hi> X.13, 14. <hi>Amos</hi> III.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> II.9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> II.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> III.15, 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="unknown:006839_0081_102A66AF363699E0"/>I having suggested concerning Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Doctrine of admitting <hi>more</hi> unconverted than converted, by attending Christ's Rule, that this supposes it to be the Case of the Members of the visible Church, that the greater Part of 'em are more provoking Enemies to God than most of the <hi>Heathen</hi>; Mr. <hi>W.</hi> represents himself as greatly alarmed at this: He calls it an extraordinary Passage, and puts five Questions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it to my serious Consideration. (P. 72, 73.) The first and chief Question is this;
<q>Did Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ever say in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> or any where else, of most of our Fellow-Worshippers at the Sacrament, that we have no Reason to think concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but that they are more provoking Enemies to the Lord, whom Christians love and adore, than most of the very <hi>Heathen</hi>?</q>
His three next Questions are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Heinousness of such supposed ill Treatment of Mr. <hi>S.</hi>— And I think will be sufficiently answered, by what I shall offer in Reply to the first.</p>
                  <p>I will tell him what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> said. Speaking to such as don't come to Christ, living under the Gospel, he said (<hi>Safety of Ap.</hi> P. 234, 235.)
<q>You mayn't think to escape as the <hi>Heathen</hi> do: Your Load will be heavier, &amp; your Fire will be hotter, and your Judgment sorer, than the Judgment of other Men. God will proportion every Man's Misery to his Iniquity. And as you have enjoyed greater Light and Love, so you must expect more amazing and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Wrath, than other Men: Conscience has more to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse you of &amp; condemn you for; and so has God: And you will sink down deeper into Hell, than other Men. You are treasuring up a greater Measure of Wrath, than others, against the Day of Wrath. You will wish you had lived in the <hi>darkest</hi> Corners of the Earth among <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
                     </q>
—</p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> must allow me to remind him of what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divine has said, and that is himself. In his Sermon on <hi>Isa</hi> xlv.11. (P. 25, 26.) he says,
<q>It's to be fear'd, there are great Numbers here present, that are in an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, unrenewed, unpardon'd State</hi>; Strangers from God, and Enemies to him. Yet you now look with great Pity and Compassion on that poor <hi>Captive,</hi> for

whom we have now been offering up our earnest Prayers,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mrs. <hi>Eunice Williams,</hi> bro't up in <hi>Canada,</hi> among the <hi>Caghnawaga Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Sister to the then Pastor of the Church in <hi>Mansfield,</hi> where this Sermon was preached, upon a Day of Prayer kept on her Account; she being then in that Place on a Visit.</note> who has been so long in so pitiable and sorrowful a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and who is now in the Thickness of <hi>Popish</hi> Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Superstition.— If you are out of Christ, and destitute of true Faith in him, if your Natures remain <hi>unrenew'd and unsanctified,</hi> what is your State better than hers, which looks so sorrowful and distressing? Rather, is it not <hi>worse?</hi> When you consider, that in the Fulness of the Means of Grace which you have enjoyed all your Days, you are as far from any saving Knowlege of Jesus Christ, as those who have lived in the Dregs and Abyss of <hi>Popish</hi> Ignorance, and know not what to believe, but what the Church, that is, <hi>Antichrist,</hi> tells them. If you die thus, your Misery will be <hi>aggravated</hi> INCONCEIVABLY beyond theirs: Which Christ has plainly enough shewn us, when he upbraided the Cities wherein most of his mighty Works were done, and tells them how much in the Comparison they fall below <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi>

<q>and <hi>Sodom</hi>; for whom it should be <hi>more tolerable,</hi> than for them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same Author says also, even in the Book under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, (P. 86.)
<q>That the Unbelief and Impieties of <hi>visible Saints,</hi> is what they will be punish'd for <hi>above all Men in the World.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And now, I think it may be proper for Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself to answer his 5th Question, which he puts to my serious Consideration, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>What Honour is it to our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, to treat visible Saints in such a Manner, when at the same Time it is his revealed Will they should be outwardly treated as visible Saints?</q>

                  <head>SECTION IX. A View of what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says concerning the <hi>publick</hi> Covenanting of Professors.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. MR. <hi>W.</hi> often speaks with Contempt, of my suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it to be a Duty required of such as come to Sacraments, that they should <hi>explicitly own the Covenant,</hi> and disputes largely against it. (P. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and many other Places.) He says concerning me (P. 22. <hi>a, b.</hi>)
<q>'Tis very unhappy, that this good Gentleman should use the Scripture in such a Manner, to prove a divine Institution which never had an Existence; and after all that is said, is but a meer Imagination and Chimera; it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, there never was any such divine Institution for the Church under the Old Testament, binding particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>publickly and explicitly to own the Covenant,</hi> in order to their enjoying the outward Ordinances of it.</q>
—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it falls out something happily for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I am not quite alone in this Chimera, but have Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself to join me in it; who abundantly asserts the same Thing (P. 5. <hi>c.</hi> P. 8. <hi>a.</hi> P. 9. <hi>b, c.</hi> and many other Places) who <hi>uses the Scripture in</hi> the same <hi>Manner,</hi> and supposes the same <hi>divine Institution</hi>; and who (in P. 5. <hi>b, c.</hi> of the Treatise in Hand) having stated the following Inquiry,
<q>What is that Evidence, which by DIVINE APPOINTMENT the Church is to have, of the Saintship of those who are admitted to the outward Priviledges of the Covenant of Grace?</q>
makes this Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to it:
<q>The SCRIPTURE has determined the Matter thus, that the open Profession &amp; Declaration of a PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON's believing in Christ,— and an hearty Consent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, and Engagement on his Part to fulfil it,</q>
&amp;c.
<q>is the sole &amp; entire Ground of that publick Judgment, which the Church is to make of the real Saintship of Professors.</q>
—'Tis manifest, he can't intend meerly that they should be the <hi>Posterity</hi> of such as thus own'd the Covenant, or <hi>declared their Consent to it,</hi> and so are look'd upon as those that own'd the Covenant in their Ancestors, at the Beginning of the Covenant-Line
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:006839_0084_102A66B52D7976D8"/>
(tho' sometimes he seems to suppose, this is all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, as I shall take particular Notice by &amp; by:) For here he expresly speaks of a <hi>personal</hi> owning the Covenant, or the <hi>open Profession and Declaration of a PERSON's</hi> Consent to the Covenant. And thus he often speaks of the same Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in like Manner, as a <hi>personal</hi> Thing, or what is done by the <hi>Person judged of,</hi> &amp; <hi>received.</hi> (See P. 10. <hi>c, d.</hi> 31. <hi>e</hi> 32. <hi>e.</hi> 33. <hi>a.</hi> 34 <hi>b, c.</hi> 73. <hi>b.</hi> 84. <hi>a.</hi> 139. <hi>a.</hi>) And in the 2d Page of his <hi>Preface,</hi> he declares himself fully establish'd in Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> Doctrine concerning this Affair of Qualifications for the Lord's Supper; who expresly declares it to be <hi>his</hi> Judgment, that
<q>It is requisite, that Persons be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto Communion in the Lord's Supper, without making a PERSONAL and publick Profession of their Faith and Repentance.</q>
(<hi>Appeal.</hi> P. 93, 94.)</p>
                  <p>And as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> holds, that there msut be a <hi>publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal owning the Covenant</hi>; so he also maintains, that this Profession must be <hi>explicit,</hi> or <hi>express.</hi>—He says (P 20. <hi>d, e.</hi>)
<q>Since we have no Direction in the Bible, at what Time nor in what Manner any <hi>personal explicit</hi> Covenanting should be performed,—it appears plain to a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the People knew nothing of any such Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as I suppose, the Christian Church never did, 'till Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> discovered it.</q>
But if I was the first Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer, he should have owned, that since I have discovered it he himself and all my Opposers have seen Cause to follow me, and receive my Discovery. For so the Case seems to be, if he gives us a true Account (in P. 132. <hi>b.</hi>) where he rejects, with Indignation, the Imputation of any other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
<q>How often (says he) has Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> said, none but visible Saints are to be admitted? Do not ALL Mr. <hi>Edwards's</hi> OPPOSERS say, that NO MAN is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, who does not profess his hearty Belief of the Gospel, and the earnest and sincere Purpose of his Heart, so far as he knows it, to obey all God's Commands, and keep his COVENANT? NONE who do not make as full and EXPRESS a Profession as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did, or was ever required by Christ or his Apostles, in any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that can be produced in the Bible, of Bodies of Men or particular Persons Admission into visible Covenant

with God?</q>
— He had before spoken of <hi>the WORDS which the</hi> Israelites <hi>used in their entring into Covenant with God.</hi> (P. 5. <hi>d.</hi>) Which must refer to their entring into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the <hi>Wilderness</hi>; for we have no Account of any <hi>Words</hi> at all, used by that Nation, <hi>at their entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> if not there. And this he sometimes speaks of as the Covenant they made, when God <hi>took 'em into Covenant</hi> (P. 8. <hi>d.</hi> 36. <hi>d, e.</hi> 37. <hi>a, b.</hi>) And (P. 20.) he allows <hi>that</hi> to be an Instance of <hi>explicit</hi> Covenanting: But ridicules <hi>my</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to shew, that <hi>explicit</hi> Covenanting was a divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for All; when, he says, we have an Account of but four Instances of any <hi>explicit</hi> Covenanting with God by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and those on most extraordinary Occasions, and by <hi>the Body</hi> of the People. But what Matter is it, whether there were four, or but two, or only that one Instance in the Wilderness? when he himself with such Earnestness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that all my Opposers hold, <hi>every Man</hi> must make as full and express a Profession of the Covenant as ever the <hi>Israelites</hi> did, or was ever required, in any Instance that can be produced in the Bible, whether of <hi>Bodies of Men</hi> or <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons</hi> Admission, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If this be so, and what he said before be also true, then all <hi>Israel,</hi> even every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Person among them, that ever was admitted to the Privileges of the Church, throughout all their Generations, by his own Confession and Assertion, did personally make as <hi>explicit</hi> a Profession of the Covenant, as the Body of the People did in that Instance in the <hi>Wilderness.</hi> And not only so, but the same must every individual Person do, hat ever comes to Sacraments, through all Ages, to the End of the World.— Thus Mr. <hi>W.</hi> fights hard to beat down him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But I will not say in his own Language, that in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>He fights hard to beat down a poor Man of Straw.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any should say, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> when speaking of an <hi>express Profession,</hi> don't mean a Profession in <hi>Words,</hi> but only in <hi>Actions</hi>; such as an outward Attendance on Ordinances and Duties of Worship: I answer, if such Actions are a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, yet certainly they are not an <hi>express</hi> Profession; they are no more than an <hi>implicit</hi> Profession. And besides, 'tis very plain, the Profession he speaks of is a verbal Profession, or a Profession in <hi>Words</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus (P. 36. <hi>b.</hi>) when describing
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:006839_0086_102A66BC77571188"/>
the Profession which ought to be made, he says,
<q>It is in as strong WORDS, as were used by any whom the Apostles admitted.</q>
And elsewhere (as was before noted) he often insists, that a Profession should be made in WORDS without any Discrimination as to their Meaning. Which shews, it is a Profession in <hi>Words,</hi> that he designs. And altho' (P. 104. <hi>e.</hi>) he speaks of a Performance of the outward Duties of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Worship, <hi>as the only Way that God ever appointed of making real Saintship visible:</hi> Yet this is only another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his great <hi>Inconsistence</hi> with himself; as appears by what has already been observed, and appears further by this, that when he speaks of a Profession of Consent to the Terms of the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he often speaks of it as a Profession which ought to be made <hi>in Order</hi> to Admission to these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. (P. 5. <hi>b, c.</hi> 10. <hi>a.</hi> 35. <hi>e.</hi> 36. <hi>a, b, c.</hi> 132. <hi>b.</hi> and other Places) If so, then how can the <hi>Attendance</hi> it self, on these Ordinances of Worship, be all the Profession which is to be made? Must Men <hi>first come to Ordinances, in Order to Admission to Ordinances!</hi> And moreover, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishes between <hi>Engaging</hi> &amp; swearing to <hi>keep Covenant</hi> in the publick Profession, and Attending on the Ordinances and Duties of Worship, which he speaks of as belonging to the <hi>Fulfilment of the Engagement &amp; Oath.</hi> (P. 130.) And <hi>lastly</hi> I would observe, tho' it could be consistently made out (which it can never be) that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> don't mean a Professing in <hi>Words,</hi> it would be nothing to the Purpose. If it be in Words, or in other Signs which are equivalent to Words and which are a <hi>full and express Profession</hi> (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says) it is exactly the same Thing as to my Purpose, and the Consequence of the Argument, which was, that real Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness must be professed. And indeed this very Thing which I endeavoured to prove by all that I said on this Head, is expresly again and again allowed by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Yet he makes a great Ado, as if there was a vast Difference between Him and Me in this Affair of publick Covenanting with God; and as tho' my Notions of it were very singular, absurd, and mischievous.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says a great Deal in Opposition to Me, to shew that <hi>swearing by God's Name, swearing to the Lord,</hi> and the like, don't mean <hi>Covenanting with God:</hi> But yet (in P.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:006839_0087_102A66C023A08B60"/>
18.) in the midst of his earnest Dispute against it, he owns it.— I mention'd several Scripture-Prophecies, referring to the <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts in the Days of the Gospel, which foretel that they should <hi>swear by God's Name, swear to the Lord of Hosts,</hi> &amp;c. as a Prediction of the Gentiles <hi>publick Covenanting with God</hi>; using that as one Thing which confirmed, that this was commonly the Meaning of such Phrases in the Old Testament. But Mr. <hi>W.</hi> despises my interpretation of these Prophecies, and my Argument from 'em. Nevertheless, in his Reply, he owns the very Thing: He in Effect owns, that entring into Covenant, and owning the Covenant is what is meant by these Prophecies; mentioning this, plainly with Approbation, as the universal Sense of Protestant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators. His Words are (P. 18. <hi>d. e.</hi>)
<q>As to all these Prophecies, which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has quoted, referring to the Gentiles, and their swearing by the Name of the Lord, the Sense of Protestant Commentators upon them, I think, universally is, that when the Gentiles in God's appointed Time should be <hi>brought into Covenant with God,</hi> it should be as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, by being persuaded to <hi>consent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging themselves to God,</hi> to be faithful to Him, and <hi>keep Covenant with Him.</hi> He who heartily consents to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, gives up himself to the Lord, <hi>gives the Hand to the Lord,</hi> engages to own and serve Him; which is the Thing signified in all those metaphorical Phrases, which describe or point out this Event, in the Old-Testament Language.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in these last cited Words, explains the Phrase of <hi>giving the Hand to the Lord,</hi> as signifying <hi>engaging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to God in Covenant,</hi> and <hi>consenting to the Terms of the Covenant</hi> (as the Reader sees) and yet in the next Page but two, he contemns and utterly disallows <hi>my</hi> interpreting the same Phrase in the same Manner. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says (P. 21. <hi>c.</hi>)
<q>As to the Words of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he call'd the <hi>Israelites</hi> to the Passover, bidding them <hi>yield</hi> or <hi>give the Hand to the Lord</hi>; and in <hi>Ezra, They gave the Hand</hi> to put away their Wives; which he thinks to be an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Phrase for entring into Covenant, it carries its own Confutation with it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="83" facs="unknown:006839_0088_102A66C1A64E55E0"/>IV. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> often speaks of the Professions made by the ancient <hi>Israelites</hi> and <hi>Jewish</hi> Christians, <hi>when they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant,</hi> and <hi>were admitted into the Church.</hi> Whereas, according to the Doctrine of the same Author, in the same Book, we have no Account of any Profession made by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on any such Occasion. For he insists, that the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of such as are in Covenant, are <hi>born in Covenant</hi>; and are not <hi>admitted into Covenant,</hi> any otherwise than as they were seminally in their Ancestors; and that the Profession of their Ancestors, at the Head of the Covenant-Line, is that <hi>individual Profession, which brings them into Covenant.</hi> His Words are (P. 135. <hi>e.</hi> P. 136. <hi>a, b, c.</hi>)
<q>It is one and the same individual Profession and Engagement, which brings them and their Children into Covenant. And if there is one Instance in the Bible, where God ever took any Man into Covenant, and not his Children at the same Time, I should be glad to see it. It is by virtue of their being in Covenant, that they have a Right to the Seals. And if <hi>these</hi> Children are not cast out of Covenant by God, <hi>their</hi> Children have as good a Right to the Seals as they had. 'Tis God's Will, that his Mark &amp; Seal should be set upon Them, AND THEIR CHILDREN, AND THEIR CHILDREN FOR EVER, 'till God casts them out of Covenant.—'Tis certain, they have an Interest in the Covenant, and they have a Right to the Privileges of the Covenant so long as they remain in Covenant; and that is, 'till God cuts them off, and casts them out.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And accordingly he supposes, that <hi>John the Baptist</hi> never inquired into the doctrinal Knowledge of those he baptized, because they <hi>were already in Covenant with God,</hi> and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his visible Church, and not yet turned out: And he suggests, that <hi>John</hi> knew many of them not to be of a good moral Character. (P. 98.) So he largely insists, that the <hi>three Thousand Jews</hi> and Proselytes that the Apostles baptized (<hi>Act.</hi> ii.) were not taken into Covenant, but only <hi>continued in Covenant.</hi> (P. 46, 47.) So he supposes the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> before <hi>Philip</hi> baptized him, was a Member of the Church, and in Covenant with God. (P. 50.) Tho' he inconsistently mentions those same Persons in the 2d of <hi>Acts,</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> as <hi>admitted into the Church</hi> by the Apostles, and

primitive Ministers. (P. 9. <hi>e.</hi> P. 10. <hi>a.</hi> P. 59. <hi>a.</hi>) And so (P. 8. <hi>d.</hi> P. 26. <hi>a.</hi>) he mentions God's <hi>taking all Israel</hi> into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: He mentions the <hi>Profession</hi> which the <hi>Israelites</hi> made (P. 25. <hi>e.</hi>) and (P. 5. <hi>d.</hi>) he speaks of the <hi>Words which the</hi> Israelites <hi>used, in their entring into Covenant with God.</hi> And (P. 36. <hi>d. e.</hi> P. 37. <hi>a b.</hi>) he speaks of their Profession in <hi>Moses</hi> Time, <hi>which God trusted so far as to admit 'em into Covenant.</hi> Whereas indeed, according to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> they <hi>were not taken in,</hi> nor did they <hi>enter into Covenant,</hi> neither in the Plains of <hi>Moab,</hi> nor at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> He says expresly, that they were <hi>in</hi> Covenant before that Time, when in <hi>Egypt,</hi> being taken-in in their Ancestors, <hi>Abraham, Isaac, &amp; Jacob.</hi> (P. 91. <hi>b.</hi>) But then we read of <hi>no Words,</hi> that these Patriarchs <hi>used at their entring into Covenant.</hi>—And it will undoubtedly follow, on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Principles, that we must go further back still for <hi>Israel</hi>'s being taken into Covenant; we must goup even to <hi>Adam</hi> himself, the first Father of Mankind, who was visibly in Covenant, and so his Posterity, in the Line of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ancestors, without the Line's being broken by a visible <hi>cutting off,</hi> and <hi>casting out</hi> by God, as we have all Reason to suppose. And after the Flood, we have Reason to think, God had a Covenant-Race continued in <hi>Shem</hi>'s Posterity, especially in the Line of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Ancestors. And tho' <hi>Terah, Abraham</hi>'s Father, was tainted with the then-prevailing Idolatry; yet there is no Appearance of the Line's being then <hi>cut off,</hi> in the Way Mr. <hi>W.</hi> speaks of, by God's visibly <hi>casting him out.</hi> On the contrary, God took a special Fatherly Care of Him and his Children, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> the Land of graven Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to <hi>Haran.</hi> (Gen. xi.31.) And God is called the God of the Father of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Nahor,</hi> that is, the God of <hi>Terah.</hi> (Gen. xxxi.53.) And if it be said, that in <hi>Abraham</hi> began a new Dispensation of the Covenant; so that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might properly on that Account be said to be <hi>taken into Covenant,</hi> as tho his Ancestors had not been in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: I answer, The Alteration of the Dispensation was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

So that, according to Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Scheme, it must be <hi>Adam</hi>'s Profession of Religion, that was <hi>the individual Profession</hi> which made all his Posterity, in the Line of the Church, even to the Apostles Days, <hi>visible Saints,</hi> or (as he himself explains visible Saintship) such as we have rational Ground to think are real Saints, possessed of Gospel-Holiness; and on that Account have a Right to Sacraments. For so He says it is with the Children of them that are in Covenant, and their Children, and their Children <hi>for ever,</hi> 'till cut off and cast out by God.</p>
                  <p>So that now we have the Scheme in a true View of it. — The <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees</hi> that <hi>John</hi> baptized, whom Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes <hi>John</hi> knew to be not of a good moral Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and whose Doctrinal Knowledge he did not inquire into before he baptized 'em; because they had before been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their Ancestors; even <hi>These</hi> were visible Saints, and such as <hi>John</hi> had rational Ground to think had sufficient doctrinal Knowledge and were orthodox and real Saints, having moral Evidence that they had Gospel-Holiness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Adam</hi> their original Ancestor made a Profession of Religion, in Words of double Meaning, without any Marks of Distinction or Discrimination, by which any might know their Meaning!</p>
                  <p>And if we should go back no further than <hi>Abraham,</hi> it would not much mend the Matter; supposing the Case had been so, that we had the Words of both <hi>Abraham</hi>'s &amp; <hi>Adam</hi>'s Profession written down in our Bibles: whereas, we have neither; no, nor have we the Words of the Profession of any one Person, either in the Old Testament or New, at their being <hi>taken into</hi> the Church, if the Things which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says are true; tho' he speaks so often of Professions, and Words of Professions, and Declarations, made on such Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as if we had an express Account of 'em in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. As our Author abundantly maintains, that unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Men in covenanting with God, may and do promise the Exercise of saving Faith, Repentance, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So he holds, that they promise to begin the Exercise of these Graces <hi>immediately, from this Moment,</hi> and to live in them <hi>from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth.</hi> (P. 25. <hi>c, e.</hi> &amp; 26. <hi>a.</hi> &amp; 28. <hi>a. c.</hi>

                     <pb n="86" facs="unknown:006839_0091_102A66CBD6D23D48"/>Now I desire this Matter may be look'd into, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly examined.— Not only the holy Scriptures, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to them, Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> and sound Divines in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral teach us, but Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself maintains, that Men who are unsanctified, do <hi>for the present refuse</hi> and <hi>oppose</hi> these Things. In a forecited Place of his Sermon on <hi>Isai.</hi> xlv.11. our Author says, that <hi>unregenerate and unsanctified Men op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all Means for the bringing them to these Things, are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly without 'em, and labour to find out all manner of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Hindrances in the Way of 'em; and if they pray for 'em, don't desire they should come yet, but would stay a while longer.</hi> Now, how is this consistent with such Persons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising, with any <hi>Sincerity</hi> at all, that they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with and perform these Things <hi>immediately, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,</hi> without staying <hi>one Moment</hi> longer? If God calls a Man <hi>this Moment</hi> to yield his whole Heart to him in Faith, Love and new Obedience; and if he in Answer to the Call solemnly promises and swears <note n="†" place="bottom">It must be observed, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> often speaks of the Promise which an unregenerate Man makes in Covenanting with God, as his <hi>Oath.</hi> P. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, such Promises and Oaths of unregenerate Men must not only be contrary to Sincerity, but very <hi>presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> upon these two Accounts. (1.) Because herein they take an Oath to the most High, which, it is ten Thousand to one, they will break as soon as the Words are out of their Mouths, by continuing still unconverted; yea, an Oath which they are breaking even while they are uttering it. And what Folly and Wickedness is it for Men to take such Oaths? and how contrary to the Counsel given by the wise Man, in <hi>Eccl.</hi> v.2, 4, 5, 6? And to what Purpose should ungodly Men be encouraged to utter such Promises &amp; Oaths before the Church, for the Church's Acceptance; which are so far from being worthy to be credited, or a Fulfilment of them to be expected, that it is many Thousands, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:006839_0092_102A66CDE40B5B20"/>
Millions of Times more likely to be otherwise? That is, it is so much more likely they will not be converted the very next <hi>Moment.</hi>— (2.) When an unconverted Man makes such a Promise, he promises what he has not to give, or that which he has no Sufficiency for the Performance of; no Sufficiency in himself, nor any Sufficiency in any other that he has a Claim to, or Interest in. There is indeed a Sufficiency in God to enable him; but he has no Claim to it. For God's helping a Man savingly to believe in Christ is a <hi>saving Blessing:</hi> And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself owns, that a Man can't by Promise claim any saving Blessings, till he has ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Conditions of the Covenant of Grace. (P. 22. <hi>e.</hi> &amp; 28. <hi>e.</hi>) So that in vain it is said by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (P. 27. <hi>e.</hi>)
<q>I pray that it may be thoroughly considered what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Covenant of Grace, and on what <hi>Stock</hi> a Man is to finish.</q>
Meaning (as appears by the Sequel) the <hi>Stock</hi> of God's Sufficiency. To what Purpose is this said? when the Covenant of Grace promises or makes over no such <hi>Stock</hi> to him who has no Interest in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of it, as having not yet complied with the Condition of its Promises. Nor does an unconverted Man promise any Thing in a humble Dependance on that <hi>Stock</hi>: no such Men do <hi>lay hold on God's Strength,</hi> or trust in God's Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency: For this is a discriminating Mark of a true Saint; as our Author himself observes, in that forecited Passage, in his <hi>Sermons on Christ a King and Witness,</hi> P. 19. <hi>c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would here take Notice of it as remarkable, that tho' Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had own'd that a natural Man can claim no saving Blessings by God's <hi>Promise,</hi> yet to help out his Scheme of a natural Man's engaging &amp; promising, even with an Oath, the Exercises of saving Grace, he (in P. 27, 28. especially P. 28 <hi>e</hi>) speaking of the <hi>great Encouragement</hi> on which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Men can promise these Things, supposes God has given <hi>such Encouragement</hi> to them who promise and engage themselves to God, with that Degree of Earnestness &amp; Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity which he often speaks of as requisite to Communion, that we have Reason to determine that God never will fail of bestowing on them saving Grace; so that they shall fulfill their Promises. I say, he supposes that we have Reason to determine this, because he himself determines it. His
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:006839_0093_102A3A4047569DC8"/>
Words are these:
<q>Tho' there be no Promise of saving Good, exclusive of Faith, yet there being a Command and Encouragement, there are suitable Springs of his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Hope, in his engaging himself to God and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself upon his Mercy with all the Earnestness and Sincerity he can. GOD NEVER <hi>will be worse than his Encouragement,</hi> nor do less than he has encouraged; and he has said, <hi>To him that hath shall be given.</hi>
                     </q>
Now if this be so, and if this will make it out, that an unconverted Man who is <hi>morally sincere</hi> may reasonably, on this <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,</hi> promise immediately to believe and repent, tho' this ben't in his own Power; then it will follow, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an unconverted Man covenants, with such moral Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity as gives a lawful Right to Sacraments, <hi>God NEVER will fail</hi> of giving him converting Grace <hi>that Moment,</hi> to enable him <hi>from thence-forward</hi> to believe and repent, as he promises. And if this be so, and none may lawfully cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God <hi>without</hi> moral Sincerity (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> also says) then it will follow, that <hi>never</hi> any one Person comes, nor can come lawfully to the Lord's Supper, in an unconverted State; because when they enter into Covenant lawfully (supposing them not converted before) God always converts 'em in the Moment of their covenanting, <hi>before</hi> they come to the Lord's Table.—And if so, what is become of all this grand Dispute about the Lawfulness of Person's coming to the Lord's Table, who have not converting Grace?</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> greatly misrepresents Me from Time to Time, in representing as tho' I had asserted, that <hi>it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for an unsanctified Man to enter into Covenant with God</hi>; and that those who were unsanctified among the <hi>Israelites,</hi> did not enter into Covenant with God; that the pretended Covenanting of such is <hi>not Covenanting, but only Lying, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lying</hi>; and that no natural Man can own the Covenant, <hi>but that he certainly Lies, knows he Lies,</hi> and <hi>designedly Lies, in all these Things, when he says them.</hi> (P. 26. <hi>d.</hi> 22. <hi>d.</hi> 24. <hi>d.</hi> 31. <hi>a, b, c.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi>) Whereas, I never said, nor supposed any such Thing. I never doubted but that Multitudes of unsanctified Persons, and in all Ages of the Christian Church, and in this Age, and here in <hi>New England,</hi> have entred visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and in Profession, into the Covenant of Grace, and
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:006839_0094_102A66D2344656E8"/>
have own'd that Covenant, and promised a Compliance with all the Duties of it, without known or wilful Lying; for this Reason, because they were deceived, and did not know their own Hearts: And that they (however deceived) were under the Obligations of the Covenant, and bound by their Engagements and Promises: And that in <hi>that</hi> Sense, they were God's Covenant-People, that by their own binding Act they were engaged to God in Covenant; tho' such an Act, perform'd without habitual Holiness, be an unlawful one. If a Thing be externally devoted to God, by doing what ought not to have been done, the Thing devoted may, by that Act, be the Lord's: As it was with the Censers of <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company. (<hi>Num.</hi> xvi.37, 38.)</p>
                  <p>What I asserted, was, that none could <hi>profess a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Covenant of Grace, and avouch JEHOVAH to be their God, and Christ to be their Saviour,</hi> i e. <hi>that they are so by their own Act and Choice, and yet love the World more than JEHOVAH without Lying,</hi> or <hi>being deceived.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See my <hi>Inquiry,</hi> P. 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34.</note> And that <hi>he who is wholly under the Power of a carnal Mind, which is not subject to the Law of God nor indeed can be, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to love God with all his Heart and with all his Soul, without either great Deceit,</hi> or <hi>the most manifest and palpable Absurdity: In-as-much-as Promising supposes the Person to be conscious to Himself, or perswaded of himself, that he has such a Heart in him; because his Lips pretend to declare his Heart, and the Nature of a Promise implies real Intention, Will, and Compliance of Heart.</hi>

Surely they that reject the Covenant of Grace <hi>in their Hearts</hi> (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> owns, all unsanctified Men do) can't own it <hi>with their Lips,</hi> without either <hi>deceiving</hi> or <hi>being deceived.</hi> Words can't be a true Signification of more than is in the Mind. <hi>Inward Covenanting,</hi> as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> taught, is by an Act of saving Faith. (<hi>Safety of Ap.</hi> P. 85. <hi>e.</hi> 86. <hi>a.</hi>) And <hi>outward Covenanting</hi> is an Expression of <hi>inward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting:</hi> therefore, if it be not attended with <hi>inward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting,</hi> it is a false Expression. And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in Effect owns the same Thing: for he says, (.P. 21. <hi>b.</hi>)
<q>That there is no Doubt they who are wilful obstinate Sinners, deal <hi>deceitfully</hi> and <hi>falsly</hi> when they pretend to covenant

with God.</q>
But so do all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unregenerate Sinners under the Gospel, according to Mr. <hi>Stoddard's</hi> and his own Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. And thus the very Point, about which he contests so earnestly and so long, and with so many great Words, is in the midst of it all, given up fully, by his own Concession.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is greatly displeased with my saying (as above) that none who are under the Power of a carnal Mind can visibly own the Covenant, <hi>without lying</hi> or <hi>being deceived,</hi> &amp;c. And he finds great Fault with my Gloss on PSAL. lxxviii.36, 37. <hi>They did flatter him with their Mouth, and lied to him with their Tongue:</hi> which I interpret, as tho' they lied in pretending that Respect to God, which indeed they had not.

                     </gap> thus interpreted this very Text now in Dispute. In his Sermons on <hi>Christ a King &amp; Witness,</hi> speaking of the outward Acts of <hi>Worship</hi> done by those that don't love God nor believe in Christ, he expresly says, (P. 77.)
<q>They are <hi>in their own Nature</hi> a LIE; a false Pretence of something <hi>within,</hi> that is not there.—See (says Mr. <hi>W.</hi>) this Interpretation of it, in PSAL. lxxviii.34,—37. <hi>They did flatter him with their Mouths; they lied to him with their Tongues,</hi> &amp;c.</q>—(<hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 74. <hi>b, c.</hi>)
<q>Christ's visible Church are such as visibly and outwardly profess to be his Subjects, and act outwardly as if they believed on him. But these outward Acts in themselves are not that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Obedience, which Christ requires; nay, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they have no Religion in them; and Christ has nothing to do with them, <hi>but as</hi> they are the Fruits and Expressions of the Heart, as they are the Language and Index of the Mind and Conscience, and outward Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the inward Frame, Temper and Actings of the

                  <head>SECTION I. <hi>General</hi> Observations upon his Way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and answering Arguments; with some <hi>Instances</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> Method excepted against.</head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>W.</hi> endeavours to support his own Opinion, and to confute the Book he pretends to answer, by the following Methods.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By frequently <hi>misrepresenting what I say,</hi> and then disputing or exclaiming against what he wrongfully charges as <hi>mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By misrepresenting what <hi>Others</hi> say in their Writings, whose Opinions he pretends to <hi>espouse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. By <hi>seeming to oppose</hi> and <hi>confute</hi> Arguments, and yet only saying Things which have no <hi>Reference</hi> at all to 'em, but relate entirely to <hi>other</hi> Matters, that are altogether <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> to the Argument in Hand.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By advancing <hi>new</hi> and <hi>extraordinary Notions</hi>; which are both manifestly contrary to <hi>Truth,</hi> and also contrary to the <hi>common Apprehensions</hi> of the Christian Church in all Ages.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By making Use of peremptory &amp; confident <hi>Assertions,</hi> instead of Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By using great <hi>Exclamation,</hi> in the Room of Arguing; as tho' he would amuse and alarm his Readers, and excite Terror in them, instead of rational Conviction.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. By wholly <hi>overlooking</hi> Arguments, and <hi>not answering</hi> at all; pretending, that there is <hi>no</hi> Argument, <hi>nothing</hi> to answer; when the Case is manifestly far otherwise.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="93" facs="unknown:006839_0098_102A66E0048E1788"/>8. By frequently turning off an Argument with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that it is <hi>begging the Question</hi>; when there is not the least Shew or Pretext for it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. By very frequently <hi>begging the Question</hi> himself, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is <hi>equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. By often alledging and insisting on Things in which he is <hi>inconsistent</hi> with himself.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>first</hi> of these Methods used by Mr. <hi>W—ms,</hi> i. e. his <hi>misrepresenting what I say,</hi> and then disputing or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming against what He injuriously charges as mine, many Instances have been already observed: I now would take Notice of some other Instances.</p>
                  <p>In P. 15. <hi>c.</hi> He charges me with
<q>affirming vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in a Number of Repetitions, <hi>That the Doctrine taught is, that no Manner of Pretence to any VISIBLE Holiness is made or designed to be made.</hi>
                     </q>
These he cites as my Words, marking them with Notes of <hi>Quotations.</hi> Whereas I never said any such <hi>Words,</hi> nor said or thought any such <hi>Thing,</hi> but the contrary. I knew, that those whose Doctrine I opposed, declared that <hi>visible</hi> Holiness was necessary: And take particular Notice of it (P. 8.) where I say,
<q>It is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all Hands, that none ought to be admitted, as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the visible Church of Christ, but visible Saints:</q>
and argue on this Supposition for 15 Pages together, in that same Part of my Book where Mr. <hi>W.</hi> charges me with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the contrary. What I say is, that People are taught, that <hi>they come into the Church without any Pretence to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace,</hi> (P. 15. <hi>d.</hi>) I don't say, without a Pretence to <hi>visible Holiness.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>W.</hi> alters my Words, to make them speak something not only diverse, but contrary to what I do say, and say very often; and so takes Occasion, or rather <hi>makes</hi> an Occasion, to charge me before the World, with telling a <hi>manifest Untruth.</hi> P. 15. <hi>d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in answering my Argument concerning <hi>brotherly Love,</hi> (P. 70. <hi>e.</hi> 71. <hi>a.</hi>) represents me as arguing,
<q>That in the Exercise of Christian <hi>Love</hi> described in the Gospel, there is such an Union of Hearts, as there cannot be of a Saint to an unsanctified Man.</q>
Which is a Thing I never said, and is quite contrary to the Sentiments which I have abundantly declared. I indeed speak of that <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therly
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:006839_0099_102A67BDAEDACBF8"/>
Love,</hi> as what can't be of a Saint to One that is not <hi>apprehended</hi> and <hi>judged</hi> to be sanctified. But that Notion of a peculiar Love, which can't be to an unsanctified Man, or without the Reality of Holiness in the Person beloved, is what I ever abhor'd, and have born a most loud and open and large Testimony against, again and again, from the Press, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Marks of a Work of the true Spirit.</hi> P. 101, 102, 103, 104.— <hi>Thoughts on the Revival of Religion,</hi> from P. 292, to 303.— <hi>Nature of Religious Affections,</hi> P. 85—87. Preface to <hi>Inquiry into Qualifications for Communion.</hi> P 5</note> and did so in the Preface to that very Book which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> writes against.</p>
                  <p>In P. 74. <hi>a, b.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> represents me as supposing, that in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, <hi>both the</hi> covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Parties, viz.</hi> Christ and the Communicant, <hi>seal to the Truth</hi> of the Communicant's Faith; or that both seal to this as true, that the Communicant <hi>does receive Christ.</hi> Whereas, by me, no such Thing was ever thought; nor is any Thing said that has such an Aspect. What I say, is very plain and express, (P. 75.) <hi>That Christ by his Minister professes his Part of the Covenant, presents himself,</hi> and <hi>professes the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness of his Heart to be theirs who receive him.</hi> That on the other Hand, <hi>the Communicant</hi> in receiving the offered Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, <hi>professes his Part in the Covenant, &amp; the Willingness of his Heart to receive Christ who is offered.</hi> How different is this from both Parties sealing to the Truth of the Communicant's Faith?</p>
                  <p>In P. 76, 77, <hi>&amp;</hi> 80. He greatly misrepresents my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from 1 COR. xi.28. <hi>Let a Man examine himself,</hi> &amp;c. as tho' I supposed, <hi>the Greek Word translated</hi> examine, <hi>must necessarily imply an Examination to Approbation</hi>; that it <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to approve</hi>; and <hi>that a Man's Examination must mean his approving himself to himself to be sanctified.</hi> This Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he makes over &amp; over, and builds his Answer to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, upon it; and in Opposition to this, he says (P. 77. <hi>c.</hi>)
<q>Wherever the Word means to examine to Approbation, it is not used in its natural Sense, but metonymically.</q>
Whereas, there is not the least Foundation for such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation: No such Thing is said or suggested by me, as if I supposed that the Meaning of the Word is to <hi>approve,</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="unknown:006839_0100_102A3A4D845ED1F8"/>
or to <hi>examine to Approbation.</hi> What I say is, that it properly signifies <hi>proving</hi> or <hi>trying a Thing, whether it be true and of the right Sort.</hi> (P. 77. <hi>d.</hi>) And I there, in the same Place, expresly speak of the Word (in the Manner Mr. <hi>W.</hi> does) as not used in its natural Sense, but metonymically, when it is used to signify <hi>approve.</hi> So that Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Representation is not only diverse from, but contrary to what I say. Indeed I suppose (as well I may) that when the Apostle directs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to try themselves with Respect to their Qualifications for the Lord's Supper, he would not have 'em come, if upon Trial they find themselves not qualified. But it would be ridiculous to say, that I therefore suppose the Meaning of the Word, <hi>Try</hi> or <hi>Examine,</hi> is to <hi>Approve,</hi> when 'tis evident that the <hi>trying</hi> is only in order to knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Thing is to be <hi>approved,</hi> or <hi>disapproved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In P. 98. <hi>b.</hi> on the Argument from <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> alters my Words, bringing them the better to comport with the odious Representation he had made of my Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that I required a giving an Account of <hi>Experiences,</hi> as a Term of Communion; he puts in Words as mine, which are not mine, and distinguishes them with Marks of Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; charging me with <hi>representing it as</hi>
                     <q>probable that <hi>John</hi> had as much Time to inquire into their Experiences as into their doctrinal Knowledge.</q>
—Whereas, my Words are these, (P. 101. <hi>a.) He had as much Opportunity to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Credibility of their Profession, as he had to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their doctrinal Knowledge and moral Character.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>In P. 118 <hi>d.</hi> (and to the like Purpose, P. 134. <hi>c.</hi>) our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor represents me, and others of my Principles, as holding, That <hi>the Gospel does peremptorily sentence Men to Damnation for eating and drinking without sanctifying Grace.</hi> But surely Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would have done well to have refer'd to the Place in my Inquiry, where any Thing is said that has such a Look. For, I find Nothing that I have said in that Book, or any other Writing of mine, about the Gospel's peremptorily sentencing such Men to Damnation, or signifying how far I thought they were exposed to Damnation, or expressing my Sentiments more or less about the Matter.</p>
                  <p>In P. 130. <hi>e.</hi> &amp; 131. <hi>a.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says,
<q>When One sees with what Epithets of Honour Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in some
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:006839_0101_102A3A61C5CD69A0"/>
Parts of his Book has complimented Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it must look like a strange Medly to tack to them; — <hi>That he was a weak Beggar of his Question; A Supposer of what was to be proved; Taking for granted the Point in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy; Inconsistent with himself; Ridiculously contradicting his own Arguments.</hi>
                     </q>
These Expressions, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> speaks of as tacked to those honourable Epithets, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents as Expressions which I had used concerning Mr. <hi>Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard:</hi> And his Readers that have not consulted my Book, would doubtless take it so from his Manner of Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereas, the Truth is, no one of these Expressions are used concerning Mr. <hi>S.</hi> any where in my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; nor is there one disrespectful Word spoken of him there. All the Ground Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had to make such a Representation, was, that in answering <hi>Arguments</hi> against my Opinion I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to shew them to be <hi>weak</hi> (tho' I don't find that I used that Epithet) and certainly for one to pretend to answer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and yet allow 'em to be strong, would be to shew <hi>himself</hi> to be very weak. In answering some of these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and endeavouring to shew wherein the Inconclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of 'em lay, I have sometimes taken Notice that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect lay in what is called <hi>begging the Question,</hi> or supposing the Thing to be proved. And if I had said so concerning Mr. <hi>S—d</hi>'s Arguments, speaking of them <hi>as his,</hi> I don't know why it should be represented as any <hi>personal</hi> Reflection, or unhandsome dishonourable Treatment of <hi>Him.</hi> Every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conclusive Argument is weak; and the Business of a Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant is to shew wherein the Weakness lies: But to speak of <hi>Arguments</hi> as weak, is not to call <hi>Men</hi> weak.— All the Ground Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has to speak of me as saying, that <hi>Mr. S. ridiculously contradicted his own Arguments,</hi> is, that (in P. 11.) citing some Passages out of Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> Appeal, I use these Words;
<q>But how he reconciled these Passages with the rest of his Treatise, I would modestly say, I must confess my self at a Loss.</q>
And particularly I observed, that I could not see how they consist with what he says, <hi>P.</hi> 16. and so proceed to mention one Thing which appears to me not well to consist with them.— But certainly this is not inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently to reflect on Mr. <hi>S.</hi> any more than Mr. <hi>W.</hi> indecently reflects on the FIRST REFORMERS, in his Answer to Mr.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:006839_0102_102A3A7253D50E90"/>
                     <hi>Croswell,</hi> (P. 74, 75.) where speaking of their Doctrine of a particular Perswasion as of the Essence of saving Faith, he says, <hi>They are found inconsistent with themselves, and their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine lighter than Vanity.</hi> And again (P. 82.) <hi>If ever</hi> (says Mr. W.) <hi>any Men were confuted from their own Concessions, these Divines are.</hi> And more to the like Purpose.—Which gives me a fair Occasion to express the like <hi>Wonder</hi> at him, as he does at me (P. 131. <hi>a.</hi>) but I forbear <hi>personal</hi> Reflections.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (in the same P. <hi>d.</hi>) has these Words;
<q>And to say, that all unsanctified Men do profess and seal their Consent to the Covenant of Grace in the Lord's Supper, when they <hi>KNOW</hi> at the same Time they do not consent to it, nor have their Heart at all in the Affair,—is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>worse</hi> than begging the Question— that is, as I suppose, (the same that he charged me with before) <hi>Telling a manifest Untruth.</hi>
                     </q>
By which he plainly suggests, that I have <hi>said</hi> thus. Whereas, I no where say, nor in any Respect signify that I suppose, all unsanctified Communicants do KNOW that they do not consent to the Covenant of Grace. I never made any Doubt, but that Multitudes of unsanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Communicants are deceived, and think they do consent to it.</p>
                  <p>In P. 132. <hi>d.</hi> he says of me,
<q>The Author endeavours to show, that the admitting unsanctified Persons tends to the Ruin and Reproach of the Christian Church; and to the Ruin of the Persons admitted.</q>
But how widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent is this from what I express in the Place he refers to? (Inq. P. 121. <hi>c.</hi>) That which I say there, is, That
<q>by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Liberty given, to open the Door to as many as please, of those who have <hi>no Visibility</hi> of real Saintship, and make no Profession of it, nor Pretension to it, is a Method which tends to the Ruin and great Reproach of the Christian Church, and also to the Ruin of the Persons admitted.</q>
I freely grant, and shew abundantly in my Book, it is never to be expected, that all unsanctified Men can be kept out, by the most exact Attendance on the Rules of Christ, by those that admit Members.</p>
                  <p>In P. 136. <hi>d.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> wholly without Grounds speaks of me as representing, that
<q>unconverted Men make Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension to nothing but what God's Enemies have, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:006839_0103_102A66E2AE768BE8"/>
in open &amp; avowed Rebellion against him.</q>
Whereas, I suppose that some natural Men do profess, and profess truly, <hi>many Things,</hi> which those have not, who are <hi>open</hi> and <hi>avowed</hi> Enemies of God. They may truly profess that Sort of moral Sincerity, in many Things belonging to Morality &amp; Religion, which avowed Enemies have not: nor is there any Sentence or Word in my Book, which implies or intimates the contrary.</p>
                  <p>In P. 141. <hi>c, d.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> evidently insinuates, that I am one of those who
<q>If Men live never so strictly confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Laws of the Gospel, and never so diligently seek their own Salvation, to outward Appearance, yet don't stick to speak of them, and act openly towards them, as Persons giving no more publick Evidence, that they are not the Enemies of God and Haters of Jesus Christ, than the very worst of the Heathen.</q>
— But surely every one that has read my Book, every one that knows my constant Conduct, and Manner of Preaching, as well as Writing, and how much I have written, said, and done against judging and censuring Persons of an externally moral and religious Behaviour, must know how injurious this Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of me is.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECTION II. Instances of the <hi>second</hi> Thing mentioned as exceptionable in Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Method of managing this Controversy; <hi>viz.</hi> His mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representing what is said in the Writings of <hi>Others,</hi> that he supposes <hi>favour</hi> his Opinion.</head>
                  <p>PErhaps Instances enough of this have already been taken Notice of; yet I would now mention some others.</p>
                  <p>In what he says in Reply to my Answer to the eighth <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> he says, (P. 108)
<q>Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> does not say, If sanctifying Grace be necessary to a Person's lawful partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord's Supper, then God would have given some certain Rule, whereby those WHO ARE TO AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIT
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:006839_0104_102A66E52F3BC048"/>
THEM, may know whether they have such Grace, or not.</q>
Mr. <hi>W.</hi> there intimates (as the Reader may see) as if Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> spake so, that it is to be understood <hi>disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,</hi> meaning, he would <hi>either</hi> have given some certain Rule to the Church who admit them, <hi>or</hi> else to the Persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: so that by one Means or other, the <hi>Lord's Supper might be restrained to converted Men.</hi> And he exclaims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me for representing as tho' Mr. <hi>Stoddard's</hi> Argument were concerning a <hi>certain Rule, whereby those who are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, may know whether they have Grace</hi> (see the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Page) and speaks of it as nothing akin to Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> Argument. Now let the Reader take Notice of Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> Words, and see whether his Argument ben't something <hi>akin</hi> to this. He says expresly (<hi>Appeal</hi> P. 75.)
<q>God don't bind his CHURCH to Impossibilities. If he had made such an Ordinance, He would give Gifts to his CHURCH, to distinguish sincere Men from Hypocrites, whereby the Ordinance might have been attended.—The <hi>minor</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so evident: He has given no such Rule to his CHURCH, whereby it may be restrain'd to converted Men. This appears, because by the Rule that they are to go by, they are allowed TO GIVE the Lord's Supper to many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Men. For all visible Signs are common to Men converted, and unconverted.</q>
— So that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in Fact does say, <hi>If sanctifying Grace be necessary to a Person's lawful partaking of the Lord's Supper,</hi> then <hi>God would have given some certain Rule, whereby the Church [those who are to admit them] may know, whether they have Grace, or not.</hi> Tho' Mr. <hi>W.</hi> denies it, and says, this is nothing akin to Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> Argument; contrary to the plainest Fact.</p>
                  <p>In P. 99. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> replying to my Answer to the sixth Objection, misrepresents Mr. <hi>Hudson,</hi> in the following Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
<q>This [<hi>i. e.</hi> Baptism] says Mr. <hi>Hudson,</hi> makes them Members of the Body of Christ. And as for a particular explicit Covenant, besides the general imposed on Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, I find no Mention of it, no Example, nor Warrant for it in all the Scripture.</q>
— Here Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is still ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifestly endeavouring to discredit my Doctrine of <hi>an explicit owning the Covenant of Grace</hi>; and he so manages and alters Mr. <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Words, as naturally leads the Reader to sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:006839_0105_102A66E6B3A62EE8"/>
that Mr. <hi>Hudson</hi> speaks against this: Whereas, he says not a Word about it. What Mr. <hi>H.</hi> speaks of, is not an explicit owning the Covenant of Grace, or baptismal Covenant; but a <hi>particular Church-Covenant,</hi> by which a particular Society bind themselves explicitly, one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, jointly to carry on the publick Worship. Mr. <hi>Hudson's</hi> Words are (P. 19.)
<q>I dare not make a <hi>particular explicit holy Covenant to be the</hi> FORM <hi>of a</hi> PARTICULAR <hi>Church, as this Description seemeth to do</hi>; because I find no Mention of any such Covenant, besides the general imposed on Churches, nor Example, nor Warrant for it in all the Scripture.</q>
And then afterwards Mr. <hi>Hudson</hi> says,
<q>But it is the general Covenant seal'd by <hi>Baptism,</hi> and not this, that makes 'em Members of the Body of Christ.</q>
— Mr. <hi>W.</hi> by citing distant Passages in Mr. <hi>Hudson,</hi> and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, in his own Way, by Particles and Conjunctions, which Mr. <hi>Hudson</hi> don't use, and leaving out these Words— <hi>To be the Form of a particular Church, as this Description seemeth to do,</hi>— quite blinds the Mind of his Reader, as to Mr. <hi>Hudson's</hi> true Sense, which is nothing to Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.—Mr. <hi>Hudson</hi> says not a Word here against, or about an <hi>express or explicit covenanting,</hi> or owning the Covenant, in my Sense: but in other Places, in the same Book, he speaks of it, and for it, as necessary for <hi>all Christians.</hi> Thus, (in P. 69. <hi>b, c.</hi>)
<q>There is one individual, EXPRESS, external Covenant: not only on God's Part,— but also it is one external, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Covenant, on Men's Part; which <hi>all Christians,</hi> as Christians, <hi>enter into,</hi> by their PROFESSED Acceptance, and EXPRESS Restipulation, and promised Subjection and Obedience; tho' not altogether in one Place, or at one Time.</q>
He speaks again to the same Purpose, P. 100.</p>

                  <p>SUch is his Answer (P. 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to my Argument from ISAI. lvi. Particularly from those Words, v. 6, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Also the Sons of the Stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve him, to love the Name of the Lord, to be his Servants — even them will I bring to my holy Mountain, and make them joyful in my House of Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. For I say nothing under that Argument (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Answer presumes) which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses any <hi>Antithesis</hi> or Opposition here between the State of the Gentiles and Eunuchs <hi>under the Old Testament, and under the Gospel, as to Terms of Acceptance with God</hi>: Nor any Opposition, as to a greater Necessity of sanctifying Grace, to the lawful partaking of Ordinances, under the Gospel, than under the Law; as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> also supposes in his Arguings on this Head. But the <hi>Opposition</hi> I speak of, as plainly pointed forth in the Chapter, is this: That, whereas under the Law, <hi>not only</hi> Piety of Heart and Practice were required, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>else,</hi> even Soundness of Body and Circumcision, 'Tis foretold, that under the Gospel, Piety of Heart and Practice <hi>only</hi> should be required; that altho' they were Eunuchs or Uncircumcised, yet if it appeared that they <hi>loved the Name of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. they should be admitted.</p>
                  <p>So when I argued, that Christ, in the latter Part of the viith Chap. of <hi>Matth.</hi> representing the final Issue of Things, with Regard to the visible Church in general, speaks of all as being such as had look'd on themselves to be interested in him as their Lord and Saviour, and had an Opinion of their good Estate; tho' the Hope of some was built on the <hi>Sand,</hi> and others on a <hi>Rock:</hi> —Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Reply (P. 40, 41.) intirely over-looks the Argument, and talks about
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:006839_0107_102A66EC040BEB50"/>
other Things. He says, <hi>Christ don't fault</hi> those that cried, LORD, LORD, <hi>for entring into Covenant, but for not keeping Covenant.</hi> (P. 41. <hi>b.</hi>) Here he runs back to another Thing, relating to another Argument, to which this has no Reference, which he dwells wholly upon; and says nothing to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument I use in that Place.</p>
                  <p>So in his Reply to what I say on the Parable of the <hi>Wheat and Tares</hi> (P. 98, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) He has intirely over-look'd the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. He says, to vindicate the Objection, (P. 99.)
<q>Which we think shows us, the Mind and Will of Christ in this Matter is, that his Servants shall proceed only on certain establish'd Rules of his visible Kingdom, and not upon any private Rules of judging about 'em.</q>
—Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, I never said, or supposed, that Christ's Servants must not <hi>proceed on certain establish'd Rules of his visible Kingdom,</hi> or that they ought to go upon <hi>any private Rules of judging</hi>; but particularly and largely express'd my Mind to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in my explaining the Question: And say (<hi>Inq.</hi> P. 5.)
<q>That it is properly a Visibility to the Eye of the <hi>publick</hi> Charity, and not of a <hi>private</hi> Judgment, that gives a Right to be received as visible Saints by the Publick.</q>
And repeat the same Thing again, P. 125. <hi>c, d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says in this Place about <hi>Infants</hi> being <hi>born in the Church,</hi> it entirely diverts the Reader to another Point (which I shall hereafter particularly consider) wholly distinct from the Subject of the Argument; which is about Rules of <hi>Admission into the Church,</hi> whenever they are admitted. If Persons are born in the Church in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Standing, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes, then they are not <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> at all, but in their <hi>Ancestors.</hi> But however, the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on returns, Whether Ancestors that are <hi>unsanctified,</hi> can have a lawful Right to come into the Church? Mr. <hi>W.</hi> holds they may. The Subject of the Argument is about <hi>bringing-in</hi> Tares into the Field, <hi>whenever they are bro't in,</hi> whether sooner or later: And whether <hi>Tares</hi> have a lawful Right, by Warrant from Christ, to be in the <hi>Field</hi>; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this to intend the Church of Christ. The Argument I produced to the contrary was, that the Tares were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced contrary to the Owner's Design, through Men's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity &amp; Satan's Procurement. Which Argument, being
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:006839_0108_102A66EFF303BCF8"/>
intirely overlook'd by my Opponent, I desire it may be now particularly considered.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Devil</hi> brought in the <hi>Tares,</hi> 'tis manifest, he brought in something that did <hi>not belong</hi> there; and therein counteracted the <hi>Owner</hi> of the Field, and did it under that very Notion of crossing his Design. <hi>An Enemy</hi> (says the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) <hi>hath done this.</hi> But how does this consist with the Tares having a <hi>lawful Right,</hi> by the Owner's Warrant and Appointment, to have a Standing in his Field? If CHRIST by his Institution has, in Mercy to unsanctified Men, given 'em a lawful Right to come into the Church, that it may be a Means of their Conversion; then 'tis a Work of his Kindness, as the compassionate Redeemer of Souls, to bring 'em in; and not the Doing of the great <hi>Enemy</hi> &amp; Destroyer of Souls. If the great Physician of Souls has built his Church, as an Infirmary, in Compassion to those that are sick, for this End that they may be brought in and heal'd there; shall it be said with Surprize, when such are found there, <hi>How came these sick People HERE!</hi> And shall the compassionate Physician, who built the Hospital, make Answer, <hi>An Enemy hath done This!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, if Christ has appointed that unsanctified Men should come into the Church, in Order to their Conversion, it would be an Instance of the <hi>Faithfulness</hi> of his Servants to bring in such. But the bringing in <hi>Tares</hi> into the Field, is not represented as owing to the Faithfulness and Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Servants; but on the contrary, is ascribed to their <hi>Sleepiness</hi> and Remisness: They were brought in while <hi>they slept,</hi> who ought to have done the Part of <hi>Watch-men,</hi> in keeping 'em out, and preventing the Designs of the subtil <hi>Enemy</hi> that brought 'em in.— Perhaps some would be ready to make the Reflection, that those Churches whose Practice is agreable to the loose Principles Mr. <hi>W.</hi> espouses, do that at Noon-Day, in the Presence of God, Angels &amp; Men, which the Devil did in the dead of the Night, <hi>while Men slept!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Reply to my Argument from that <hi>Christian brotherly Love,</hi> which is required towards all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the visible Church, goes entirely off from the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to Things quite aliene from it. His first Answer (P. 69. <hi>c.</hi>) is, that <hi>the Exercise of this Christian Love is not the
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:006839_0109_102A66F1C34FDAC8"/>
Term of Communion or Admission into the visible Church:</hi> which is perfectly foreign to the Business. For the Argument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects <hi>the Object</hi> of this Love, <hi>viz.</hi> visible Saints, <hi>that are to be thus beloved</hi>; and not at all the Qualifications of the <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Subject</hi> of it, or the <hi>Person that exercises this Love.</hi> If they that are admitted, are to be lov'd <hi>as true Saints,</hi> or <hi>for the Image of Christ appearing in them, or supposed to be in them</hi> (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> allows P. 68. <hi>c.</hi>) then it will follow, that none are to be admitted, but such as can reasonably be the Objects of Christian Love, or be loved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>as true Saints,</hi> and as those who <hi>have the Image of Christ appearing in them.</hi> Whether the Exercise of this Love be the Term of Communion, or not; yet if we are commanded to exercise this Love to all that are admitted to Communion, then it will certainly follow, that some reasonable Ground for being thus beloved, must be a Term of Communion in such as are admitted. To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it appointed, that we should love all that are admitted as true Saints, &amp; yet that it is not appointed that such as are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted should exhibit any reasonable Grounds for such a Love, is certainly to suppose very inconsistent Appointments.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q>The Apostles look'd on all those, whom they gathered into Churches or Christian Congregations to eat the Lord's Supper, as having the <hi>Truth</hi> dwelling in them; and so they behoved, every one of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to look upon one another: Seeing they could not love one another as Brethren in the <hi>Truth,</hi> without acknowledging that <hi>Truth</hi> as dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them. And so we see the Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their Writings to the Churches, supposing all their Members Objects of <hi>this Brotherly Love.</hi>— Christ's visible Church then is the Congregation of those whom the Apostle could call <hi>the Saints and Faithful in Christ Jesus.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s second Answer (P. 70. <hi>b.</hi>) is no less imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; viz. <hi>That Men</hi>'s <hi>Right to Communion in Gospel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> don't <hi>depend upon the Corruptions of other Men,</hi> in their forbearing to love 'em. As if my Argument were, that unless Men are <hi>actually loved,</hi> as true Saints, they have no Right to Communion! Whereas, the Argument was very diverse, <hi>viz.</hi> That unless Men have <hi>a Right to be so loved,</hi> they have no Right to Communion. If Men have an Appearance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Reason, of being true Saints, they may have a Right to be loved as true Saints, and to be admitted as such; however corrupt and void of Love other Men are: but without such an Appearance to Reason, 'tis <hi>no Corruption,</hi> not to love 'em as
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:006839_0110_102A66F4969B3F28"/>
true Saints; unless it be corrupt, not to act without Reason.<note n="†" place="bottom">A good Argument might also be drawn from the Corruption of unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Men; for that they are all so under the Power of Corruption, that they are not able to love Saints, or any one else, with truly <hi>Christian</hi> Love. Agreable to what Mr. <hi>Stod</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> says in his <hi>Three Sermons</hi> (P. 40.)
<q>Men are obliged to love their Neighbours as themselves. But no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men do in any Measure live up to that Rule; but Men are great Enemies one to another, <hi>hateful</hi> and <hi>hating one another.</hi> They do but little <hi>Good</hi> one to another: They do a great Deal of <hi>Hurt</hi> one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
Now is it reasonable to suppose, that such Men have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Qualifications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by divine Institution, for a lawful Right to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the visible Family of God?</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s third Answer, and the Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is built upon, it has already been taken Notice of.</p>
                  <p>In Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Reply to my Answer to the <hi>first Objection</hi> (P. 81, &amp;c.) He wholly leaves the Argument, and writes in Support and Defence of other Matters, quite different from those which I mention'd, or had any Concern with. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which I mention'd, and which had been much insisted on by some against my Opinion, was, That Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are called <hi>Disciples,</hi> or Scholars; a Name, that gives us a Notion of the visible Church as a School; and leads us to suppose, that all who profess that Sort of Faith &amp; Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which implies a Disposition to seek Christian Learning and spiritual Attainments, are qualified for Admission. But Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says nothing at all in Support of this Objection. In Answer to it, I endeavour'd to shew, that the Name <hi>Disciples</hi> given to Church-Members, does not argue that unsanctified Persons are fit to be Members. He says nothing to shew, that it <hi>does.</hi> He says, if it won't follow from Christ's visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church's being represented as Christ's School, that 'tis in Order to <hi>all</hi> good Attainments; <hi>yet 'tis in Order to all that they have not yet attained.</hi> Which is nothing to the Purpose, but foreign to the Thing in Debate, viz. <hi>Whether sanctifying Grace <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of those Things which are not yet attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those that are lawfully in the Church.</hi> He there says nothing to prove, that it is; and especially to prove it from the Meaning of the Word, Disciples; which was the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Hand. He insists, that Men may be sufficiently subject to Christ as their Master and Teacher, in Order to be in his School or Church, without Grace: But then the Thing to be proved, was, That Church-Members being called <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="unknown:006839_0111_102A66F856103D38"/>
makes this evident, in Order to support the Argument or Objection I was upon: Which Argument is intirely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected throughout all his Discourse under this Head.</p>
                  <p>So in his Reply to my Answer to the 11<hi>th</hi> Objection (P. 123, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) he wholly neglects the Argument, and labours to support a different one. I endeavoured, without concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self about the Words of any Argument in Mr. <hi>Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi>'s Appeal, to answer an Argument abundantly used at <hi>Northampton</hi> against my Doctrine, of unsanctified Men's not having a Right to come to the Lord's Supper; which was this,
<q>You may as well say, that unsanctified Men mayn't attend any <hi>other</hi> Duty of Worship:</q>
and particularly,
<q>You may as well forbid 'em to <hi>pray.</hi>—</q>
As for Mr. <hi>S—d</hi>'s Objection, in these Words,
<q>If unsanctified Men may attend all other Ordinances or Duties of Worship, then they may lawfully attend the Lords Supper; it was an Argument I was not obliged to attend to in the Words in which <hi>He</hi> delivered it, because it was not an Argument bro't against <hi>my</hi> Scheme of Things, but one very diverse:</q>
Sense 'tis not my Opinion, that unsanctified Men may attend <hi>all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, or Duties of Worship, besides the Lord's Supper</hi>; for I don't suppose, such may offer themselves to <hi>Baptism</hi>; which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> takes for granted, in his Argument. And therefore what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says in Support of it, is quite beside the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. As to the Argument I was concern'd with, taken especially from the Lawfulness of unsanctified Men's <hi>Praying,</hi> to prove, that therefore it must be lawful for 'em to come to the Lord's Supper, certainly if there be any Consequence in it, the Consequence depends on the Truth of this Supposition, <hi>That the same Thing which makes it lawful for a Man to</hi> pray, <hi>also makes it lawful for him to come to the Lord's Supper.</hi> And seeing this Position is proved to be not true, the Argument falls to the Ground. And Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s nice Observations and Distinctions, of a <hi>Non Obstante,</hi> and a <hi>simply</hi> &amp; <hi>per se,</hi> are nothing to the Purpose.</p>
                  <p>This good Reason (with several others) may be given, why the same that makes it lawful for a Man to pray and hear the Word, won't make it lawful for him to partake of Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sacraments are not only Duties, but <hi>Covenant-Privileges,</hi> and are never lawfully given
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:006839_0112_102A66FA92E20BA0"/>
or received but under <hi>that Notion.</hi> Whereas, it is not so with Prayer and hearing the Word: And therefore they who have no Interest in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and are in no Respect God's <hi>Covenant-People,</hi> may lawfully hear the Word and pray. But it is agreed on all Hands, that they who are not in some Respect God's <hi>Covenant-People,</hi> may not come to Sacraments: And the Reason is this, because Sacraments are <hi>Covenant-Privileges.</hi> And this same Reason will prove, that none but <hi>true Believers,</hi> or those that have saving Faith, the only Condition of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> have a Right to Sacraments. For, as was observed before, the Condition of any Covenant is the Condition of all the Benefits or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of that Covenant. (See PART II. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.)</p>

The <hi>fourth</hi> Thing observed in Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Method of managing the Controversy, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly considered, <hi>viz.</hi> His advancing <hi>new and extraordinary Notions,</hi> not only manifestly contrary to <hi>Truth,</hi> but also to the <hi>common</hi> &amp; <hi>received Principles</hi> of the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church.</head>
                  <p>THUS it is with Regard to many Things which have already been taken Notice of. As, that Men may be ungodly Men, and yet truly profess to love God more than the World: That Men may be Professors of Religion and have no true Grace, and yet not be Luke-warm, but serve God as their only Master: That such may profess to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Christ with all their Hearts, and to give up all their Hearts and Lives to Christ, and speak true, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall now take Notice of another remarkable Instance of this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Reply to my Argument from the Epithets and Characters given by the Apostles to the Members of visible Christian Churches, in their Epistles,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:006839_0113_102A66FC423CEFE0"/>
represents (P. 56. <hi>d.</hi>) That there
<q>is no <hi>Difference in all the Epithets and Characters, which I had heap'd up from the New-Testament,</hi>
                     </q>
from those that are given in the Old-Testament, to the whole Body of the <hi>Jewish Church</hi>; which he elsewhere abundantly supposes to be the whole Body of the <hi>Jewish Nation</hi>; yea, even in their <hi>worst</hi> Times, 'till the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was rejected and cast off by God from being any longer his People: as I shall have Occasion particularly to observe afterwards.</p>
                  <p>That it may be the easier judged, how manifestly this is contrary to Truth, I shall here repeat some of those <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> I before mention'd, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has Reference to. This is very manifest concerning most of them: but that I mayn't be tedious, I will now rehearse but a few Instances, <hi>viz.</hi> Being <hi>made free from Sin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Servants of Righteousness:</hi> Having <hi>the Spirit of Adoption:</hi> Being <hi>the Children of God, Heirs of God, Joint-Heirs with Christ:</hi> Being <hi>Vessels of Mercy, prepared unto Glory:</hi> Being such <hi>as don't live to themselves, nor die to themselves; but live to the Lord, and die unto the Lord</hi>; and who <hi>living and dying are the Lord's:</hi> Being those that have <hi>all Things for theirs, whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the World or Life, or Death, or Things present, or Things to come; because they are Christ's:</hi> Being <hi>begotten through the Gospel:</hi> Being such as <hi>shall judge the World:</hi> Being <hi>washed, sanctified, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God:</hi> Being <hi>manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ, written not with Ink, but by the Spirit of the living God; not in Tables of Stone, but in fleshly Tables of the Heart:</hi> Being such as <hi>behold as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord, and are changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory:</hi> Being <hi>chosen in Christ before the Foundation of the World, that they should be holy and without Blame before him in Love</hi>; and <hi>predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated unto the Adoption of Children:</hi> Being <hi>sealed by that holy Spirit of Promise:</hi> Being <hi>quicken'd,</hi> tho' once <hi>dead in Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and Sins:</hi> Being <hi>made meet to be Partakers of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Saints in Light:</hi> Being <hi>dead, and having their Life hid with Christ in God</hi>; and being those that <hi>when Christ who is our Life shall appear, shall also appear with him in Glory; Having put off the old Man with his Deeds, and having put on
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:006839_0114_102A6700647FB448"/>
the new Man, which is renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of him that created him</hi>; Being <hi>begotten again to a living Hope — to an Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for 'em; who are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation; who love Christ, tho' they have not seen him; in whom, tho' now they see him not, yet believing, they rejoyce with Joy unspeakable &amp; full of Glory; having purified their Souls in obeying the Truth thro' the Spirit; Knowing him that is from the Beginning; having their Sins forgiven; having overcome the wicked one; having an Unction from the holy one, by which they know all Things; who are now the Sons of God; and who, when Christ shall appear, shall be like him, because they shall see him as he is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let the Christian Reader judge, with what Face of Reason our Author could represent as tho' there were No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all these Epithets and Characters, more than used of Old to be given to the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that even in Times of their greatest Corruption &amp; Apostacy, 'till the Nation was rejected of God! One would think, there is no Need of arguing the Matter with any that have read the Bible.</p>
                  <p>This Representation of Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s is not only very contrary to Truth, but also to the common Sentiments of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> Tho' I pretend not to be a Person of great Reading, yet I have read enough to warrant this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I never yet (as I remember) met with any Author that went the same Length in this Matter with Mr. <hi>W.</hi> but only Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> the Author that lately has been so famous for his corrupt Doctrine. In his Piece which he calls <hi>A Key to the Apostolic Writings,</hi> where he delivers his Scheme of Religion (which seems scarcely so agreable to the Christian Scheme, as the Doctrine of many of the wiser <hi>Heathen</hi>) he delivers the same Opinion, and insists largely upon it; it being a main Thing he makes Use of to establish his whole Scheme. And it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in the Manner of his delivering it, that he is sensible it is exceeding far from what has hitherto been the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received Sentiment in the Christian World. He supposes that as all those Epithets &amp; Characters belong to the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> eyen in their most corrupt Times, so
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:006839_0115_102A67045649DF20"/>
they belong to all <hi>Christendom,</hi> even the most vicious Parts of it; that the most vicious Men, who are baptized, and profess to believe Jesus to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> are <hi>chosen before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World, Predestinated according to the Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, Regenerated, Justified, Sanctified, Children of God, Heirs of God, Joint-Heirs with Christ, the Spouse of Christ, the Temple of God, made to sit together in heavenly Places in Christ, being the Family of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. And certainly he may with as good Reason, and with the same Reason, suppose this of all <hi>Christendom,</hi> even the most vicious Parts of it, as of the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> however corrupt, 'till there was a national Rejection of them.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, 'tis manifest there is no other Way of evading the Force of the Argument from the Epistles, but by falling into <hi>Taylor's</hi> Scheme. If his Scheme of Religion ben't true, then it is plain as any Fact in the New Testament, that all the Christian Churches, thro' the whole Earth, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Days, were constituted in the Manner that I insist on. The Scripture says ten Times as much to demonstrate this Matter, as it does about the Manner of Discipline, Officers, and Government of the Church, or as it does about the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts of the publick Worship, or about the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Christian Sabbath.</p>

                  <head>SECTION V. Instances of the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>sixth</hi> Particulars, in Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Method of disputing, <hi>viz.</hi> his using confident &amp; peremptory <hi>Assertions,</hi> and great <hi>Exclamations,</hi> instead of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</head>
                  <p>WE have an Instance of the <hi>former,</hi> in his Reply to my Answer to the 14th Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>'tis not unlawful for unsanctified Men to carry themselves like Saints.</hi> I objected against this, if thereby be meant, that they may lawfully carry themselves externally like Saints in all Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, remaining ungodly; and mention'd some Things
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:006839_0116_102A6705DD820038"/>
which belonged to the external Duty of godly Men, which no ungodly Man, remaining such, may do. To which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> makes no Reply; but to prove the Point says,
<q>Mr. <hi>St—d</hi> knew, and all Divines know, That the external Carriage of some unsanctified Men <hi>is</hi> to the outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and the publick Judgment of the Church, the same with the Carriage of the Saints; and they know they are <hi>bound</hi> to such a Behaviour.</q>
And this peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory confident Assertion is all the Argument he brings to prove the Thing asserted.</p>
                  <p>Again, I observe, that sometimes Mr. <hi>W.</hi> uses <hi>great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,</hi> as tho' he intended to alarm, and excite Terror in his Readers, and raise their Indignation: Tho' they are perhaps never like to know <hi>for what.</hi> We have two very remarkable Instances of this, (P. 136, &amp; 137.) where he says,
<q>I shall further take Notice of two <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>surprizing</hi> Passages, if I understand them. And I have with great Diligence tried to find out the Meaning of them. One is P. 129. between the 17th and 23d Lines; if it be rightly printed.</q>
He don't quote my Words: This mighty Exclamation would have become too flat, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ridiculous, if he had. The Passage refer'd to is in these Words—
<q>Indeed such a Tendency (i. e. a Tendency to Irreligion and Profaneness) it would have, to shut Men out from having any Part in the Lord, in the Sense of the two Tribes and Half, <hi>Josh.</hi> xxii.25. or to fence 'em out by such a Partition-Wall, as formerly was between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and so to shut 'em out as to tell 'em, if they were never so much disposed to serve God, he was not ready to accept 'em: According to the Notion the <hi>Jews</hi> seem to have had of the uncircumcised <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                     </q>
That is, plainly, to shut 'em out so as to tell 'em, that let 'em have Hearts never so well and piously disposed to love and serve God, their Love and Service could not be accepted. This doubtless would have a Tendency to discourage Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in Men. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>The other extraordinary Passage he stands thunderstruck with, is in these Words;
<q>May it not be suspected, that this Way of baptizing Children of such as never make any proper Profession of Godliness, is an Expedient ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally invented for that very End, to give Ease to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors with Respect to their Posterity, in Times of great Declension and Degeneracy?</q>
Mr. <hi>W.</hi> knows, that thro' the whole of my Book I suppose, this Practice of baptizing the Children of such as are here spoken of, is <hi>wrong</hi>; and so does <hi>He</hi> too; for he abundantly allows, that Persons in Order to be admitted to the Privileges of visible Saints, must make a Profession of real Piety, or Gospel-Holiness.—And if it be wrong, as we are both agreed, then surely 'tis nothing akin to Blasphemy, to suspect that it arose from some bad Cause.</p>

               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>SECTION VI. Instances of the <hi>seventh</hi> Particular observed in Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Way of disputing, <hi>viz.</hi> His wholly <hi>overlooking</hi> Arguments, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no Argument, nothing to answer; when the Case is far otherwise.</head>
                  <p>THUS in his Reply to my tenth Argument, which was this,
<q>It is necessary, that those who partake of the Lord's Supper, should judge themselves truly and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to accept of Christ as their Saviour, and chief Good; for this is what the Actions, which Communicants per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form at the Lord's Table, are a solemn Profession of.</q>
I largely endeavoured (in P. 75, 76, &amp; 77.) to prove this, from the Nature of those significant Actions, of receiving the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of Christ's Body and Blood when offered, representing their accepting the Thing signified, as their spiritual Food<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To all which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says (P. 74. <hi>a.</hi>)
<q>I don't find that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has said any Thing to prove the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, which is the whole Argument offered here in
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:006839_0118_102A670CF8BFF058"/>
Proof of the Point proposed to be proved, but only gives his Opinion, or Paraphrase of the Purport and Nature of the Sacramental Actions.</q>
— Since Mr. <hi>W.</hi> esteems it no Argument, I desire it may be considered impartially whether there be any Argument in it or no.</p>
                  <p>These Sacramental Actions all allow to be <hi>significant</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: They are a Signification &amp; Profession of something: They are not Actions without a Meaning. And all allow, that these external Actions signify something <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>spiritual.</hi> And if they signify any Thing spiritual, they doubtless signify those spiritual Things which they <hi>represent.</hi> But what <hi>inward</hi> Thing does the outward Taking or Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body and Blood of Christ represent, but the <hi>inward</hi> accepting Christ's Body and Blood, or an accepting him in the Heart? And what <hi>spiritual</hi> Thing is the outward Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Christ in this Ordinance a Sign of, but a <hi>spiritual</hi> Feeding on Christ, or the Soul's Feeding on Him? Now there is no other Way of the Soul's feeding on him, but by that <hi>Faith,</hi> by which Christ becomes our spiritual Food, and the Refreshment and vital Nourishment of our Souls. The <hi>outward eating and drinking</hi> in this Ordinance is a Sign of <hi>spiritual eating and drinking,</hi> as much as the <hi>outward Bread</hi> in this Ordinance is a Sign of <hi>spiritual Bread</hi>; or as much as the <hi>outward Drink</hi> is a Sign of <hi>spiritual Drink.</hi> And doubtless those Actions, if they are a Profession of any Thing at all, are a Profession of the Things they signify. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> owns, that the Sacramental Actions, both in Baptism and the Lord's Supper, signify <hi>saving Faith</hi> in Christ. <hi>Safety of App.</hi> P. 120.
<q>By Baptism is signified <hi>our Fellowship with Christ</hi> in his Sufferings. That is signified hereby, that we have an Interest in the Vertue of his Sufferings, that his Sufferings are made over unto us, and that we do participate in the Good and Benefit of them.— It was <hi>John the Baptist's</hi> Manner, before he baptized Persons, to teach them that they must <hi>believe on Christ.</hi> And the Apostles, and Apostolical Men would not baptize any Adult Persons but such as professed to <hi>believe on Christ.— He that believeth &amp; is baptized, shall be saved.</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is mention'd as the Evidence of Faith.</q>
—So concerning the Lord's Supper, <hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 122 <hi>c.</hi> 123. <hi>a.</hi>
                        <q>In this Ordinance we are invited to put our <hi>Trust</hi> in the Death of Christ. <hi>Take eat; this is my Body: and drink ye all of it.</hi> When the Body feeds on the Sacramental Bread and Wine, the <hi>Soul</hi> is to do that <hi>which answers unto it</hi>; The Soul is to <hi>feed</hi> on Christ crucified; which is Nothing else but the acting <hi>Faith</hi> on him.</q>

                     <pb n="114" facs="unknown:006839_0119_102A670FB86FE428"/>
To say, that these significant Actions are appointed to be a <hi>Profession</hi> of something, but not to be a Profession of the <hi>Things</hi> they are appointed to <hi>signify,</hi> is as unreasonable as to say, that certain Sounds or Words are appointed to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of something, but not to be a Profession of the Things signified by those Words.</p>
                  <p>Again, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Reply to my Answer to the <hi>second Objection,</hi> with like Contempt passes over the main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I offered, to prove that the Nation of <hi>Israel</hi> were called <hi>God's People,</hi> and <hi>Covenant-People,</hi> in another Sense besides a being visible Saints. My Argument (in P. 85, 86.) was this: That 'tis manifest, that something diverse from being visible Saints, is often intended by that Nation's being call'd <hi>God's People,</hi> and that That Nation, the Family of <hi>Israel according to the Flesh,</hi> and not with Regard to any moral and religious Qualifications, were in some Sense adopted by God, to be his peculiar and Covenant-People; from Rom. ix.3, 4, 5.— <hi>I could wish my self accursed from Christ for my Brethren according to the Flesh; who are</hi> Israelites; <hi>to whom pertaineth the Adoption, and the Glory, and the COVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANTS, and the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the Promises; whose are the Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. I observed, that these Privileges here mentioned, are spoken of as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Jews,</hi> not now as visible Saints, not as Professors of the true Religion, not as Members of the visible Church of Christ (which they did not belong to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only as a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of such a Nation, such a Blood, such an external carnal Relation to the Patriarchs, their Ancestors; <hi>Israelites, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Flesh</hi>: Inasmuch as the Apostle is speaking here of the <hi>unbelieving Jews,</hi> professed Unbelievers, that were out of the Christian Church, and open visible Enemies to it; and such as had no Right at all to the external Privileges of Christ's People.—I observed further, that in like Manner this Apostle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Rom.</hi> xi.28, 29. speaks of the same <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews,</hi> that were Enemies to the Gospel, as in some Respect an Elect People, and interested in the Calling, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and Covenants, God formerly gave their Fore-fathers, and are still beloved for their sakes. <hi>As concerning the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, they are Enemies for your sakes: But as touching the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, they are beloved for the Fathers sakes. For the Gifts and Calling of God are without Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="unknown:006839_0120_102A67127AE531B8"/>All that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, which has any Reference to these Things, is,
<q>That he had read my Explication of the Name of <hi>the People of God,</hi> as given to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp;c. But that he confesses, it is perfectly unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible to him.</q>
The impartial Reader is left to judge, whether the Matter did not require some other Answer.</p>

               <div n="7" type="section">
                  <head>SECTION VII. What is, and what is not <hi>begging the Question</hi>; And how Mr. <hi>W.</hi> charges me, from Time to Time, with begging the Question, without Cause.</head>
                  <p>AMong the Particulars of Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Method of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, I observed, that <hi>he often causlessly charges me with begging the Question, while he frequently begs the Question himself, or does that which is equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that it may be determined with Justice and Clearness, who does, and who does not beg the Question, I desire it may be particularly considered, what that is which is called <hi>Begging the Question</hi> in a Dispute.— This is more especially needful for the Sake of illiterate Readers. And here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let it be observed, that meerly to suppose some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in a Dispute, without bringing any Argument to prove it, is not begging the Question: for this is done ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, in every Dispute, and even in the best and clearest Demonstrations. One Point is proved by another, 'till at Length the Matter is reduced to a Point that is supposed to need no Proof; either because it is self-evident, or is a Thing wherein both Parties are agreed, or so clear that 'tis suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it won't be denied.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is begging the Question the same Thing as offering a weak Argument, to prove the Point in Question. 'Tis not all weak Arguing, but one <hi>particular Way</hi> of weak Arguing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is called <hi>begging the Question.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="116" facs="unknown:006839_0121_102A67144BA41270"/>3. Nor is it the same Thing as <hi>missing the true Question,</hi> and bringing an Argument that is impertinent, or <hi>beside the Question.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Thing which is called <hi>begging the Question,</hi> is the making use of the very Point, that is the Thing in Debate, or the Thing to be proved, as an Argument to prove itself. Thus, if I were endeavouring to prove that none but godly Persons might come to Sacraments, and should take this for an Argument to prove it, That none might come but such as have saving Faith, taking this for granted; I should then beg the Question: for this is the very Point in Question, whether a Man must have saving Faith or no? 'Tis called begging the Question, because 'tis a depending as it were on the Courtesy of the other Side, to grant me the Point in Question, without offering any Argument as the Price of it.</p>
                  <p>And whether the Point I thus take for granted, be the main Point in Question, in the general Dispute, or some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Point, something under Consideration, under a particular Argument; yet if I take this particular Point for granted, and then make use of it to prove it self, 'tis begging the Question.</p>
                  <p>Thus if I were endeavouring, under this <hi>general Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy</hi> between Mr. <hi>W.</hi> &amp; Me, to prove that <hi>particular Point,</hi> That we ought to love all the Members of the Church as <hi>true Saints</hi>; and should bring this as a Proof of the Point, That we ought to love all the Members of the Church as <hi>true Christians,</hi> taking this for granted; this is only the same Thing, under another Term, as the Thing to be proved; and therefore is no Argument at all, but only begging the Question.</p>
                  <p>Or if the Point I thus take for granted, and make use of as an Argument, be neither the general Point in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy, nor yet the Thing nextly to be proved under a particular Argument; yet if it be some known controverted Point between the Parties, 'tis begging the Question, or equivalent to it: for 'tis begging a Thing known to be in Question in the Dispute, and using it as if it were a Thing allowed.</p>
                  <p>I would now consider the Instances, wherein Mr. <hi>W.</hi> asserts or suggests that I have begg'd the Question.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="unknown:006839_0122_102A6715D82D58A8"/>In P. 30. <hi>d, e.</hi> &amp; 31. <hi>a, b.</hi> he represents the Force of my Reasoning as built on a Supposition, That there is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Man, but what knows he has no Desire of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ, no Design to fulfil the Covenant of Grace, but designs to live in Stealing, Lying, Adultery,—or some other known Sin: And then says,
<q>Is it not manifest, that such Sort of Reasoning is a meer quibbling with Words, and begging the Question?</q>
And so insinuates, that I have thus begged the Question. Whereas, I no where say or suppose this which he speaks of, nor any Thing like it. But on the contrary, often say, what supposes an unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Man may <hi>think</hi> he is truly godly, and that he has truly upright and gracious Designs and Desires.—Nor does any Argument of mine depend on any such Supposition. Nay, under the Argument he speaks of, I expresly suppose the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That unsanctified Men who visibly enter into Covenant, may be deceived.</p>
                  <p>In P. 38. <hi>a.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> makes a certain Representation of my Arguing from <hi>Isai.</hi> lvi. And then says upon it,
<q>It is no Arguing, but only begging the Question.</q>
But as has been already shown, that which he represents as my Argument from that Scripture, has no Relation to my Argument.</p>
                  <p>In P. 59. in Opposition to my arguing from the Epistles, that the Apostles treated those Members of Churches which they wrote to, as those who had been received on a positive Judgment, <hi>i. e.</hi> (as I explain my self) a proper and affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Opinion; that they were real Saints; Mr. <hi>W.</hi> argues, that the Apostles could make no such Judgment of them, without either personal Converse, or Revelation; unless it be supposed to be founded on a Presumption, that Ministers who baptized them, would not have done it, unless they had themselves made such a positive Judgment concerning their State: And then adds these Words, <hi>This may do for this Scheme, but only 'tis a begging the Question</hi> Whereas, it is a Point that never has been in Question in this Controversy, as ever I knew, Whether <hi>some Ministers or Churches</hi> might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably, and affirmatively suppose, the Members of <hi>other Churches,</hi> they are united with, were admitted on Evidence of proper Qualifications, (whatever they be, whether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or saving) trusting to the Faithfulness of other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:006839_0123_102A671AB38387D0"/>
and Churches. Besides, this can be no Point in Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Me and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> unless it be a Point in Question between him &amp; himself. For he holds, as well as I, Persons ought not to be received as visible Christians, without <hi>moral Evidence</hi> (which is something positive, and not a meer Negation of Evidence of the contrary) of <hi>Gospel-Holiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In P. 82. of my Book I suppose, that none at all do truly subject themselves to Christ as their Master, but those who graciously subject themselves to him, and are delivered from the reigning Power of Sin. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> suggests, (P. 83. <hi>d.</hi>) that herein I beg the Question. For which there is no Pretext, not only as this is no known Point in Controversy between the Parties in this Debate; but also as 'tis a Point I don't take for granted, but offer this Argument to prove it, That they who have no Grace, <hi>are under the reigning Power of Sin,</hi> and no Man can truly subject himself to two such contrary Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, at the same Time, as Christ, and Sin. I think this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sufficient to obtain the Point, without begging it. And besides, this Doctrine, That they who have no Grace don't truly subject themselves to Christ, was no Point in Question between Me &amp; Mr. <hi>W.</hi> But a Point wherein we were fully agreed, and wherein he had before express'd himself as fully, and more fully than I. In his Sermons on <hi>Christ a King and Witness,</hi> (P. 18. <hi>b.</hi>) he speaks of <hi>all such as don't depend on Christ, believe in him, and give up themselves and all to him, as not true Subjects to Christ</hi>; but <hi>Enemies to him, and his Kingdom.</hi> We have Expressions to the same Purpose again, in P. 74. &amp; 91. and in P. 94. <hi>d, e.</hi> of the same Book, He says,
<q>It is utterly inconsistent with the Nature of the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Gospel, that it should be a <hi>forced Subjection.</hi> —No Man is a <hi>Subject</hi> of Christ, who does not make the Laws and Will of Christ his Choice, and desire to be governed by him, and to live in Subjection to the Will of Christ, as <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>fit,</hi> and <hi>best</hi> to be the Rule of his Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>his Happiness.</hi> A forced Obedience to Christ is <hi>no Obedience.</hi> 'Tis <hi>in Terms a Contradiction.</hi> Christ draws Men with the Cords of <hi>Love,</hi> and the Bands of a Man. Our Lord has himself expresly determined this Point.</q>
There are other Passages in the same Book, to the same Purpose. So that I had no Need to beg this
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:006839_0124_102A671C36DA0DA0"/>
Point of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> since he had given it largely, and that in full Measure, and over and over again, without Begging.</p>
                  <p>In P. 120. <hi>b.</hi> He observes,
<q>That to say, such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of internal invisible Things is the Rule to direct the Church in Admission,—is to hide the Parallel, and beg the Question. For the Question here is about the Person's Right to come, and not about the Church's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them.</q>
Here Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would make us believe, that he don't know what begging the Question is: For 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, his Meaning is, that my saying so is <hi>beside the Question.</hi> But to say something beside the Question, is a different Thing from begging the Question, as has been observed. My say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>a Profession of invisible Things</hi> is the Church's Rule in Admission, is not begging the Question: Because it is not, nor ever was any Thing in Question. For Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself are full in it, that a Profession of <hi>invisible Things,</hi> such as a believing that Christ is the Son of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the Church's Rule. Yea, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is express in it, that a credible Profession and Visibility of <hi>Gospel-Holiness</hi> is the Church's Rule. P. 139. Nor is my saying as above, <hi>beside the Question then in Hand,</hi> relating to the Church of <hi>Israel</hi>'s admitting to the Priesthood, those that could not find their Register. For that wholly relates to the Rule of <hi>Admission</hi> to the Priesthood, and not to the Priests <hi>Assurance of their own Right.</hi> For, as I observed, if the Priests had been never so fully assured of their Pedigree, yet if they could not demonstrate it to others, by a publick Register, it would not have avail'd for their Admission.</p>
                  <p>Again, in P. 124. <hi>e.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> charges me with begging the Question, in supposing that Sacraments are Duties of Worship, whose very Nature and Design is an Exhibition of those vital and active Principles and inward Exercises, wherein consists the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. He charges the same Thing as a begging the Question, P. 131. <hi>d.</hi>—But this is no begging the Question, for two Reasons; (1.) Because I had before proved this Point, by Proofs which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has not seen Cause to attempt to answer, as has been just now observed, in the last Section. (2.) This, when I wrote, was no Point in Question, wherein Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; but wherein we were agreed, and in which he had
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:006839_0125_102A6720D977C680"/>
declared himself as fully as I, in his Sermons on <hi>Christ a King and Witness</hi>; P. 76. <hi>c.</hi>
                     <q>When we attend Sacraments (says he) we are therein visibly to profess our receiving Christ, and the Graces of his Spirit, and the Benefits of his Redemption, on his own Terms &amp; Offer, and giving up the All of our Souls to him, on his Call, Covenant, and Engagement.</q>
And in the next preceding Page but one, in a Place forecited, He speaks of these Acts "as <hi>Mockery, Hypocrisy, Falshood and Lies, if they are not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Faith and Hope, and spiritual Acts of Obedience.</hi> So that I had no Manner of Need to come to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> as a Beggar for these Things, which he had so plentifully given me, and all the World that would accept them, Years before.</p>

                  <head>SECTION VIII. Shewing how <hi>Mr.</hi> W. often <hi>begs the Question</hi> Himself.</head>
                  <p>THE Question is certainly begg'd in that Argument, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> espouses and defends, viz. <hi>That the Lord's Supper has a proper Tendency to promote Men's Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> In the Prosecution of the Argument Mr. <hi>W.</hi> implicitly yields, that it is not the apparent natural Tendency alone, that is of any Force to prove the Point; but the apparent Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency under this Circumstance, <hi>That there is no express Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition.</hi> And thus 'tis allowed, that in the Case of express Prohibition with Respect to the scandalous and morally In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere, no seeming Tendency in the Nature of the Thing proves the Ordinance to be intended for the Conviction and Conversion of such. So that 'tis a Thing <hi>supposed</hi> in this Argument, that all morally insincere Persons are expresly forbidden, but unsanctified Persons not so. Now when it is supposed, that morally insincere Persons are expresly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the Thing meant can't be, that they are forbidden in those very Words; for no such Prohibition is to be found: nor are Men that live in Sodomy, Bestiality, and Witchcraft, any where expresly forbidden in this Sense. But the Thing intended must be, that they are very evidently forbidden,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:006839_0126_102A67236E5603C8"/>
by plain Implication, or Consequence. But then the whole Weight of the Argument lies in this <hi>Supposition,</hi> That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Persons are not also plainly and evidently forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; which is the very Point in Question. And therefore to make this the Ground of an Argument to prove this Point, is a manifest <hi>begging the Question.</hi> And what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says to the contrary (P. 127. <hi>a.</hi>) That Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> had proved this Point before, avails Nothing: For let it be never so much proved before, yet, after all, to take this very Point and make use of it <hi>as a further Argument</hi> to prove it self, is certainly <hi>begging the Question.</hi> The Notion of bringing a new Argument is bringing additional Proof: But to take a certain Point, supposed to be already proved, to prove it self with over again, certainly don't add any Thing to the Evidence.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, my supposing <hi>unconverted</hi> Persons, as such, to be as evidently forbidden, as <hi>scandalous</hi> Persons, is as much begging the Question. I answer, So it would be, if I made that Point an Argument to prove it self with, after Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Manner. But this is far from being the Case in Fact.</p>
                  <p>And the Question is again most certainly begged, in that other Thing said to support this Argument, viz. <hi>That tho' the Lord's Supper may seem to have a Tendency to convert scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Sinners, yet there is another Ordinance appointed for that.</hi> Here the Meaning must be, that there is another Ordinance <hi>exclusive</hi> of the Lord's Supper; otherwise 'tis nothing to the Purpose. For they don't deny but that there are other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances for the Conversion of Sinners, who are morally sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, as well as of those who are scandalous. But the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Whether other Ordinances are appointed for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version <hi>exclusive</hi> of the Lord's Supper; or, Whether the Lord's Supper be one Ordinance appointed for their Conversion? This is the grand Point <hi>in Question.</hi> And to take this Point as the Foundation of an Argument, to prove this same Point, is plain begging the Question. And 'tis also giving up the Argument from the Tendency, and resting the whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on another Thing.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> again plainly begs the Question in his Reply (P. 127. <hi>c. d.</hi>) That God's Prohibition is an Argument, that God saw there was no such Tendency for their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:006839_0127_102A67265B1C8570"/>
His so saying supposes again, that there is no evident Prohibition of unsanctified Persons. In which he again flies to the very Point in Question, and rests the Weight of his Reasoning upon it.</p>
                  <p>Just in the same Manner, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> begs the Question in espousing and making use of that Argument, <hi>That all in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Covenant, &amp; neither ignorant nor scandalous, are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perform all external Covenant-Duties.</hi> Here 'tis supposed, that scandalous Persons (which, according to Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Scheme, must include all that have not moral Sincerity) tho' in the external Covenant, are expresly, that is, <hi>evidently, excepted and forbidden</hi>: and that unsanctified Men are not also <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently forbidden</hi>; Which is the Point in Question. For if unsanctified Men, tho' in external Covenant, are as evidently forbidden and excepted, as scandalous Men that are in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant, then the Argument touches not one any more than the other. So that the Argument is entirely a Castle in the Air, resting on nothing but it self: The grand Thing to be proved, first taken for granted, and then made an Argument to prove it self!</p>
                  <p>In explaining the Nature of <hi>begging the Question,</hi> I observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that 'tis begging the Question, or equivalent to it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Point that is taken for granted, and made an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of, be the main Point in Controversy, or some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular known disputed Point between the controverting Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: I will now illustrate this by an Example. 'Tis a known disputed Point in this Controversy, whether in the Parable concerning the <hi>Man without the wedding Garment,</hi> the King condemned the Man for coming into the Church without <hi>Grace.</hi> Now supposing that I, because I look on the Matter very clear, should, besides using it as one distinct Argument, also make it the Basis of other Arguments; and should use it in Opposition to the strongest Arguments of my Opposers, as if it were sufficient to stop their Mouths, without offering any proper Solution of those Arguments: As, in Case I were press'd with the Argument from the Passover, if I should fly to <hi>the Man without the wedding Garment</hi>; and should say, 'Tis certain, this Argument from the Passover can be of no Force against the express Word of God in the xxii. of <hi>Matth.</hi> For there <hi>'tis plain as any Fact that ever the Sun shone upon,</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="unknown:006839_0128_102A6729683165F0"/>
that the King condemns the Man for coming into the Church <hi>without a Wedding-Garment</hi>; and 'tis plain as the Sun at Noon-Day, that the Wedding-Garment is <hi>Grace.</hi> — And if when the Argument from <hi>Judas</hi>'s partaking of the Lord's Supper is alledg'd, I should again fly to <hi>the Man without a Wedding-Garment,</hi> and say, whatever Reasons Christ might have for admitting <hi>Judas,</hi> yet 'tis plainly reveal'd, in <hi>Matth.</hi> xxii.12. that God don't approve of Men's coming into the Church without a <hi>Wedding-Garment.</hi> This would be a beggarly impertinent Way of disputing, thus to answer one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by throwing another in the Way, which is contested, and the Validity of which is denied. 'Tis fair, that I should have Liberty to use the Argument concerning <hi>the Wedding-Garment,</hi> in it's Place, and make the most of it: But to use it as the Support of other Arguments, is to produce no additional Proof. And thus, from Time to Time, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the disputed Hypothesis of one Argument, for Answer to the Arguments of my Antagonist, instead of solving those Arguments, is flying and hiding from Arguments, instead of answering them: instead of defending the Fortress which is attack'd, 'tis dodging and flying from one Refuge to another.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> acts this Part from Time to Time, in the use he makes of his great Argument from the <hi>Old Testament</hi> Church and it's Ordinances. Thus (in P. 8.) he takes this Method to answer my Argument from the Nature of Visibility and Profession, insisting that the <hi>Israelites</hi> Avouching and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting was a Thing compatible with <hi>Ungodliness</hi>; which he knows is a disputed Point in this Controversy, and what I deny.— Again, he makes Use of the same Thing, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to my Argument from the Nature of Covenanting with God. (P. 23, 24.—) And again he brings it in (P. 25. <hi>e.</hi> 26. <hi>a.</hi>) answering what I say, by confidently asserting that concerning the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> which he knows is disputed, &amp; I deny; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Covenanting of <hi>Israel</hi> did not imply a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession that they did already believe and repent: As in these Words,
<q>This was never intended nor understood, in the Profession which the <hi>Israelites</hi> made; But that they <hi>would</hi> immediately, and from thenceforth comply with the Terms of the Covenant; and by the Help of God, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:006839_0129_102A672B9A9F6E00"/>
in it, <hi>would</hi> fulfil it. <hi>I am sure,</hi> this was what they profess'd; and <hi>I am sure,</hi> God declared he took them into Covenant with him.</q>
— And the same Thing is brought in again to answer the same Argument. (P. 31. <hi>c.</hi>)— The same Thing is thrown in, once and again, as an Answer to what I say of the Unreasonableness of accepting such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions as leave Room to judge the greater Part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors to be Enemies of God. (P. 34. <hi>b, c.</hi>)— The same Thing is cast in as a sufficient Block in the Way of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from the Unreasonableness of accepting such Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as amount to nothing more than <hi>Luke-warmness.</hi> (P. 36. <hi>d, e.</hi>)— The same is brought in, and greatly insisted on, to stop my Mouth, in arguing from the Epistles. (P. 56, 57.)— The same is brought in again to enervate my Argument concerning <hi>brotherly Love.</hi> (P. 69 <hi>d.</hi>)— And this is made Use of as the Support of other Arguments; as that from the Name <hi>Disciples,</hi> &amp; about the Church's being the <hi>School of Christ</hi>; and to confute what I say, in Answer to that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (P. 84 <hi>a.</hi>)— The same is bro't in as a Support of the eleventh Objection, and a Confutation of my Answer to that. (P. 12 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>d, e.</hi>)— And again, in Reply to what I say in Answer to the nineteenth Objection. (P. 137. <hi>b, c.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Another Thing, near akin to begging the Question, is resting the Weight of Arguments on Things asserted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Proof; which, tho' they don't properly make a Part of the Controversy, yet are Things not allowed by those on the other Side.— Thus does Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Arguing from the Success of the Lord's Supper in the <hi>Conversion</hi> of Sinners (P. 137, 138.) Supposing, not only that the Lord's Supper has been the <hi>Occasion</hi> of the Conversion of many, but that their communicating was the <hi>Means</hi> of it. This he offers nothing to prove, and it is not allowed by those on the other Side.<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus that very eminent Divine, and successful Minister of Christ, the late Dr. <hi>Doddridge,</hi> in his <hi>Sermons on Regeneration,</hi> speaking of the Means of Regeneration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (P. 251. <hi>e.</hi> 252. <hi>a.</hi>) says,
<q>I do not mention the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Sacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon this Occasion; because, tho' they have so noble and effectual a Tendency to improve Men's Minds in Piety, and to promote Christian Edification; yet I do not remember to have heard <hi>of any Instance,</hi> in which they have been the <hi>Means</hi> of Men's <hi>Conversion</hi>; which is the less to be wonder'd at, as they are appointed for a very different End.</q>
                     </note> And it is what would be very hard to prove: If
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:006839_0130_102A672D808AFE08"/>
many were converted <hi>at</hi> the Lord's Table (which yet is not evident) it would not prove, that their <hi>Partaking</hi> was the Means of their Conversion; it might be only what they saw and heard there, which others may see and hear, that don't partake.</p>

                  <head>SECTION IX. Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Inconsistence with himself, in what he says in Answer to my <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> Arguments, and in his Reply to my Arguments from the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the <hi>Epistles.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>last</hi> Thing observed in Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting is his alledging &amp; insisting on Things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is inconsistent with himself.— His Inconsistencies are of many Sorts: Sometimes he alledges those Things that are inconsistent with the Doctrine of those whose Principles he pretends to maintain: He abundantly urges those Things against my Scheme, which are in like Manner against his own: He often argues against those Things which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and strenuously insists on: He denies what he affirms, and affirms what he utterly denies; laying down and urging those Things which are contrary to what he says in other Books; and sometimes contrary to what he says in the same Book: Yielding up the Thing wherein the Argument lies, yet strenuously maintaining the Argument; Allowing both Premises and Consequence, yet finding Fault, and opposing: Sometimes urging Things which are contrary to what he says under <hi>different</hi> Arguments; and sometimes contrary to what he says under the <hi>same</hi> Argument: Sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting himself in the plain Sense and Meaning of what he says; at other Times even in plain Terms: Sometimes in Effect contradicting himself in the same Breath, and in the same Sentence.</p>
                  <p>These various Kinds of Inconsistence have many of 'em been already observed: And will further appear by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Consideration of what he says on several Heads, in what remains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="unknown:006839_0131_102A673230429188"/>In my third Argument, I insisted, that it could not be much to God's Honour, for Men to profess the Assent of their Judgment to the true Religion, without pretending to any real Friendship or Love to God in their Hearts. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in Opposition, (P. 34. <hi>d, e.</hi>) speaks of it as an Honour to God, that secret Hypocrites openly declare their Conviction of the Truth of God's Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>in the Multitude of Subjects is the King's Honour.</hi> And yet he himself represents the Matter quite otherwise in his Sermons on CHRIST <hi>a King and Witness</hi>; there (in P. 87. <hi>a.</hi>) He has these Words,
<q>To promote the Kingdom of Christ, is not to do that which may prevail with Men to make Pretences that they are Christians, or that they own Jesus Christ as their Saviour, and to call him Lord, Lord, when really he is not so.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Answer to my fourth Argument (P. 35. <hi>d.</hi>) Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, I make <hi>a great Misrepresentation of the Matter, in insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating that according to Mr. S—d's Scheme</hi> (which Scheme he declares himself to be of) <hi>they who are admitted make a Pretence of NO MORE than moral Sincerity, and common Grace.</hi> And yet he insists, that when <hi>Philip</hi> required a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the <hi>Eunuch</hi>'s Faith, his Question <hi>designed NO MORE</hi> than an <hi>Assent of the Understanding</hi> (P. 51. <hi>a, b.</hi>) which he there distinguishes from saving Faith: And says, that 'tis morally certain that his Enquiry <hi>amounted to NO MORE.</hi> And yet in his Discourse on the same Head (P. 49. <hi>c.</hi>) he inveigh's agaist me for supposing it a Consequence of the Opinion of my Opposers, that the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> in Order to come to Sacraments, had no Manner of Need to look at any such Qualification in himself as saving Faith.— Certainly the <hi>Eunuch</hi> in making Answer to <hi>Philip's</hi> Enquiry, had no Need to look at <hi>any more</hi> than <hi>Philip</hi> enquired after. In P. 50. <hi>a.</hi> he says,
<q>It <hi>don't</hi> seem at all probable, that <hi>Philip</hi> ENQUIRED ANY THING about the Regeneration or Sanctification of the <hi>Eunuch.</hi>
                     </q>
And yet in the next preceding Sentence, he refers me over to another Judgment, for representing as tho' my Opposers supposed, that it was <hi>no Matter whether a Person coming to Gospel-Ordinances had any Grace or not, and had no Manner of Need to enquire any Thing about his Sincerity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="unknown:006839_0132_102A6735374FF538"/>And tho' he highly blames me for insinuating, as above, that my Opposers <hi>require a Pretence of</hi> NO MORE <hi>than common Grace and moral Sincerity</hi>; yet in Opposition to my insisting on a Profession of saving Faith, speaking of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession which the <hi>Apostles</hi> required, he says (P. 58. <hi>c.</hi>)
<q>'Tis certain, that a Profession in these Words, which was wont to be required, do sometimes import NO MORE than a Conviction of the Understanding on moral Evidence.</q>
So he says concerning those whose Admission into the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church we have an Account of in <hi>Acts</hi> ii. (P. 45. <hi>e.</hi>)
<q>There is not one Word said about ANY OTHER FAITH, but believing that <hi>Jesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                     </q>
And if so, then certainly NO MORE was profess'd.</p>
                  <p>In P. 35. <hi>e.</hi> He allows, that all visible Saints who are not truly pious, are <hi>Hypocrites</hi>; and yet maintains, that the Profession they make is no more than what they may make and speak HONESTLY &amp; TRULY. P. 105. <hi>d.</hi> &amp; 47. <hi>c.</hi> How then are they all Hypocrites, if they are <hi>honestly and truly</hi> what they profess to be?</p>
                  <p>In supporting the Argument from <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, that the Profession the People made, did <hi>not</hi> imply, that they <hi>had savingly repented:</hi> and that <hi>John</hi> openly supposed, that their Profession did <hi>not</hi> imply it, in what he said to 'em. (P. 97. <hi>a, b, c.</hi>)— And in P. 98. <hi>a, b.</hi> he says,
<q>We read not a Word of <hi>John</hi>'s enquiring whether these People made a credible Profession of true Piety.</q>
And he there manifestly suggests, that <hi>John</hi> knew they were not pious, as <hi>he knew they were a Generation of Vipers.</hi> Yet how often else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where does Mr. <hi>W.</hi> insist, that Men in Order to come to Sacraments <hi>must</hi> make a credible Profession of true Piety and Gospel-Holiness, and that they must in a Judgment of Charity be supposed to have real Godliness?</p>
                  <p>In answer to my Argument from the Instance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in <hi>Acts</hi> ii. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> speaking of their Convictions, and being <hi>pricked in their Heart,</hi> (P. 45. <hi>c, d, e.</hi>) says,
<q>They <hi>were convinced that Jesus was the true Messiah</hi> &amp; Saviour, whom God had promised to <hi>Israel,</hi> — whereupon convinced of their Sin, they cry out, <hi>What shall we do?</hi> To which the Apostle replies, <hi>Repent and be baptized,—in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the Remission of Sins.</hi> — There is
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:006839_0133_102A6739E3CA7DA8"/>
not one Word said about any other Faith, but <hi>believing that Jesus was the Messiah.</hi>
                     </q>
—And in the two next Pages Mr. <hi>W.</hi> insists, that their <hi>gladly receiving the Word</hi> can by no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity from the Text imply more, than that they now <hi>believed that Jesus was the Messiah,</hi> and that it was Matter of Joy to 'em that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was come.—So that we have this <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> Account of the Matter from Mr. <hi>W.</hi> That these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are first <hi>convinced that Jesus is the Messiah,</hi> and this is Cause of <hi>Distress</hi> to 'em: and they ask<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>What they shall do?</hi> Hereupon the Apostles direct 'em <hi>to believe that Jesus is the Messiah</hi>; which they believed <hi>already,</hi> before they ask'd the Question: but however, when they heard this, <hi>They believed that Jesus was the Messiah</hi>; They now found it out, as a <hi>new</hi> Thing they did not know of before, and are <hi>glad</hi> at the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Discovery; tho' just before they believed the same Thing, and the Discovery fill'd them with Distress.</p>
                  <p>In P. 47. <hi>b.</hi> Whereas it is said concerning these new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,—"That such were added to the Church, as were <hi>the saved</hi>"— Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, <hi>The like Appellation is given to the whole Church of Israel.</hi> And in this, and the foregoing Page, he insists, that these Converts were before <hi>in</hi> the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> and were not now <hi>admitted,</hi> but only <hi>continued</hi> as some of God's People. But if these Things were so, they were <hi>the saved</hi> before their Conversion to Christianity, as much as after; and others that were in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, that were not yet converted to Christianity, were as much <hi>the saved</hi> as they. And then why is their being <hi>saved</hi> spoken of as what was now brought to pass, and as a Thi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd the believing <hi>Jews</hi> from others?</p>
                  <p>In the same Page <hi>c.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says,
<q>We don't dispute but that the Apostles <hi>supposed</hi> and <hi>believed</hi> in Charity, so far as they had any. Thing to do to suppose or believe any Thing about it, that God had given these Persons saving Repentance, and an Heart-purifying Faith.</q>
And yet in P. 61. He speaks of the Apostles as supposing the contrary of many of those that had been admitted into the primitive Church; in that they speak of 'em, as such <hi>Temples</hi> of God as might be <hi>destroyed:</hi>
                     <q>Which (says Mr. <hi>W.</hi>) can't be true of sanctified Persons, unless they can fall from Grace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="unknown:006839_0134_102A673CAF0A09B8"/>In his Answer to the Argument from <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,</hi> he supposes, that <hi>believing with all the Heart</hi> is only such a Belief of the Doctrine of Christianity as <hi>unsanctified</hi> Men may have. And yet in that foremention'd Place (<hi>Christ a King and Witness,</hi> P. 144.) he says, A Man before he is <hi>renewed by the Holy Ghost, has a View of the Truth as a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uncertain Thing.</hi> And in the Book now especially attended to, he in Effect owns the Thing, which he earnestly disputes against in Reply to this Argument. He greatly insists, that the Phrase, <hi>with all the Heart,</hi> don't signify gracious Sincerity; and yet he owns it does. (P. 51. <hi>e.</hi> &amp; 52. <hi>a, b.</hi>) He owns, that according to the usual Way of speaking <hi>among Mankind,</hi> both in our Days, and also in Times when the Scriptures were written,
<q>GOD <hi>requires</hi> Men to give him their Hearts, intending by it such a Sincerity as God will own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; which be sure (says he) is nothing less than a <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sincerity</hi>; which never can be, unless the whole Soul and all its Faculties be engaged for God.</q>
Then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards adds,
<q>But how will this any Ways prove, that <hi>when Men</hi> use the same Expressions, it must necessarily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in the same Sense?</q>
And yet in the same Breath, he had observed that GOD in thus using the Phrase, uses it according to the usual Manner of speaking AMONG MANKIND. He gives this Reason, why the Phrase need not be understood in the same Sense when used <hi>by Men,</hi> that Men are not Searchers of Hearts. But the Argument is about the Phrase as <hi>Philip</hi> put it to the <hi>Eunuch</hi>'s own Conscience, which was or ought to be a Searcher of his Heart.</p>
                  <p>And by the Way I must observe, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would have done well, if he was able, to have reconciled these repugnant Things, taken Notice of in my Book; <hi>That with the Heart Man believeth to Righteousness, and that if Men believe with the Heart that God raised Christ from the Dead, they shall be saved</hi>; agreable to <hi>Rom.</hi> x.9, 10. And yet that Men may <hi>believe this with their Heart,</hi> yea, and <hi>with all their Heart,</hi> and still not <hi>believe to Righteousness,</hi> nor ever <hi>be saved.</hi> So likewise, <hi>That whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God</hi>; as in 1 Joh. iv.15. <hi>And that whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. v.1. And yet, that a Man <hi>may believe</hi> this very
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:006839_0135_102A673FA6B78B78"/>
Thing <hi>with all his Heart,</hi> and <hi>confess it with his Mouth</hi>; and this in the Language of the same Apostles and primitive Ministers; and still not <hi>be born of God,</hi> nor have a Spark of Grace in him.</p>
                  <p>It may also be worthy to be considered, whether it be reasonable to suppose, that the Faith which a Man must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, in order to being in the visible Kingdom of <hi>Christ,</hi> and not in the visible Kingdom of the <hi>Devil,</hi> must not be some <hi>other</hi> Sort of Faith than that which the <hi>Devil</hi> has: That seeing the very Design of a publick Profession of Religion is to declare on which Side we are, whether on Christ's, or on the Devil's, no other Faith is requir'd to be profess'd, than such as <hi>Satan</hi> himself has, and such as is not at all inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with being a <hi>willing, cursed Servant and Slave of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and Enemy to Christ</hi>; as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, all unsanctified Men are.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his Reply to my Argument from the <hi>Epistles</hi> (P. 55. speaks of it) as an <hi>unaccountable</hi> Thing, that I should represent as if according to the Principles of my Opposites, the primitive Christians were not admitted <hi>under any such Notion of their being REALLY godly Persons, or with any Respect to such a Character</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">So in P. 132. <hi>c.</hi> He exclaims against me thus;
<q>After all this, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it again and again, that these Persons have no Visibility to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of REAL Saintship, <hi>&amp;c. I</hi> think, gives better Ground to retort Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Words.</q>
                     </note>: and yet in his Discourse on the same Head, he abundantly insists, that it was not REAL Holiness, but only FEDERAL Holiness, which was the Qualification, which the Apostles had Respect to in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them; expresly, from Time to Time, distinguishing <hi>federal</hi> Holiness from <hi>real.</hi> In P. 56. <hi>e.</hi> and 57. <hi>a.</hi>
                     <q>It makes it evident (says he) that this Manner of treating Churches and Bodies of Men, and such Expressions used to them &amp; of them, are to be understood in NO OTHER SENSE, than to signify FEDERAL Holiness.</q>
—So in P. 60. he affirms the same Thing, once and again, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing <hi>federal</hi> Holiness from <hi>real.</hi> He says, <hi>They formed no positive Judgment of their REAL Piety.— And knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all about them, but only that they were FEDERALLY Holy.</hi> And again,
<q>They did not make a positive Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:006839_0136_102A674193F396F8"/>
that these Persons were REALLY godly; and the high Characters they gave them, and the Hopes they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed concerning them, could be understood in <hi>no other Sense</hi> than as holding forth a FEDERAL Holiness.</q>
— So that by this, they express'd no HOPES concerning any Thing more than their <hi>federal</hi> Holiness, as distinguish'd from <hi>real.</hi> And he argues earnestly, thro' the two next Pages, that they could not be look'd upon, many of them, as having <hi>real</hi> Holiness. How does this consist with their being treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>visible Saints; under the Notion of their having</hi> real Holiness, <hi>and from Respect to such a Character appearing on them</hi>? or with none's being visible Saints, but such as have a credible Visibility of <hi>Gospel-Holiness</hi>?</p>
                  <p>So in P. 63. <hi>b.</hi> He speaks of the gross Scandals of many of those the Apostles wrote to, as an absolute Proof, that they consider'd them only as <hi>federally</hi> holy; which he in the same Place distinguishes from <hi>real</hi> Holiness. Then how were they treated (as he insists) as those that <hi>had the Character of REAL PIETY appearing on them,</hi> and as <hi>making a credible Profession of Gospel-Holiness, and Real Christianity</hi>? Which, he abundantly allows, all must make in Order to being visible Saints. See also P. 64. <hi>e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In P. 58. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> insists, that it don't appear, that those who were admitted into the primitive Church, <hi>made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that they had saving Faith, but ONLY that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to that Faith.</hi>— But how does this consist with what he abundantly says elsewhere, That they must <hi>pretend</hi> to real Piety, <hi>make a Profession</hi> of Gospel-Holiness, <hi>exhibit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evidence,</hi> that they have such Holiness, <hi>&amp;c</hi>? These Things are something else besides <hi>engaging to</hi> saving Faith and Gospel-Holiness <hi>for the Future.</hi>

                  <head>SECTION X. The Unreasonableness and Inconsistence of Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Answer to my Argument from the Man without <hi>a Wedding Garment,</hi> and concerning <hi>Brotherly Love,</hi> and from <hi>1 Cor. xi.28.</hi> and of what he says in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>15</hi>th <hi>Objection.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>W.</hi> in answering my Argument from <hi>Matth.</hi> xxii.11. allows that the <hi>King's House,</hi> into which the Guests came, is the visible Church. P. 43. <hi>c.</hi> &amp; 44. <hi>d.</hi> So that the Man's <hi>coming in hither,</hi> is his coming into the visible Church. Nor does he at all dispute but that by <hi>the Wedding-Garment</hi> is meant saving Grace; (for truly the Thing is too evident to be disputed:) And yet he says, (P. 43. <hi>b, c.</hi>)
<q>We read nothing of Christ's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Man for coming into the Church without saving Grace.</q>
So that Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Answer amounts plainly to this; <hi>The King, when he comes to Judgment, will say, I don't at all condemn thee for coming in hither without a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment: but Friend, How camest thou in hither without a Wedding Garment?</hi> And no wonder; The Case is too plain to allow of any other than such a lamentable Refuge, as this is.—If the <hi>Wedding Garment</hi> be saving Grace, which is not denied; and if coming into the <hi>King's House</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the visible Church, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> owns; Then if the King condemns the Man for coming into the House without a Wedding Garment, He condemns him for coming into the visible Church without saving Grace.</p>
                  <p>'Tis plain, the Thing the Man is blamed for, is something else than simply <hi>a being without Grace,</hi> or without a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment. The King's Words have Respect to this as it stands in <hi>Connection</hi> with <hi>coming into the King's House.</hi> If Christ has commanded Men who are <hi>not converted,</hi> to come into the Church, <hi>that they may be converted,</hi> He will never say to them, upon their obeying this Command, <hi>Friend, how camest thou in hither before thou wast converted?</hi> Which would be another Thing than blaming him simply for not being
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:006839_0138_102A67485591FCE8"/>
converted. If a Man, at his own Cost, sets up a School, in order to teach ignorant Children to read; and accordingly ignorant Children should go thither in order to learn to read, would he come into the School, and say in Anger to an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Child that he found there; <hi>How camest thou in hither, before thou hadst learnt to read!</hi> Did the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> ever rebuke the Heathen, who came to hear him preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, saying, <hi>How came you hither to hear me preach, not having Grace?</hi> This would have been unreasonable, because <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is an Ordinance appointed to that End, that Men might obtain Grace. And so, in Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Scheme, is the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi>—Can we suppose, that Christ will say to Men in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, at the Day of Judgment, <hi>How came you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to use the Means I appointed for your Conversion, before you were converted!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the Servants were to invite all, <hi>both bad &amp; good,</hi> to come to the Feast, and to <hi>compel them to come in:</hi> but this don't prove, that bad Men, <hi>remaining</hi> in their Badness, have a lawful Right to come. The Servants were to invite the vicious, as well as the moral; they were to invite the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> who were especially meant by them that were <hi>in the High-Ways and Hedges:</hi> Yet it will not follow, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, while <hi>remaining</hi> Heathen, have a lawful Right to come to Christian Sacraments. But heathen Men must turn from their Heathenism, and come: so likewise wicked Men must turn from their Wickedness, and come.</p>
                  <p>I endeavoured to prove, that <hi>That brotherly Love,</hi> which is required towards the Members of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in general, is such a Love as is required to those <hi>only</hi> whom we have Reason to look upon as <hi>true Saints.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> disputes, thro' two Pages, (P. 66, 67) against the Force of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning to prove this Point; and yet when he has done, he allows the Point. He allows it (P. 68. <hi>d, e.</hi>) as an undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Thing, that <hi>'tis the Image of God and Christ appearing or supposed to be in others, that is the Ground and Reason of this Love.</hi> And so again (P. 71. <hi>d, e.</hi>) he grants, that <hi>there must be some Apprehension, and Judgment of the Mind, of the Saintship of Persons,</hi> in Order to this brotherly Love. Indeed he pretends to differ from me in this, that he denies the Need of any <hi>positive Judgment:</hi> But doubtless the Judgment
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:006839_0139_102A674B426AAED0"/>
or Apprehension of the Mind must be as positive as the <hi>Love</hi> founded on that Apprehension &amp; Judgment of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>In P. 78, 79. He seems to insist, that what the Apostle calls <hi>unworthy Communicating,</hi> is eating in a greedy, disorderly and irreverent Manner: as tho' Men might communicate without Grace, and yet not communicate <hi>unworthily,</hi> in the Apostle's Sense. But if so, the Apostle differed much in his Sense of Things from Mr. <hi>W.</hi>— The latter says, in his Sermon on <hi>Christ a King and Witness,</hi> (P. 77, 78.)
<q>These outward Acts of Worship, when not performed from Faith in Christ, and Love to God, are <hi>mocking</hi> God, — in their own Nature a <hi>Lie,</hi>— The <hi>vilest Wickedness</hi>;— in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being that Religion, which Christ requires, 'tis <hi>infinitely contrary</hi> to it,— The most <hi>flagrant</hi> &amp; <hi>abominable Impiety,</hi> &amp; <hi>threatned with the severest Damnation.</hi>
                     </q>
Is not this a Communicating <hi>unworthily</hi> enough of all Reason!</p>
                  <p>In P. 132, 133. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> strenuously opposes me in my Supposition, that the Way of freely allowing all that have only <hi>moral Sincerity</hi> to come into the Church, tends to the <hi>Reproach</hi> &amp; <hi>Ruin</hi> of the Church. On the contrary, he seems to suppose it tends to the establishing and building up of the Church. But I desire that what Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> says, in his Sermon on <hi>the Danger of speedy Degeneracy,</hi> may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under this Head. He there largely insists, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of unconverted Men and unholy Professors among a People is the principal Thing that brings 'em into Danger of <hi>speedy Degeneracy</hi> and Corruption. He says, that <hi>Where this is the Case, there will be many bad Examples, that will corrupt others</hi>; and that <hi>unconverted Men will indulge their Children in Evil, will be negligent in their Education</hi>; and that <hi>by this Means their Children will be very corrupt &amp; ungovern'd</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom">If we have Reason to expect it will be thus with ungodly Parents, with Respect to their Children, then certainly such can't reasonably expect Ministers and Churches should admit their Children to Baptism, in a Dependance that they do <hi>give them up to God,</hi> and <hi>will bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord,</hi> if they make no Profession that implies more than moral Sincerity; and none but what wicked Men may as well make as the godly, and speak <hi>true.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>by this Means the godly themselves that are among 'em, will be tainted, as sweet Liquor put into a corrupt Vessel will be tainted</hi>; that <hi>thus a People will grow blind, will not much regard the Warnings of the Word, or the Judgments of God;
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:006839_0140_102A674CE44EDC60"/>
and that they will grow weary of religious Duties after a While</hi>; and that <hi>many of their leading Men will be carnal</hi>; and that <hi>this will expose a People to have carnal Ministers and other leading Men in the Town and Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I desire also, that here may be considered what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself says, in that Passage forecited, P. 86, 87. of his Sermons <hi>on Christ a King and Witness</hi>; where, in explaining what it is to promote the Kingdom of Christ, he says nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
<q>That 'tis not to do that which may prevail on Men to make <hi>Pretences,</hi> that they are Christians, and that they own Jesus Christ as their Saviour, and to <hi>call him Lord, Lord,</hi> when <hi>really</hi> he is not so.</q>
Which he supposes is the Case with all unsanctified Professors; for in the same Book, he abundantly declares, that they who make such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and have not true Faith and Love, make <hi>false</hi> and <hi>lying</hi> Pretences; as has been several Times already observed.</p>

                  <head>SECTION. XI. The <hi>Impertinence</hi> of Arguments, that are in like Manner against the Schemes of <hi>both</hi> the controverting Parties: <hi>And</hi> this exemplified in what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says concerning the Notion of <hi>Israel's</hi> being <hi>the People of God,</hi> and his Manner of arguing concerning the Members of the primitive <hi>Christian</hi> Church.</head>
                  <p>IN as much as in each of the remaining Instances of Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Arguing, that I shall take Notice of, He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists upon and urges Arguments, which are in like Manner against <hi>his own</hi> Scheme, as against mine, I desire, that such a Way of arguing may be a little particularly considered.</p>
                  <p>And here I would lay down this as a Maxim of undoubted Verity; <hi>That an Argument, brought to support one Scheme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, can avail Nothing to the Purpose it is brought for, if it is at the same Time against the Scheme it would</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>in like Manner as against that which it would</hi> destroy.</p>
                  <p>It is an old and approved Maxim, <hi>That Argument which proves too much, proves Nothing.</hi> i. e. If it proves too much
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:006839_0141_102A674FDC093348"/>
for him that brings it, proves against himself in like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as against his Opponent, then it is Nothing to help his Cause. The Reason of it is plain: The Business of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is to make one Cause good against another, to make one Scale heavier than the other. But when a Man uses an Argument which takes <hi>alike</hi> out of <hi>both</hi> Scales, this don't at all serve to make <hi>his</hi> Side preponderate, but leaves the Ballance just as it was.</p>
                  <p>Arguments brought by any Man in a Dispute, if they ben't altogether impertinent, are against the <hi>Difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Him and his Opponent, or against his Opponent's <hi>differing from him:</hi> For wherein there is <hi>no Difference,</hi> there is no <hi>Dispute.</hi> But that can be no Argument against his Opponent's <hi>differing</hi> from him, which is only an Argument against what is <hi>common to both,</hi> and taken from some Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that <hi>both</hi> Sides equally share in. If I charge supposed Absurdities or Difficulties against him that <hi>differs</hi> from me, as an Argument to shew the Unreasonableness of his <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and yet the Difficulty is not owing to his <hi>differing</hi> from me, in as much as the same would lie against him, if he <hi>agreed</hi> with me, my Conduct herein is both very impertinent and injurious.</p>
                  <p>If one in a Dispute insists on an Argument, that lies equally against his own Scheme as the other, and yet will stand to it that his Argument is <hi>good,</hi> he in Effect stands to it that his own Scheme is <hi>not good</hi>; he supplants himself, and gives up his own Cause, in opposing his Adversary; in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fast <hi>his Argument,</hi> he holds fast what is <hi>his own Overthrow</hi>; and in insisting that his Argument is <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>strong,</hi> he in Effect insists that his own Scheme is <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>vain.</hi> If my Antagonist will insist upon it, that his Argument is good, that he brings <hi>against me,</hi> which is in like Manner <hi>against himself</hi>; then I may take the same Argument, in my Turn, and use it against him, and he can have nothing to answer; but has stopped his own Mouth, having own'd the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be conclusive.</p>
                  <p>Now such Sort of Arguments as these Mr. <hi>W.</hi> abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes use of.</p>
                  <p>For Instance, the Argument taken from the whole Nation of <hi>Israel</hi>'s being called <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>People,</hi> and every Thing that
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:006839_0142_102A6751B6373DF0"/>
Mr. <hi>W.</hi> alledges, pertaining to this Matter, is in like Manner against <hi>his own</hi> Scheme as against mine: And that, let the Question be what it will; whether it be about the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which make it lawful for the Church to <hi>admit,</hi> or about the Lawfulness of Persons <hi>coming</hi> to Sacraments; whether it be about the <hi>Profession they should make before Men,</hi> or the <hi>internal Qualification they must have in the Sight of God.</hi> And what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says to the contrary, don't indeed at all deliver the Argument from this Embarassment &amp; Absurdity. After all he has said, in turning and twisting it, to save the Force of it, the Argument, if any Thing related to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy, is plainly this, <hi>That because the whole Nation of</hi> Israel <hi>were God's</hi> visible People (<hi>which is the same as</hi> visible Saints) <hi>therefore the Scripture-Notion of</hi> visible Saintship <hi>is of larger Extent than mine; and the Scripture supposes those to be visible Saints, which my Scheme don't suppose to be so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if this be Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Argument, then let us see whether it agrees any better with <hi>his own</hi> Scheme. Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> (Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s great Author) in his Book <hi>on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> (P. 190. <hi>b.</hi>) insists, <hi>that</hi> Israel <hi>at the very</hi> WORST <hi>is own'd as God's Covenant-People, and were called God's People</hi>; and (P. 149. <hi>e.</hi>) that <hi>all the Congregation of</hi> Israel, <hi>&amp; every one of them, are called Holy, and God's own People, even</hi> Corah <hi>and his Company.</hi> And (P. 253. <hi>e.</hi> 254. <hi>a.</hi>) he urges, that <hi>every one who is descended from</hi> Jacob, <hi>even the WORST of</hi> Israel, <hi>in their LOWEST State and Condition, were God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Covenant, called by the Name of God's People.</hi>— And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> herein follows Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and urges the same Thing; that this Nation was God's Covenant-People, &amp; were called God's People, at the Time that they were carried Captive into <hi>Babylon</hi> (P. 24. <hi>d.</hi>) when they were undoubtedly <hi>at their Worst,</hi> more corrupt than at any other Time we read of in the Old Testament; being represented by the Prophets, as over-run with abominable Idolatries, &amp; other Kinds of the most gross, Heaven-daring Impieties, most obstinate, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, pertinacious and irreclaimable in their Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and against his Word by his Prophets. But yet these, 'tis urged, are called the <hi>People of God</hi>; not agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>my</hi> Notion of visible Saintship, but agreable to Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s. What his Notion of <hi>visible Saints</hi> is, he tells us
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:006839_0143_102A6756086B1720"/>
in P 139. He there says expresly, that He
<q>don't suppose Persons to be visible Saints, unless they exhibit a credible Profession and Visibility of <hi>Gospel-Holiness.</hi>

Now do those Things said about those vile Wretches in <hi>Israel,</hi> agree with this? Did they exhibit moral Evidence of <hi>Gospel-Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness!</hi> — But if we bring the Matter lower still, and say, the true Notion of visible Saintship is a credible Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and moral Evidence of <hi>moral Sincerity</hi>; does this fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, open, abandoned, obstinate Impiety consist with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evidence of such Sincerity as that? 'Tis as apparent therefore, in Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Scheme as Mine, that when these are called <hi>God's People,</hi> 'tis in some other Sense than that wherein the Members of the Christian Church are called <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Saints.</hi> And indeed the Body of the Nation of <hi>Israel,</hi> in those corrupt Times, were so far from being God's Church of visibly pious Persons, visibly endowed with <hi>Gospel-Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> People, as to the Body of them, were visibly and openly declared by God, to be a <hi>Whore</hi> and a <hi>Witch,</hi> and her Children <hi>Bastards,</hi> or <hi>Children of Adultery.</hi> Isai. lvii.3. <hi>Draw near hither, ye Sons of the Sorceress, the Seed of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer and the Whore.</hi> (We have the like in other Places.) And so the Body of the same People in Christ's Time (which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> supposes even then to be Branches of the <hi>True Olive,</hi> in the same Manner, as the Members of the Christian Church were in the Apostles Times) are visibly declared not to be God's Children, or Children of the true Church, but Bastards or an adulterous Brood. Matth. xii.39. <hi>An evil and adulterous Generation seeketh after a Sign.</hi> v. 45. <hi>Even so shall it be with this wicked Generation.</hi> And certainly the People were then, visibly and in the Eyes of Men, such as Christ had visibly and openly and in the Sight of Men declared 'em to be.</p>
                  <p>If the Question be not concerning the <hi>Visibility</hi> which makes it <hi>lawful for others to admit Persons,</hi> but concerning the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications which render it lawful for them to come,</hi> still the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is no more against <hi>my</hi> Scheme, than against Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s. He (in P. 84, 85, &amp; 86.) says, That such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly scandalous Persons <hi>ought not to be admitted into the Church</hi>; insinuating, that these scandalous People among the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>otherwise</hi> when they were <hi>admitted at first:</hi> But that being taken in, and not cast out again, <hi>it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:006839_0144_102A675A855F3A98"/>
for 'em to be there,</hi> and they had a lawful Right to the Privileges of the Church. But this Supposition, that all that are lawfully <hi>admitted</hi> by others, may lawfully <hi>come</hi> into the Church, and lawfully <hi>continue</hi> to partake of its Privileges <hi>'till cast out,</hi> is utterly inconsistent with Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s own Scheme. For according to his Scheme, 'tis not lawful for Men that are not <hi>morally sincere,</hi> to partake of the Privileges of the Church; but yet such may in some Cases be lawfully admitted by others; for he maintains, that in admitting them, they are not to act as <hi>Searchers of Hearts,</hi> even with Regard to their moral Sincerity; and so argues (P. 106.) That Christ might give <hi>Judas</hi> the Sacrament, when not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Sincere. If Christ as Head of the visible Church might admit <hi>Judas</hi> to his Table, when he knew he was not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Sincere, and when it was not lawful for <hi>Judas</hi> himself to come; then it is lawful for Men to admit some, for whom it is not lawful to be there; contrary to Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion in P. 86. <hi>b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that Persons may become grosly scandalous, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been regularly admitted on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, on a Profession in Words of indiscriminate Signification. And so they may after being regularly admitted, according to my Principles, on a credible Profession of Gospel Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Words of a determinate Meaning: And therefore the gross Wickedness of such Apostates as we read of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is no more an Objection against my Principles, than his.</p>
                  <p>Just in the same Manner is Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s arguing (P. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63.) concerning the Members of Churches mentioned in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> equally against his own Scheme and mine. He largely insists on it, that the Apostle speaks of many of them as grosly scandalous, notoriously wicked Persons, Idolaters, Hereticks, Fornicators, Adulterers, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresses, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> In his Arguing from these Things, he is inconsistent with his own Principles, two Ways. (1.) Such a Character is as plainly inconsistent with the Character he insists on as necessary to render it lawful for Persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to come to Sacraments, as mine. And (2.) 'Tis utterly inconsistent with what he often declares to be his Notion of <hi>visible Saintship,</hi> necessary to a being admitted by others; so no more an Argument against my Opinion of <hi>visible Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> than his own.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XII. The great Argument from the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the <hi>PASSOVER,</hi> and <hi>CIRCUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISION,</hi> considered.</head>
                  <p>AS has been observed concerning the Argument from the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, so the Argument from the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ordinances, if it be against my Scheme, is as plainly, in every Respect, against Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>This grand Argument, as plainly express'd, or implied in Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Words (which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> insists I should attend to) is this:</p>
                  <p>God did expresly command all the Nation of <hi>Israel</hi> to be <hi>Circumcised</hi>; and he also expresly commanded the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come to the <hi>Passover</hi>; excepting such as were cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially Unclean, or in a Journey. Therefore it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for unsanctified Men to come. (See Mr. <hi>Stod—'s Sermon</hi> on the Controv. P. 8. &amp; <hi>Appeal,</hi> P. 51.) The Want of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication never was alledged by any Man as a Reason for forbearing the Passover. (<hi>Appeal,</hi> P. 51.) Unsanctified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons attending this Ordinance is never charged on them as a Sin in Scripture. <hi>(Ibid.)</hi> Jesus Christ himself partook of the Passover with <hi>Judas</hi>; which proves it to be lawful for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Men to come to the Passover. But such as might lawfully come to the <hi>Passover,</hi> may lawfully come to the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let us consider what are the Qualifications, which are necessary, according to Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Scheme, to a lawful coming to Christian Sacraments; and then see whether this Objection, in every Part of it, and every Thing that belongs to it, ben't as plainly and directly against <hi>his own</hi> Scheme, as mine.</p>
                  <p>According to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> 'tis not lawful for a Man to come unless he is <hi>morally sincere. (Pref.</hi> P. 2. &amp; 3. P. 21. <hi>b.</hi> 25. <hi>d, e.</hi> 30. <hi>d.</hi> 35. <hi>e.</hi> 36. <hi>a.</hi> 111. <hi>b, c.</hi> 115. <hi>b.</hi>) And, according as he has explain'd that moral Sincerity, which is necessary in Order to come to Sacraments, it implies
<q>A real Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:006839_0146_102A676086412688"/>
of the Judgment and Conscience of the Truth of the great Things of Religion,— a deep Conviction of a Man's undone State without Christ, and an earnest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to obtain Salvation by him, — a fervent Desire of Christ and the Benefits of the Covenant of Grace, with an earnest Purpose and Resolution to seek Salvation on the Terms of it;— A Man's being willing to do the utmost that he can, by the utmost Improvement of his natural and moral Power, in the most earnest and diligent Use of the Ordinances of Salvation;— being resolved for Christ, coming to a Point, being engaged for Heaven;— having a settled Determination of the Judgment &amp; Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for God;— giving up all his Heart and Life to Christ, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>

And he says, they are received into the Church, <hi>on like Terms, by entring into Covenant in like Manner, as the</hi> Jews; <hi>and that their Holiness, both real, and federal, is the same with theirs.</hi> (P. 56, 57. P. 61. <hi>e.</hi> P. 65. <hi>c.</hi>) So that according to this Scheme, none but those that had such Qualifications as these, such a Sincerity and Engagedness in Religion as this, might lawfully come to the <hi>Passover.</hi>— But now do the Things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged agree any better with this his Scheme, than with mine? If the Case be so, to what Purpose is it alledged, that God in <hi>Numb.</hi> Chap. ix. expresly commanded all of that perverse, rebellious and obstinate Generation in the Wilderness, and the whole Nation of <hi>Israel</hi> in all Generations, to keep the <hi>Passover,</hi> excepting such as were ceremonially unclean or in a Journey, without the Exception of any other? Was every one else of such a Character as is above described? Was every one under deep Convictions, and Persons of such earnest Engagedness in Religion, of such settled strong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to give up their utmost Strength &amp; all their Heart and Life to God, <hi>&amp;c</hi>? Mr. <hi>W.</hi> suggests, that <hi>those who had not moral Sincerity are expresly excepted from the Command.</hi> (P. 93. <hi>d.</hi>) But I wish, he had mention'd the Place of Scripture. He cites Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> who says, <hi>God appointed Sacrifice to be
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:006839_0147_102A6763839747F0"/>
offered for Scandal, with Confession.</hi> But where did God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> for the <hi>Want</hi> of such <hi>Sincerity,</hi> for the <hi>Want</hi> of such deep Conviction, earnest Desire, and fix'd Resolution, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> speaks of? And where are such as are without these Things, <hi>expresly excepted</hi> from the Command to keep the <hi>Passover</hi>? And besides there were many scandalous Sins, for which <hi>no Sacrifice</hi> was appointed: As <hi>David</hi>'s Murder and Adultery, and the Sin of Idolatry, (which the Nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral often fell into) and many other gross Sins. Nor was there any Precept for <hi>deferring</hi> the keeping of the <hi>Passover,</hi> in Case of scandalous Wickedness, or moral Uncleanness, 'till there should be Opportunity for cleansing by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. as was in the Case of ceremonial Uncleanness.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>S.</hi> says, <hi>The want of Sanctification was never alledged by any Man as a Reason for forbearing the Passover.</hi> So, where do we read in any Part of the Bible, that ever the <hi>Want</hi> of such deep Conviction <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> speaks of, or indeed any scandalous moral Uncleanness, was ever alledged by any Man, as a Reason for forbearing to eat the <hi>Passover</hi>?—Mr. <hi>S.</hi> urges, that unsanctified Persons attending the <hi>Passover</hi> was never charged on them as a <hi>Sin.</hi> And where do we read of Persons coming without such <hi>moral Sincerity</hi> being any more charged on them as a <hi>Sin,</hi> than the other? We have Reason to think, it was a common Thing for Parents that had no such <hi>moral Sincerity,</hi> yea, that were grosly and openly wicked, to have their Children <hi>circumcised</hi>; for the Body of the People were often so: But where is this charged as a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>? Mr. <hi>S.</hi> says (Serm. P. 7.) <hi>Ishmael</hi> was circumcised, but yet a carnal Person. And there is as much Reason to say, He was <hi>not</hi> of the Character Mr. <hi>W.</hi> insists on, <hi>under deep Convictions, having earnest Desires of Grace, a full and fixed Determination, with all his Heart, to the utmost of his Power, to give his whole Life to God,</hi> &amp;c.—Mr. <hi>S.</hi> says (<hi>Serm.</hi> P. 8.)

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> insists on, as that they were without sanctifying Grace.— Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, (P. 91. <hi>c.) The</hi> Israelites <hi>had carefully attended the Seal of Circumcision, from the Time of its Institution, 'till
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:006839_0148_102A676506ED7BB8"/>
the Departure out of</hi> Egypt. But surely most of 'em at the same Time were without Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> moral Sincerity; for 'tis abundantly manifest, that the Body of the People fell away to Idolatry in <hi>Egypt.</hi> (See <hi>Levit.</hi> xvii.7. <hi>Josh.</hi> xxiv.14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xx.8. &amp; xxiii.3, 8, 27.) And there is not the least Appearance of any more <hi>Exception,</hi> either in the Precepts or History of the Old Testament, of the Case of <hi>moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity,</hi> in such as attended these Ordinances, than of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness, or an unsanctified State.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>S.</hi> urges, that <hi>Jesus Christ himself partook of the Passover with</hi> Judas; and thence he would argue, that it was lawful for an <hi>unregenerate</hi> Person to partake of the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> But there can be no Argument, in any Sort, drawn from this, to prove that it is lawful for Men to partake of the Lord's Supper without <hi>sanctifying Grace,</hi> any more than that it is lawful for 'em to partake without <hi>moral Sincerity:</hi> for it is every Whit as evident, that <hi>Judas</hi> was at that Time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moral Sincerity, as that he was unregenerate. We have no greater Evidence, in all the Scripture-History, of the moral Insincerity of any one Man, than of <hi>Judas,</hi> at the Time when he partook of the <hi>Passover</hi> with Christ; he having just then been and bargained with the High Priest, to <hi>betray</hi> him, and being then in Prosecution of the horrid Design of the Murder of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>If any Thing contrary to my Principles could be argued from all <hi>Israel's</hi> being required, thro'out their Generations, to come to the <hi>Passover</hi> and <hi>Circumcision,</hi> it would be this; That all Persons, of all Sorts, thro'out all <hi>Christendom,</hi> might lawfully come to <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>; godly and ungodly, the knowing and the ignorant, the moral and the vicious, orthodox and heretical, Protestants &amp; Papists alike. But this don't agree with Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any better than with mine.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XIII. Concerning <hi>Judas's</hi> partaking of the Lord's Supper.</head>
                  <p>I Think, we have a remarkable Instance of Tergiversation, in what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says in support of the Argument from <hi>Judas</hi>'s partaking of the Lord's Supper. By those on his Side of the Question, 'tis insisted upon, as a clear Evidence of its being lawful for unsanctified Men to come to the Lord's Table, That Christ gave the Lord's Supper to <hi>Judas,</hi> when he knew he was unsanctified. In Answer to which, I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this is just as much against their own Principles, as mine; because Christ knew as perfectly that he was not <hi>morally sincere,</hi> as that he was not <hi>graciously</hi> sincere; and they themselves hold, that 'tis not lawful for such as are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally sincere, to partake. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ridicules this, as very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent &amp; strange; because <hi>Christ did not know this as Head of the visible Church, but only as omniscient God and Searcher of Hearts.</hi> And what does this argue? Only, that altho' <hi>Judas</hi> was really not fit to come, yet, in-as-much-as Christ, acting as King of the visible Church, did not know it, He <hi>might admit him:</hi> But not, that it was <hi>lawful for</hi> Judas <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to come,</hi> who knew his own Heart in this Matter, and knew his own Perfidiousness and Treachery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Mr. <hi>W.</hi> denies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that 'tis lawful for such to come, as have no moral Sincerity. So that here the Question is changed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from, <hi>Who may lawfully come,</hi> to <hi>Who may lawfully be admitted</hi>? Mr. <hi>W.</hi> does abundantly in his Book insist, that the Question is not, <hi>Who shall be admitted?</hi> but, <hi>Who may lawfully come?</hi> Not, whether it be lawful to admit those who have not a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of Saintship, or don't appear to be true Saints? but whether those who are not true Saints, may lawfully partake? And this he insists upon in his Discourse on this very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, P. 104. <hi>c, d.</hi> And to prove this latter Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>those who are not real Saints, may lawfully come,</hi> the Instance of <hi>Judas</hi>'s coming to the Lord's Supper is produced as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Evidence. But when it is answered, that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment don't prove this, any more than that the morally insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere may lawfully come; because <hi>Judas</hi> was morally insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere: then Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (P. 106.) to shelter himself, dodges, and
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:006839_0150_102A676AA4FA8D80"/>
evidently changes the Question, at once, to that which he had so much exclaimed against as <hi>not the Question.</hi> Now, to serve his Turn, the Question is not, Whether <hi>Judas</hi> might <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully come</hi>? but, Whether Christ might <hi>lawfully admit him,</hi> acting on a publick Visibility? And he makes an Occasion to cry out of me, as talking <hi>strangely,</hi> and soon forgetting that I had said, Christ in this Matter did not act as Searcher of Hearts. Whereas, let the Question be what it will, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>Judas</hi>'s partaking (should the Fact be supposed) if it proves any Thing relating to the Matter, is perfectly, and in every Respect, against the one, just as it is against the other. If the Question be about <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Visibility</hi> to others, and who others may <hi>lawfully admit,</hi> then <hi>Judas</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted (if he was admitted) no more proves, that Men may be admitted without a Visibility &amp; Profession of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, than without a Visibility of moral Sincerity. For it no more appears, that He was without a Profession &amp; Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the former, than of the latter. But if the Question is not about <hi>Visibility to others,</hi> or who others <hi>may admit,</hi> but who may <hi>lawfully come,</hi> then <hi>Judas</hi>'s coming no more proves, that a Man may come without Grace, than without moral Sincerity; because he was in like Manner without both: And Christ <hi>knew</hi> as perfectly, that he was without the one, as the other; and was not ignorant of the one Case, as King of the visible Church, any more than of the other. So that there is no Way to support this Argument, or to make any Thing at all of it; but the only Way left is, to hide the Question, by shifting &amp; changing it; to have one Question in the Premises, and to slip in another into the Conclusion. Which is according to the Course Mr. <hi>W.</hi> takes. In the Premises (P. 104, 105.) He expresly mentions Mr. <hi>S—d</hi>'s Question, as now in View; and agreably must here have this for his Question, <hi>Whether it was lawful for a Man so qualified, to come to the Lord's Supper?</hi> Who, according to Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s own Doctrine, (P. 111.) ought to act as a Discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his own Heart. But in his Conclusion (P. 106.) he has this for his Question, <hi>Whether Christ might lawfully</hi> AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIT <hi>a Man so qualified,</hi> therein not acting as the Searcher of Hearts? — What Shuffling is this?</p>

                  <p>'TIs hard to understand distinctly what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would be at, concerning this Matter, or what his Argument is. He often speaks of Parents that are in Covenant, as <hi>born in Covenant,</hi> and so <hi>born in the Church.</hi> (For to be in Covenant, is the same with him as to be Members of the visible Church. See P. 98. <hi>c.</hi> 88. <hi>d.</hi> 89. <hi>b.</hi> 59. <hi>e.</hi> 60. <hi>a.</hi> 136. <hi>b.</hi>) And speaks of them as admitted into the Church in their <hi>Ancestors,</hi> and by the <hi>Profession</hi> of their Ancestors. (P. 135. <hi>e.</hi> 136. <hi>a.</hi>) Yea, for ought I can see, He holds that they were <hi>born Members in COMPLEAT STANDING in the visible Church.</hi> (P. 3.)</p>
                  <p>And yet he abundantly speaks of their being ADMIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TED into the Church, and MADE Members, after they are born, <hi>viz.</hi> by their Baptism. And his Words (unless we will suppose him to speak Nonsense) are such as will not allow us to understand him, meerly, that Baptism is a <hi>Sign</hi> &amp; <hi>publick Acknowlegement</hi> of their having been admitted in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, in preceding Generations. For he speaks of Baptism as <hi>the ONLY Rite</hi> (or <hi>Way) of Admission into the visible Church,</hi> applying it to the Baptism of Children; and as that which <hi>MAKES 'em Members of the Body of Christ.</hi> (P. 99. <hi>c, d.</hi>) And he grants, that <hi>it was ordained for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And he joins 'em together in the same Line (P. 46. <hi>e.</hi>) in these Words,—
<q>Baptism instituted by him, as a Rite of ADMISSION into his Church, &amp; being CONTINUED
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:006839_0152_102A6771E7967DB0"/>
in Covenant with God.</q>
—Certainly a being then <hi>admitted</hi> into the Church, and a being <hi>continued</hi> in Covenant (or in the Church) into which they were admitted <hi>before,</hi> are not the same Thing, nor consistent one with another. — If In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are born Members in <hi>compleat Standing,</hi> as it seems Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> holds, then their Baptism does nothing towards <hi>making</hi> them Members; nor is there any Need of it to make the Matter more <hi>compleat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again in P. 3. <hi>b.</hi> (the same Page where he speaks of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants as Members having a compleat Standing in the Church) he maintains, that Nothing else is requisite in Order to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Privileges of Members in compleat Standing,</hi> but only that they should be <hi>capable</hi> hereof, and <hi>should desire</hi> the same, and should not be <hi>under Censure, or scandalously Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or Immoral.</hi> (See also P. 100. <hi>c, d.</hi> to the same Purpose.) Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says this in Opposition to my insisting on something further, <hi>viz.</hi> making a Profession of Godliness. And yet he himself insists on something <hi>further,</hi> as much as I; which has been observed before. For he abundantly insists on a <hi>personal, explicit Profession and open Declaration</hi> of believing that the Gospel is indeed the Revelation of God, and of a hearty Consent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And speaks of the whole Controversy as turning upon that single Point, of the Degree of Evidence to be given, and the Kind of Profession to be made, Whether in Words of indiscriminate Meaning? (See P. 5. <hi>b, c.</hi> P. 6. <hi>c, d.</hi>) And consequently not, Whether they must make any Profession at all, having been compleatly admitted before, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their Ancestors?</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if it be so, that the Infants of visible Believers are born in the Church, and are already Members in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Standing, and don't drop out of the Church, and fall from a compleat Standing, when they grow up; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they are not ignorant nor immoral, &amp; desire full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, <hi>Nothing else</hi> can be required of them: And it will hence follow, contrary to <hi>my</hi> Principles, that they can't be required to make a Profession in Words of <hi>discriminate</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But then, it also equally follows, contrary to <hi>his</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that neither can they be required to make a Profession in Words of <hi>indiscriminate</hi> Meaning. If nothing else besides
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:006839_0153_102A6775F3565D50"/>
those forementioned Things is necessary, then <hi>no Profession</hi> at all is necessary, in any Words at all, neither of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate nor indeterminate Signification. So that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in supposing some personal Profession to be necessary, gives up and destroys this his grand Argument.</p>
                  <p>But if he did not give it up by this Means, it would not be tenable on other Principles belonging to <hi>his</hi> Scheme; such as its being necessary in order to a being admitted to Sacraments, that Persons should have a Visibility that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends them to the reasonable Judgment and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Minds of others, as true Christians, really pious Persons, and that there should be such a Profession as exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits moral Evidence of this. For who will say, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Profession of an Ancestor, a Thousand or fifteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years ago, is a credible Exhibition &amp; moral Evidence of the real Piety of his present Posterity, without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal explicit Profession of any Thing about Religion, in any one of the succeeding Generations. And if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had not said, There must be a credible Exhibition of <hi>Gospel Holiness,</hi> but only some common Faith or Vertue; yet no such Thing is made visible to a rational Judgment and Apprehension of Mind, by this Means. How, for Instance, does it make <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> visible? What reasonable Ground is there in it, at such a Day as this in <hi>England,</hi> to believe concerning any Man, that he believes the Doctrine of the Trinity, and all other fundamental Doctrines, with full Conviction, and with all his Heart, because he descended from an Ancestor that made a good Profession, when the ancient <hi>Britons</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> were converted from Heathenism, and because withal he is free from open scandalous Immorality, and appears wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to attend Duties of publick Worship! If an Attendance on these publick Duties was in its own Nature a Profession of Orthodoxy, or even Piety; yet the Reason of Mankind teaches them the Need of joining <hi>Words</hi> &amp; <hi>Actions</hi> together in publick Manifestations of the Mind, in Cases of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: <hi>Speech</hi> being the great and peculiar Talent, which God has given to Mankind, as the special Means and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Manifestation of their Minds one to another. Thus, Treaties of Peace among Men are not concluded and finished, only with Actions, without Words. Feasting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:006839_0154_102A6777785B23A8"/>
was used of old, as a Testimony of Peace &amp; Covenant-Friendship; as between <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Abinrelech, Laban</hi> &amp; <hi>Jacob,</hi> but not without a verbal Profession. Giving the Hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to express a Marriage-Agreement and Union; but still a Profession in Words is annex'd. So we allow it to be needful, after Persons have fallen into Scandal, that in manifesting Repentance there should be a verbal Profession, besides attending Duties of Worship. Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes won't trust a Profession of Allegiance, in Actions only, such as bowing, kneeling, keeping the King's Birth Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they require also a Profession in Words, and an Oath of Allegiance is demanded. Yea, it is thought to be reasonably demanded, in Order to Men's coming to the actual Possession and Enjoyment of those Privileges, they are <hi>born Heirs to.</hi> Thus, the eldest Sons of Noble-Men in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> are born Heirs to the Honours and Estate of their Fathers; yet this no Way hinders but they may be obliged, when they come to Ripeness of Age, in Order to a being invested in the actual Possession, to take the Oath of Allegiance: tho' in Order to their lawful doing it, it may be necessary they should believe in their Hearts, that King GEORGE is the lawful Prince, and that they should not be Enemies to Him, and Friends to the Pretender, in their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>But moreover, If this Objection of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> about Infants being born in the Church be well considered, it will appear to be all <hi>beside the Question,</hi> and so nothing to the Purpose. It is not to the Purpose of either of the Questions, Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s or Mine. The Question as I have stated it, is concerning them that may be <hi>admitted</hi> Members in compleat Standing; not about them that have a compleat Standing in the Church <hi>already,</hi> and so are no Candidates for Admission; which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he says, is the Case of these Infants. And the Question as <hi>He</hi> often states it, is concerning them that may <hi>lawfully come:</hi> And this Objection, from Infants being <hi>born in the Church,</hi> as it must be understood from Mr. <hi>W.</hi> don't touch this Question. For when Mr. <hi>W.</hi> objects, that some Persons are born in the Church, and therefore may lawfully come to Sacraments, he can't be understood to mean, that their being <hi>born</hi> in the Church <hi>alone</hi> is sufficient; but that, besides <hi>this,</hi> Persons must have some Vertue or Religion, of one Sort or
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:006839_0155_102A677C353D45C0"/>
other, in order to their lawful coming. For he is full in it, that it is not lawful for Men to come without moral Vertue and Sincerity. Therefore the Question comes to this in the Result: Seeing Persons, besides their being born in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, must have some Sort of Vertue and Religion, in order to a lawful coming to the Lord's Supper, <hi>What Sort</hi> of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion <hi>that</hi> is, whether <hi>common</hi> or <hi>saving</hi>? Now this Question is not touch'd by the present Objection. Meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Persons being <hi>born</hi> in Covenant, is no more Evidence of their having moral Sincerity, than saving Grace. Yea, there is more Reason to suppose the latter, than the former with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, in the Infant Children of believing Parents. For the Scripture gives us Ground to think, that some Infants have the Habit of saving Grace, and that they have a new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture given them; But no Reason at all to think, that ever God works any meer moral Change, in them, or infuses any Habits of moral Vertue without saving Grace: And we know, They can't come by moral Habits in Infancy, any other Way than by immediate Infusion: They can't obtain them by human Instruction, nor contract them by Use and Custom. And especially there's no Reason to think, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of such as are visible Saints, according to Mr. <hi>W—m</hi>'s Scheme, have any Goodness infused into them by God, of any Kind. For in his Scheme, all that are morally sincere may lawfully receive the Privileges of visible Saints; But we have no Scripture-Grounds to suppose, that God will bless the Children of such Parents as have nothing more than moral Sincerity, with either common or saving Grace. There are no Promises of the Covenant of Grace made to such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, either concerning themselves, or their Children. The Covenant of Grace is a conditional Covenant; as both Sides in this Controversy suppose: And therefore, by the Supposition, Men have no Title to the Promises without the Condition. And as saving Faith is the Condition, the Promises are all made to <hi>that,</hi> both those which respect Persons themselves, and those that respect their Seed. As 'tis with many Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants or Bargains among Men; by these, Men are often entitled to Possessions for themselves and their Heirs: Yet they are entitled to no Benefits of the Bargain, neither for themselves, nor their Children, but by complying with the
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:006839_0156_102A677DDE2CE250"/>
Terms of the Bargain. So with Respect to the Covenant of Grace, the Apostle says (Act. ii.39.) <hi>The Promise is to you and to your Children.</hi> So the Apostle says to the <hi>Jaylor</hi> (Act. xvi.31.) <hi>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and Thou shalt be saved, and thy House.</hi> And we find many Promises, all over the Bible, made to the Seed of the Righteous, that God will bless their Seed for their sakes. Thus, Psal. cxii.2. <hi>The Generation of the Upright shall be blessed.</hi> Psal. lxix.35, 36. <hi>For God will save Zion;—The Seed also of his Servants shall inherit it; and they that love his Name shall dwell therein.</hi> See also <hi>Prov.</hi> xiv.26. <hi>Psal.</hi> ciii.17, 18. <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.28. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5, 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> vii.9.— Supposing these to be what are called indefinite Promises; yet do they extend to any but the <hi>Seed of the Righteous?</hi> Where are any such Promises made to the Children of unsanctified Men, the Enemies of God, and Slaves of the Devil (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> owns all unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Men are) whatever moral Sincerity and common Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they may have?</p>
                  <p>The Baptism of Infants is the Seal of these Promises made to the Seed of the Righteous: And on these Principles, some rational Account may be given of Infant-Baptism; but there is no Account can be given of it on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Scheme, no Warrant can be found for it in Scripture; for they are <hi>Promises,</hi> that are the Warrant for <hi>Privileges:</hi> But there are no Promises of God's Word to the Seed of morally sincere Men, and only Half-Christians.</p>
                  <p>Thus this Argument of Mr. <hi>W—ms's,</hi> let us take it which Way we will, has Nothing but what is as much, yea, much more, against his Scheme, than against mine.</p>
                  <p>However, if this were not the Case, but all the Shew or Pretence of Strength there is in the Argument, lay directly and only against <hi>Me,</hi> yet the Strength of it, if tried, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to prove Nothing at all. The pretended Argument, so far as I can find out what it is, is this; <hi>The Children of visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Saints are born in Covenant; and being already in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they must have a Right to the Privileges of the Covenant, without any more ado: Such therefore have a Right to come to the Lord's Supper, whether they are truly godly, or not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Shew of Argument there is here, depends on the Ambiguity of the Phrase, <hi>Being in Covenant:</hi> Which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:006839_0157_102A6780D2C71930"/>
two distinct Things: either (1.) <hi>Being under the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations Bonds of the Covenant</hi>; or (2.) <hi>A being conformed to the Covenant, and complying with the Terms of it.</hi>— A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subject of the Obligations and Engagements of the Covenant, is a Thing quite distinct from a being conformed to these Obligations, and so being the Subject of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Now 'tis not a being in Covenant in the former, but the latter Sense, that gives a Right to the Privileges of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. The Reason is plain, because 'tis Compliance and Conformity to the Terms of a Covenant, that is the Thing which gives Right to all the Benefits; and not meerly a being under Ties to that Compliance and Conformity. Privileges are not annexed meerly to Obligations, but to Compliance with Obligations.</p>
                  <p>Many that do not so much as visibly comply with the Conditions of the Covenant, are some of God's Covenant-People in <hi>that</hi> Sense, that they are under the Bonds and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of the Covenant; so were <hi>Corah</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; so were many gross Idolaters in <hi>Israel,</hi> that lived openly in that Sin; and so may Hereticks, Deists and Atheists be God's Covenant-People; They may still be held under the Bonds of their Covenant-Engagements to God; for their great Wickedness and Apostacy don't free 'em from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the solemn Promises and Engagements they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly enter'd into. But yet a being in Covenant, meerly in this Sense, gives 'em no Right to any Privileges of the Covenant. In Order to that, they must be in Covenant in another Sense; they must cordially consent to the Covenant: which indeed Mr <hi>W.</hi> himself owns, when he acknowleges, that in Order to come to Sacraments, Men must profess a cordial Consent to, and Compliance with the Conditions of the Covenant of Grace. <note n="*" place="bottom">If it be said here, Those who have been born of baptized Ancestors, tho' they don't comply with the Terms of the Covenant, are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in this Sense, that they have a Right to the Promises of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Conditionally,</hi> in Case they will hereafter comply: I answer, So are all Mankind in Covenant, God may be said to have bound himself to 'em all Conditionally; and many have these Promises declared to 'em, that still remain <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> or <hi>Heathens.</hi>
                     </note> And if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> inquires, Why those Children that were born in the Covenant, ben't <hi>cast
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:006839_0158_102A6784BA35EAA0"/>
out,</hi> when in adult Age they make no such Profession; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it as much concerns <hi>Him</hi> to answer, as Me; for 'tis as much his Doctrine, as mine, that they must profess such Consent.— But I am willing to answer nevertheless. — They are not cast out, because 'tis a Matter held in Suspense, whether they do cordially consent to the Covenant, or not; or whether their making no such Profession don't arise from some other Cause. And none are to be excommunicated, without some positive Evidence against them. And therefore they are left in the State they were in, in Infancy, not admitted actually to partake of the Lord's Supper (which actual Participation is a new positive Privilege) for Want of a Profession, or some Evidence, beyond what is meerly Negative, to make it visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they do consent to the Covenant. For 'tis reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expect some Appearance more than what is Negative, of a proper Qualification, in Order to being admitted to a Privilege beyond what they have hitherto actually received. A negative Charity may be sufficient for a negative Privilege, such as Freedom from Censure and Punishment; but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a negative Charity, is needful to actual Admission to a new positive Privilege.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XV. A particular Examination of Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Defence of the <hi>9th Objection,</hi> or that boasted Argument, that if it ben't lawful for <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted</hi> Men to come to the Lord's Supper, then none may come but they that <hi>know</hi> themselves to be converted.</head>
                  <p>THIS Argument has been greatly gloried in, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invincible. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> seems to have been alarmed, and his Spirits raised to no small Degree of Warmth at the Pretence of an Answer to it: And he uses many big Words, and strong Expressions in his Reply; such as, <hi>'Tis absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain—'Tis beyond my Power to comprehend, and I believe beyond the Power of any Man to tell me—This I assert &amp; stand
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:006839_0159_102A6789F89D39A0"/>
to—As plain as the Sun—A Contradiction of the Bible, of the Light of Nature, and of the common Sense of Mankind,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. But let us get away from the Noise of a Torrent, and bring this Matter to the Test of calm Reasoning, and examine it to the very Bottom.</p>
                  <p>Here let it be considered, wherein precisely the Argument consists.—If it has any Strength in it, it consists in this Proposition. <hi>viz. That 'tis not lawful for Men to come to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, without a known Right.</hi> This is the Proposition Mr. <hi>S.</hi> himself reduces the Argument to, in his <hi>Appeal,</hi> P. 62, 63. And 'tis very evident, that the whole Strength of the Argument rests on the supposed Truth of this Proposition.</p>
                  <p>And here let it be noted, what Sort of <hi>Knowledge</hi> of a Right Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and so Mr. <hi>W.</hi> mean in this Argument. 'Tis <hi>Knowledge</hi> as distinguished from such an <hi>Opinion,</hi> or <hi>Hope,</hi> as is <hi>founded on Probability.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>S.</hi> expresly insists, that a Man must not only THINK he has a Right, but he must KNOW it. (<hi>Appeal,</hi> P. 62.) And again, (P. 63.) He says, <hi>Probable Hopes won't warrant him to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> uses many peremptory strong Expressions (P. 109.) to set forth the Certainty of that which never was denied; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>a Man can't know he has a Right, unless he knows he has the Qualification which gives him a Right.</hi> But this is not the Thing in Question: The Point is, <hi>Whether a Man mayn't have a lawful Right, or mayn't lawfully come, and</hi> yet <hi>not know his Right, with such a Knowlege and Evidence as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Probability</hi>? This is the Thing asserted, and herein lies the Argument. And the Negative of this cannot be stood to and maintain'd, in Order to maintain Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Scheme, without the grossest Absurdity; it being a Position, which, according to Scripture, Reason, Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> Doctrine, and Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s own, effectually destroys his Scheme.</p>
                  <p>To this Purpose, I observed, If this Proposition be true, that no Man may come, save he which not only thinks, but <hi>knows</hi> he has a Right, then it will follow, that no uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Person may come, unless he <hi>knows</hi> that Doctrine to be true, <hi>That unconverted Men may have a Right.</hi> Because an unconverted Man can't know, that one in particular (<hi>viz.</hi> He himself) who is an unconverted Man, has a Right, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he knows that Doctrine which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> maintained, to be
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:006839_0160_102A678811DF16A8"/>
true, <hi>viz.</hi> That Men may have a Right, tho' they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted. And consequently no one unconverted Man may lawfully come to the Lord's Supper, unless he is so knowing in this Point of Controversy, as not only to think, and have probable Evidence, that this Opinion is Right, but <hi>knows</hi> it to be so.— Mr. <hi>W.</hi> endeavours to help the Matter by a Distinction, of different Kinds of Knowlege: And by the Help of this Distinction would make it out, that common People in general, and even Boys and Girls of 16 Years old, may with Ease know, that his Doctrine about unsanctified Men's lawful Coming to the Lord's Supper, is true. And we must understand him (as he is defending Mr. <hi>S—d</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) that they may know it with that Evidence that is distinguish'd from Probability; and this according to Mr. <hi>VV.</hi> himself, is <hi>Certainty</hi>; which he speaks of as above <hi>a Thousand Probabilities.</hi> (See P. 118. <hi>c.</hi>) But how miserable is this? to pretend, that his Doctrine about Qualifications for Sacraments, is so far from a disputable Point, that it is of such plain and obvious Evidence, to common People and even Children, that without being studied in Divinity, they may not only <hi>think</hi> it to be <hi>exceeding probable,</hi> but <hi>know</hi> it to be <hi>true!</hi> When it is an undeniable Fact, that Multitudes of the greatest Ability &amp; Piety, that have spent their Lives in the Study of the Holy Scriptures, have never so much as <hi>thought so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, I observed, that according to Mr. <hi>S—d's</hi> Doctrine, <hi>not one</hi> unconverted Man in the World can <hi>know,</hi> that he has <hi>Warrant</hi> to come to the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; Because, if he has any Warrant, God has given him Warrant in the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> And therefore if any unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, not only <hi>thinks,</hi> but <hi>knows,</hi> that he has Warrant from God, he must of Consequence not only <hi>think,</hi> but <hi>know</hi> the Scriptures to be the Word of GOD. Whereas, it was the constant Doctrine of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> That no unconverted Man <hi>knows</hi> the Scriptures to be the Word of God. <note n="*" place="bottom">I did not say, that it was also a Doctrine according to Scripture; for there was no Occasion for this, among those with whom I had chiefly to do in this Controversy; with whom I knew it was a Point as much settled and uncontroverted, as any Doctrine of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> whatever. And I knew it to be the current Doctrine of orthodox Divines; who ever allow this Doctrine to be implied in such Texts as those, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="156" facs="unknown:006839_0161_102A678BA2570FB8"/>
would make it out, that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> did hold, unconverted Men might <hi>know</hi> the Scriptures to be the Word of God; but only not know it with <hi>a gracious Knowlege, such as effectually bowed</hi> Men's <hi>Hearts, and influenced 'em to a gracious Obedience.</hi> (P. 113. <hi>b.</hi>) But let us see whether it was so, or not. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in his <hi>Nature of saving Conversion</hi> (P. 73.) says,
<q>The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Man is <hi>ignorant</hi> of the divine Authority of the Word of God;— His Wound is, that he <hi>don't know certainly</hi> the divine Authority of these Institutions; he <hi>does not know</hi> but they are the Inventions of Men.</q>
Again (<hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 74.) he says,
<q>The carnal Man is <hi>uncertain</hi> of those Things that are the Foundation of his Reasonings. He thinks, there is <hi>a great Probability</hi> of the Truth of these Things; but he has <hi>no Assurance.</hi> His Principles are grounded on an <hi>uncertain</hi> Proposition.</q>
And he observes (P. 20.)
<q>Men when converted, don't look on it as <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,</hi> that the Word is his Word, <hi>as they did before</hi>; but they <hi>have Assurance of the Truth of it.</hi>
                     </q>
— So elsewhere <hi>(Guide to Christ,</hi> P. 26.)
<q>They that have not Grace, <hi>don't properly believe</hi> the Word of GOD.</q>
— And in another Book (<hi>Safety of Ap.</hi> P. 6.)
<q>The Gospel always works ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually where it is <hi>believed, and received as the Truth of</hi> GOD.</q>
— In another Book <hi>(Benef. of the Gos.</hi> P. 149.)
<q>Common Illumination <hi>don't convince Men of the Truth of the Gospel.</hi>
                     </q>
— In his Discourse on the <hi>Vertue of Christ's Blood</hi> (P. 27.) speaking of such as have no Interest in the Blood of Christ, he says,
<q>They are <hi>Strangers</hi> to the divine Authority of the Word of GOD.</q>
Again (<hi>Ibid.</hi> P. 16.)
<q>
                        <hi>Before [i. e</hi> before saving Faith] they were <hi>at a Loss</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Word was the Word of GOD.</q>
— To the like Purpose are many other Passages in his Writings. (See <hi>Nat. of sav. Conv.</hi> P. 72. <hi>Safety of Ap.</hi> P. 6, 7, 99, 107, 186, 187, 229.— <hi>Benef. of the Gosp.</hi> P. 89.)</p>
                  <p>So that here, if it be true, that some unconverted Men have a divine Warrant to come to the Lord's Supper; and if the Thing which is the Foundation of this Argument, be also true, <hi>viz.</hi> That in Order to Men's warrantably coming to the Lord's Supper, they must not only <hi>think,</hi> but <hi>know</hi> they have a Right; then it must be true likewise, that they not only <hi>think,</hi> but <hi>know,</hi> that the Scripture, wherein this
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:006839_0162_102A678EDD8B08B8"/>
Warrant is suppos'd to be delivered, is the Word of GOD. And then we have the following Propositions to make hang together: That unconverted Men are <hi>ignorant of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's being the Word of God, are uncertain of it, have no As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of it, are not convinced of it, don't properly believe it, are at a Loss whether it be the Word of God, or not</hi>; and yet <hi>they not only think, but</hi> know, <hi>that the Scriptures are the Word of God, and that the Gospel,</hi> which is the Charter of all Christian Privileges, <hi>is Divine</hi>; they have a <hi>Knowlege</hi> of it, which is <hi>above all probable Hope or Thought,</hi> and attended with Evidence <hi>above a Thousand Probabilities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now let it be considered, whether this agrees better with Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi>'s own Doctrine, concerning Men's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth and divine Authority of the Gospel, in what has been before cited from his Sermons on <hi>Christ a King and Witness.</hi> Where he expresly says, That Man, since the Fall, <hi>is ignorant of divine Truth,</hi> and <hi>full of Prejudices against it; has a View of the Truth contain'd in the Bible, as a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uncertain Thing; receives it as what is probably true; sees it as a probable Scheme, and something likely to answer the End proposed:</hi> But that after Conversion <hi>it appears divinely true and real.</hi> (See P. 114, 115, &amp; 144.) <hi>Then</hi> unconverted Men only look'd on the Truth of the Word of God, as <hi>probable, something likely,</hi> yet as a <hi>doubtful, uncertain Thing</hi>; but <hi>now</hi> they <hi>not only think,</hi> but <hi>know it to be true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No Distinction, about the different Kinds of Knowlege, or the various Ways of knowing, will ever help these Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, or reconcile such Inconsistencies. If there be any such Sort of <hi>Knowing,</hi> as is contra-distinguish'd to probable <hi>Thinking,</hi> and to such Opinion as is built on <hi>a Thousand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities,</hi> which yet is consistent with being <hi>ignorant, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, being uncertain, not assured, not convinced, only look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Thing probable, looking on it doubtful and uncertain,</hi> it must certainly be a new &amp; very strange Sort of Knowlege.</p>
                  <p>But this Argument, that is so clear and invincible, must have such Supports as these, or must quite sink to the Earth. It is indeed a remarkable Kind of Argument. It is not only as much against the Scheme it is brought to support, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that which it would confute; but abundantly more so. For if it were the Case in Truth, that none might come
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:006839_0163_102A679326BBE0D8"/>
to the Lord's Supper, but they that <hi>know</hi> they have a Right, yet it would be no direct and proper Proof, that <hi>unconverted</hi> Men might come. It would indeed prove, that many <hi>godly</hi> Men might <hi>not</hi> come: Which, it is true, would bring some Difficulty on the Scheme <hi>opposed</hi>; yet would be no Proof against it. But it is direct and perfect Demonstration against the Scheme it would <hi>support:</hi> It demonstrates, according to the Scripture, and according to the Doctrine of those that urge the Argument, that not one unconverted Man in the World may lawfully come to the Lord's Supper; as no one of them certainly <hi>knows</hi> the Gospel to be divine, and so no one <hi>knows</hi> the Charter to be authentick, in which alone the Right of any to Christian Privileges is conveyed; Hence no one unsanctified Man is <hi>sure</hi> of his Right; and therefore (as they draw the Consequence) no one unsanctified Man may come to the Lord's Supper. And so it follows, that the more strongly Mr. <hi>W.</hi> stands to this Argument, the more peremptory and confident his Expressions are concerning it, the more violently and effectually does he supplant himself.</p>
                  <p>And this Position, <hi>That a Man must not take any Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, 'till he not only thinks, but knows he has a Right,</hi> is not only unreasonable, as used by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> against me, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is ten Times as much against himself; but 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable in it self, as it is an Argument, which if allowed and pursued, will prove, that a Man may do nothing at all, never move Hand or Foot, for his own Advantage, unless he first, not only <hi>thinks,</hi> but <hi>knows,</hi> it is his Duty. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself owns (P. 116.) that all the <hi>Duties,</hi> which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us in his instituted Worship, are <hi>Privileges,</hi> as well as the Lord's Supper: And so is every other Duty, which we are to do for our own Benefit. But all human Actions are, upon the whole, either <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evil</hi>: every Thing that we do as rational Creatures, is either a Duty, or a Sin; and the Neglect of every Thing that is our Duty, is forbidden. So that we must never so much as take a Step, or move a Finger, upon only a probable Judgment and Hope; but must first <hi>know</hi> it to be our Duty, before we do it: nay, we must neither move, nor voluntarily forbear to move, without a <hi>Certainty</hi> of our Duty in the Case, one Way or other!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="unknown:006839_0164_102A679616F3A410"/>As to its being <hi>alike difficult</hi> for Men to know or be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of their moral Sincerity, as of their real Sanctification, I shall speak to that under the next Head; whereby it will appear again, another Way, that this Argument is vastly more against Mr· <hi>W—m's</hi>'s Scheme, than mine.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XVI. A Consideration of Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Defence of the <hi>10th Objection,</hi> against the Doctrine of the Unlawfulness of <hi>unsanctified</hi> Men's coming to the Lord's Supper, That it tends to the great <hi>Perplexity</hi> and <hi>Torment</hi> of many <hi>godly</hi> Men in their Attendance on this Ordinance.</head>
                  <p>MY <hi>first</hi> Reply to this Objection was, that 'tis for Want of like Tenderness of Conscience, that the other Doctrine which insists on <hi>moral Sincerity,</hi> don't naturally bring such as are received on those Principles, into as great <hi>Perplexities.</hi>— Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> in his Animadversion upon it says,
<q>This is an Assertion which I take to be contrary to common Sense, and the Experience of Mankind; and the allowing of it to be true, must overthrow the Law of Nature, &amp; cast infinite Reproach upon the Author of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are strong Expressions; but let us bring the Matter to the Test of Reason.—The necessary Qualification, on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Principles, is moral Sincerity, and a <hi>certain Degree</hi> of moral Sincerity. For there is scarcely any Man, that lives under the Light of the Gospel, and is not an Atheist, or Deist, but what has <hi>some Degree</hi> of moral Sincerity, in some Things pertaining to Christianity and his Duty; some Degree of common Faith, some Degree of Conviction of the Need of Christ, some Desire of Him, and moral Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness, tho' from selfish Considerations, to be good; and some Purpose to endeavour a Conformity to the Covenant of Grace, and to seek Salvation on the Terms of it. But how shall a Man know, what is a <hi>sufficient Degree</hi> of these
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:006839_0165_102A679960A78710"/>
Things? Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has determined the Matter thus; That his Belief of the Doctrine of the Gospel, and moral Willingness to be conformed to the Covenant of Grace, must be <hi>with his</hi> WHOLE <hi>Heart,</hi> (P. 49. <hi>e.</hi> P. 5. <hi>c.</hi> 36. <hi>a.</hi>) And that his Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his undone State without Christ must be <hi>deep</hi>; And his Desire of Christ and his Benefits <hi>fervent,</hi> and his Purpose <hi>earnest,</hi> (P. 75. <hi>e.</hi> P. 11. <hi>c.</hi>) so as to induce him to enter into Covenant <hi>with</hi> ALL <hi>the Earnestness he can,</hi> and engage him to use Endeavours <hi>with</hi> ALL <hi>the Strength &amp; Power that he has.</hi> (P. 83. <hi>e.</hi> P. 32. <hi>d.</hi> P. 36. <hi>a.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Now, how exceeding <hi>difficult</hi> must it be for unsanctified Men to determine, with any Assurance, whether they have moral Sincerity to <hi>such a Degree?</hi>—How difficult for them to know, whether their Convictions are thus <hi>deep</hi>? Every one that is used to deal with Souls under Conviction, knows, that when they are indeed under deep Convictions, they are especially apt to complain of the <hi>Hardness</hi> of their Hearts, and to think their Convictions are <hi>not</hi> deep.—How difficult to determine, with any Assurance, whether their Assent rises so high, that they can truly be said to <hi>believe with all their Hearts</hi>? Whether their moral Willingness to be conformed to the Covenant of Grace, be <hi>with their whole Heart</hi>? And whether they are really engaged <hi>with all the Solicitude they can,</hi> and are willing to do <hi>all that they can</hi>? These Things, I am pretty sure, are of vastly more difficult Determination, than whether a Man has any true Holiness, or not. For in the former Case, the Determination is concerning the Degree of Things, that are capable of an infinite Variety of Degrees; some of which are nearer to, and others are further from, the lowest <hi>sufficient</hi> Degree: And consequently some of the Degrees that are not sufficient, may yet be very near; which renders the Matter of very difficult Determination; unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably more so, than when what is to be distinguished, is the <hi>Nature</hi> of Things, which <hi>in all Degrees</hi> is widely diverse, and even contrary to that which it is to be distinguish'd from: As is the Case between saving and common Grace; which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself acknowledges. <note n="*" place="bottom">See his Serm. on <hi>Christ a King and Witn.</hi> (P. 84. <hi>e.</hi>) where he says,
<q>Notwithstanding the <hi>visible Likeness</hi> of nominal and real Christians, there is a <hi>wide Difference,</hi> as there is between the Subjects of CHRIST, and the Slaves of the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </note> 'Tis more easy to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:006839_0166_102A679C92D1E2E8"/>
                     <hi>Light</hi> from Darkness, tho' there may be innumerable Degrees of Light, than to determine the precise <hi>Degree</hi> of Light: and so it's more easy to determine, whether a Man be alive, or dead, than whether there be exactly such a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Degree</hi> of Vigour and Liveliness.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>moral Sincerity,</hi> which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> insists on, is a most indeterminate uncertain Thing; a Phrase without any certain precise Meaning; and must for ever remain so. It being not determin'd, <hi>how much</hi> Men must be morally sincere; <hi>how much</hi> they must believe with a moral Sincerity; whether the deeply awakened and convinced Sinner must believe, that God is absolutely Sovereign <hi>with Respect to his Salvation,</hi> and that Christ is perfectly sufficient to <hi>save him in particular</hi>; and to what <hi>Degree</hi> of moral Assent &amp; Consent, he must believe and embrace these Things, and comply with the Terms of the Covenant of Grace; whether he must be willing to obey all God's Commands, the most difficult, as well as the most easy, and this in all Circumstances, even the most difficult that can arise in Providence; or whether only in some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; and what, and how many. The Scripture gives us many infallible Rules, by which to distinguish between saving Grace, and common: But I know of no Rules given in the Bible, by which Men may certainly determine this <hi>precise Degree</hi> of moral Sincerity. So that if <hi>Grace</hi> is not the Thing which gives a Right to Sacraments in the Sight of God, we have no certain Rule in the Bible, commensurate to the Understanding of Mankind, by which to determine when we have a Right, and when not. — Now let the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader judge, which Scheme lays the greatest Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for <hi>Perplexity</hi> to Communicants, of tender Consciences, concerning their Qualifications for the Lord's Supper; and whether this Argument drawn from such a supposed <hi>Tendency</hi> to such Perplexity (if there be any Force in it) is not vastly more against Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Scheme, than mine.</p>
                  <p>And here by the Way, let it be noted, that by these Things it is again demonstrated, that the <hi>ninth Objection,</hi> the great Argument considered in the preceeding Section, concerning the Necessity of a <hi>known Right,</hi> in order to a lawful Partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is exceedingly more against Mr. <hi>W—ms's</hi> Principles, than mine; In-as-much-as, on his Principles, 'tis so much more
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:006839_0167_102A67A0A78468C8"/>
difficult for Men to know, whether they have a Right, or have the prescribed Qualification, or not.</p>
                  <p>I answer'd this Argument in the <hi>second</hi> Place, by alledging, that this Doctrine of the Necessity of saving Grace in Order to a Right to the Lord's Supper, is not properly the <hi>Cause</hi> of the Perplexities of doubting Saints, in their Attendance on this Ordinance; tho' it may be the <hi>Occasion:</hi> But that their own <hi>Negligence</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> is the true Cause; and that this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is no more the Cause of these Perplexities, than the Doctrine of the Necessity of saving Grace in Order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the Cause of the Perplexity of doubting Saints when they come to <hi>die.</hi> Upon which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says, <hi>There is no Shadow of Resemblance of these Cases, because Death is no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,</hi> &amp;c. But if Death is no Ordinance, yet 'tis the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Duty of the Saints to <hi>yield themselves to the Lord,</hi> and <hi>resign</hi> to the Will of God, in their Death. And in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, the Cases are exactly parallel, that <hi>Perplexities</hi> are just so much the <hi>Consequence</hi> of the respective Doctrines, in one Case, as in the other; <hi>That is,</hi> the Perplexities of a doubting Saint on a <hi>Death-Bed,</hi> the Difficulty and Trouble he meets with in resigning himself to the Will of God in dying, is just in the same Manner the Consequence of the Doctrine of the Necessity of saving Grace in Order to eternal Salvation, as the Perplexities of a doubting Saint at the <hi>Lord's Table</hi> are the Consequence of the Doctrine of the Necessity of saving Grace in Order to a Right to the Lord's Supper. And this is sufficient for my Purpose.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself says, in his Answer to Mr. <hi>Croswell</hi> (P. 122. <hi>c.</hi>)
<q>Altho' there are comparatively few, that obtain Assurance; yet 'tis thro' their own <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Negligence,</hi> that they do not. We fully agree with Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> that a Man in this Life may ordinarily be infallibly certain of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
So Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> (in his Sermon on <hi>one good Sign</hi>—) says,
<q>There is no Necessity, that the People of God should lie under Darkness &amp; Temptation; they may obtain As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance.</q>
—Now, if this be the Case, then certainly there is no Justice in laying the Temptation &amp; Uneasiness, which is the Effect of Sloth &amp; Negligence, to the Doctrine I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in those that embrace it. 'Tis a wise Dispensation of God, that he has so ordered Things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Comfort in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:006839_0168_102A67A3E94E7680"/>
and in all Duties, and under all Providences, should be to be obtain'd in a Way of Diligence; and that Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness should be the Way to Perplexity and Uneasiness, and should be a Way <hi>hedged up with Thorns,</hi> agreable to <hi>Prov.</hi> xv.19.—That it is so ordered, is for the Good of the Saints, as it tends to turn them out of this thorny Path, into the Way of Diligence. And so this Doctrine, as it has this Tendency, has a Tendency in the End to that solid Peace &amp; Comfort, which is the happy Fruit of their holy Diligence. And that, and not the Saints Perplexity, is properly the Effect of this Doctrine.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XVII. Containing some <hi>further</hi> Observations on what is said by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in Support of the <hi>13th Objection,</hi> concerning God's <hi>commanding</hi> all the Members of the visible Church, that are <hi>not ignorant nor scandalous,</hi> to attend all <hi>external</hi> Covenant-Duties.</head>
                  <p>IT has been already demonstrated (<hi>Sect.</hi> 8<hi>th</hi> of this third Part) that in this Argument the Question is begg'd, notwithstanding what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has said to the contrary; which sufficiently overthrows the whole Argument. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, that I may pass by Nothing, which such as are on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Side, may be likely to think material; I will here make some further Observations on this Objection, as represented and supported by Mr. <hi>W.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chief Thing, that has the plausible Appearance of Argument in what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> say on this Head, is this; That <hi>for God to require all who are in Covenant to come to the Lord's Supper, and yet to forbid 'em to come unconverted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to suppose, that He both commands 'em and forbids 'em at the same Time.</hi> And this is thought to be the more manifest, in-as-much-as <hi>Conversion is not in Men's Power.</hi> Though it is not denied, but that God justly requires Men to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or to be truly holy. (See P. 129, 130.)</p>
                  <p>To this I would say,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) If when they speak of commanding and forbidding at the same Time, they mean God's commanding and
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:006839_0169_102A67A56F2D7BF0"/>
forbidding <hi>the same Thing,</hi> at the same Time, no such Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence follows from my Principles. For <hi>That</hi> Thing, and that only, which I suppose God requires of any, is to come to the Lord's Supper with a sanctified Heart; and that this God requires at <hi>all Times,</hi> and never forbids at <hi>any Time</hi>; And that to come without this Qualification, is what He <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> forbids, and <hi>requires at no Time.</hi> So that <hi>what</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, at the same Time he forbids something, is not the <hi>same Thing</hi> that he forbids; but a very different and contrary one: And 'tis no Absurdity, to suppose, that God requires one Thing, and forbids a contrary Thing at the same Time.</p>
                  <p>To illustrate this by an Example: It was the Duty of the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> openly to <hi>confess</hi> CHRIST, to own Him as the <hi>Messiah,</hi> at that Hour when he was led away to be crucified, and openly to testify their adoring Respect to him on that extraordinary Occasion. But yet they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and could not believe it (many of 'em at least) since they look'd on his present abject Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances as a Demonstration, that he was not the <hi>Messiah.</hi> It was beyond their Power, at least at once, in that Instant, to give their Assent, with all their Hearts, to such a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. Nor was it in their Power, to exercise an adoring Respect to Him: for, besides their strong Prejudices, most of them were judicially harden'd, and given up to a Spirit of Unbelief and obstinate Rejection of Him; as appears by that Account (Joh xii.39, 40.) <hi>Therefore they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, because that</hi> Esaias <hi>said again, He hath blinded their Eyes, and harden'd their Heart, that they should not see with their Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. (See also <hi>Luk.</hi> xix.41, 42. &amp; <hi>Matth.</hi> xiii.14, 15.) And yet it would have been unlawful for 'em to have made a lying Profession; to profess, that they believ'd him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and that they received and loved him as such, when at the same Time they hated him, and did not believe he was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> But here is no requiring and forbidding the same Thing at the same Time: for the only Thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them was, to have Faith and Love, and to testify it; which was not at all forbidden.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) None of the Difficulties, which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> or Mr. <hi>W.</hi> objects, either God's supposed requiring Impossibilities, or his requiring &amp; forbidding at the same Time, do follow, any more on <hi>my</hi> Principles, than on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:006839_0170_102A67A714AB7D18"/>
that God calls Men <hi>this Moment</hi> to enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, and commands them to do it. (P. 28. <hi>c.</hi>) One Thing implied in this, according to his own frequent Explanation of visibly entring into Covenant, is professing a Belief of the fundamental Doctrines of Christianity. Now therefore, we will suppose a Man to be a Candidate for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, who has been brought up in <hi>Arianism</hi>; and is strongly perswaded, that the Doctrine of the TRINITY is not true: Yet he is this Moment required to profess that Doctrine; but has no Ability in a Moment to believe the Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he don't at present see the Evidence of it. For as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself says (Serm. on <hi>Christ a King and Witn.</hi> P. 91. <hi>d, e.</hi> &amp; 92. <hi>a.</hi>)
<q>The Understanding can't be bro't to yield it's Assent to any Truth, which it does not see the Truth or apprehend the Evidence of.— If you would hire him with Cart-loads or Ship-loads of Gold and Silver; if you should imprison him, whip him, burn him; you can't make him believe a Thing to be true, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends to be incredible, or which he sees no sufficient Reason to believe.</q>
— Now therefore what shall the Man do, on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Principles? He is commanded to profess the Doctrine of the Trinity, which must be profess'd in Order to be lawfully baptized in the Name of the Trinity; and, on Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Principles, he is commanded to do it <hi>this Moment:</hi> Yet also on his Principles, if the Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses it, and is not morally sincere, or knows he don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, he is guilty of <hi>horrible Falshood and Prevarication</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which God doubtless forbids. Therefore here is certainly as much of an Appearance of Commanding &amp; Forbidding the same Thing at the same Time, as in the other Case.</p>
                  <p>Every Husbandman in <hi>Israel,</hi> that lived even in Christ's Time, was required to offer a Basket of the First-Fruits; and was commanded when he offered it, solemnly to make that Profession, concerning the principal Facts relating to the Redemption out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>—which is prescribed in <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvi.5,—10. <hi>A</hi> Syrian <hi>ready to perish was my Father,</hi> &amp;c. Now supposing there had been an <hi>Israelite,</hi> who did not believe the Truth of all these Facts, which came to pass so many Ages before, (as there are now many in <hi>Christendom</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who don't believe the Facts concerning <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>) and
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:006839_0171_102A67AB4A649178"/>
continued in his Unbelief, 'till the very Moment of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; God peremptorily requires him to make this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; yet none will say, that he may lawfully profess these Things, at the same Time when he don't believe 'em to be true. However, here is no commanding and forbidding the same Thing at the same Time: Because, tho' God required the <hi>Jews</hi> to make this Profession, yet the Thing required was <hi>to believe it</hi> and <hi>profess it.</hi> Tho' some might not believe it, nor be able for the present to believe it; yet this Inability arose from Depravity &amp; Wickedness of Heart, which did not at all excuse their Unbelief, for <hi>one Moment.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">This Instance may shew us, that God's requiring all <hi>Israel</hi> to enter into Covenant with God, and seal their Covenant in the Passover, will not prove, that it was lawful for any to avouch the Lord to be their God, and promise and swear they would perform universal and persevering Obedience, when at the same Moment they had no Love to God, and even then, while speaking the Words, continued in an habitual wilful Disobedience to God's Commands, and were willing Slaves to the Devil.— Nor will it follow, from these Commands given to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their covenanting with God, and sealing their Covenant, that God ever did, since the Foundation of the World, appoint or command any other covenanting with him, than as giving up themselves wholly and without Reserve, both Soul &amp; Body, both Heart and Life; or that ever he appointed or commanded any covenanting, wherein Men give a Part, and keep back a Part, give him the Out-side, and keep back the noblest and best Part, the Heart, Will and Affections, for Sin and Satan; or that there is any such Covenant of God in Being; or that such covenanting has not always been as much without Foundation in any Institution of God, as any of the spurious Sacraments of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; or that it has not always been strictly forbidden of God; or that it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely and in it self sinful and unlawful, as truly as the Act of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Now this may be laid down as a Truth, of easy and plain Evidence; <hi>If God may require what wicked Men, while such, are unable to perform, then he may also require those Things which are connected with it, and dependent on it, and which, if the other be done, they would be able to do, and might do, and without which they may not do it.</hi> So, if God may require an unsanctified Man to love him, then he may require him to testify &amp; profess his Love, as I suppose Christians do in the Act of partaking of the Lord's Supper; and yet it not be lawful for him to testify &amp; profess Love, when he has it not.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HO' I am not now your Pastor, yet having so long stood in that Relation to you, I look on my self obliged, notwithstanding all that has of late pass'd between us, still to maintain a special Concern for your spiritual Welfare. And as your present Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appear to me very evidently attended with some peculiar Dangers, threatning the great Wounding of the Interest of vital Religion among you; which probably most of you are not well aware of: I look on my self called to point forth your Danger to you, and give you Warning. What I now especially have Respect to, is the Danger I apprehend you are in, from the Contents of that Book of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> to which the foregoing Performance is a Reply; which I perceive has been written and publish'd very much by your Procurement &amp; at your Expence; and so (it may naturally be supposed and expected) is dispers'd in your Families, and will be valued, and much made use of by you as a Book of great Importance. What I have Respect to, is not so much the Danger you are in of being established by that Book in your former Principles, concerning the Admission of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (tho' I think these Principles are indeed very opposite to the Interest of true Piety in Churches;) But what I now mean is the Danger there is, that while you are making much of that Book as a Means to maintain Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Doctrine concerning the Terms of Communion, You, and especially
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:006839_0173_102A67AF94C5CF60"/>
your Children, will by the Contents of it be led quite off from <hi>other</hi> religious Principles and Doctrines, which Mr. S. brought you up in, and always esteemed as of vastly greater Importance, than his particular Tenet about the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and be naturally led into Notions and Principles, which <hi>He</hi> ever esteemed as of fatal Tendency to the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>By the Way, I would have it observed, that when I take Notice of these Things in his Book, my Aim is not to beget in you an ill Opinion of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> as tho' he were as corrupt in his settled Persuasion, as one would be ready to think, if we were to judge only by Things delivered in <hi>some Parts</hi> of this Book; and especially if it should be supposed, that he embraced all the <hi>Consequences</hi> of what he here maintains. Men often don't see or allow the plain Consequences of their own Doctrines. And therefore, tho' I charge very pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Consequences on some <hi>Things</hi> he says, yet I don't charge <hi>Him</hi> with embracing these Consequences: Nor will I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to explain how it could come to pass, that he should maintain Things now in <hi>this</hi> Book, in Opposition to me, which are so contrary to the good and sound Doctrines he has formerly delivered in <hi>other</hi> Books. Let that be as it will, and however orthodox the Principles may be, which he more ordinarily maintains; yet the <hi>ill</hi> &amp; <hi>unsound</hi> Things he delivers here, may do never the less Hurt to you &amp; your Children, who may read this Book without having in View the more wholesome Doctrines of his other Writings.</p>
            <p>For Instance, You have ever been taught, that <hi>unconverted Men don't really believe the Gospel, are never truly convinced of its Truth</hi>; and that 'tis of great mportance that Sinners should be sensible of the Unbelief and Atheism of their Hearts. But contrary to this, Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Book abundantly teaches you and your Children this Notion, <hi>That unsanctified Men may really be convinced of the divine Truth of the Gospel, and believe it with all their Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have been ever taught, that Christless Sinners, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when under some more slight Awakenings, are very ready to flatter themselves that they are willing to accept of Christ as their Saviour; but that they must be brought off from their vain Imagination, and be brought to see that the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:006839_0174_102A67B291511718"/>
Fault is in their own Wills, and that their not being interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Christ is owing to their Obstinacy and Perversness, and wilful wicked Refusal of God's Terms; on which Account they are wholly inexcusable, and may justly be cast off by God. But contrary to these Things, this Book of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> abundantly teaches you, that Men, in an unconverted State, may indeed <hi>cordially consent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, may comply with the Call of the Gospel, may submit to it's Proposals, may have Satisfaction in the Offer God makes of himself as our God in Christ, may fall in with the Terms of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation propounded in the Gospel, and renounce all other Ways, and may sincerely and earnestly desire Salvation in this Way; and that some unconverted Men are not wilful obstinate Sinners.</hi> (P. 21. <hi>b.</hi>) Which Doctrines, if embraced and retain'd by your Children as true, will tend forever to hinder that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the Opposition and Obstinacy of the Heart, which Mr. <hi>Stod</hi> ever taught you to be of such Importance in Order to the Soul's Humiliation, and thoro' Conviction of the Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of God in it's Damnation.</p>
            <p>You have ever been taught, that the Hearts of natural Men are wholly corrupt, entirely destitute of any Thing spiritually Good, not having the least Spark of Love to God, and as much without all Things of this Nature, as a dead Corpse is without Life: Nevertheless, that 'tis hard for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be convinced of this; that they are exceeding prone to imagine, there is some Goodness in 'em, some Respect to God in what they do: Yet that they must be brought off from such a vain Conceit of themselves, and come to see themselves utterly depraved and quite dead in Sin.— But now this Book of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> leads you to quite other Notions; it leads you to suppose, that some natural Men are <hi>above Lukewarmness in Religion,</hi> that <hi>they may truly profess to be the real Friends of Christ, and to love God, more than his Enemies, and above the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a Doctrine greatly inculcated on you by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> as supposing it of great Importance for all to be convinced of it, That natural Men <hi>are not subject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be</hi>; that they never do truly serve God, but are wholly under the Dominion of Sin and Satan.—But if Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners believe Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Book, they won't be convinced of
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:006839_0175_102A67B7A462BA50"/>
these Things; nay, will believe quite contrary Things, <hi>viz.</hi> That Sinners, while in a State of Nature, may <hi>have a cordial Subjection to Jesus Christ,</hi> and may <hi>be subject to him with all their Hearts,</hi> and may <hi>be so devoted to the Service of Christ as to be above those that serve two Masters,</hi> may <hi>give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be taught, ruled, and led by him in a Gospel-Way of Salvation,</hi> and may <hi>give up all their Hearts and Lives to him.</hi>— And is it likely, while Sinners believe these Doctrines of Mr. <hi>W.</hi>— that they will ever be brought to a thorough Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, in a Conviction of their being wholly under the Power of Enmity against God? Which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> taught you to be of such great Importance.</p>
            <p>You know, it was always a Doctrine greatly insisted on by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> as a Thing of the utmost Consequence, that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who are seeking converting Grace, should be thoro'ly sensible of God's being under no Manner of Obligation, from any Desires, Labours, or Endeavours of theirs, to bestow his Grace upon them; either in Justice, or Truth, or any other Way; but that when they have done all, God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at Liberty, whether to shew them Mercy, or not; that they are wholly in the Hands of God's Sovereignty. (See <hi>Guide to Christ.</hi> P. 75. <hi>c, d.</hi> &amp; <hi>Benef. of the Gosp.</hi> P. 64. and P. 75, 76.)— Whereas, if a Sinner seeking Salvation believes Mr. <hi>W—ms</hi>'s Book, it will naturally lead him to think quite otherwise. He (in P. 28.) speaking of such Sincerity and Earnestness of Endeavours as may be in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men, to qualify 'em to come to the Sacrament, and of the great Encouragement God has given, that he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow his saving Grace on such as use such Endeavours, adds these Words (near the Bottom of the Page)
<q>God never will be worse than his Encouragement, nor do less than he has encouraged; And he has said, <hi>To him that hath shall be given.</hi>
               </q>
Naturally leading the awakened Sinner, who is supposed to have moral Sincerity enough to come to the Sacrament, to suppose, that God is not wholly at Liberty; but that he has given so much Encouragement, that it may be depended upon he will give his Grace; and that it would not be reasonable or becoming of God to do otherwise; because if God should do so, he would <hi>be worse than his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,</hi> and would not fulfil that Word of his, <hi>To him
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:006839_0176_102A67B98BB0FF08"/>
which hath shall be given.</hi> And how will this tend effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to prevent the Sinner's looking on God as absolutely at Liberty, and prevent his resigning himself wholly into the Hands of God, and to his sovereign Pleasure?</p>
            <p>It is a Doctrine which has ever been taught you, &amp; made Use of for the warning, awakening and humbling of Gospel-Sinners, That they have greater Guilt, and are exposed to a more terrible Punishment, than the <hi>Heathen.</hi>—But this is spoken of by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> as an unsufferable Treatment of <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Saints:</hi> Naturally tending to alleviate and smooth the Matter in the Consciences of those that are not scandalous Persons, tho' they live in Unbelief and the Rejection of Christ under Gospel-Light and Mercy.</p>
            <p>If you will believe what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> says (P. 56.) Those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Epithets</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> in the Epistles of the Apostles, which you always, from the first Foundation of the Town, have been taught to be peculiar and glorious Expressions and Descriptions of the blessed Qualifications and State of true Saints, and Heirs of eternal Happiness; such as <hi>being elected, chosen before the Foundation of the World, predestinated to the Adoption of Children through Jesus Christ; quickened, and made alive to God,</hi> tho' once dead in Trespasses &amp; Sins; <hi>washed, sanctified, justified;— made to sit together in heavenly Places in Christ; begotten again, to an Inheritance incorruptible, undefiled</hi>; — with innumerable others the like:— I say, if you believe Mr. <hi>W.</hi> you have been quite mistaken all your Days, and misled by all your Ministers; these Things are no more than were said of the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> even in their worst Times! Which is (as I have observed) exactly agreable to the strange Opinion of Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that Author who has so corrupted Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in <hi>N. England.</hi> Thus you are at once deprived of all the chief Texts in the Bible, that hitherto have been made Use of among you, as teaching the discriminating Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Privileges of the truly pious, and the Nature and Benefits of a real Conversion; too much paving the Way for the Rest of <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Scheme of Religion, which ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly explodes the Doctrines you have been formerly taught concerning eternal Election, Conversion, Justification; and so, of a natural State of Death in Sin; and the whole Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:006839_0177_102A3A4BDBE70160"/>
of Original Sin, and of the mighty Change made in the Soul by the Redemption of Christ applied to it.</p>
            <p>And this, taken with those other Things which I have observed, in Conjunction with some other Things which have lately appear'd in <hi>Northampton,</hi> tend to lead the young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among you apace into a Liking to the new, fashionable, lax Schemes of Divinity, which have so greatly prevail'd in <hi>New-England</hi> of late; as wide as the East is from the West, from those great Principles of Religion, which have always been taught, and have been embraced, and esteemed most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and have justly been accounted very much your Glory by others.</p>
            <p>If this Book of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> with all these Things, is made much of by you, and recommended to your Children, as of great Importance to defend the Principles of the Town, how far has your Zeal for that one Tenet, respecting natural Men's Right to the Lord's Supper, transported you, and made you forget your Value and Concern for the most precious and important Doctrines of Jesus Christ, taught you by Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> which do most nearly concern the very Vitals of Religion!</p>
            <p>I beseech you, Brethren, seasonably to consider how dark the Cloud is that hangs over you, and how melancholy the Prospect (especially with Regard to the rising Generation) in many Respects. I have long been intimately acquainted with your religious Circumstances, your Notions &amp; Principles, your Advantages &amp; Dangers; having had perhaps greater Opportunity for it than any other Person on Earth.— Before I left you, it was very evident, that <hi>Arminianism,</hi> and other loose Notions in Religion, and Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s in particular, began to get some Footing among you; and there were some Things special in your Circumstances, that threaten'd a great prevailing of such like Notions: which if they should by Degrees generally prevail, will doubtless by Degrees put an End to what used to be called saving Religion.</p>
            <p>Therefore let me intreat you to take the friendly Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I now give you, and stand on your Guard against the encroaching Evil. If you are not inclined to hearken to Me, from any remaining Affection to one whose Voice and Counsels you once heard with Joy, and yielded to with great
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:006839_0178_102A67C06F29F598"/>
Alacrity; yet let me desire you not to refuse, as you would act the Part of Friends to yourselves &amp; your dear Children.</p>
