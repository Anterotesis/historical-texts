            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                           <p>To the committee appointed for the relief of the ſick and poor, afflicted with the prevailing malignant diſeaſe.</p>
                           <p>The committee appointed to the care of the orphans <hi>Report,</hi> that on the 19th September, they engaged a houſe belonging to William Ralſton, in fifth ſtreet, for the accommodation of the orphans under the care of the committee: and on the ſame day they engaged Mary Parvin as Matron, and placed thirteen children under her care; and between that time and the 13th October fourteen more were added to their number.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="81" facs="unknown:027501_0082_0FD491A8DBFE9C58"/>
That from the frequent applications for admiſſions, it was neceſſary to procure a more commodious place, which, by direction of the committee they obtained. This houſe was formerly occupied, and is now known by the name of the Loganian Library: it is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of John Swanwick, Eſq. and although it was rented to a perſon who then occupied it, the exertions of that Gentleman ſoon prevailed, and we obtained poſſeſſion, with the concurrence of the tenant, on the 1ſt Inſtant.</p>
                           <p>Your committee further <hi>Report,</hi> that from that time to the preſent, they have employed three men and ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en women to aſſiſt the matron.</p>
                           <p>That they have agreed with Doctor Samuel Duffield to viſit the houſe, and afford ſuch medical aid as may be neceſſary; and they doubt not but from the well-known character of this Gentleman, that due attention will be paid to ſuch caſes as may require his aſſiſtance.</p>
                           <p>That the children have now become ſo numerous, that notwithſtanding additional buildings have been erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the purpoſes of waſhing, &amp;c. they found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to add another room of about 30 feet by 14, which it is expected will ſoon be completed.</p>
                           <p>That from the firſt eſtabliſhment of this inſtitution to this day, there hath been one hundred and fifty nine children admitted, forty three of whom are now out at nurſe, who appear to be well taken care of; thirty one have been delivered to their relations or friends, eight have died, viz. ſix of thoſe who were at nurſe and two in the houſe; ſeventy ſeven remain in the houſe and are in general healthy and cheerful.</p>
                           <p>That your committee are perfectly ſatisfied with the conduct of the matron, as well as of thoſe who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed under her direction.</p>
                           <p>

It may not be improper to remark; that many of the children have not loſt both their parents; but when one of them is deceaſed, and the other ſick, it has been the uniform practice of the committee to admit the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into the houſe.</p>
                           <p>The committee will only add, that they keep regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar minutes of their proceedings, which are always o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the inſpection of the members of the general committee</p>

which as men, and citizens of the ſame common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we are all under to afford each other every aſſiſtance in our power, they requeſt that you would ſuffer them to ſhare the honors of benevolence, and partake with you in the offices of ſocial affection—The exemption of their particular diſtrict from the dreadful calamity which now afflicts your devoted city, far from creating an indolent or unfeeling ſecurity, ſuggeſts to their minds only the idea of what ought to be expected from them and every other citizen of our hitherto proſperous community on this lamentable occaſion; for they can conceive no more acceptable method of teſtifying their thankfulneſs to the All-wiſe diſpoſer of human events, for his particular mercy towards them, than by entertaining a proper tenderneſs for the ſufferings of their fellow-men, and a chearful readineſs to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the dominions of diſtreſs—They would alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider themſelves as having rejected all regard for the ſocial tie, if, whilſt members of other ſocieties are voluntarily coming forward with offers of aſſiſtance, they ſhould be remiſs in their endeavours to alleviate the miſery of our fellow citizens—Under theſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions a number of the inhabitants of Bucks County con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened upon public buſineſs, joined by others whom a common principle of benevolence had aſſociated with them, came to certain reſolves, a copy of which will be found incloſed, for the purpoſe of procuring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for the ſick, and poor inhabitants of Philadelphia.

<pb n="88" facs="unknown:027501_0089_0FD49181C33117C8"/>
and taken every ſtep in their power to execute the charge entruſted to them; and they are happy to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the committee of Philadelphia that ſuch is the general diſpoſition of the inhabitants of the county, that they are confident their donations will do no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit to their charity towards the diſtreſſed, or their affection for their fellow citizens—The monies collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will be lodged with the treaſurer of the county, and wait the order of the committee of Philadelphia. What we wiſh principally at preſent is, that you would inform us of the place where, and the perſons to whom you would wiſh the payments to be made; A letter therefore upon this head directed to the chairman of the committee will meet with due attention—In the mean time be aſſured that we are the friends of our fellow citizens, and particularly of thoſe who are in diſtreſs: And may the great Ruler of the univerſe who ever chaſtens with the tenderneſs of 2 parent, look with compaſſion upon the ſufferings of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and put a period to their afflictions—We remain, worthy fellow citizens with eſteem and ſincerity,</p>

That Stephen Girard, Matthew Carey, Iſrael Iſrael, James Kerr, John Letchworth, John Haworth and John Connelly, be a committee to meet the aſſiſtant commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, for the purpoſe of deviſing a plan for cauſing the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral houſes in the city which have been ſhut up, and particularly thoſe wherein perſons have died, to be opened and cleanſed.</p>
               <p>The ſaid committees having met,—the committee of this board returned with a <hi>Report,</hi> which being read, was adopted, and is as follows.</p>
               <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                  <p>The inattention of a number of the inhabitants, in whoſe houſes the late diſorder hath prevailed, in not opening and cleanſing them, agreeably to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations frequently repeated, hath induced this committee in conjunction with the aſſiſtant commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee to enter into the following reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolved,</hi> that it is highly expedient to have all houſes and ſtores in the city and liberties, wherever the malignant fever prevailed, purified and cleanſed as ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily and compleatly as poſſible: and to have all thoſe well aired, which have been cloſed for any length of time; and that it be recommended to the citizens to have unſlacked lime thrown into their privies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolved,</hi> that the members of theſe committees will exert themſelves, in their ſeveral diſtricts, to have the foregoing reſolve carried into effect; and that where the diſtricts are too large for the reſpective members, they be hereby empowered to call in ſuch reſpectable characters to their aſſiſtance, as may be neceſſary, and who may be diſpoſed to co-operate in this buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolved,</hi> that when any perſon whoſe houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be cleanſed, and who is able to defray the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences thereof, ſhall refuſe or neglect to comply with
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:027501_0118_0FD491CC07649400"/>
the requiſition of the members appointed to carry theſe reſolves into effect, he or they ſhall be reported to the next Grand-Jury, for the city or county, as ſupporting a nuiſance dangerous to the public welfare.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Which being approved was directed to be publiſhed in the Papers, and fifteen hundred hand-bills, with the names of the aſſiſtant committee, be printed, and paſted up through the city.</p>
               <p>Joſeph Good was this day admitted into the orphan-houſe.</p>

                  <p>After the long continued diſtreſs with which our city hath been afflicted, the committee have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to congratulate their fellow-citizens upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of as great a degree of health, they unanimouſly believe, as uſually prevails at this ſeaſon of the year.</p>
                  <p>They have heard of no new caſes in the malignant fever for many days; and they have great reaſon to ſuppoſe that there will not remain any veſtige of it in the city or ſuburbs after a few days.</p>

reports to the contrary have been circulated, which upon inveſtigation have proved to be falſe.</p>
                  <p>Purifying the houſes where the diſorder hath been, is eſſentially neceſſary to prevent future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The committee think it incumbent upon them to repeat to their fellow-citizens, and to urge in the moſt preſſing manner, the performance of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant duty.</p>
                  <p>Clothing, either for the body or beds, which hath been made uſe of by the ſick, and more particularly for thoſe who have died of the diſorder, ſhould be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, baked, buried or deſtroyed. The loſs which would attend a total deſtruction, will not, it is hoped, be put in competition with the life or health of an individual, much leſs with thoſe of the community.</p>

                     <p>The committee for the relief of the ſick and poor of the city of Philadelphia, in reply to the ſeveral que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries propoſed to them by the Governor, anſwer;</p>
                     <p>To the firſt:</p>
                     <p>That the malignant diſorder, by which ſo many of our citizens have been taken off, made its firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance about the latter end of July, in Water Street.</p>
                     <p>Its ravages were for ſome time confined to that ſtreet, between Mulberry and Saſſafras ſtreets; from thence it extended northwardly up Water ſtreet to Vine Street. Front ſtreet, within the above limits, was next attacked, whence it ſpread into the parallel ſtreets, up thoſe which run Eaſt and Weſt; the greateſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voc being neareſt the river Delaware, and becoming
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:027501_0129_0FD4921B85444058"/>
more feeble in its progreſs to the Weſtward; this will more clearly appear from the account of the number of houſes, &amp;c. in the different ſtreets, lanes and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ys in the city and ſuburbs, hereunto ſubjoined.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond:</p>
                     <p>The committee have procured pretty accurate liſts from the ſeveral burial grounds in and about the city, of the interments from the firſt day of Auguſt to the ninth day of November; from theſe it appears that Four thouſand and thirty one perſons, of all ages, ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and diſorders, have been buried during that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod:</p>
                     <p>It is impracticable to diſcriminate the number taken off by the malignant diſorder, no accounts having been kept by the ſextons, or other perſons, to whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtering of burials was committed, except in two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, viz. in the burial grounds belonging to Chriſt-Church and St. Peters.</p>
                     <p>There are no data from which the committee can form a calculation as to the number of thoſe who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been afflicted with the diſorder, have recovered.</p>
                     <p>The committee have received into their care ſince the commencement of the diſorder, one hundred and ninety one children, who have either loſt one or both of their parents and the ſurvivors being ſick or ſo much reduced in circumſtances as to render the attention of the committee abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>The whole number admitted into the orphan-houſe, and the preſent ſtate of it is as follows, viz.</p>
                     <p>Admitted one hundred and ninety one: Died ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen: Returned to their friends forty nine: There remain one hundred and twenty five, of which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:027501_0130_0FD491DED2FB0DF8"/>
there are in the houſe eighty one, and of infants at nurſe forty four.</p>
                     <p>The committee are ſo much affected by the ſituation of the orphans under their care, that they beg leave to recommend them in a particular manner to the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor's notice.</p>
                     <p>To the Third:</p>
                     <p>At the firſt appearance of the diſorder the general conſternation was ſo great, that thoſe whoſe particular province it was to take care of the poor, knew not how to act; terror ſoon put them all to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>light, except three, whoſe exertions merit the higheſt encomiums; worn down with fatigue, a call was made upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent citizens to come to their aid, a meeting of a few took place, who voluntarily offered their ſervices in the dangerous undertaking. A ſecond meeting was obtained, when a committee conſiſting of twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven perſons was appointed the majority of whom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the taſk, but from death and other cauſes the buſineſs was principally conducted by twelve only. This committee formed themſelves into ſub-commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees to whom different parts of the buſineſs was aſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—One of which undertook the extreme hazardous part of attending at and managing the hoſpital at Buſh-Hill; Another to receive applications for the removal of the ſick to the hoſpital, and of burying the dead.</p>
                     <p>The great increaſe of deaths ſoon left a number of children without parents or friends to whom to apply for protection; ſome of thoſe were found in the houſes from whence their parents had juſt been remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſilent grave, deploring their loſs in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt agonies of diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>

A committee was appointed to provide a houſe for their reception; a matron and nurſes were employed.</p>
                     <p>As the effects naturally reſulting from the accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated diſtreſs of the more indigent citizens, many of them were reduced to ſuch a ſituation as to require im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſupplies of the neceſſaries of life.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe another committee was appointed, who have for ſeveral weeks paſt daily diſtributed to about two hundred families, for one week's ſupport, of the following articles, which have amounted upon an average to four hundred and forty loaves of bread, fifteen cords of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ood, one hundred and fifty dollars in money, per day, beſides meat, meal, vegetables, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A number of citizens undertook to act as an ASSIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANT COMMITTEE in recommending ſuitable objects for thoſe ſupplies.</p>
                     <p>The whole amount of diſburſements for the various objects already mentioned is not leſs than Twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars; the particulars, cannot yet be aſcertained with preciſion.</p>
                     <p>To the Fourth:</p>
                     <p>The charitable contributions already received in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney amount to Twenty two thouſand dollars. Some of our fellow-citizens, individuals of the committee, before it was known that one dollar would be contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted by donations, borrowed upon their perſonal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Bank of North America, ſix thouſand five hundred dollars; others of our fellow-citizens have ſince ſigned a guarantee to that bank, to make good the amount of fifteen thouſand dollars, if the committee ſhould have occaſion for further loans.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:027501_0132_0FD491E04B7DB238"/>
The committee having thought it a meaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely requiſite in order to purify the city from the latent infection, that reſpectable citizens ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to undertake the trouble of going to every houſe where any perſon had been ſick, or in which any had died of the diſorder, to recommend it to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors, to cauſe them to be opened and thoroughly cleanſed.</p>
                     <p>The Gentlemen who had before undertaken to act as an ASSISTANT COMMITTEE, cheerfully added this to their labours; they have made conſiderable progreſs in the buſineſs, and by their exertions will undoubtedly execute it in the moſt ſatisfactory manner, as far as their influence can extend. There are ſome refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſons who either inſenſible of the danger to which themſelves and their fellow citizens may be expoſed from a non-compliance, or from obſtinacy, occaſion ſome difficulty. It is hoped that this, as well as prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er means to cauſe all infected clothing, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially beds and bedding, to be purified or deſtroyed, will attract the Legiſlative attention.</p>
                     <p>The precautions neceſſary to be taken to guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſimilar calamity in future, will require much conſideration. The committee are of opinion that a health-officer, upon a more extenſive plan than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is of the greateſt importance, and that the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the officer and phyſicians ſhould be at a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance below the city.</p>
                     <p>That a healthful ſpot for the ſite of an hoſpital, nearly contiguous to the city, eaſily acceſſible by land and water, together with requiſite buildings for the accommodation of thoſe who may be attacked by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:027501_0133_0FD4921E812F8338"/>
diſorders in future, are among the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary means for the purpoſe of prevention.</p>
                     <p>From the want of ſuch a place, to which the ſick might have been removed, at an early period of the late diſorder, may be aſcribed the great terror which incapacitated the inhabitants from giving that aſſiſtance to their fellow-citizens, by which many hundred lives might have been ſaved.</p>
                     <p>The increaſing trade of the city, and the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people who are daily arriving from all parts of the world, expoſe us to every ſpecies of infection that prevails in other places, the neceſſity of efficient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures being immediately taken to guard againſt future dangers become therefore indiſpenſible.</p>

               <p>The committee appointed to wait upon the ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the French Legation <hi>Report,</hi> that they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to their appointment, informed him of the terms on which the ſick and wounded, under his care, were to be accommodated at the hoſpital, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances on which the committee hold that place, and which he muſt be ſubject to; to which he fully agreed and expreſſed himſelf well ſatisfied with the attention of the committee towards theſe afflicted people; and in addition to the terms ſtipulated, it was further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:027501_0147_0FD4923146207758"/>
that four dollars per man be allowed for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment of all the French people who may die at that place.</p>
               <p>Thirteen barrels of flour were received from the inhabitants of Manheim townſhip, Lancaſter county, accompanied by a letter from Martin Mayer, which was anſwered.</p>
               <p>As the buſineſs of the committee is drawing to a cloſe, it was conſidered as an indiſpenſible duty that compenſation be made for the uſe of the property, which hath been accupied by our afflicted fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, as an hoſpital at Buſh-Hill: The ſubject was again brought before the committee, and after fully conſidering the circumſtances of the buſineſs, it was <hi>Agreed,</hi> that the proprietor be preſented with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars for the time it hath been occupied as an hoſpital, and until the 25th day of March, 1795. As there are fears exiſting in the minds of ſome of our fellow-citizens that the diſeaſe may again make its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the ſpring; and there being at preſent no proviſion made for the accommodation of ſuch as may be afflicted with malignant diſorders, it was thought adviſeable that endeavours be made to retain the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of re-occupying that place, for the like purpoſe. The committee, to whom is entruſted the management of this buſineſs, are requeſted to uſe their endeavours to effect the object of the committee.</p>
               <p>It was further agreed that the committee appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate five hundred dollars for repairs of ſaid hoſpital; which may now be preſented to the proprietor, ſhould it be more agreeable to him to make the repairs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; if not, that it be reſerved in truſt for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                     <p>As a manager of the Hoſpital at Buſh-Hill and the one who organiſed that inſtitution, I think that as we are advancing toward the moment of cloſing the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs intruſted to our care by our fellow-citizens, it is my duty to ſtate to you my ideas upon that ſubject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the following manner:</p>
                     <p>FIRST. That the managers ſhall not admit into the Hoſpital any patients to become chargeable to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, except thoſe who may have an order of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the committee, and the managers ſhall alſo take proper ſteps to reduce as much as poſſible the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of ſaid Hoſpital.</p>
                     <p>SECOND. The convaleſcents, old, aged or infirm perſons, now in the hoſpital, ſhall be immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="unknown:027501_0164_0FD49C5D8DB92348"/>
THIRD. The ſick in the Manſion-houſe ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care of until they are fit to be diſcharged or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved with ſafety.</p>
                     <p>FOURTH. Two or more members of the committee ſhould be appointed to wait on the Miniſter of the French Republic, with directions to give him notice of the approach of our diſſolution, and to requeſt him to provide a place for the reception of his ſick now in the Hoſpital at Buſh-Hill, and alſo to aſk of the ſaid Miniſter the payment of a bill handed to him by the committee, which is ſtill unpaid.</p>
                     <p>FIFTH. That the committee will take into their conſideration the ſervices which Mrs. Mary Saville, matron of ſaid Hoſpital, has rendered to our ſick bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in that inſtitution, and make to this valuable woman ſuch compenſation as they ſhall think adequate to her merit.</p>
                     <p>SIXTH. That a ſufficient ſum of money be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately borrowed, either from the banks or private ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, in the name of the committee, for the purpoſe of paying and diſcharging every debt, &amp;c. relative to the Hoſpital of Buſh-Hill, and contracted by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee ſince the 16th of September laſt.</p>
                     <p>SEVENTH. At the period of the diſſolution of the Hoſpital—an inventory of every article belonging to it ſhould be made, and after having cleanſed the houſe, goods and furniture, that the goods ſhould be ſtored, together with the drugs, medicine, &amp;c. belonging to the apothecaries and doctors department, in one or more rooms of the Manſion-houſe under lock.</p>

                           <p>HAVING been appointed a Committee on the 14th of September laſt, at a meeting of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, called by the Mayor, for the purpoſe of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating the ſufferings of our fellow-citizens, who were labouring under the afflicting ſickneſs, which then prevailed; we have requeſted your attendance, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der briefly to report to you our proceedings; referring you for more particular information to our minutes, which are in the preſs, and to our accounts, now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for your inſpection.</p>
                           <p>Upon entering on the duties of our appointment, we found many families of the poor ſtruggling under diſeaſe and want. And that the houſe of William Hamilton, at Buſh-Hill, which had been taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, and converted into an hoſpital, for their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, contained ſeveral ſick perſons in a deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation. Two of our members offering their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to ſuperintend that inſtitution, they were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed managers thereof, and by their exertion and attention it was conducted with order and regularity. About one thouſand perſons were removed to it (in carriages provided for the purpoſe) and ſupplied with every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, to render them comfortable, that the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the times and our ſituation would admit of.</p>
                           <p>Notwithſtanding the great mortality which prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, we think ourſelves warranted in the belief, that much diſtreſs was prevented and the ſufferings of many greatly alleviated. We cannot with propriety omit informing you, that the tenderneſs and care ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by Mary Savill (the matron of the hoſpital) to the ſick, were ſuch as intitles her to your generous no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="186" facs="unknown:027501_0187_0FD49C42B48E0678"/>
The extreme diſtreſs to which many families were reduced rendering it impoſſible for them to procure the interment of their deceaſed connections, it became one of our moſt preſſing duties to provide for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of ſuch perſons, and therefore we procured coffins and carriages, and employed ſuitable perſons to attend to this mournful part of the ſervice.</p>
                           <p>In the progreſs of the diſeaſe, many children were bereft of their parents, and the general diſtreſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting individuals from attending to their expoſed ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations, we were impelled to take charge of ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, and of courſe it became neceſſary to provide a a ſuitable houſe, with a matron and attendants and a number of wet nurſes This was done and the whole placed under the direction of four of our members eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appointed for that purpoſe: of one hundred and ninety-two of theſe helpleſs innocents, who came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our care, ninety-four have been reclaimed by their friends, twenty ſeven have died, and ſeventy-one yet remain; on whoſe behalf we have applied to the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, but as they have not come to a determination on our application, we therefore earneſtly recommend theſe orphans to your immediate attention.</p>
                           <p>The calamitous ſtate of the city cauſed an univerſal ſtagnation of buſineſs and increaſed the number of the indigent ſo much, that in order to obtain a knowledge of their real ſituation and guard againſt impoſition, in relieving their wants, we found it neceſſary to call for aſſiſtance; when a number of reſpectable inhabitants of the city and ſuburbs came forward to our aid, under the title of the Aſſiſtant Committee, who rendered very eſſential ſervice by recommending ſuitable objects; which facilitated the diſtribution of money, proviſions
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:027501_0188_0FD49C7B663449E8"/>
and firewood, from the 14th October to the 23d No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, to upwards of one thouſand families, weekly.</p>
                           <p>Theſe different operations requiring conſiderable funds, and the major part of the overſeers of the poor, as well as moſt of the officers of government and police being removed; recourſe was had to the preſident and directors of the bank of North-America, who cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accommodated us with ſix thouſand five hundred dollars; which we have been enabled to repay by the ſubſequent liberality of our fellow citizens of this and other ſtates, whoſe donations to us have amounted to twenty nine thouſand and eighty five dollars ſeventy ſeven cents, beſides which we have received 5316 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, 32 cents, for ſundries mentioned in our accounts; which ſums fall ſhort of that expended by us, three thouſand two hundred and forty five dollars twelve cents.</p>
                           <p>The mode of ſupplying this deficiency you will doubtleſs conceive to be a part of the buſineſs of the preſent meeting.</p>
                           <p>As no public proviſion is made in caſe we ſhould be viſited with a ſimilar affliction (to which all great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial cities are expoſed) it was deemed eſſential, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compenſating the proprietor of Buſh-Hill for the uſe made of his property, to ſecure a reſort to it again, ſhould it be found neceſſary, before the 25th of March, 1795; this was done and it is ſtill in our poſſeſſion—wherein are depoſited ſuch articles as remain on hand belonging to the Hoſpital. The appropriation of theſe articles is an object which will claim your attention.</p>
                           <p>The conſideration of the propriety of eſtabliſhing an Hoſpital in the neighbourhood of this city, for perſons afflicted with infectious diſeaſes, which at the time of our appointment was referred to us, would have claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                           <p>We think it proper to inform you, that on the 13th day of October, a number of ſick and wounded French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men arrived here, on board the ſhip Citizen of Marſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
