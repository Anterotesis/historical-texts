            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>First, We must venture our <hi>Quiet,</hi> for the People of God. It was the Speech of a Gallant Man, in 2 Sam. 11.11. <hi>The Ark and Israel and Iudah abide in Tents, and my Lord Ioab, and the Servants of my Lord are Enc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> our own Repose, when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God and His People shall call us forth. Many <hi>Pains,</hi> many <hi>Toyls,</hi> and all the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Fatigues of <hi>Business,</hi> must be Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, without Reluctancies, when the People of God are to be served; and we should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000537_0014_0FA6B46A06B27270"/>
our soft Beds, our full <hi>Tables,</hi> and our Fine <hi>Hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,</hi> for the sake thereof. We should engage in the Service of our Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' there should be two <hi>Hankerchie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

We may not, for the Love of <hi>Ease,</hi> decline the doing of what is to be done for the Interest of God, and of His People.</p>
            <p>Again, We must venture our <hi>Estate</hi> for the People of God. It is Recorded for the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Reputation of those well-disposed men, in 2 Cor. 8. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>y,</hi> or <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,</hi> as it may be rendred. Many persons can do nothing in a way of Service for the People of God, because they say, <hi>They are poor.</hi> Nay, but our extreamest <hi>Poverty</hi> should not hinder our <hi>Liberality,</hi> When God and His People are to be served with what we have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whatever <hi>Simplicity</hi> the Wity and Crafty and Gripple Hold fasts of the World, may imagine in it. We should not grumble at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Expences</hi> which the Service of God and His People is to be maintained with; and tho' we have no more than <hi>Two Mites</hi> to give, we should part with more than <hi>One</hi> of them, rather than his Interest should meet
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000537_0015_0FA6B46DC8BC34C0"/>
with any prejudice.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we must venture our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> for the People of God. It was an Act for which <hi>Moses</hi> is for ever <hi>Honourable,</hi> in Heb 11.24, 25. <hi>He Refused to be called, The Son of</hi> Pharaohs Daughter, <hi>choosing rather to suffer Affliction, with the People of God.</hi> Tho' we may arise to never so much Grandeur, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Preferment, by overlooking the Service of God and His People, we should think <hi>Little</hi> of the <hi>Grandeur,</hi> and rather trample upon such Dignity and Preferment. Tho' our Titles may be, <hi>Reverend,</hi> or <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful,</hi> or <hi>Honourable,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Rightly</hi> so too; nevertheless we should think it no <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> to us, that the People of God m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st be served by us. We are swoln with the <hi>vainest Air,</hi> if we count our selves too B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gg to do what is bespoke for the Interest of those that we should be <hi>Benefactors</hi> unto, if we would not unworthily pretend to be <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> over them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we must venture our <hi>Friends</hi> for the people of God. The Lord General of <hi>Israel</hi> had a dear and a kind <hi>Brother,</hi> to whom nevertheless he said, as in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10, 11, 12. <hi>Be of good Courage, let us play the men for our People: and the Lord do that which seemeth Him good.</hi> Tho it be a <hi>Brother,</hi> yea, and somewhat nearer than a <hi>Brother</hi> that we must

            <p>IT having been a thing too sensible and obvious to escape the Observation of all who are not wholly strangers in our <hi>Israel</hi>; that this poor Land has laboured under a long <hi>Series</hi> of Afflictions and Calamities, whereby we have suffered successively in our precious and pleasant Things, and have seen the anger of the righteous God against us, expressed in Characters, which ought to be as terrible as they must needs be visible unto us; it having also, both by the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> undeniable; that a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:000537_0050_0FA6B4A46F3772B8"/>
of Manners attended with inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Degeneracies</hi> and <hi>Apostasies,</hi> found in too many of this People, is the cause of that Controversie, which the God of our Fathers has, for many years maintaining with us: It being likewise at this day, such a <hi>Probation time</hi> with all <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> as this Countrey has never before seen from the first foundation of it, and the judgments of that Holy God, who hath beheld how incorrigible we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been under all His Dispensations, now arriving to such an extremity, That the <hi>Ax is laid to the Root of the Trees,</hi> and we are in imminent danger of perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if a speedy <hi>REFORMATION</hi> of our <hi>Provoking Evils</hi> prevent it not:</p>
            <p>This COURT have therefore thought it needful to praeface their other Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the Publick Welfare, with a very solemn Admonition unto this whole People, that they every where give De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of a thorough <hi>Repentance,</hi> without which we have little reason to hope for any good success in our Affairs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is Ordered, that the Laws
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:000537_0051_0FA6B4A48D91A9D0"/>
of this Colony against <hi>Vice,</hi> and all sorts of <hi>Debauchery</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness</hi> (which <hi>Laws</hi> have too much lost their edg by the late Interruption of the Government) be now faithfully and vigorously put in Execution; Particularly the <hi>LAWS</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Blasphemy, Cursing, Prophane Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lying unlawful Gaming, Sabbath break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Idleness, Drunkenness, Vncleanness,</hi> and all the Enticements and Nurseries of such <hi>Impieties.</hi> Together with all other the wholsome <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> agreeable to the present Circumstances of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; by the Execution whereof, we may approve our selves <hi>a peculiar People, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as all Persons are hereby warned to avoid those <hi>Vices</hi> which these <hi>Laws</hi> are designed for the Prevention and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of (the <hi>Lovers</hi> of, and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> for, such Iniquities, being among the principal <hi>Troublers</hi> of their Countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) So all inferiour <hi>Officers</hi> are enjoyn'd to perform their Duty in finding and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Offenders against the aforesaid <hi>Laws,</hi> and withal to give notice to such
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:000537_0052_0FA6B4A543BC3CE0"/>
Offenders that they must expect the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of an <hi>Exemplary Punishment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that no attempt towards <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> may want that Assistance which all good men will be willing to give the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reunto, 'tis hoped that the Ministers of God will to the publick Reading of this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> adjoyn their own fervent Labours, not only for the Rebukeing and Suppressing of those <hi>Provoking Evils,</hi> which are marked for common Hatred: but also to witness against the more <hi>Spiritual Sins,</hi> which fall not so much under the cognizance of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Laws,</hi> namely, such as <hi>Vnbelief, Worldliness, Heresy, Pride, Wrath, Strife, Envy,</hi> and the <hi>Neglect</hi> of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, in both Natural and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted <hi>Worship,</hi> and the <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>everlasting Gospel,</hi> with a shameful want of due <hi>Family-Instruction,</hi> which are the <hi>Roots of Bitterness</hi> in the midst of us.</p>
            <p>Moreover, after the Example of <hi>Pious Rulers</hi> commended in Sacred Writ; the <hi>Churches</hi> every where are hereby advised to give utmost Encouragement unto the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000537_0053_0FA6B4A61FC8B030"/>
Faithful and Watchful <hi>Pastors</hi> of their Souls; to seek (where they <hi>lack</hi>) a full Settlement and Enjoyment of such <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> as the Lord Jesus Christ has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Edification; to reflect seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and frequently on their <hi>Covenants,</hi> to sharpen their <hi>Discipline</hi> against those that <hi>walk disorderly</hi>; and immediately to compose their <hi>Differences</hi> and <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (if <hi>such</hi> there be) whereby any of them may be distempered and enfeeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that so they may become <hi>Terrible as an Army with Banners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore it is Expected that the several <hi>Towns</hi> within this Jurisdiction do speedily furnish themselves with all fit means for the good <hi>Education of Youth,</hi> and take special care to avoid <hi>Factions</hi> &amp; <hi>Quarrels</hi> in their other <hi>Town Affairs</hi>; and all Plantations are strictly forbidden to continue without the Advantages of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Word</hi> of God constantly preacht unto them, or without a Sincere and Active Industry, to obtain the Presence of the Lord Christ in all His blessed <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:000537_0054_0FA6B4A889CF4E88"/>And Finally, this whole People are hereby advertised, that if these <hi>Essayes</hi> for an universal Reformation, shall be obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted (as those in the dayes of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iosiah</hi> were) by Mens being <hi>settled on their Lees,</hi> and <hi>hating to be Reformed,</hi> they can reasonably look for no other issue than this, that the jealous God <hi>will punish them yet seven times more for their iniquities:</hi> But, that if the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shall grant unto them the Grace to <hi>Remember whence they are fallen, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and do the first Works,</hi> it will give a greater Prospect of <hi>Prosperity,</hi> than can arise from the best <hi>Counsels,</hi> and biggest <hi>Armies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Work of <hi>Reformation</hi> thus <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,</hi> is now <hi>recommended</hi> unto the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Almighty, with whom alone it is, to Recover a Backsliding people; perswading our selve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
