            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IT is far from being the Deſign of this Pamphlet to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate private Characters, or to inflame the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Reader, by any bitter, perſonal Invectives. The Author intends nothing more, than to lay before the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic a fair and impartial State of Facts; and ſubmits the Propriety of the Concluſions drawn from thoſe Facts, to the cool Determination of every unbiaſſed Underſtanding. The Editor moſt heartily concurs with the Author, in wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a due Attention to the ſeveral Conſiderations here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuggeſted, may ſerve to convince the unprejudiced, that the Oppoſition of the</hi> Colonies <hi>to certain Meaſures, did not owe its Riſe to any Diſaffection to the Mother Country, or Diſloyalty to their Sovereign—that it may alſo prevent the undue Influence of Miſrepreſentation—and prove, in ſome Degree, the happy Occaſion of tempering the Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Parliament, with an equitable Reſpect to the Claims of paſt Services; and a candid Regard to the Jealouſies and Reſentments, natural to a People who
<pb facs="unknown:013177_0003_0F92916163DB94A8"/>
are deſcended from</hi> Britiſh <hi>Anceſtors, who have ſtruggled ſo hard, fought ſo gloriouſly, and bled ſo freely, to procure and defend their civil and religious Liberties. That ſo the Honour of his Majeſty's Crown may be moſt effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, his Name endeared to his</hi> American <hi>Subjects, and the Union, mutual Affection, and Proſperity of</hi> Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>and the</hi> Colonies, <hi>be happily reſtored, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed upon the moſt honourable Baſis.</hi>

            <head>A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE RISE, PROGRESS, SERVICES AND SUFFERINGS, OF NEW-ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>AMERICA, <hi>New-England</hi> in particular, was firſt ſettled by a pious People from <hi>England,</hi> who were not allowed to worſhip their Maker according to his Inſtitutions, in their native Country, without the Mixture of human Inventions. Animated therefore by the beſt of Principles, they were ſpirited to attempt a Settlement at a Diſtance from <hi>Britain,</hi> that ſo they might enjoy a Worſhip purely Scriptural, and leave the ſame to their Poſterity. They accordingly provided all Things neceſſary for their Removal, at their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and ſailed for an unknown Country. Their firſt Arrival was at <hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> which is ſituated in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay;</hi> and they ſat down at a Place they call <hi>New-Plymouth,</hi> utterly unknown, and in the advance of Winter. Wherever they turned their Eyes, the utmoſt Diſtreſs ſurrounded them: Fatigued with their boiſterous Voyage, diſappointed of their expected Country, <hi>Virginia;</hi> without any Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of human Succour, without the Help or Favour of <hi>England,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Patent, without a Promiſe of their religious Liberties, without
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013177_0005_0F9291655DA858A0"/>
convenient Shelter from the Weather, and their Hardſhips almoſt beyond the Power of Language to deſcribe. Clambs, Oyſters, and Lobſters were their daily Food; their Cloathing ſoon became Rags and Skins of Beaſts; their Proſpects on the Sea were extenſive, but afforded no Relief; on the Land their Views were limited to a few Rods, by a Wilderneſs altogether in the Dreſs of uncultivated Nature. Their only Neighbours, the moſt ſavage, cruel and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty of all the human Race, over numbered them a Thouſand to One, and were united to deſtroy them while few and weak. Theſe are a Few of the numberleſs Sufferings which attended their firſt Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements; ſo that, in leſs than five Months after their Arrival, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half the Company died; yet the Survivors bore all their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes with a chriſtian Fortitude and Patience, as extraordinary as their Trials. "Brown Bread and the Goſpel is good Fare," they uſed to ſay to one another, for their mutual Encouragment to Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Endurance. Thus they were carried on, and ſoon began to encreaſe in Numbers; ſo that when the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va-Scotia,</hi> diſturbed them, they raiſed an Army in 1690, under Sir WILLIAM PHIPPS, and took that Fort, and therewith the whole Country of <hi>Acadia,</hi> which was afterwards ceded to the <hi>French,</hi> at the Treaty of <hi>Ryſwick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Year the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> raiſed three Thouſand Men, to make an Attempt upon <hi>Canada,</hi> but failed of Succeſs; after having ſuſtained the Loſs of a Thouſand Lives, and the Expence of fifteen Thouſand Pounds.</p>
            <p>About eighteen Years after they made another Attempt againſt <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> but had not the former Succeſs.</p>
            <p>Near the ſame Time, Queen ANNE ſignified her royal Intention to reduce <hi>Canada;</hi> and making the ſame known to the <hi>New-England<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> they acceded to every Meaſure with great Alacrity; but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did not proceed on the Deſign.</p>
            <p>The next Year, <hi>New-England</hi> raiſed an Army, and took <hi>Port-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> with the Aſſiſtance of only five Hundred <hi>Britiſh</hi> Troops; ſince which Time the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Province, by the Vigilance of their late
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013177_0006_0F929166266529A0"/>
Governor SHIRLEY, in ſending Provincial Troops to their timely Aſſiſtance, has ſaved that Fort two or three Times from falling into the Enemy's Hand; and it is owing to their Aid that it is now in the Hands of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> together with the whole Country of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va-Scotia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after, they raiſed more than their Quota, in the unfortunate Expedition againſt <hi>Canada,</hi> under General HILL; and ſuſtained a great Loſs of Men, together with an heavy Expence.</p>
            <p>In 1703, <hi>Jamaica</hi> being threatened with an Invaſion, applied to <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> for Help; the Inhabitants of that Province raiſed two Companies, and ſent them under the Command of Colonel WALTON and Captain LARAMORE; which timely aid arrived ſafe to the Iſland, but very few of them ever returned to their own Country.</p>
            <p>In 17740, they raiſed many Hundred Men, and made an Attempt upon the Iſland of <hi>Cuba;</hi> but failing of Succeſs, moſt of thoſe Men were unhappily buried on that Iſland.</p>
            <p>In 1745, the <hi>New-England</hi> Provinces ſet on foot an Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> under General PEPPEREL; and raiſed three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five Hundred Men, who were embarked on board a ſufficient Number of Tranſports, with Proviſions, Artillery, and every Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a Campaign, guarded by a Number of armed Ships. In this important Buſineſs they were ſucceſsful. <hi>Great-Britain</hi> knew nothing of this Attempt, neither did any other Colony afford any Aſſiſtance; nor was there any, except from Admiral WARREN, who came from the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> with four Ships of War, and joined the Fleet before <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> when the Conqueſt was half compleated; ſo that he did not fire a Gun at any of the ſtrong Fortreſſes of the Enemy; and the City of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> together with the Iſlands of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> and <hi>St. John's</hi> ſurrendered to the <hi>New-England</hi> Forces. And although the Land and Sea Forces went forth as equal Adventurers (according to a previous Agreement at <hi>Boſton)</hi> yet when a great Treaſure, <abbr>viz.</abbr> a <hi>French</hi> Ship from the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> two <hi>French</hi> Ships from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and ſeveral other Ships of immenſe Value (which put into <hi>Louiſbourg</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:013177_0007_0F929166A2B521C0"/>
to recruit in their way Home) fell into our Hands by Means of this Capture; the Admiral ordered them to <hi>England</hi> for Condemnation, and the Property was all divided among the King's Ships, and not one Farthing of it was ever enjoyed by the <hi>New-England</hi> Troops; except a ſmall Sum which Capt. FLETCHER received after near as much expended in his Application to obtain it. Thus, by Means of this Undertaking of <hi>New-England,</hi> double, if not treble the Caſh was brought into <hi>England,</hi> that ever <hi>England</hi> paid for this important Piece of Service; and the Conqueſt itſelf was very ſoon after given up to the <hi>French,</hi> to buy a Peace for the <hi>Dutch. New-England</hi> was indeed paid the Expence of this Expedition by the Crown; but at ſuch a low Rate, that many were ruined in their Fortunes. The Benefit of all theſe Conqueſts accrued to this Nation, and <hi>New-England</hi> was obliged to ſet down where it began, with this Difference only, that they loſt nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Hundred of their beſt Men.</p>
            <p>In 1746, <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſet on foot an Expedition againſt Canada. <hi>New-England</hi> was deſired to raiſe its Quota of Men, and a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence was incurred for that Purpoſe; but Weſterly (ſome ſay, <hi>F—h</hi>) Winds blew ſo hard, and ſo long, on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ports, that the Fleet deſtined for that Service did not get out of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and this Expedition came to nothing. Here it may be mentioned, that near the ſame Time, the Duke <hi>D'Anville, </hi> with about 20 Sail of <hi>French</hi> Ships of the Line, was ſuffered to approach the Coaſt of <hi>New-England,</hi> undiſturbed; though he came to revenge the taking of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> and the Reduction of <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> by the <hi>New-Englanders.</hi> Divine Providence was pleaſed to interfere; the Fleet was ſcattered, and only a few Ships returned to <hi>France,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done <hi>New-England</hi> no Damage, except putting them to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Expence in watching their Motions, and preparing to give them a proper Reception; and making Captures of a Number of the Fiſhing Veſſels.</p>
            <p>During the laſt War, <hi>New-England</hi> at every call, raiſed its Quota of Men, and joined the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Troops. The Numbers raiſed, and the Chearfulneſs with which they were raiſed, will hardly find Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013177_0008_0F9291678454EEB8"/>
in the Annals of Hiſtory. And although at the Beginning of the War, through a Miſtake in Meaſures, the Nation met with great Diſcouragement, and was almoſt ready to fall a Prey into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Hand; yet no ſooner was that great Miniſter (yet living) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Helm of national Affairs, and the beſt and moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Officers appointed to command the Troops, but it ſet <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in Triumph. Every Meaſure propoſed, was adopted; and, as one Inſtance, the Maſſachuſetts Province raiſed ſeven Thouſand Men to ſerve in one Campaign, and paid and cloathed them; beſides three Thouſand more which were, at the ſame Time, in pay on their own more immediate Service. All theſe together amounted to a Fourth Part, of all the Men in the whole Province, capable of bearing Arms. In this ſpirited Manner they proceeded, until the War was finiſhed; which ſwept away a large Proportion of their fighting Men, and involved the Province in a Debt, which will not be paid in fifty Years.</p>
            <p>It may now be enquired, how <hi>New-England</hi> behaved under all the Sufferings and Services before-mentioned? Did they deſpair? No. War was almoſt their continual Employment, when the Mother Country was at Peace, us well as when it was at War. From their firſt Arrival to the End of the laſt War, ſcarce a Village was ſettled, but what was broken up once, or oftner by the Savages. Men, Women, and Children, whole Families, Villages and Towns, were murthered, ſcalpt, and captivated, and their whole Subſtance committed to the Flames. It may be ſaid with Truth, that moſt of the inland Towns were once or twice, ſoaked with the Blood of their Inhabitants. Did they Murmur at being thus oppreſſed, while wholly neglected by the Nation? No. Did they grow diſaffected to the national Intereſt? The contrary to all this was manifeſt. They loved and revered the Nation to a Degree of Exceſs and Enthuſiaſm. New Glory to the Crown, new Acquiſitions of Territory, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Wealth to <hi>England,</hi> were ever as much a Source of Joy to <hi>New-England,</hi> as to the Nation itſelf: And every Misfortune that befel the Parent Country, as deeply affected the <hi>New-England</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013177_0009_0F929168211B43F8"/>
However ſtrange this may ſeem, it is an undoubted Truth. If the Nation proſpered, they fought with reiterated Vigour, and bore Hardſhips with Patience and Fortitude; nay, ſuch was their Sincerity, and the Strength of their Affections and Regard for the Mother Country, that the News of any dark Cloud gathering over <hi>England,</hi> would moſt viſibly ſink their Spirits and diſtil in Tears. On ſuch Occaſions, the adverſe Aſpect of Affairs was the melancholy Topic of their Conſultations at the General Court; and whether any thing could be done by them to prevent the approaching Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, became the principal Object of their Attention. If you went into their Churches, they would be often found Praying, Faſting, and Weeping, that the impending Evil might be averted; and the fame was obſervable in private Families.</p>
            <p>Thus they went on, from Year to Year, and from Age to Age, with an invincible Attachment to a Country, to which, beſides Love, they owed nothing but a dear bought Charter, and the Birth of a few of their Fore-Fathers.</p>
            <p>It may now be conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of what Advantage <hi>New-England</hi> is to the Mother Country, more eſpecially above the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands, conſidering the Charge the Nation, has been put to, to ſecure and defend them ſeparately. At firſt Glance, the Difference is nearly, as Something is to Nothing; at leaſt, till the Commencement of the laſt War. What numerous Fleets and Armies have, at all Times, been employed in the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands, both in Peace and War? Who can tell the Millions Sterling, thoſe Iſlands have coſt the Nation, to ſecure, protect, and defend them? Even in a Time of general Peace, an Expedition muſt be ſet on foot, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a few <hi>Caribbs</hi> (of late) <hi>St. Vincent's;</hi> the very Thought of which creates a Bluſh. <hi>New-England</hi> has, for all that Time, been <hi>intirely</hi> left to its own Fate. In common there was not ſo much Sea Force, as would amount to an armed Long-Boat, provided at the Coſt of the Crown; not a ſingle Officer, or private Man in Pay of the Crown (till ſince the laſt Peace) though the War was ever ſo hot, and Danger ever ſo threatning. God alone appeared to be the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013177_0010_0F92916B22B79A90"/>
Guardian of <hi>New-England,</hi> and carried the Inhabitants through the many Difficulties which attended their Struggle, under the Auſpices of his gracious Providence—a Struggle, which has raiſed, as it were, an Empire to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown, and a vaſt Fund of Wealth and Glory to the Nation.—Rivers of Blood were laid in the Foundation, at the ſole Expence of the Inhabitants of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great Numbers of <hi>New-England</hi> Men are trained up to the Sea, in Fiſhing Veſſels, and on other Voyages; ſo that it is a good Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery for the Royal Navy. The Refuſe of their Fiſh, together with all Kinds of Proviſions, Horſes and Lumber, they carry to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> without which the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> could not make Sugar, &amp;c. ſo cheap as they now do. And ſhould <hi>New-England</hi> ſtop the Trade to the Iſlands, a Plantation there would hardly be worth Acceptance, if the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> muſt be ſupplied with Proviſions from <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beſt Sort of Fiſh is ſent to <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi> and the <hi>Straits;</hi> the neat Proceeds of which are remitted to <hi>England</hi> in Caſh. Oil, Bone, Maſts for the Royal Navy, Timber of all Kinds (which is now ſent home in Rafts) Ships of every Kind, Pot-Aſh, Furrs, &amp;c. &amp;c. (many of which <hi>England</hi> was obliged to other Nations for, before <hi>New-England</hi> was knows) are the immediate Exports to <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> In return for all, they receive the Manufactories of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby give Bread to Thouſands of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects. Thus all their Labour centers in <hi>England,</hi> excepting their daily Food.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt, that ſome of the moſt northern Colonies (eſpecially <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay)</hi> while the national Debt has been contracting, have been at almoſt an infinite Expence of Blood and Treaſure, to defend themſelves; and in a Number of Inſtances, to carry their Arms into the Enemies Country, by which his Majeſty's Service has been greatly promoted for a Century paſt, until the Commencement of the laſt War. With a very little Help from <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> Colonies only, they have been the grand Barrier of many of his Majeſty's other Colonies on the Continent; at leaſt ſo much, that it may be affirmed, had they not exerted themſelves, more than all the other Colonies together, with the Nation's Aſſiſtance, the laying Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013177_0011_0F92916C305667A8"/>
on the Colonies had been a needleſs Buſineſs ſeventy Years ago, LOUIS the 14th of <hi>France,</hi> who firſt projected the Conqueſt of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> might have accompliſhed his Deſigns, if <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> had not effectually covered the whole Country. <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> (both of them Royal Governments) were by their Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſomewhat expoſed. As to the former, their Trade and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> gave them great Advantage, in turning the Heat of the War from their own Doors, to thoſe of <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay.</hi> Reſpecting the latter, near a Fourth part of <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts</hi> Province, was added to <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> and after this Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Territory, which was ſo much expoſed to the Enemy, and which <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> was unable to defend; the Province of <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay,</hi> at a very great Expence, defended it for them; <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> has not yet paid one Farthing of the Expence, although Application was made to <hi>England</hi> for that Purpoſe, and Reſtitution was promiſed, or elſe that the Territory ſhould be returned; neither of which Promiſes hath ever been performed.</p>
            <p>Let us now inquire, whether <hi>New-England</hi> hath not a juſt Right to expect ſome peculiar Advantages, as the Fruit of their Sufferings, Services, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt, have they not Reaſon to expect, and an unqueſtionable Right to claim, a national Confidence in their future Attachment to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt? This is a Queſtion of great Importance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they had good Reaſon and clear Right to expect this Opinion from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> then every oppreſſive Meaſure is unjuſt, arbitrary and cruel. And if it be conſidered, how unnatural any Oppreſſion of our fellow Subjects muſt be, who have given ſuch unparallelled Evidence, of their Adherence to the national Good; and how likely to introduce Diſtraction, and beget Diſtruſt and Diſaffection, ſurely, common Prudence will direct a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Miniſter to avoid or Repeal ſuch impolitic Ruinous, and oppreſſive Meaſures.</p>
            <p>Again, have they not both Reaſon and Right to expect ſome <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> Advantages, particularly ſuch, as were not balanced, much leſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013177_0012_0F92916CA4908CC8"/>
over-balanced, by any pecuniary Advantages? Doth not the Loſs of fourteen or fifteen Thouſand Men (which they ſuſtained during the laſt War) beſides a very heavy Debt yet remaining, after twelve Years Taxes, to the Amount of at leaſt four Shillings in the Pound, deſerve ſome Compenſation, at leaſt ſuch as will place them on an equitable Adjuſtment with the other <hi>American</hi> Provinces.</p>
            <p>Again, have they not good Reaſon to expect, as all their Labour centers in <hi>England,</hi> that it ſhould excuſe them from being taxed, to pay the national Debt? eſpecially while they Support a Government of their own. And that all Taxes ſhould be laid conſiſtently with <hi>Britiſh</hi> Liberty, and be void of all Partiality, no juſt Man can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deny. Ought not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation to reſt ſatisfied, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, with the ſame Kind of Services from them, as from his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's other Subjects? This is certain, they have done as much for the national Glory, and have exulted in it. Why then, ſhould they not ſhare in the ſame Immunities? At leaſt be exempted from the ſame Oppreſſions? And why ſubmit to Taxes, unleſs by their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives?</p>
            <p>Let us now inquire, into the Neceſſity of taking or impoſing Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, on the Colonies; or whether there was any Authority for ſuch a Step, while their Charters continued in Force? The Queſtion ſhall not be, about the Neceſſity the Nation was under, of Aſſiſtance from the Colonies. No doubt, it ſtands in need of Help from them; but ſuch Help ſhould be in Proportion to the Ability of the reſpective Colonies, and to the Expences the Nation hath been put to, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting, ſecuring, and defending them ſeverally. But the true Inquiry ſeems to be, what was the Neceſſity of raiſing this Money by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament.</p>
            <p>To ſay that this Meaſure, ſo extremely alarming, to the Colonies, was neceſſary, in order to obtain their Help, is very ſtrange. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that the Colonies were never aſked, if they would raiſe a Sum themſelves, on a Requiſition from <hi>England.</hi> This Method was taken in Time of War, in raiſing Men; and when it is conſidered,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013177_0013_0F92916D794C8C70"/>
how cheerfully they complied with every Requeſt, although heavy, and burthenſome to the laſt Degree, and, with what an entire Confidence in his Majeſty's Wiſdom, this was done; it muſt needs creat ſome Wonder, that this Method for raiſing Money, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the national Debt, never was propoſed to them. There was the greateſt Probability from long Experience, as well as from the good Diſpoſition the Colonies then manifeſted, that it would have been complied with, and the Money paid into the Exchequer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Half the Diſtreſs on the People; and with Three Parts in Four of more clear Revenue to the Crown, than by the preſent Duty, or Tax in the Way ſince adopted. There would have been no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement on Charter Rights, no Diſaffection from the Parent Country; and no Regret, that they had fought and bled for Chains, would have been heard among the Inhabitants. Suppoſing this Method had failed, the Steps which have been taken, might have had ſome ſeeming Appearance of Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>It may now be enquired, whether the Crown has received any Benefit from theſe Duties or not?</p>
            <p>Here then let it be conſidered, what vaſt Sums of Money are firſt paid to the Officers, and others who receive their Saleries out of this Revenue (and the unlimited Power the Board of Commiſſioners have, of increaſing the Number of Officers under them) which are ſo many, that there were but about Eighty-five Pounds paid into the Exchequer, the laſt Year. Farther what Numbers of Men of War, and Swarms of armed Veſſels, and armed Boats, and how many Regiments of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Troops are alſo emyloyed, under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of of protecting the Officers of this Revenue, whoſe Pay comes from another Quarter? This muſt neceſſarily leave a large Ballance againſt the Nation.</p>
            <p>Did not the People of <hi>New-England</hi> undergo ſuch Hardſhips and Sufferings as have been ſtated, in the firſt Settlement of the Country? Did they not make a Conqueſt of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> once and again? Did they not always exert themſelves for the national Intereſt, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with every Requiſition for that Purpoſe? Have they not behaved themſelves dutifully, and ever loyally to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:013177_0014_0F92916F839A8FC8"/>
And have their Services and Sufferings been attended with the Expence of ſo much Blood and Treaſure, that they have even raiſed an Empire to the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and are they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to have and maintain a Government of themſelves, by a Charter under the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and all this at the ſole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Inhabitants? If ſo, then every Meaſure already taken, or which may be about to be taken by the Parent Country, that is grievous to them, is but an unkind Return; it is not treating them as every Father is wont to treat his Children, and if ſuch Treatment ſhould be continued, it will, perhaps, end in the utter Ruin of the whole Family.</p>
            <p>If the foregoing Repreſentation of <hi>New-England</hi> be true, (as all unprejudiced Men, who have Knowledge of the Hiſtory, will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,) the following Remarks may be made.</p>
            <p>Firſt. Can it be for the Intereſt of the Nation, to continue the Duties on the Colonies, when the Expence of collecting them, is double, if not treble, the Amount of the whole Duties collected?</p>
            <p>Secondly. Can it be for the Inetreſt of the Nation, to loſe the Affections of four or five Millions of brave, loyal and loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, always inured to manly Freedom, who have never thought it too much to venture their Lives and Fortunes, and every Thing dear and valuable to them, if by any Means they could add to the Glory, Wealth and Oppulence of the Nation? This they have done, at all Times, where there was the leaſt Probability of Succeſs.</p>
            <p>Finally, Can it be for the Intereſt of the Nation, to keep up an armed Force in <hi>New-England,</hi> eſpecially in Time of Peace? How vauge is the Pretence, for thus affronting, and even murthering ſome of the Inhabitants, corrupting their Morals by Debauchery, Drunkenneſs, Prophaneneſs, &amp;c.! Sins but little known among them, until Troops were quartered upon them. Surely ſuch a Torrent of Evils, as has ruſhed in upon them by Means of the Meaſures taken by the Mother Country, is a far greater Puniſhment, than all the Hardſhips and Difficulties they endured, from their firſt Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the End of the laſt War. In all thoſe Hardſhips and Sufferings, there was no general Complaint or Murmurings. But
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013177_0015_0F92916FC2059FB8"/>
how far this is from being the Caſe at preſent, is manifeſt to the World; and there is no Doubt, but they would rather have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, to have fought <hi>Canada</hi> to the Knees in Blood, with their Charter Rights in full Poſſeſſion, than to be freed even from ſo dreadful a Calamity, and have the Evils before-mentioned heaped upon them. Let me add, that all Men of Sobriety, who have the national Intereſt at Heart, tremble to think, what the End of theſe Proceedings will be.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, notwithſtanding the hard Treatment the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies have met with of late Years, <abbr>viz.</abbr> In having Duties or Taxes impoſed upon them, by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, quartering Troops in the capital Town, wreſting <hi>Caſtle-William</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>A Fortreſs built on an Iſland, three Miles from Boſton, commanding all Ships that enter the Harbour; it has upwards of</hi> 100 <hi>large Cannon, a Number of Mortars, and every Neceſſary ſuitable for a Fortification.</hi>
               </note> out of the Hands of <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> which built, furniſhed and maintained it, at their ſole Expence; without either paying the Province for the Fort and its Artillery, or ſo much as promiſing that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> would pay for it; beſides the numerous other dreadful Evils which have attended theſe Meaſures.—Nothwithſtanding theſe Things the Colonies do not wholly deſpair, but continue to be loyal and loving Subjects to his preſent Majeſty, hoping that the Influence of Individuals will be of ſhort Continuance. They never have doubted, that if the Nation ſhould ſeriouſly and diſpaſſionately once attend to the Services which the Colonies have done it, of what Importance they muſt ever be to its Intereſts, and that all their paſt Services have been effected in the Enjoyment of their civil and religions Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, the Nation would grant them the full Poſſeſſion thereof for the Time to come. In this Hope, under God, they have hitherto perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; nay, ſo well grounded do they ſuppoſe this Hope to be, that however ſtrange it may ſeem, though the Meaſures which have ſo much aggrieved them, were adopted by the repreſentative Body of the Empire, they do not yet give it up; although it is like hoping againſt Hope.</p>
