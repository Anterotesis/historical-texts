         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the Indians about his Barn, ventured and
went out, but was quickly shot down. There
were three others belonging to the same Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

shoot down upon them over their Fortification.
Thus these murtherous wretches went on bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <p>At length they came &amp; beset our own house,

the Hill, others into the Barn, and others behind

they wounded one man among us, then another,

When we were come, Oh the number of
<hi>Pagans</hi> (now merciless Enemies) that there came
about me, that I may say as <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 27. 13.
<hi>I had fainted, unless I had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Day was the Sabbath: I then remembred how
careless I had been of God's holy Time: how
many Sabbaths I had lost and mispent, &amp; how
evily I had walked in God's sight; which lay
so c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

me to see how Righteous it was with God to
cut off the thread of my Life, and cast me out
of his presence for ever. Yet the Lord still
shewed Mercy to me, and helped me; and as
he wounded me with one Hand, so he healed
me with the other. This Day there came to
me one <hi>Robert Pepper,</hi> (a Man belonging to <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>)
who was taken at Capt. <hi>Beers</hi> his Fight;
and had been now a considerable time with the
Indians, and up with them almost as far as <hi>Albany</hi>

me he himself was wounded in the Leg at Capt.
<hi>Beers</hi> his Fight; and was not able sometime to
go but as they carried him, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Oak Leaves and laid to his Wound, and by the
Blessing of God, he was able to Travel again.
Then I took Oak Leaves and laid to my Side,
and with the Blessing of God, it cured me also;
yet before the Cure was wrought, I may say as
it is in <hi>Psal. 38. 5, 6. My Wounds Stink and are
Corrupt, I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I
go Mourning all the day long.</hi> I sate much alone
with my poor wounded Child in my Lap, which
moaned Night and Day, having nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
the Body, or chear the Spirits of her; but
instead of that, one <hi>Indian</hi> would come and tell
me one hour, your Master will knock your Child
on the head, and then a second, and then a third,
your Master will quickly knock your Child on
the head.</p>
               <p>This was the Comfort I had from them;
Miserable Comforters were they all. Thus nine
Days I sate upon my Knees, with my Babe in
my Lap, till my Flesh was raw again. My Child
being even ready to depart this sorrowful <hi>World,</hi>
they bid me carry it out to another Wigwam;

with such Spectacles) Whither I wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the first wounding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

without any Refreshing of one nature or
other, except a little cold Water. I cannot but
take notice, how at another time I could not bear
to be in the room where any dead Person was,
but now the case is changed; I must, and could
lie down by my dead Babe all the Night after.
I have thought since of the wonderful Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God to me, in preserving me so in the
use of my Reason and Senses, in that distressed
time, that I did not use wicked and violent
Means to end my own miserable Life. In the
Morning, when they understood that my Child
was dead, they sent for me home to my Masters
Wigwam: (By my Master in this Writing, must
be understood <hi>Quannopin,</hi> who was a Saggamore,
and married K. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Wives Sister; not that
he first took me, but I was sold to him by a <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganset
Indian,</hi> who took me when I first came
out of the Garrison) I went to take up my dead
Child in my Arms to carry it with me, but they
bid me let it alone: There was no resisting, but
go I must and leave it. When I had been a while

I left that Child in the Wilderness, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

<hi>Mary,</hi> who was at this same <hi>Indian</hi> Town,
at a Wigwam not very far off, though we had
little liberty or opportunity to see one another:
She was about ten Years old, and taken from
the Door at first by a Praying <hi>Indian,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sold for a Gun. When I came in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would fall a Weeping, at which they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
and would not let me come near her,
but bid me be gone; which was a Heart cutting
Word to me. I had one Child dead, another in
the Wilderness, I knew not where, the third
they would not let me come near to; <hi>Me</hi> (as he
said) <hi>have ye bereaved of my Children, Ios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this Condition, but kept walking from one place
to another. And as I was going along, my

up and down mourning and lamenting my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002173_0016_0F52A9BFD510E608"/>
my Son came to me, and asked me how
I did? I had not seen him before, since the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Town; and I knew not where
he was, till I was informed by himself, that he
was amongst a smaller parcel of <hi>Indians,</hi> whose
place was about six Miles off, with tears in his
eyes, he asked me whether his Sister <hi>Sarah</hi> was
dead? and told me he had seen his Sister <hi>Mary;</hi>
and prayed me, that I would not be troubled in
reference to himself. The occasion of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to see me at this time was this: There was,
as I said, about six Miles from us, a small Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Indians,</hi> where it seems he had been du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Captivity; and at this time, there were
some Forces of the <hi>Indians</hi> gathered out of our
Company, and some also from them, (amongst
whom was my Sons Master) to go to assault and
burn <hi>Medfield:</hi> In this time of his Masters Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
his Dame brought him to see me. I took
this to be some gracious Answer to my earnest
and unfeigned Desire. The next Day the <hi>India<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

returned from <hi>Medfield:</hi> (all the Company, for
those that belonged to the other smaller Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
came through the Town that now we
were at) But before they came to us, Oh the
outrageous Roaring and Hooping that there
was! They began their din about a Mile before
they came to us. By their Noise and H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

as soon as they heard the Hooping, and
every time that the other went over their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
these at home gave a shout, that the very

come up to the Saggamor's Wigwam; and then
Oh the hideous Insulting and Triumphing that
there was over some <hi>English</hi> Mens Scalps, that
they had taken (as their manner is) and brought
with them. I cannot but take notice of the
wonderful Mercy of God to me in those Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in sending me a <hi>Bible:</hi> One of the <hi>Indians</hi>
that came from <hi>Medfield</hi> Fight, and had brought
some Plunder, came to me, and asked me if I
would have a <hi>Bible,</hi> he had got one in his Basket.
I was glad of it, and asked him if he thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

the <hi>Indians</hi> would let me Read? he answered
yes; so I took the <hi>Bible,</hi> and in that melancholy
Time, it came into my Mind to Read first the
28th Chap. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which I did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
when I had read it, my dark Heart wrought on

But the Lord helped me still to go

I never saw afterward, the Lord only knows
the end of them. Among them also was that
poor Woman before mentioned, who came to
a sad end, as some of the Company told me in
my Travel: She having much Grief upon her
Spirits, about her miserable Condition, being
so near her Time, she would be often asking
the <hi>Indians</hi> to let her go home; they not being
willing to that, and yet vexed with her Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
gathered a great Company together
about her, and stript her naked, and set her in
the midst of them; and when they had Sung
and Danced about her (in their hellish manner)
as long as they pleased, they knockt her on the
head, and the Child in her Arms with her:

one Tear, but prayed all the while. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to my own Journey: We travelled about
half a Day or a little more, and came to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate
Place in the Wilderness, where there
were no Wigwams or Inhabitants before: We
came about the middle of the Afternoon to this
place; cold and wet, and snowy, and hungry,
and weary, and no Refreshing (for Man) but
the cold Ground to sit on, and our poor <hi>Indian</hi>
Cheer.</p>
               <p>Heart-aking Thoughts here I had about my
poor Children, who were scattered up and down
among the wild Beasts of the Forest: My Head
was Light and Dissy, (either through Hunger or
hard Lodging, or Trouble, or altogether) my
Knees Feeble, my Body Raw by sitting double
Night and Day, that I cannot express to Man,
the Affliction that lay upon my Spirit, but the Lord
helped me at that time to express it to himself.
I opened my <hi>Bible</hi> to Read, and the Lord brought
that precious Scripture to me, <hi>Ier. 31. 16. Thus
saith the Lord, Refrain thy Voice from Weeping, and
thine Eyes from Tears, for they Work shall be Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and they shall come again from the Land of the
Enemy.</hi> This was a sweet Cordial to me, when
I was ready to Faint, many and many a time,
have I sat down, and wept sweetly over this
Scripture. At<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this place we continued about
four Days.</p>

               <p>The occasion (as I thought) of their moving
at this time, was the <hi>English</hi> Army's being near
and following them: For they went as if they
had gone for their Lives, for some considerable
way; and then they made a stop, and chose out
some of their stoutest Men, and sent them back
to hold the <hi>English</hi> Army in play whilst the rest
escaped; and then like <hi>Iehu</hi> they marched on
furiously, with their old and young: Some car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
their old decriped Mothers, some carried
one, and some another. Four of them carried
a great <hi>Indian</hi> upon a Bier; but going through
a thick Wood with him, they were hindred, and
could make no haste; whereupon they took
him upon their backs, and carried him one at
a time, till we came to <hi>Bacquag</hi> River. Upon a
<hi>Friday</hi> a little Afternoon we came to this River:
When all the Company was come up, and were
gathered together, I thought to count the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them, but they were so ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this Travel, because of my Wound, I was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
favoured in my Load: I carried only my
Knitting-work, and two quarts of parched Meal:
Being very faint, I asked my Mistress to give me
one Spoonful of the Meal, but she would not
give me a taste. They quickly fell to cutting
dry Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002173_0022_0F52A9C3F779DBC8"/>
River, and soon my turn came to go over. By
the advantage of some Brush which they had
laid upon the Raft to sit on, I did not wet my
Foot, (which many of themselves at the other
end were mid-leg deep) which cannot but be
acknowledged as a favour of God to my wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
Body, it being a very cold time. I was not
before acquainted with such kind of doings, or
dangers. <hi>When thou passest thorough the Waters I
will be with thee, and thorough the Rivers they shall
not overflow thee.</hi> Isai. 43. 2. A certain Number
of us got over the River that Night, but it was
the Night after the Sabbath before all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was got over. On the <hi>Saturday</hi> they boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
an old Horse's Leg (which they had got) and
so we drank of the Broth, as soon as they
thought it was ready, and when it was almost
all gone, they filled it up again.</p>
               <p>The first Week of my being among them, I
hardly ate any thing: The second Week I found
my Stomach grow very Faint for want of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and yet 'twas very hard to get down
their filthy Trash; but the third Week (though
I could think how formerly my Stomach would
turn against this or that, and I could starve and
die before I could eat such things, yet) they
were pleasant and savoury to my taste. I was at
this time Knitting a pair of white <hi>Cotten</hi> Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for my Mistress, and I had not yet wrought
upon the Sabbath Day: When the Sabbath came,

               <p>After a restless and hungry Night there, we
had a wearisome time of it the next Day. The
Swamp by which we lay, was as it were a deep
Dungeon, and an exceeding high and steep
Hill before it. Before I got to the top of the
Hill, I thought my Heart and Legs and all
would have broken, and failed me. What
through faintness and foreness of Body, it was
a grievous Day of Travel to me. As we went

laid it on the Coals to Roast, but before it was

to be a Bait, the Devil lays to make Men lose
their precious Time. I remember with Shame,
how formerly, when I had taken two or three
Pipes, I was presently ready for another; such
a bewitching thing it is: But I thank God, he
has now given me power over it; surely there
are many who may be better employed, than to
sit sucking a stinking Tobacco-pipe.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Indians</hi> gather their Forces to go
against <hi>North-Hampton:</hi> Over Night one went
about yelling and hooting to give Notice of the
Design. Whereupon they went to Boyling of
Ground-Nuts, and parching of Corn, (as many
as had it) for their Provision; and in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away they went. During my abode in this
place, <hi>Philip</hi> spake to me to make a Shirt for his
Boy, which I did; for which he gave me a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
I offered the Money to my Master, but he
bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> me keep it, and with it I bought a piece
of Horse-flesh. Afterward he asked me to make
a Cap for his Boy, for which he invited me to
Dinner: I went, and he gave me a Pan-cake, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
as big as two Fingers; it was made of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
Wheat, beaten, and fryed in Bears-grease,
but I thought I never tasted pleasanter Meat in
my Life. There was a Squaw who spake to me
to make a Shirt for her Sannup; for which she
gave me a piece of Bear. Another asked me to
Knit a pair of Stockings, for which she gave me
a quart of Pease. I boyled my Pease and Bear
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002173_0030_0F52A9CAC3FCEB78"/>
together, and invited my Master and Mistress to
Dinner; but the proud Gossip, because I served
them both in one Dish, would eat nothing, except
one bit that he gave her upon the point of his
Knife. Hearing that my Son was come to this
place, I went to see him, and found him lying
flat upon the Ground; I asked him how he
could Sleep so? he answered me, that he was
not asleep, but at Prayer; and that he lay so,
that they might not observe what he was doing.
I pray God he may remember these things now
he is returned in safety. At this place, (the Sun
now getting higher) what with the beams and
heat of the Sun, and the smoke of the Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams,
I thought I should have been blind. I
could scarce discern one Wigwam from another.
There was here one <hi>Mary Thurston</hi> of <hi>Medfield,</hi>
who seeing how it was with me, lent me a Hat
to wear; but as soon as I was gone, the Squaw
who owned that <hi>Mary Thurston,</hi> came running
after me, and got it away again. Here was a
Squaw who gave me a Spoon-full of Meal, I
put it in my Pocket to keep it safe, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
some body stole it, but put five
<hi>Indian</hi> Corns in the room of it; which Corns
were the greatest Provision I had in my Travel
for one Day.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> returning from <hi>North-Hampton,</hi>
brought with them some Horses, and Sheep, and
other things which they had taken; I desired
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002173_0031_0F52A9CB76858118"/>
them that they would carry me to <hi>Albany</hi> upon
one of those Horses, and sell me for Powder;
for so they had some times discoursed. I was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
hopeless of getting home on Foot, the
way that I came. I could hardly bear to think
of the many weary Steps I had taken, to come
to this place.</p>

               <p>But instead of going either to <hi>Albany</hi> or home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
we must go five Miles up the River, and
then go over it. Here we abode a while. Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lived a sorry <hi>Indian,</hi> who spake to me to make
him a Shirt, when I had done it, he would pay
me nothing for it. But he living by the River
side, where I often went to fetch Water, I would
often be putting of him in mind, and calling
for my pay; at last he told me, if I would make
another Shirt for a Papoos not yet born, he
would give me a Knife, which he did, when I
had done it. I carried the Knife in, and my
Master asked me to give it him, and I wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not
a little glad that I had any thing that they
would accept of, and be pleased with. When
we were at this place, my Masters Maid came
home; she had been gone three Weeks into
the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Country to fetch Corn, where
they had stored up some in the Ground: She
brought home about a peck and half of Corn.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002173_0032_0F52A9CD0AA455B0"/>
This was about the time that their great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(<hi>Naananto</hi>) was killed in the <hi>Narraganset</hi>
Country.</p>
               <p>My Son being now about a Mile from me,
I asked liberty to go and see him, they bid me
go, and away I went; but quickly lost my self,
travelling over Hills and thorough Swamps, and
could not find the way to him. And I cannot
but admire at the wonderful Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God to me, in that though I was gone
from home, and met with all sorts of <hi>Indians,</hi>
and those I had no knowledge of, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Christian Soul near me, yet not one of
them offered the least imaginable Miscarriage
to me. I turned homeward again, and met with
my Master, and he shewed me the way to my
Son. When I came to him, I found him not
well; and withal he had a Boil on his Side,
which much troubled him: We bemoaned one
another a while, as the Lord helped us, and
then I returned again. When I was returned, I
found my self as unsatisfied as I was before. I
went up and down Mourning and Lamenting,
and my Spirit was ready to sink, with the
thoughts of my poor Children: My Son was
ill, and I could not but think of his mournful
Looks, having no Christian Friend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> him,
to do any Office of Love for him, either for
Soul or Body. And my poor Girl, I knew not
where she was, nor whether she was sick, or
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002173_0033_0F52A9CE0CD3FF20"/>
well, or alive, or dead. I repaired under these
thoughts to my Bible, (my great Comforter in
that time) and that Scripture came to my hand,
<hi>Cast thy Burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain
thee,</hi> Psal. 55. 22.</p>
               <p>But I was fain to go look after something
to satisfy my Hunger: And going among the
Wigwams, I went into one, and there found a
Squaw who shewed her self very kind to me,
and gave me a piece of Bear. I put it into my
Pocket, and came home; but could not find an
opportunity to Broil it, for fear they should get
it from me; and there it lay all that Day and
Night in my stinking Pocket. In the Morning
I went again to the same Squaw, who had a
Kettle of Ground-Nuts Boyling: I asked her
to let me boyl my piece of Bear in her Kettle,
which she did, and gave me some Ground-Nuts
to eat with it, and I cannot but think how
pleasant it was to me. I have sometimes seen
Bear baked handsomely amongst the <hi>English,</hi>
and some liked it, but the thoughts that it was
Bear, made me tremble: But now that was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
to me that one would think was enough
to turn the Stomach of a Brute-Creature.</p>
               <p>One bitter cold Day, I could find no room
to sit dowr before the Fire: I went out, and
could not tell what to do, but I went into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Wigwam, where they were also sitting
round the Fire; but the Squaw laid a Skin for
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002173_0034_0F52A9CEDDD5A260"/>
me, and bid me sit down, and gave me some
Ground-Nuts, and bid me come again; and
told me they would buy me, if they were able;
and yet these were Strangers to me that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew before.</p>

               <p>That Day a small part of the Company re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
about three quarters of a Mile, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the place where they intended to Lodge, and

When I was there, there came an <hi>Indian</hi>
to look after me; who when he had found me,

was so steep, that I was fain to creep up upon
my Knees, and to hold by the Twigs &amp; Bushes
to keep my self from falling backward. My
Head also was so Light, that I usually reeled
as I went: But I hope all those wearisome steps
that I have taken, are but a forwarding of me
to the heavenly Rest. <hi>I know O Lord, that thy

               <p>It was upon a Sabbath-day Morning, that
they prepared for their Travel. This Morning
I asked my Master whether he would sell me
to my Husband? he answered <hi>Nux;</hi> which did
much rejoyce my Spirit. My Mistress, before
we went, was gone to the Burial of a <hi>Papoos,</hi>
and returning, she found me sitting, and Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in my Bible: She snatcht it hastily out of
my Hand, and threw it out of doors; I ran out
and catcht it up, and put it into my Pocket,
and never let her see it afterward. Then they
packed up their things to be gone, and gave
me my Load: I complained it was too heavy,
whereupon she gave me a slap on the Face, and
bid me be gone. I lifted up my H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rt to God,
hoping that Redemption was not far off; and
the rather because their Insolancy grew worse
and worse.</p>

                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:002173_0036_0F52A9CFF75131A0"/>
But the thoughts of my going homeward,
(for so we bent our course) much cheared my
my Spirit, and made my Burden seem Light,
and almost nothing at all. But (to my amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and great perplexity) the Scale was soon
turned; for when we had gone a little way,
on a sudden my Mistress gave out, she would go
no further, but turn back again, and said I must
go back again with her, and she called her
Sannup, and would have had him go back also,
but he would not; but said, he would go on,
and come to us again in three Days. My Spirit
was upon this (I confess) very Impatient, and
almost Outragious. I thought I could as well
have died as went back. I cannot declare the
Trouble that I was in about it; but yet back
again I must go. As soon as I had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I took my Bible to Read, and that quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scripture came to my Hand, <hi>Psal.</hi> 46. 10.
<hi>Be still, and know that I am God.</hi> Which stilled
my Spirit for the present; but a sore time of
Trial I concluded I had to go thorough. My
Master being gone, who seemed to me the best
Friend that I had of an <hi>Indian,</hi> both in Cold &amp;
Hunger, and quickly so it proved. Down I sat,
with my Heart as full as it could hold, and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
so Hungry, that I could not sit neither: But
going out to see what I could find, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among the Trees, I found six Acrons and
two Chesnuts, which were some Refreshment
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002173_0037_0F52A9D0C4BAB180"/>
to me. Toward Night I gathered me some
Sticks for my own Comfort, that I might not
lye a Cold: But when we came to lye down,
they bid me go out, and lye somewhere else,
for they had Company (they said) come in
more than their own: I told them I could not
tell where to go, they bid me go look: I told
them, if I went to another Wigwam they would
be angry, and send me home again. Then one
of the Company drew his Sword, and told me
he would run me thorough, if I did not go pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
Then was I fain to stoop to this rude
Fellow, and to go out in the Night I knew not
whither. Mine eyes have seen that Fellow after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
walking up and down in <hi>Boston,</hi> under
the appearance of a <hi>Friendly Indian,</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
others of the like Cut. I went to one Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam,
and they told me they had no room.
Then I went to another, and they said the
same: At last an old <hi>Indian</hi> bid m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

saw nothing but Wilderness, and Woods, and a

of that spoken concerning <hi>Sampson,</hi> who said,

I thought of being Sold to my Husband, as my
Master spake; but instead of that, my Master
himself was gone, and I left behind, so that
my Spirit was now quite ready to sink. I asked
them to let my go out and pick up some Sticks,
that I might get alone, and pour out my Heart
unto the Lord. Then also I took my Bible to
Read, but I found no Comfort here neither;
yet I can say, that in all my Sorrows and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

upon me less than I deserved: Afterward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this doleful time ended with me, I was
turning the leaves of my Bible, and the Lord
brought to me some Scriptures which did a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
revive me, as that, <hi>Isa. 55. 8. For my thoughts

to go and see him; and when I came, he was
crying bitterly, supposing they would quickly
Kill him. Whereupon I asked one of them,
whether they intended to Kill him, he answered
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002173_0041_0F52A9D4517B8E30"/>
me, they would not: He being a little cheared
with that, I asked him about the Welfare of
my Husband, he told me he saw him such a
time in the <hi>Bay,</hi> and he was well, but very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.
By which I certainly understood
(though I suspected it before) that whatsoever
the <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Lies. Some of them told me he was Dead,
and they had killed him: Some said he was
Married again, and that the Governour wished
him to Marry, and told him he should have his
Choice, and that all perswaded him I was dead.
So like were these barbarous Creatures to him
who was a Liar from the beginning.</p>
               <p>As I was sitting once in the Wigwam here,
<hi>Philip</hi>'s Maid came in with the Child in her
Arms, and asked me to give her a piece of my
Apron, to make a Flap for it; I told her I
would not; then my Mistress bid me give it,
but I still said no. The Maid told me, if I <hi>would</hi>
not give her a piece, she would tear a piece off
it: I told her I would tear her Coat then:
With that my Mistress rises up, and takes up
a Stick big enough to have killed me, &amp; struck
at me with it, but I stept out and she struck
the stick into the Mat of the Wigwam. But
while I was pulling of it out, I ran to the
Maid and gave her all my Apron, and so that
Storm went over.</p>

as much grieved for his Father, as for himself; I
wondred at his Speech, for I thought I had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

to make me mindless of my Husband, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

He told me also, that a while before, his Master,
(together with other <hi>Indians</hi>) were going to the

Company, which made the rest turn back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
for which I desire that my self and he
may bless the Lord; for it might have been
worse with him, had he been Sold to the <hi>French,</hi>
than it proved to be in his remaining with the
<hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I went to see an <hi>English</hi> Youth in this place,
one <hi>Iohn Gilberd</hi> of <hi>Springfield.</hi> I found him
lying without doors upon the Ground; I asked
him how he did? he told me he was very sick
of a Flux with eating so much Blood. They
had turned him out of the Wigwam, and with
him an <hi>Indian</hi> Papoos, almost dead, (whose Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
had been killed) in a bitter cold Day,
without Fire or Cloaths: The young Man
himself had nothing on but his Shirt and Wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat.
This sight was enough to melt a Heart
of Flint. There they lay quivering in the Cold,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002173_0043_0F52A9D535900940"/>
the Youth round like a Dog, the Papoos stretcht
out, with his Eyes and Nose, and Mouth full of
Dirt, and yet alive, and groaning. I advised
<hi>Iohn</hi> to go and get to some Fire; he told me
he could not stand, but I perswaded him still,
lest he should lye there and die. And with
much ado I got him to a Fire, and went my
self home. As soon as I was got home, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Daughter came after me, to know what
I had done with the <hi>English</hi> Man? I told her I
had got him to a Fire in such a place. Now
had I need to pray <hi>Paul</hi>'s Prayer, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 2.
<hi>That we may be delivered from unreasonable and
wicked Men.</hi> for her Satisfaction I went along
with her, and brought her to him; but before I
got home again, it was noised about, that I was
running away, and getting the <hi>English</hi> Youth
along with me: That as soon as I came in, they
began to rant and domineer, asking me where
I had been, and what I had been doing? and
saying they would knock me on the head: I
told them I had been seeing the <hi>English</hi> Youth,
and that I would not run away. They told me
I lied, and getting up a Hatchet, they came to
me, and said they would knock me down if I
stirred out again; and so confined me to the
Wigwam. Now may I say with <hi>David, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>:
24. 14. I am in a great strait.</hi> If I keep in, I must
dye with Hunger; and if I go out, I must be

<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002173_0044_0F52A9D657FE74C0"/>
held that Day, and half the next; and then the
Lord remembred me, whose Mercies are great.
Then came an <hi>Indian</hi> to me with a pair of Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
which were too big for him, and he would
have me ravel them out, and knit them fit for
him. I shewed my self willing, and bid him ask
my Mistress if I might go along with him a
little way? She said, yes, I might; but I wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
not a little refresh'd with that News, that I had
my Liberty again. Then I went along with
him, and he gave me some roasted Ground-Nuts,
which did again revive my feeble Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>Being got out of her sight, I had time &amp; liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
again to look into my Bible, which was my
Guide by Day, and my Pillow by Night. Now
that comfortable Scripture presente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

me, <hi>Isai. 45. 7. For a small Moment have I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
thee, but with great Mercies will I gather thee.</hi>
Thus the Lord carried me along from one time
to another, and made good to me this precious
Promise, and many others. Then my Son came
to see me, and I asked his Master to let him stay
a while with me, that I might comb his Head,
and look over him, for he was almost overcome
with Lice. He told me when I had done, that
he was very Hungry, but I had nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, but bid him go into the Wigwams
as he went along, and see if he could get any
thing among them. Which he did, and (it

was angry with him, and beat him, and then
sold him. Then he came running to tell me
he had a new Master, and that he had given
him some Ground-Nuts already. Then I went
along with him to his new Master, who told
me he loved him, and he should not want. So
his Master carried him away, and I never saw
him afterward, till I saw him at <hi>Piscataqua</hi> in
<hi>Portsmouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Night they bid me go out of the Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam
again: My Mistress's Papoos was Sick, &amp;
it died that Night; and there was one benefit in
it, that there was more room. I went to a Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam,
and they bid me come in, and gave me a
Skin to lye upon, and a mess of Venson and
Ground-Nuts, which was a choice Dish among
them. On the morrow they buried the Papoos;
and afterward, both Morning and Evening, there
came a company to mourn and howl with her:
though I confess I could not much condole with
them. Many sorrowful Eyes I had in this
place; often getting alone, <hi>like a Cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Unrighteousness towards one or other; yet I
saw how in my Walk with God, I had been a
careless creature. As <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>Against thee,
thee only have I sinned.</hi> And I might say with the
poor Publican, <hi>God be merciful unto me a Sinner.</hi>
Upon the Sabbath-days I could look upon the
Sun, and think how People were going to the
House of God, to have their Souls refresht,
and then home, and their Bodies also; but I
was destitute of both, and might say as the
poor Prodigal. <hi>He would fain have filled his Belly

Night before and after the Sabbath, when my
Family was about me, and Relations &amp; Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
with us; we could Pray, and Sing, and
refresh our Bodies with the good Creatures of
God, and then have a comfortable Bed to lye
down on; But instead of all this, I had only a
little Swill for the Body, and then like a Swine,
must lye down on the Ground I cannot express
to Man, the Sorrow that lay upon my Spirit,
the Lord knows it. Yet that comfortable
Scripture would often come to my mind, <hi>For
a small Moment have I forsaken thee, but with
great Mercies will I gather thee.</hi>

She gave it me, and I put it into my Pocket:
There it lay, till it was so mouldy, (for want

it was made of; it fell all to crumbs, and grew
so dry and hard, that it was like little Flints;

put it into my Mouth, that if ever I returned,
I would tell the World, what a Blessing the
Lord gave to such mean Food. As we went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
they killed a <hi>Deer,</hi> with a young one in
her; they gave me a piece of the <hi>Fawn,</hi> and it
was so young and tender, that one might eat
the Bones as well as the Flesh, and yet I
thought it very good. When Night came on,
we sat down; it Rained, but they quickly got
up a Bark Wigwam, where I lay dry that
Night. I looked out in the Morning, and many

by their Reaking. Thus the Lord dealt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

along, I saw an <hi>English</hi> Man stript naked, and
lying dead upon the Ground, but knew not
who it was. Then we came to another <hi>Indian</hi>
Town, where we stayed all Night. In this <hi>Town</hi>
there were four <hi>English</hi> Children, Captives, and
one of them my own Sister's. I went to see how
she did, and she was well, considering her Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Condition. I would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arried that Night
with her, but they that owned her would not
suffer it. Then I went to another Wigwam,
where they were boyling Corn &amp; Beans, which
was a lovely sight to see, but I could not get a
taste thereof. Then I went into another Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam,
where there were two of the <hi>English Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi>
The Squaw was boyling Horses Feet, she
cut me off a little piece, and gave one of the
<hi>English</hi> Children a piece also. Being very hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
I had quickly eat up mine; but the Child
could not bite it, it was so tough and sinewy,
but lay sucking, gnawing, chewing and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of it in the Mouth and Hand, then I took it
of the Child, and ate it my self, and savoury it
was to my taste. That I may say as <hi>Iob, Chap.
6. 7. The things that my Soul refused to touch, are
as my sorrowful meat.</hi> Thus the Lord made that
Pleasant and Refreshing, which another time
would have been an Abomination. Then I
went home to my Mistress's Wigwam, and they
told me I disgraced my Master with Begging,
and if I did so any more, they would knock me
on the head: I told them, they had as good do
that, as starve me to death.</p>

without resting any Day between. At

came to <hi>Wachuset,</hi> where he was, and glad was
I to see him. He asked me when I washt me?

some Water himself, and bid me wash, &amp; gav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My Master had three Squaws, living some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with one, and sometimes with another.
One, this old Squaw at whose Wigwam I was,
and with whom my Master had been those three
Weeks Another was <hi>Wettimore,</hi> with whom I
had lived and served all this while. A severe
and proud Dame she was; bestowing every day
in dressing her self near as much Time as any
of the Gentry of the Land: Powdering her Hair,
and Painting her Face, going with her Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,
with Jewels in her Ears, and Bracelets
upon her Hands. When she had dressed her self,
her Work was to make Girdles of Wampom &amp;
and Beads. The third Squaw was a younger
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002173_0055_0F52A9DE93CD4278"/>
one, by whom he had two Papooses. By that
time I was refresht by the old Squaw, <hi>Wetti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>'s
Maid came to call me home, at which I
fell a weeping. Then the old Squaw told me
to encourage me, that when I wanted Victuals,
I should come to her, and that I should l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in
her Wigwam. Then I went with the Maid, &amp;
quickly I came back and lodged there. The
Squaw laid a Matt under me, and a good Rugg
over me; the first time that I had any such kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shewed me. I understood that <hi>We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>imore</hi>
thought, that if she should let me go and serve
with the old Squaw, she should be in danger to
lose (not only my Service) but the Redemption-pay
also. And I was not a little glad to hear
this; being by it raised in my hopes, that in
Gods due time, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

me to knit him three pair of Stockings, for which
I had a Hat, and a Silk Handkerchief. Then
another asked me to make her a Shift, for which
she gave me an Apron.</p>
               <p>Then came <hi>Tom</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> with the second
Letter from the Council, about the Captives.
Though they were <hi>Indians,</hi> I gat them by the
Hand, and burst out into Tears; my Heart was
so full that I could not speak to them; but reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
my self, I asked them how my Husband
did? and all my Friends &amp; Acquaintance? they
said they were well, but very Melancholy. They
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002173_0056_0F52A9DEF7EE15B0"/>
brought me two Biskets, &amp; a pound of Tobacco.
The Tobacco I soon gave away: when it was
all gone, one asked me to give him a Pipe of
Tobacco, I told him it was all gone; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
he to rant and threaten; I told him when
my Husband came, I would give him some:
Hang him, Rogue, (says he) I will knock out
his Brains, if he comes here. And then again
in the same Breath, they would say, That if
there should come an Hundred without Guns,
they would do them no hurt. So unstable and
like mad Men they were. So that fearing the
worst, I durst not sent to my Husband, though
there were some thoughts of his coming to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
and fetch me, not knowing what might
follow; for there was little more trust to them,
than to the Master they served. When the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was come, the Saggamores met to consult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Captives, and called me to them, to
enquire how much my Husband would give to
Redeem me: When I came, I sat down among
them, as I was wont to do, as their manner is;
Then they bid me stand up, and said, They
were the <hi>General Court.</hi> They bid me speak what
I thought he would give. Now knowing that
all we had was destroyed by the <hi>Indians,</hi> I was
in a great strait. I thought if I should speak of
but a little, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

matter; if of a great Sum, I knew not where
it would be procured; yet at a venture, I sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Twenty Pounds,</hi> yet desired them to take less;
but they would not hear of that, but sent that
Message to <hi>Boston,</hi> That for <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> I
should be redeemed. It was a Praying <hi>Indian</hi>
that wrote their Letter for them. There was
another Praying <hi>Indian,</hi> who told me, that he
had a Brother that would not eat Horse, his
Conscience was so Tender and Scrupulous,
(though as large as Hell, for the Destruction of
poor Christians) Then he said, he read that
Scripture to him, 2 <hi>King. 6. 25. There was a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in Samaria, and behold they besieged it, until an
Asses head was sold for fourscore pieces of Silver,
and the fourth part of a Kab of Doves Dung, for
five pieces of Silver.</hi> He expounded this place to
his Brother, and shewed him that it was lawful
to eat that in a Famine, which is not at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time. And now says he, he will eat Horse
with any <hi>Indian</hi> of them all. There was another
Praying <hi>Indian,</hi> who when he had done all the
Mischief that he could, betrayed his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the <hi>English</hi>'s Hands, thereby to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
his own Life. Another Praying <hi>Indian</hi> was
at <hi>Sudbury</hi> Fight, though as he deserved, he was
afterward hanged for it. There was another
Praying <hi>Indian</hi> so wicked and cruel, as to wear
a String about his Neck, strung with <hi>Christian</hi>
Fingers. Another Praying <hi>Indian,</hi> when they
went to <hi>Sudbury</hi> Fight, went with them, and his
Squaw also with him, with her Papoos at her
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002173_0058_0F52A9E0A7896A08"/>
back: Before they went to that Fight, they got
a company together to <hi>Powaw:</hi> The manner
was as followeth.</p>
               <p>There was one that kneeled upon a <hi>Deer-Skin,</hi>
with the Company round him in a Ring,
who kneeled, striking upon the Ground with
their Hands, and with Sticks, and muttering or
humming with their Mouths. Besides him who
kneeled in the Ring, there also stood one with
a Gun in his hand: Then he on the <hi>Deer-Skin</hi>
made a Speech, and all manifested Assent to it,
and so they did many times together. Then
they bid him with the Gun go out of the Ring,
which he did; but when he was out, they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him in again; but he seemed to make a
stand: Then they called the more earnestly,
till he returned again. Then they all sang. Then
they gave him two Guns, in either Hand one.
And so he on the <hi>Deer-Skin</hi> began again; and
at the end of every Sentence in his speaking,
they all assented, humming or muttering with
their Mouths, and striking upon the Ground
with their Hands. Then they bid him with the
two Guns, go out of the Ring again; which he
did a little way. Then they called him in again,
but he made a stand, so they called him with
greater earnestness: But he stood reeling and
wavering, as if he knew not whether he should
stand or fall, or which way to go. Then they
called him with exceeding great Vehemency,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002173_0059_0F52A9E179A7B078"/>
all of them, one and another. After a little
while he turned in, staggering as he went, with
his Arms stretched out, in either Hand a Gun.
As soon as he came in, they all sang and rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
exceedingly a while, and then he upon the
<hi>Deer-Skin</hi> made another Speech, unto which
they all assented in a rejoycing manner; and so
they ended their Business, and forthwith went
to <hi>Sudbury</hi> Fight.</p>
               <p>To my thinking, they went without any
scruple but that they should prosper, and gain
the Victory. And they went out not so rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but they came home with as great a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For they said they had killed two Captains,
and almost an hundred Men. One <hi>English</hi> Man
they brought alive with them, and he said it
was too true, for they had made sad work at
<hi>Sudbury;</hi> as indeed it proved. Yet they came
home without that Rejoycing and Triumphing
over their Victory, which they were wont to
shew at other times: But rather like Dogs, (as
they say) which have lost their Ears. Yet I
could not perceive that it was for their own
loss of Men; they said they lost not above five
or six; and I missed none, except in one <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam.</hi>
When they went, they acted as if the
Devil had told them that they should gain the
Victory; and now they acted as if the Devil
had told them that they should have a Fall.
Whither it were so or no, I cannot tell, but so
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002173_0060_0F52A9E1F6E31238"/>
it proved: For quickly they began to fall, and
so held on that Summer, till they came to utter
Ruine. They came home on a Sabbath day,
and the <hi>Powaw</hi> that kneeled upon the <hi>Deer-Skin,</hi>
came home (I may say without any abuse)
as black as the Devil. When my Master came
home, he came to me, and bid me make a Shirt
for his Papoos of a Holland laced Pillow-beer.
About that time there came an <hi>Indian</hi> to me,
and bid me come to his Wigwam at Night, and
he would give me some Pork and Ground-Nuts.
Which I did, and as I was eating, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Indian</hi> said to me, He seems to be your
good Friend, but he killed two <hi>English</hi> Men at
<hi>Sudbury,</hi> and there lye their Cloaths behind you;
I looked behind me, and there I saw bloody
Cloaths, with bullet-holes in them; yet the
Lord suffered not this wretch to do me any
hurt. Yea, instead of that, he many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresht
me: five or six times did he &amp; his <hi>Squaw</hi>
refresh my feeble Carcass. If I went to their
Wigwam at any time, they would always give
me something, and yet they were Strangers
that I never saw before. Another Squaw gave
me a piece of fresh Pork, and a little Salt with
it, and lent me her Frying-pan to fry it; and
I cannot but remember what a sweet, pleasant
and delightful Relish that bit had to me, to this
day. So little do we prize common Mercies,
when we have them to the full.</p>

               <head>The Twentieth Remove.</head>
               <p>It was their usual manner to Remove, when
they had done any Mischief, lest they should be
found out; and so they did at this time. We
went about three or four Miles, and there they
built a great <hi>Wigwam,</hi> big enough to hold an
hundred <hi>Indians,</hi> which they did in preparation
to a great day of Dancing. They would now
say amongst themselves, that the Governour
would be so angry for his loss at <hi>Sudbury,</hi> that he
would send no more about the Captives, which
made me grieve and tremble. My Sister being
not far from this place, and hearing that I was
here, desired her Master to let her come and see
me, and he was willing to it, and would go with
her; but she being ready first, told him she <hi>would</hi>
go before, and was come within a Mile or two
of the place: Then he overtook her, and began
to rant as if he had been mad, and made her go
back again in the Rain; so that I never saw her
till I saw her in <hi>Charlestown.</hi> Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

began now to come from all Quarters, against
their merry dancing Day: Amongst some of
them came one Good-wife <hi>Kettle:</hi> I told her my
Heart was so heavy that it was ready to break:
So is mine too, said she, but yet I hope we shall
hear some good <hi>News</hi> shortly. I could hear how

earnestly my Sister desired to see me, and I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desired to see her; yet neither of us could
get an opportunity. My Daughter was now but
about a mile off; and I had not seen her in 9
or 10 Weeks, as I had not seen my Sister since
our first taking. I desired them to let me go and
see them, yea, I intreated, begged &amp; perswaded
them to let me see my Daughter; and yet so hard-hearted
were they, that they would not suffer it.
They made use of their tyrannical Power whilst
they had it, but through the Lord's wonderful
Mercy, their time was now but short.</p>
               <p>On a Sabbath-day, the Sun being about an
hour high in the afternoon, came Mr. <hi>Iohn Hoar,</hi>
(the Council permitting him and his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Spirit inclining him) together with the 2
forementioned <hi>Indians, Tom</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> with the
third Letter from the Council. When they came
near, I was abroad; they presently calle me in,
and bid me sit down, and not stir. Then they
catcht up their Guns and away they ran, as if
an enemy had been at hand, and the Guns went
off apace. I manifested some great trouble, and
they asked me what was the matter? I told them
I thought they had killed the <hi>English</hi> Man, (for
they had in the mean time told me that an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Man was come) they said no; they shot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his Horse, and under, and before his Horse;
and they pusht him this way and that way, at
their pleasure, shewing what they could do.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:002173_0063_0F52A9E48BBD0528"/>
Then they let them come to their Wigwams. I
begged of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but they would not; but there was I fain to sit
their pleasure. When they had talked their fill
with him, they suffered me to go to him. We
asked each other of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they were all well, and would be glad to see me.
Among other things which my Husband sent me,
there came a <hi>pound of Tobacco,</hi> which I sold for 9
<hi>Shillings</hi> in Money: For many of them for want
of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> smoked <hi>Hemlock</hi> &amp; <hi>Ground-Ivy.</hi> It was

should go home with Mr. <hi>Hoar?</hi> they answered
no, one and another of them; and it being late,
we lay down with that Answer: In the Morning
Mr <hi>Hoar</hi> invited the <hi>Saggamores</hi> to Dinner; but
when we went to get it ready, we found they had
stolen the greatest part of the Provision Mr. <hi>Hoar</hi>

they seemed to be ashamed of the fact,
and said it was <hi>Matchit Indians</hi> that did it. Oh
that we could believe that there is nothing too
hard for God! God shewed his Power over the

in his Holland Shirt, with great Laces sewed at
the tail of it, he had his <hi>Silver Buttons,</hi> his white
Stockings, his Garters hung round with <hi>Shillings,</hi>
and had Girdles of <hi>Wampom</hi> upon his head and

two other singing &amp; knocking on a Kettle for
their Musick. They kept hopping up and down
one after another, with a Kettle of Water in the

Mr. <hi>Hoar</hi> called his own <hi>Indians, Tom</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi>
and bid them all go, &amp; see if he would promise
it before them three; and if he would, he should
have it, which he did, and had it. <hi>Philip</hi> smell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the business, called me to him, and asked me
what I would give him, to tell me some good
News, and to speak a good word for me, that I
might go home to morrow? I told him I could
not tell what to give him, I would any thing I
had, and asked him what he would have? He
said two Coats, and <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> in Money,
half a bushel of Seed Corn, and some Tobacco.
I thanked him for his love, but I knew that <hi>good
News</hi> as well as that crafty Fox. My Master af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had had his <hi>Drink,</hi> quickly came ranting
into the <hi>Wigwam</hi> again, and called for Mr. <hi>Hoar,</hi>
drinking to him, and saying he was a <hi>good Man,</hi>
and then again he would say, hang him Rogue.
Being almost Drunk, he would drink to him, &amp;
yet presently say he should be hanged. Then
he called for me,; I trembled to hear him, and
yet I was fain to go to him; and he drank to

At last his Squaw ran out, &amp; he after her, round
the <hi>Wigwam,</hi> with his Money jing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Squaw he ran to her; and so through the Lord's
Mercy, we were no more troubled with him that
Night. Yet I had not a comfortable Nights rest;
for I think I can say, I did not sleep for three
Nights together. The Night before the Letter
came from the Council, I could not rest, I was
so full of fears and troubles; yea, at this time I
could not rest Night nor Day. The next Night
I was over-joy'd, Mr. <hi>Hoar</hi> being come, and that
with such good Tidings. The third Night I was
even swallowed up with the thoughts of going
home again, and that I must leave my Children
behind me in the Wilderness; so that sleep was
now almost departed from mine eyes.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Tuesday</hi> Morning they called their <hi>General

seemingly consented that I should go, except
<hi>Philip,</hi> who would not come among them.</p>
               <p>But before I go any farther, I would take
leave to mention a few remarkable Passages of
Providence, which I took special Notice of in
my afflicted time.</p>
               <p>1. Of the fair opportunity lost in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Enemy, and so near as to overtake several
and destroy them; and the Enemy in such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Food, that our Men might track them
by their rooting in the Earth for Ground-Nuts,
whilst they were flying for their lives; I say that
then our Army should want Provision, and be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to leave their pursuit, &amp; return homeward,
and the very next week the enemy came upon
our Town, like <hi>Bears</hi> bereft of their <hi>Whelps,</hi> or so
many Ravenous Wolves, rending us and our
Lambs to Death. But what shall I say? God
seemed to leave his People to themselves, and
ordered all things for his own holy ends. <hi>Shall
there be evil in the City and the Lord hath not done
it? They are not grieved for the Affliction of Ioseph,
therefore they shall go Captive, with the first that go
Captive. It is the Lords doing, and it should be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
in our eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I cannot but remember, how the <hi>Indians</hi>
derided the slowness and dulness of the <hi>English</hi>
Army in its setting out. For after the desolations
at <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Medfield,</hi> as I went along with
them, they asked me when I thought the <hi>English</hi>
Army would come after them? I told them I could
not tell. It may be they may come in <hi>May,</hi> said they
Thus did they scoff at us, as if the <hi>English</hi>
would be a quarter of a Year getting ready.</p>
               <p>3 Which also I have hinted before, when the
<hi>English</hi> Army with new Supplies were sent forth
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:002173_0068_0F52A9E820755F38"/>
to pursue after the Enemy, &amp; they understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, fled before them till they came to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaug</hi>
River, where they forthwith went over
safely; that that River should be impassible to
the <hi>English.</hi> I can but admire to see the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Providence of God in preserving the <hi>Heathen</hi>
for farther Affliction to our poor Country.
They could go in great Numbers over, but the
<hi>English</hi> must stop: God had an over-ruling hand
in all those things.</p>
               <p>4. It was thought, If their Corn were cut
down, they would starve and die with Hunger;
and all that could be found, was destroyed, and
they driven from that little they had in store, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Woods, in the midst of Winter; and yet
how to admiration did the Lord preserve them for
his holy ends, and the destruction of many still
among the <hi>English!</hi> strangely did the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for them, that I did not see (all the time
I was among them) one Man, Woman or Child
dye with Hunger. Though many times they
would eat that that a Hog or a Dog would
hardly touch; yet by that God strengthened
them to be a scourge to his People.</p>
               <p>Their chief &amp; commonest food was Ground-Nuts;
they ate also Nuts, and Acrons, Harty-choaks,
Lilly-roots, Ground-beans, and several
other Weeds and Roots, that I know not.</p>
               <p>They would pick up old Bones, and cut them
in pieces at the joynts, and if they were full of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:002173_0069_0F52A9E92652CA80"/>
Worms &amp; Magots, they would scald them over

boyl them, and drink up the Liquor, and then
beat the great ends of them in a Morter, and so
eat them. They would eat Horses Guts, &amp; Ears,

                  </gap> all sorts of wild Birds which they could
catch: Also Bear, Venson, Beavers, Tortois,
Frogs, Squirrils, Dogs, Skunks, Rattle-snakes:
Yea, the very Bark of Trees; besides all sorts
of Creatures, &amp; Provision which they plundered
from the <hi>English.</hi> I can but stand in admiration
to see the wonderful power of God, in providing
for such a vast number of our Enemies in the
Wilderness, where there was nothing to be seen,
but from hand to mouth. Many times in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the generality of them, would eat up all
they had, and yet have some further supply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
they wanted. It is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 13, 14.
<hi>Oh that my people had hearkened to, me, and Israel
had walked in my ways; I should soon have subdued
their Enemies, and turned my hand against their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.</hi>
But now our perverse and evil carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
in the sight of the Lord, have so offended
him, that instead of turning his hand against
them, the Lord feeds and nourishes the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> up to
be a scourge to the whole Land.</p>
               <p>5. Another thing that I would observe is, the
strange providence of God in turning things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
when the <hi>Indians were at the highest, and the
English at the lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without their fury, and some Desolation by <hi>Fire</hi>

for their own Losses, yet triumphed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
in their inhumane and devilish Cruelty
to the <hi>English.</hi> They would boast much of their
Victories; saying, that in two hours time, they

<hi>The bitterness of Death is past.</hi> Now the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
begin to think all is their own; &amp; the poor
<hi>Christians</hi> hopes to fail, (as to man) and now their
Eyes are more to God, and their Hearts sigh
Heaven-ward, and to say in good earnest, <hi>Help
Lord, or we perish.</hi> When the Lord had brought
his people to this, that they saw no help in any
thing but himself, then he takes the Quarrel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own hand; and tho' they had made a pit
(in their own imaginations) as deep as <hi>Hell</hi> for
the <hi>Christians</hi> that Summer, yet the Lord hurl'd
themselves into it. And the Lord had not so
many ways before to preserve them, but now
he hath as many to destroy them.</p>

But to return again to my going home; where
we may see a remarkable change of Providence:
At first they were all against it, except my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
would come for me; but afterward they
assented to it, and seemed to rejoyce in it: some
asking me to send them some Bread, others some
Tobacco, others shaking me by the hand, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me a <hi>Hood and Scarfe</hi> to Ride in: not one
moving Hand or Tong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e against it. Thus hath
the Lord answered my poor desires, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
earnest Requests of others put up unto God
for me. In my Travels an <hi>Indian</hi> came to me,
and told me, if I were willing, he and his Squaw
would run away, and go home along with me.
I told them no; I was not willing to run away, <hi>but</hi>
desired to wait Gods time, that I might go home
quietly, and without fear. And now God hath
gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed me my desire. O the wonderful Power
of God that I have seen, &amp; the Experiences that
I have had: I have been in the midst of those
Roaring Lions, and Salvage Bears, that feared
neither God, nor Man, nor the Devil, by Night
and Day, alone and in company; sleeping all sorts
together, and yet not one of them ever offered
the least abuse of Unchastity to me, in Word or
Action. Though some are ready to say, I speak
it for my own Credit; but I speak it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, and to his Glory. Gods Power is
as great now, as it was to save <hi>Daniel</hi> in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Den,</hi> or the three Children in the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:002173_0072_0F52A9EAF9B0D068"/>
I may well say as he, <hi>Psal. 170. 12. Oh

                     </gap>y
endureth for ever. Let the redeemed of the Lord
say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the
Enemy:</hi> Especially that I should come away in
the midst of so many hundreds of Enemies, and
not a Dog move his Tongue. So I took my leave
of them, &amp; in coming along, my Heart melted
into <hi>Tears</hi> more than all the <hi>while</hi> I was with them,
&amp; I was almost swallowed up with the thoughts
that ever I should go home again. About the
Suns going down, Mr. <hi>Hoar,</hi> my self, and the
two <hi>Indians,</hi> came to <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and a solemn
sight it was to me. There had I lived many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Years among my Relations and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
and now not one <hi>Christian</hi> to be seen,
nor one House left standing. We went on to a

all Night; and a comfortable Lodging we had,
though nothing but Straw to lye on. The Lord
preserved us in safety that Night, &amp; raised us up
again in the Morning, and carried us along, that
before Noon we came to <hi>Concord.</hi> Now was I
full of joy, and yet not without sorrow: Joy, to
see such a lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and some of them my Neighbours: There
I met with my Brother, and my Brother-in-law,
who asked me, if I knew where his Wife was?
poor heart! he had helped to bury her, &amp; knew
it not; she being shot down by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ouse, was
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002173_0073_0F52A9EC45EA1D48"/>
partly burnt, so that those who were at <hi>Boston</hi>
at the Desolation of the Town, and came back
afterward and buried the Dead, did not know
her. Yet I was not without Sorrow, to think how
many were looking and longing, and my own
Children among the rest, to enjoy that Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that I had now received; and I did not
know whither ever I should see them again. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
recruited with Food &amp; Raiment, we went to
<hi>Boston</hi> that Day; where I met with my dear Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
but the thoughts of our dear Children, one
being dead, &amp; the other we could not tell where,
abated our comfort each in other. I was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so much hem'd in by the merciless &amp; cruel
<hi>Heathen,</hi> but now as much with pitiful, tender-hearted
and compassionate <hi>Christians.</hi> In that
poor and beggerly condition, I was received in,
I was kindly entertained in several Houses: So
much Love I received from several, (many of
whom I knew not) that I am not capable to
declare it. But the Lord knows them all by
name: The Lord reward them seven fold into
their Bosoms of his Spirituals, for their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.
The <hi>Twenty Pounds,</hi> the price of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
was raised by some <hi>Boston</hi> Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and M. <hi>Usher,</hi> whose Bounty and Charity,
I would not forget to make mention of. Then
Mr. <hi>Thomas Shepard of Charlstown</hi> received us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his House, where we continued 11 Weeks;
and a Father and Mother they were unto us.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:002173_0074_0F52A9EC84104C68"/>
And many more tender-hearted Friends we met
with in that place. We were now in the midst
of Love, yet not without much and frequent
heaviness of Heart, for our poor Children, and
other Relations, who were still in Affliction.
The Week following, after my coming in, the
Governour and Council sent to the <hi>Indians</hi> again,
and that not without success; for they brought
in my Sister and good-wife <hi>Kettle.</hi> Their not
knowing where our Children were, was a sore
Trial to us still; and yet we were not without
secret hopes of seeing them again. That which
was dead lay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heavier upon my Spirit, than those
which were alive among the <hi>Heathen;</hi> thinking
how it suffered with its Wounds, and I was not
able to relieve it; and how it was buried by the
<hi>Heathen</hi> in the Wilderness from among all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
We were hurried up and down in our
Thoughts, sometime we should hear a Report
that they were gone this <hi>way,</hi> and sometimes
that; and that they were come in, in this place
or that. We kept inquiring and listning to hear
concerning them, but no certain News as yet.
About this time the Council had ordered a Day
of publick <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> though I thought I had
still cause of Mourning; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to see if we could hear any thing concerning

<hi>Ipswich</hi> and <hi>Rowly,</hi> we met with <hi>William Hubbard,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:002173_0075_0F52A9ED55ACFB10"/>
who told us our Son <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and my Sisters Son,
were come in to Major <hi>Waldren</hi>'s: I asked him
how he knew it? he said the Major himself told
him so. So along we went till we came to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi>
and their Minister being absent, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
my Husband to Preach the <hi>Thanksgiving</hi>
for them; but he was not willing to stay there
that Night, but would go over to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> to
hear farther, and come again in the Morning,
which he did, and preached there that Day.
At Night, when he had done, one came and told
him that his Daughter was come in at <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi>
Here was Mercy on both hands. Now
hath God fulfilled that precious Scripture, which
was such a comfort to me in my distressed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
When my heart was ready to sink into the
Earth, and my knees trembling under me, and
I was <hi>walking through the valley of the shadow of
Death:</hi> Then the Lord brought, and has now
fulfilled that reviving Word unto me, <hi>Thus saith
the Lord, Refrain thy Voice from Weeping, and thy
Eyes from Tears, for thy work shall be rewarded, saith
the Lord, and they shall come again from the Land
of the Enemy.</hi> Now we were between them, the
one on the <hi>East,</hi> and the other on the <hi>West;</hi> our
Son being nearest, we went to him first, to <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
where we met with him, and with the
Major also; who told us, he had done what he

Pounds,</hi> which the good People thereabouts were

pleased to pay. The Lord reward the Major, and
all the rest, tho' unknown to me, for their labour
of Love. My Sisters Son was redeemed for <hi>four
Pounds,</hi> which the Council gave order for the
payment of. Having now received one of our
Children, we hastned toward the other: Going

there on the Sabbath-day, for which they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
him manifold.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> we came to <hi>Charlstown,</hi> where we
heard that the Governour of <hi>Rhoad-Island</hi> had
sent over for our Daughter, to take care of her,
being now within his Jurisdiction; which
should not pass without our acknowledgements.
But she being nearer <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Newman</hi> went over and took care of her, &amp;
brought her to his own House. And the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God was admirable to us in our low
estate, in that he raised up passionate Friends on
every side, when we had nothing to recompence
any for their Love. The <hi>Indians</hi> were now gone
that way, that it was apprehended dangerous
to go to her; but the Carts which carried Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
to the <hi>English</hi> Army, being guarded,
brought her with them to <hi>Dorchester,</hi> where we
received her safe; blessed be the Lord for it, <hi>for

She was travelling one day with the <hi>Indians,</hi>
with her Basket at her back; the company of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:002173_0077_0F52A9EECD5EC678"/>
were got before her, and gone out of fight,
all except one Squaw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She followed the Squaw
till night, and then both of them lay down,
having nothing over them but the Heavens, nor
under them but the Earth. Thus she travelled 3
days together, having nothing to eat or drink
but Water and green <hi>Hirtle-berries.</hi> At last they
came into <hi>Providence,</hi> where she was kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by several of that Town. The <hi>Indians</hi>
often said, that I should never have her under
<hi>twenty Pounds,</hi> but now the Lord hath brought
her in upon free-cost, and given her to me the
second time. The Lord make us a Blessing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
each to others. Now have I seen that <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
also fulfilled, <hi>Deut. 30. 4, 7. If any of thine be
driven out to the utmost parts of Heaven, from thence
will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence
will I fetch thee. And the Lord thy God will put all
these Curses upon thine enemies, and on them which
hate thee, which persecuted thee.</hi> Thus hath the
Lord brought me and mine out of that horrible
pit, &amp; hath set us in the midst of tender-hearted
and compassionate Christians. 'Tis the desire of
my Soul, that we may walk worthy of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
received, and which we are receiving.</p>
               <p>Our Family being now gathered together, the
<hi>South</hi> Church in <hi>Boston</hi> hired an House for us:
Then we removed from Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>'s (those
cordial Friends) and went to <hi>Boston,</hi> where we
continued about three quarters of a Year. Still
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:002173_0078_0F52A9EF7B0F1078"/>
the Lord went along with us, and provided
graciously for us. I thought it somewhat strange
to set up House-keeping with bare Walls, but as
<hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>Money answers all things:</hi> And that
we had through the Benevolence of <hi>Christian</hi>
Friends, some in this Town, and some in that,
and others; and some from <hi>England,</hi> that in a
little time we might look and see the House
furnished with Love. The Lord hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
good to us in our low estate, in that
when we had neither house nor home, nor other
necessaries, the Lord so moved the Hearts of
these and those towards us, that that we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
neither Food nor Raiment for our selves or
ours, Prov. 18. 24. <hi>There is a Friend that sticketh
closer than a Brother.</hi> And how many such Friends
have we found, and now living amongst! and
truly such a Friend have we found him to be
unto us, in whose House we lived, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Iames Whitcomb,</hi> a Friend near hand, and afar of.</p>
               <p>I can remember the time, when I used to sleep
quietly without workings in my thoughts, whole
Nights together; but now it is otherwise with
me. When all are fast about me, and no eye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
but his who ever waketh, my thoughts are
upon things past, upon the awful dispensations
of the Lord towards us; upon his wonderful
power and might in carrying of us through so
many difficulties, in returning us in safety, and
suffering none to hurt us. I remember in the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:002173_0079_0F52A9F066A09490"/>
night season, how the other day I was in the
midst of thousands of enemies, and nothing but
Death before me: It was then hard work to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my self, that ever I should be satisfied
with Bread again. But now we are fed with the
finest of the <hi>Wheat,</hi> and (as I may say) with <hi>Honey
out of the Rock:</hi> Instead of the <hi>Husks,</hi> we had the
<hi>Fatted Calf:</hi> The thoughts of these things in the
particulars of them, and of the love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> towards us, make it true of me,
what <hi>David</hi> said of himself, <hi>Psal. 6. 6. I water
my Couch with my Tears.</hi> Oh the wonderful power
of God that mine eyes have seen, affording mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enough for my thoughts to run in, that when
others are sleeping mine eyes are weeping.</p>
               <p>I have seen the extream vanity of this World:
One hour I have been in Health, and Wealth,
wanting nothing, but the next hour in Sickness,
and Wounds, and Death, having nothing but
Sorrow and Affliction. Before I knew what
Affliction meant, I was ready sometimes to wish
for it. When I lived in prosperity, having the
comforts of this World about me, my Relations
by me, and my Heart chearful, and taking little
care for any thing; and yet seeing many (whom
I preferred before my self) under many Trials
and Afflictions, in sickness, weakness, poverty,
losses, crosses, and cares of the World, I should
be sometimes jealous lest I should have my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this Life; and that Scripture would come
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:002173_0080_0F52A9F16C0276D8"/>
to my mind, <hi>Heb. 12. 6 For whom the Lord loveth
he chasteneth, and scourgeth every Son whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth.</hi>
But now I see the Lord had his time to
scourge and chasten me. The portion of some is
to have their Affliction by drops, but the <hi>Wine of
astonishm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt,</hi> like a <hi>sweeping Rain, that leaveth no
Food,</hi> did the Lord prepare to be my portion.
Affliction I wanted, and Affliction I had, full
measure, pressed down and running over: Yet I
see when God calls a person to never so many
Difficulties, yet he is able to carry them through,
&amp; make them say, they have been gainers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
And I hope I can say in some measure, as
<hi>David, It is good for me that I have been afflicted.</hi> The
Lord hath shewed me the vanity of these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things; that they are the <hi>Vanity of vanities,
and vexation of Spirit:</hi> That they are but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
a blast, a bubble, and things of no conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.
If trouble from smaller matters begin
to arise in me, I have something at hand to
check my self with, and say, Why am I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled?
It was but the other day, that if I had
had the World, I would have given it for my
Freedom, or to have been a Servant to a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi>
I have learned to look beyond present
and smaller Troubles, and to be quieted under
them, as <hi>Moses</hi> said, <hi>Exod. 14. 13. Stand still, and
see the Salvation of the Lord.</hi>
