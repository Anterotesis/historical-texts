            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Proviſion from the Truſtees, yet treated in a Manner unbecoming even Heathens. Was all the Money I have collected, to be ſpent in freeing theſe Three Children from Slavery, it would be well laid out.

               <p>This Day I began the Cotton Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factury; and agreed with a Woman to teach the litle Ones to ſpin and card.

Tho' there are fewer Inhabitants, yet, I think the People are in a better Situation than when I was here laſt. They now live independant on a Publick Store, Proviſions (Flour eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) are much cheaper; Cattle more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; and by the Divine Bleſſing, if any Manufacture can be raiſed amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

to prevent their exporting ſo much Money, they may yet do well. I bleſs GOD! My Congregations are as large as uſual. The Court-Houſe is generally full, and I keep as near as may be to my old Way of Proceeding. We have the Sacrament every Sunday, and publick Prayer and Expoſition twice every Day in the Week. <hi>The LORD bleſs my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and grant the Inhabitants may know the Things which belong to their Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are eternally hid from their Eyes!</hi>

                  <hi>Wednesday, January</hi> 30. Went to Day with the Carpenter and Surveyor, and laid out the Ground whereon the Orphan-Houſe is to be built. It is to be ſixty feet long, and forty wide: A Yard and Garden before and behind: The Foundation is to be Brick, and is to be ſunk four Feet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and raiſed three Feet above the Ground, which is intended for a Cellar and other convenient Places. The Houſe is to be two Story, with a Hip-Roof, the Firſt ten the Second nine Foot high. In all there will be near twenty commodious Rooms. Behind are two ſmall Houſes, the one for an Infirmary, the other for a Charity-School for the poor Children of the Town that are not Orphans; for I intend to take in ſome of them, as my Stock will admit. There is alſo to be a Still-Houſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004636_0006_100DB4DBCD88B8C0"/>
built for the Apothecary. — And I truſt, 'ere my return to <hi>England,</hi> I ſhall ſee my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Family quite ſettled in it. I find it will be an expenſive Work: But it is for the LORD CHRIST; He will take care to defray all Charges.— The Money that will be ſpent on this Occaſion, will keep many Families from leaving the Colony; and in all Probability bring many others over.— There are near thirty working at the Plantation already, and I would employ as many more, if they could be got.— Whatſoever is done for GOD ought to be done ſpeedily, as well as with all our Might.</p>

GOD was pleaſed to give me much Freedom, and the People ſeem'd very attentive—Dined with the General. Intended to go to St. <hi>Simons</hi> to the Soldiery; but it being too late to go there and preach, I thought it adviſeable to preach a ſecond Time at <hi>Frederica.</hi> The General, Soldiers and People attended very orderly.

met with a cool Reception. After I had been there a little while, I told him, That I was inform'd, he had ſome Queſtions to propoſe to me, and that I was now come to give him all the Satisfaction I could in anſwering them. Upon this I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately perceived Paſſion begin to ariſe in his Heart,—
<q>Yes Sir, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I have ſeveral Queſtions to put to you, but, <hi>added he,</hi> you are got above us,</q>
or ſomething to that Purpoſe. Then he charged me with <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> and Pride, for ſpeaking againſt the Generality of the Clergy, and deſired I would make my Charge good. I told him, I thought I had already; but, as yet, I had ſcarce begun with them. He then aſked me, Wherein were the Clergy ſo much to blame? I anſwered, they did not preach up <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith alone</hi>: And, upon talking with the Commiſſary, I found he was as ignorant of it as any of the reſt.

me. I replied, I ſhall regard that as much as I would a Pope's Bull. But, Sir, ſays I, why ſhould you be offended at my ſpeaking againſt the Generality of the Clergy, for I always ſpoke worthily of you?—I might as well be offended, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my Brother, at your ſaying, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of People were notorious Sinners, and might come to accuſe you, for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil of me, becauſe I was one of the People. I further added, Sir, you did not behave thus, when I was with you laſt. No, ſays he, you did not ſpeak againſt the Clergy; or ſome ſuch Thing. Becauſe, replied I, more Light has been given me ſince that time: But if you will make an Application to yourſelf, be pleaſed, Sir, to let me aſk you one Queſtion.
<q>Have you delivered your Soul, by exclaiming againſt the Aſſemblies and Balls here? What, Sir, <hi>ſays he,</hi> muſt you come to catechiſe me? No, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I have not exclaim'd againſt them; I think there is no Harm in them. Then, Sir, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> I ſhall think it my Duty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt you. Then, Sir, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, (in a very great Rage)</hi> get you out of my Houſe.</q>
Upon which I made my Bow, and, with my Friends, took my Leave, pitying the Commiſſary, who I really tho't was more noble than to

After this, we went to publick Prayer, dined at a Friend's Houſe, drank Tea with the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Miniſter, and preached about 4 in the Afternoon, to a large Auditory in his Meeing-Houſe.

I was led out to ſhew the utter Inability of Man to ſave himſelf, and the abſolute Neceſſity of his depending on the rich and ſovereign Grace of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, in order to be reſtored to his primitive Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Some, I obſerv'd, were put under Concern, and moſt ſeem'd willing to know, whether thoſe Things were ſo. In

the Evening I preach'd again, in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant</hi> Meeting-Houſe, to a more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Auditory than ever: And had the Pleaſure afterwards of Finding, that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, whoſe whole Family has been carried away for ſome time with Deiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principles, began now to be unhinged, and to ſee that there was no Reſt in ſuch a Scheme, for a fallen Creature to rely on.

A good Part of the Foundation is dug, and many Thouſands of Brick ready for Uſe. Near Forty Children are now under my Care, and near an Hundred Mouths are daily ſupplied with Food from our Store. The Expence is great, but our great and good GOD, I am perſuaded, will enable me to defray it. As yet I am kept from the

Many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeeing me go in, followed me, and Numbers of them told me afterwards, the Commiſſary, tho' undeſignedly, had confirmed them more and more in the Truths which I had delivered. In the Evening I preached from the ſame Words, to about Fifteen Thouſand Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and conſuted the falſe Doctrines and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004636_0035_100DB52B68585A98"/>
many fundamental Errors contained in the Commiſſary's Diſcourſe; for he all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long took Faith to be only an Aſſent to the Truths of the Goſpel. He ſaid St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> ſpoke of the ſame Kind of <hi>Juſtification</hi>; that <hi>Works</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> were only the Works of the ceremonial Law; that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of an <hi>imputed Righteouſneſs</hi> had done much Harm, and hindred the Converſion of the Heathens; that we were to be juſtified by our Works at the laſt Day, and conſequently were to be juſtified in the ſame Manner now. To all theſe Things I endeavour'd to anſwer diſtinctly, and was obliged, in the Concluſion of my Diſcourſe, to tell the People, ſince CHRIST was not preached in the Church, they might go hear him preach'd where they could. After Sermon we collected <hi>Eighty Pounds</hi> Currency, for my Children at <hi>Georgia</hi>; and came Home rejoicing in Spirit, to ſee how <hi>Satan</hi> was continually bruiſing his own Head. Little do my Enemies think what Service they do me; if they did, one would think, out of Spite they would even deſiſt from oppoſing me. <hi>Oh what a good Maſter is</hi> JESUS CHRIST!</p>

Afterwards I began to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Money from private Hands, for my Orphans, and met with Succeſs. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD, who has the Hearts of all Men in his Hands!</hi> — Dined at Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s, but was obliged to retire as ſoon as Dinner was over; for my Body was weak, and my Soul was in an unſpeakable Agony for near an Hour. At length I dropped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, but roſe about Five in the Evening, and preached to upwards of Six or Seven

                  <hi>Thurſday, May</hi> 1.

               <p>At our coming to <hi>Flat-Buſh</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters received me with all Civility, and gave me the Uſe of their Church.

<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004636_0058_100DB5649475CEE8"/>
to bring home by my Preaching, when here laſt. The Account he gave of GOD's dealing with him, was very ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory. He is juſt come from the <hi>Indian</hi> Natives, where he has been praying with and exhorting all he met with, that were willing to hear. Some of the <hi>Indians</hi> he had Hopes of, but his Brother Traders en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prejudice them againſt him: However, by my Advice, he propoſes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting them again next Fall; and I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope the LORD will open a Door a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the poor Heathen. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of one of their Traders, I take to be one great Step towards it. <hi>LORD carry on the Work begun; fulfil thy ancient Promiſes, and let thy Son have the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the utmoſt Parts of the Earth for his Poſſeſſion.

               <p>Converſed alſo with a poor Negro Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who has been viſited in a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Manner. GOD was pleaſed to convert her by my Preaching the laſt Fall; But being under Dejections on Sunday-Morning, ſhe prayed that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might come to her Heart, and that the LORD would be pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf to her Soul that Day. While ſhe was at Meeting, hearing one Mr. <hi>M—n,</hi> a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Preacher, whom the LORD has
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:004636_0059_100DB5666D93E478"/>
been pleaſed lately to ſend forth, the Word came with ſuch Power upon her Heart, that at laſt ſhe was obliged to cry out; and a great Concern alſo fell upon many in the Congregation, ſo that they betook themſelves to ſecret Prayer. The Miniſter ſtopped, and ſeveral perſuaded her to hold her Peace; but the Glory of the LORD ſhone ſo brightly round about her, that ſhe could not help bleſſing and praiſing GOD, and telling how GOD was revealing himſelf to her Soul. After ſome time, ſhe was taken out of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe, but ſhe fell upon her Knees praiſing and bleſſing GOD. She conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in an Agony for ſome conſiderable Time, and afterwards came in and heard the remaining Part of the Sermon. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſince this, have called her mad, and ſaid ſhe was full of new Wine: But, the Account ſhe gave me of herſelf, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and ſolid; and I believe, in that Hour the LORD JESUS took greater Poſſeſſion of her Soul. Such Caſes are not very common; but when an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Work is carrying on, GOD ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally manifeſts himſelf to ſome Souls in this extraordinary Manner. And I doubt not, but when the poor Negroes are to be called, GOD will highly ſavour them, <hi>to wipe off their Reproach, and to ſhew that

               </p>
               <p>Preached in the Morning, about 11, to 6 or 7000 People. Had great Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Spirit, and clear'd myſelf from ſome Aſperſions that had been caſt upon my Doctrine, as though it tended to <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi>: But I abhor the Tho'ts of it; and, whoſoever entertains the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of <hi>Free Grace</hi> in an honeſt Heart, will find, that they will in their own Nature cauſe him to be fruitful in every good Word and Work. Many expreſſed how the Power of GOD was amongſt them; and I believe GOD has much People in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> City. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations are very large and ſerious, and I have ſcarce preach'd this Time among them, but I have ſeen a ſtirring among the dry Bones.

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004636_0062_100DB56D67CD06A0"/>
Expectation, my Soul was ſo carried out, that I had not Time to talk at all. A wonderful Power was in the Room, and with one Accord they began to cry out, and weep moſt bitterly, for the Space of half an Hour. They ſeem'd to be under the ſtrongeſt Convictions, and did indeed ſeek JESUS ſorrowing. Their Cries might be heard a great Way off. When I had done, I thought proper to leave them at their Devotion. They continued in Prayer (as I was informed by one of them afterwards) for above an Hour, confeſſing their moſt ſecret Faults; and at length the Agonies of ſome were ſo ſtrong, that Five of them fell into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion Fits. The preſent Captain of our Sloop going near the Water-ſide, was called into a Company almoſt in the ſame Circumſtances: And at Midnight I was deſired to come to one, who was thrown into ſtrong Convulſions; but felt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Peace and Joy, after I had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her ſeveral Times. — Her Caſe put me in Mind of the young Man whom the Devil tore when he was coming to JESUS CHRIST. Theſe bodily Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I believe, come from the Devil, who, now the Work of GOD is going on, wants to bring an evil Report upon it. <hi>But, O LORD, for thy Mercies Sake,

                  <hi>Sunday, May</hi> 11. Preached in the Morning to about Fifteen Thouſand Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and obſerved a great Melting to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Word. Went twice to Church, and heard myſelf laſh'd by the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who preach'd from theſe Words,
<q>I bear them Record, they have a Zeal of GOD, but not according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</q>
I could have wiſhed he had conſidered the next Words, <hi>For they being ignorant of GOD's Righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of GOD.</hi> Had he conſidered theſe, I might juſty have ſaid, <hi>Speaketh Mr. Commiſſary of this falſe Zeal, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to himſelf, or of ſome other Man?</hi> In the Afternoon, the <hi>Tenth</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> out of which his Text was taken, was appointed for the Leſſon; and had he not been more perverſe than <hi>Balaam,</hi> it muſt have reſtrained the Bitterneſs of this falſe Prophet. But he exclaimed loudly againſt me in the Pulpit; and, as I ſoon found, obliged many of his Hearers to do what they before were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to, I mean, reſolve to leave him
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:004636_0064_100DB573193333D0"/>
entirely. <hi>I bear him Record,</hi> that Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will ſoon convince him, <hi>that</hi> whatever mine be, his own <hi>Zeal</hi> is by no means <hi>according to Knowledge.</hi> After he had done, I preached my Farewel-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to I believe very near Twenty Thouſand Hearers. As the Commiſſary's Sermon was chiefly full of perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, I did not render Railing for Railing: However, I thought it my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in an eſpecial Manner, to recommend Meſſrs. <hi>Tennents</hi> and their Aſſociates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt worthy Preachers of our dear LORD JESUS. One Paſſage out of the ſecond Leſſon in the Morning much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me,
<q>And the LORD had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the Multitude, becauſe they were ſcatter'd abroad, as Sheep having no Shepherd.</q>
I then reminded them of our LORD's Command, <hi>Pray ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the LORD of the Harveſt, that he may thruſt out Labourers into his Harveſt; for tho' the Harveſt is ſo great, yet the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers are very few.</hi> The poor People were much concern'd at my bidding them farewel: And after I had taken my Leave, Oh how many came to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſorrowing, moſt of all, that they were likely to ſee my Face no more for a long Seaſon. I believe near Fifty Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes came to give me Thanks, under
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:004636_0065_100DB574A1529FD8"/>
GOD, for what has been done to their Souls. Oh how heartily did thoſe poor Creatures throw in their Mites for my poor Orphans. Some of them have been effectually wrought upon, and in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Manner. Many of them have now begun to learn to read; and one that was free, ſaid, ſhe would give me her two Children, whenever I ſettled my School. I believe Maſters and Miſtreſſes will ſhortly ſee, that Chriſtianity will not make their Negroes worſe Slaves. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, had Time permitted, to have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled a Society for Negro Men and Negro Women; but that muſt be deferred till it ſhall pleaſe GOD to bring me to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> again. I have been much drawn out in Prayer for them, and have ſeen them exceedingly wrought upon, under the Word preach'd. I cannot well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, how many others, of all Sorts, came to give me a laſt Farewel: And, indeed, I never yet ſaw a more general Awakening in any Place. Religion is all the Talk; and, I think, I can ſay, the LORD JESUS hath gotten himſelf the Victory in many Hearts. I have ſcarce had time to eat Bread, from Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till Evening. Some one or other was generally applying to me under deep Soul-Concern, and others continually preſſing
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004636_0066_100DB576C4C88C60"/>
upon me, to baptize their little Infants. I did comply with as many as I could; but I was obliged ſometimes to ſay, The LORD ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel. Many of the <hi>Quakers</hi> have been moſt powerfully convinced of the Righteouſneſs of JESUS CHRIST, and openly profeſs the Truth as it is in JESUS; for which, I believe, they will be ſhortly thruſt out of their Synagogues. Some of their head Men are zealous againſt me, and are much afraid their Foundation will be ſadly ſhaken. Great Numbers of the Inhabitants would have immediately built me a very large Church, if I would have conſented; but I am perſwaded, the LORD would have the Goſpel preached in the Fields, and building a Church, would, I believe, inſenſibly lead the People into Bigotry, and make 'em place the Church again, as they have done for a long Time, in the Church Walls: — For theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I declined it, tho' notwithſtanding, I believe they will build ſome Place or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. What I moſtly fear is, now there is ſuch a general Awakening, People will not know where to go for proper Food (for they will no longer take up with Huſks, as they have done) and then fall into different Sets and Parties. <hi>LORD JESUS look upon them, let not Satan divide
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004636_0067_100DB578E943D3D8"/>
them again, but raiſe them up Paſtors after thy own Heart, for thy infinite Mercies Sake!</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
               <p>With Preaching, Praying and Adviſing, I was truly weary by Eight at Night: However, I went and baptized Two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: took my Leave of both the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and I had not prayed long in the Women's Society, but two of them fell again into violent Fits, ſo that I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to leave them. At my Return Home, I ſupped with a Chriſtian Friend, and went to Bed aſtoniſh'd at, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be humbly thankful for the great Things the LORD has done for me at <hi>Philadelphia. Bleſſed be the LORD GOD of Iſrael, for he hath wonderfully viſited this People, and raiſed up for them Means of Salvation, from whence it was leaſt expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!

                  <hi>Monday, May</hi> 12. Roſe very early, to anſwer thoſe who came for private Advice. Viſited Three Perſons, one of which was under ſuch violent Convictions, that ſhe had not eat above an Ounce of Bread for near a Fortnight; another had a Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Hell ſet before her laſt Night, in the moſt terrifying Colours; but before the Morning, received Comfort. When
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004636_0068_100DB57B0B0D0678"/>
I came to my Lodgings, my Friends were waiting to accompany me on Horſeback, and great Numbers of the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were crowding at the Door. About Nine I left <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> and when I came to the Ferry, was told, People had been croſſing over, as faſt as Two Boats could carry them, ever ſince Three in the Morning: After we had waited ſome Time, I and my Friends got over, and preach'd at <hi>Darby,</hi> Seven Miles from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> to about Four Thouſand Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Sweetly did the LORD aſſiſt me in ſpeaking to them, and I believe many of the Hearers Hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were ready to break, for they wept much. After Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and eating a little Food, I took Leave of many, then preach'd at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> about 9 Miles off, to about Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; and collected there and at <hi>Darby</hi> upwards of <hi>Forty Pounds</hi> for the Orphans. Here alſo I parted with more Friends; but ſeveral went with me, after Sermon, to <hi>Wilmington,</hi> Fifteen Miles from <hi>Cheſter.</hi> We got in about Eleven at Night. My Body was ſomewhat weak, but GOD ſtrengthned me to pray, ſing Pſalms with, and exhort a Room full of People, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Hour; and then I lay at a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s Houſe, who, I believe, was a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian indeed, and, as I obſerved before,

denied the Uſe of the Pulpit by one of his own Brethren, and was obliged to preach in the Woods, where the LORD manifeſted forth his Glory, and cauſed many to cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved</hi>? It ſurprized me to ſee ſuch a great Multitude gathered together at ſo ſhort a Warning, and in ſuch a Deſart-Place. I believe they were near Twelve Thouſand Hearers.

the People. Look where I would, moſt were drowned in Tears. The Word was <hi>ſharper than a two-edged Sword</hi>: And their bitter Yellings and Groans put me much in Mind of the Shriekings and Howlings of the Damned in Hell. Oh what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Viſages were then to be ſeen! — Some had their Mouths half open; others pale as Death; others wringing their Hands; others lying on the Ground; others ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Arms of their Friends; and moſt lifting up their Eyes towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and crying out to GOD. I could think of Nothing when I looked upon them ſo much as the Great Day. They ſeem'd like Perſons awak'ned by the laſt Trump, and coming out of their Graves to Judgment. One would imagine none but a Devil incarnate could have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Power, or avoid crying out. <hi>Surely GOD is in this Place.</hi> — And yet one Mr. <hi>Al—ſon,</hi> a Diſſenting Miniſter, a virulent Oppoſer of Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> and his Brethren, after Sermon was over, whilſt Thouſands were under the deepeſt Diſtreſs of Soul, came, deſiring to have a publick Diſputation.

I told him, if he was a ſpiritual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he would have known there was a Time, when GOD withdraws his ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Preſence from a Believer's Soul; and yet, that Soul might be kept from Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Intereſt in CHRIST. He was then about to quote ſome other Paſſage of Scripture; but by this Time the People were exaſperated at his ill Treatment of me, and one <hi>cried out in his Haſte,</hi> That he would take Mr. <hi>Al—ſon</hi> out of the Place: For this, I rebuked him ſharply, ſaying, <hi>That was not the Spirit of</hi> CHRIST; and, at the ſame time, blamed Mr. <hi>A—n,</hi> for coming at ſuch an improper Time to diſpute, when he ſaw the Power of GOD ſo viſibly amongſt us.

make, I would anſwer them as I rode to <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> or in a Letter, if he would ſend his Objections to me. Upon this he ſeem'd ſenſible of his Fault, and ſaid, he thought 'twas beſt to withdraw. With great Difficulty I got upon a Horſe, for the poor convicted Souls hung upon me; and after I had given them a ſhort Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to anſwer thoſe that oppoſed themſelves with Meekneſs and Fear, I rode to a Friend's Houſe, who had invited me to Dinner, where we all rejoiced, to find what a Fool the Devil and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that I brought over, was enabled to wreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with GOD exceedingly, both for himſelf and others. About Four GOD gave me to pray intenſly and particularly, with ſtrong Crying and Tears, for my Friends who were in the Room with me. Many came into the Paſſage near us, and wept much before the LORD, labouring much in their Souls. After this I went up and prayed, for near half an Hour, with ſome of the Women of the Houſe, and three Girls, who ſeemed to be weary with the Weight of their Sins. But when we were at publick Prayer, the HOLY GHOST ſeem'd to come into the Congregation, like a mighty ruſhing Wind, carrying all before it. I was ſo carried out in my Expoſition, that the Sweat poured moſt plentifully from my Face, till my Animal-Spirits were almoſt exhauſted. I had not begun long, before ſeveral began to cry ſorely, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſtill encreaſed, till young Men and Maidens, old Men and Children, were all diſſolved into Tears, and mourning after JESUS. I believe there was ſcarce half a Dozen in the whole Congregation, but what were deeply affected. I think I never ſaw the like before; it amazed me, and I think it muſt have affected the Heart of any one, not quite dead to GOD, to

behold the little Lambs crying moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly: And what was more extraordinary, after Church ſeveral of my Pariſhioners, all the Family, and my little Children, came crying along the Street; and many could not avoid Praying very loud. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come Home, I laid myſelf on the Bed, weak in Body and aſtoniſh'd at the Power of GOD; but finding ſo many come up in ſuch a Condition, I roſe from the Bed, and betook myſelf unto Prayer again; but had not I lifted up my Voice like a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, the Groans and Cries of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and People would have prevented my being heard. This continued for near an Hour, till at laſt, finding their Concern rather increaſe than abate, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired all to retire. — But Oh! how was I delighted afterwards, to hear ſome or other praying moſt intenſively to GOD in every Corner of the Houſe; and it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me to hear what a Spirit of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was put into the Hearts of ſome of the Boys and Girls. It happened alſo to thunder and lighten, which added much to the Solemnity of the Night, and reminded us more of the Coming of the Son of Man. After my Pariſhioners were gone, and my Family retir'd for about an Hour; when I thought their Spirits were compoſed, I called all together, and ſung
