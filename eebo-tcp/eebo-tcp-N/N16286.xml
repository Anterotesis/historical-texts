            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>IN every part of theſe ſtates the great <hi>ſcarcity of money</hi> is become a common ſubject of complaint. This does not ſeem to be an imaginary grievance, like that of <hi>hard times,</hi> of which men have complained in all ages of the world; the misfortune is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and in many caſes it is ſeverely felt. The ſcarcity of money is ſo great, or the difficulty of paying debts has been ſo common, that riots and combinations have been formed in many places, and the operations of civil government have been ſuſpended: this is the more remarkable, becauſe three years have not paſſed ſince money was very plenty. A calamity of ſuch magnitude has deſervedly drawn the attention of every legiſlature in the union. In ſome of the ſtates paper money has been coined as the beſt or the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient remedy by which the ſufferings of the people can be relieved. The general aſſembly of the ſtate of North-Carolina has already had recourſe to two emiſſions of paper. Certainly when any article is ſcarce, the general remedy is, <hi>to make more;</hi> and if it ſhall be found, when money is ſcarce, that private and public debts can be honeſtly diſcharged by a new coinage of paper, the expedient is admirable, for it is the moſt eaſy proceſs by which debts were ever paid. This however, is a ſubject on which many doubts have ariſen. It is not queſtioned whether there are means by which we may be enabled to diſcharge our debts and become opulent and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, but there are many who believe that our debts cannot be fairly diſcharged, nor our citizens relieved, much leſs can they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich by the manufacture of paper money. It has alſo been my lot to entertain ſome doubts, whether the regulations have hitherto been adopted for preſerving juſtice, for relieving the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and for ſecuring the proſperity of the ſtate;—theſe doubts have given riſe to the preſent addreſs.</p>

This is a queſtion, my fellow citizens, that claims your utmoſt attention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for no ſubject of equal importance has been preſented to your view ſince the declaration of independence. We are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conſider whether the adminiſtration of government, in theſe infant ſtates, is to be a ſyſtem of patch-work, and a ſeries of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients—Whether a youthful empire is to be ſupported, like the walls of a tottering ancient palace by ſhores and temporary props, or by meaſures which may prove effectual and laſting—meaſures which may improve by uſe, and ſtrengthen by age. We are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conſider whether we ſhall deſerve to be the moſt poor, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and contemptible, or the moſt flouriſhing, independent and happy nation on the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>The reader is not intereſted in knowing who the writer of this letter may be; a bad argument is not mended by the ſuppoſed abilities of its author, and a good argument does not require paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſupport. In the mean while he counts it his duty to declare, and he does it with humble gratitude, that his complaints are not occaſioned by perſonal misfortunes; but he finds himſelf a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a great family; he intereſts himſelf as a brother in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his fellow citizens, and he ſuffers when they are grieved.</p>
               <p>The more I conſider the progreſs of credit, and the increaſe of wealth in foreign nations, the more fully am I convinced that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money muſt prove hurtful to this country; that we cannot be relieved from our debts except by promoting domeſtic manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that during the prevailing ſcarcity of money, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the poor may be relieved by altering the mode of taxation. Here are three ſeparate and diſtinct propoſitions; they ſhall be conſidered apart, in order that each of them may fall or ſtand by its own weakneſs or ſtrength.</p>
               <p>In public meaſures as in the conduct of private life, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly be found that <hi>"honeſty is the beſt policy;"</hi> this maxim is ſomewhat old, but it is not become uſeleſs. A paper currency, which is a legal tender, even when it may have depreciated 20 or 30 per cent. is not generally conſidered as an honeſt tender, and there are many reaſons for believing that ſuch a currency will not finally prove uſeful to the ſtates. I ſay it has not generally been conſidered an <hi>honeſt</hi> tender. There are many people who ſay the money ought not to have depreciated; they ſay that neceſſity juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the manufacture, and that we are bound to receive ſuch pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the law preſcribes: but I never have heard any man ſay that it would be perfect juſtice to paſs a law, by which every cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor ſhould be compelled to receive three fourths or two thirds of his debt inſtead of the whole debt; and yet ſuch a law would be perfectly ſimilar to the tender of depreciated paper, except that it would be a proof of more frugality and plain dealing; for it would
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:020887_0004_0FB1492423FF9B50"/>
he calling things by the right name, and would ſave the expence of paper coinage.</p>
               <p>However convenient depreciated paper may appear to thoſe who uſe it in the diſcharge of debts, we have already diſcovered that the credit and finances of This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are injured by paper curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and we ſhall certainly continue to ſuffer, unleſs we can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from it. There has ever been found much difficulty in ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the prejudices of education. We have been accuſtomed to the uſe of paper money while we continued a depending province; ſuch a currency was properly calculated to prevent the growth of manufactures, and to continue our dependence and poverty. Surely under a change of circumſtances there ſhould be a change of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; we ought now to conſult our own proſperity, and not the emolument of Great Britain, or any other kingdom. If we are willing to take a leſſon from other governments, we ſhall find that money is not to be made out of paper, for there is not an empire, kingdom or ſtate under the ſun where debts may be legally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by paper money, except in ſome of the united ſtates of America. It is admitted that a paper medium, under the form of bank notes or government ſecurities, is circulated in France, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Holland, and moſt other commercial countries; but nobody is compelled by law to receive the payment of any debt in ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; hence it is, that the paper of thoſe countries bears no reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to our's, except in name. Every man receives a bank note or refuſes it at pleaſure; when he receives it, he knows that on the next hour he may have it changed for gold or ſilver, as the bank is obliged to make ſuch payments on demand. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon bank notes, being portable, are frequently preferred to coin of the weighty metals. But it never was found that bank notes could be circulated at par, unleſs when it was believed that they might be exchanged for ſolid money; nor could they be circulated, if they were declared to be a legal tender. The reaſon is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous—the whole value of paper is imaginary, and men do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by compulſion. Every attempt to force a man to believe that paper is equal in value to ſilver, implies a conſciouſneſs that it is not equal. It injures what it was intended to ſave. Though the paper money which had been emitted in North Carolina in the year 1783, had depreciated 20 per cent. arguments were invented on the laſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> year for making more money. It was alledged that under the regal government a greater ſum of money had been circulated without much depreciation, and conſequently a ſecond coinage might take place; it would not depreciate. This argument was plauſible, but not ſolid; for the value of paper is never found to depend on the quantity in circulation, but on the ſecurity that appears for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. The bank of England, which belongs to a company
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020887_0005_0FB14925A47BA150"/>
of private ſubjects, circulates notes to the amount of thirty two millions of dollars, though it is not believed that they have above fourteen millions in ſpecie at any time on hands; but every man can get money for his note when he demands it. In the year 1716, ſoon after the death of Lewis the XIVth, the celebrated John Law, in company with ſome other gentlemen, obtained a patent for a banking houſe at Paris. They iſſued notes in which they promiſed <hi>to pay the bearer, on ſight,</hi> a certain ſum, <hi>in gold and ſilver of the weight and fineneſs</hi> then <hi>eſtabliſhed by law.</hi> As the late King had altered the weight or quality of the current coin ten times during his reign, and the ſame thing might be done again, Law's notes, which were not ſubject to depreciation, were preferred to ſpecie at one per cent. Such were the effects of a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in good payment. Within the ſpace of four years, notes were iſſued by Law and company to the amount of 225 millions of dollars, which was near twice as much as all the ſpecie in France; but the notes retained their credit, becauſe the company were thought to be honeſt and able to pay. On the twenty firſt of May, 1721, the Duke of Orleans, regent of France, iſſued a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, by which he reduced the value of bank notes to half the nominal ſum. They were depreciated fifty per cent. This was a proof of the want of integrity, and it operated accordingly; it deſtroyed public confidence. It did not merely diminiſh the value of the notes,—it annihilated them, and on the 22d of May one guinea in gold could not have been purchaſed in Paris for one thouſand guineas in notes. The hiſtory of paper money in all ages is uniform. It's value depends on the confidence of the public. Let government give a ſingle proof that they ought not to be truſted—Confidence vaniſhes, and "like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion, leaves not a trace behind." Let us compare this with the hiſtory of the paper in ſome of our ſtates, and conſider whether it ought to have retained its value. The firſt emiſſion of the ſtate of North-Carolina in 1783, was to have been redeemed by the ſale of forfeited eſtates. That foundation was ſoon removed, and thoſe eſtates were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to another uſe. The money depreciated, and recourſe was had to another coinage. This ſecond ſtructure was raiſed, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, on a worſe foundation, for it had not even the <hi>appearance</hi> of ſtability; taxes are laid for calling in the money, and it is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſtored to circulation. Was it expected that ſuch money ſhould paſs as gold or ſilver? No, certainly. The legiſlature them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do not ſeem to have expected that it ſhould be conſidered of equal value. Tobacco, a ſtaple of North-Carolina, has been purchaſed by the public for two prices in this new money, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors at the ſame time are compelled to receive it as ſpecie, in the payment of debts. Is this <hi>juſtice?</hi> Strangers will call it by a different name.</p>

I have attempted to ſhew, according to the fate of paper in other countries, that it was not to have been expected that our money ſhould paſs as gold or ſilver. Every body knows that it is more or leſs depreciated in all the ſtates who have emitted it.

               <p>IT is painful in all caſes to animadvert on public meaſures, lest we ſhould hurt the feelings of any citizen with whom ſuch meaſures have originated.

I have ſaid that paper money, which is a legal tender, muſt prove hurtful to this country; when made, it muſt depreciate, and the effects of depreciation are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to induſtry, injurious to the poor, and deſtructive of good morals. On the ſuppoſition that the paper currency in ſome of the ſtates has depreciated one third, it will follow that the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent citizens to whom this money was firſt paid, in its depreciated ſtate, muſt have loſt 33⅓ per cent. on every payment; but as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bill of paper may have paſſed frequently from hand to hand, it will follow, that the ſeveral citizens of that ſtate may have ſuffered the loſs of ten times that ſum by receiving bad money inſtead of ſolid coin to which they were entitled. This muſt have been a very conſiderable tax, and unfortunately it was a tax of the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious kind, for it was a tax on the frugal and temperate in favour of the idle, the profligate and luxurious. It cannot be right in government to protect and encourage vice; it is a plant that thrives ſufficiently in every ſoil, without the help of legiſlative authority. In ſupport of a meaſure that agrees ſo little with the common ideas of juſtice, we have been told, that money was wanted for the ſake of the poor, that they might have a medium wherewith to pay their debts and taxes. Whoever has reflected
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020887_0007_0FB14928A05DACD0"/>
on the circulation of paper money, will be apt to ſay, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt poor man has not been the chief gainer by it. There is ſome difficulty in diſcovering how the poor man ſhould be profited by a coinage of money. If he had been poſſeſſed of marketable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, before the money was made, he might have ſold it for the full value; for there has been no ſeaſon in which produce has not been ſold for more than its worth; the exporters have been loſers; if the poor man had no property for ſale, neither could he have got any of the new money, unleſs it was to have been given away. There is doubtleſs ſome obſcurity in this buſineſs, unleſs we alledge, that depreciation was intended, and this we are not willing to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Let us ſuppoſe that the poor man may have gained a trifle by the depreciation of money; what is ſuch a gain when compared with his ſufferings by the loſs of credit? No man can expect to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row money nor obtain goods on credit, when government does not ſupport the creditor againſt diſhoneſt payments by baſe money. When the rich are taught by government not to give credit, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the poor muſt be increaſed, and when credit is deſtroyed, induſtry muſt languiſh; for they are conſtantly found to flouriſh in proportion to the honeſty of government and the ſtability of the legal money. So lately as on the 43d year of Queen Elizabeth, the coin of England was debaſed almoſt nine per cent. by parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and about that time the coin of France was frequently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. The commerce of thoſe nations ſuffered greatly by ſuch inſtability. They have ſince profited by their good faith. There is no country in which the value of money has been ſo perfectly ſtable as in Holland for the laſt 200 years; and it is admitted that no country has proſpered ſo much by commerce, nor any in which the intereſt of money is ſo moderate. Security of property has ever proved the ſpur to induſtry; hence we find that arts and commerce have flouriſhed moſt in republican governments; for in abſolute monarchies the value of money is not ſtable, and in deſpotic governments the caſe is worſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſuch government we ſeldom find much induſtry. In republican governments he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the citizen has generally been perfectly ſafe. To this we aſcribe the progreſs of arts and commerce, and the conſequent wealth of Athens, Carthage and Venice; of the Hans Towns and the United Netherlands. In thoſe republics the governments have not been uſed to depreciate their coin; time will ſhew how the experiment ſucceeds with us. The chief advantage that appears to have ariſen from depreciated money is, that fraudulent debtors have been enabled to diſcharge their contracts on eaſy terms. It is admitted that the debts of citizen to citi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We complain in general that <hi>money is ſcarce.</hi> We are miſtakes about facts, for the thing alledged is not altogether true. Pride or the force of habits prevent us from diſcovering the truth. There is not any country in which money may be acquired with more eaſe than in America, and every man has it, who has any right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, except in caſes where government interferes; but moſt of us ought not to have any money; we have not deſerved it, for we have expended more ſince the peace than we have gained, whence it is that we neither have money, nor any kind of marketable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty by which we can pay our debts: No man nor body of men can have either, whoſe expences exceed their income. There is a plain and certain proceſs by which our complaints may be relieved—The bad effects of indolence and luxury muſt be cured by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and oeconomy, and the whole of our debts may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in a few years by induſtry and frugality. When are we like to obtain money by ſuch means? No man can attend to the prevailing conduct of the Americans without expreſſing his fear that the period is very diſtant. Inſtead of finding general proofs of induſtry, oeconomy, temperance, and other republican virtues, he ſees a nation that is more luxurious, more indolent and more extravagant, than any other people on the face of the earth. In drawing this figure, I may be charged with high colouring, but the reader is requeſted to examine the original, and if he finds that we are the moſt luxurious and the moſt diſſolute of all nations, he will certainly admit that ſome reſtraints might help to increaſe the quantity of money among us, or it might prevent the occaſion for it.</p>
               <p>Every empire under the ſun is ſuppoſed to be independent of any other; that is to ſay, the ſubjects of every empire are ſuppoſed to enjoy a natural as well as a political independence. It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that they cloath and feed themſelves. This, in former times, was obviouſly the caſe in all countries, but the introduction of commerce has produced many ſeeming variations from the rule. Induſtrious nations, who have more proviſions or cloathing of any particular quality than are neceſſary for their own conſumption, ſend them abroad to be exchanged for money, or for ſome other kind of cloathing or proviſions which they like better, or which they cannot prepare with the ſame eaſe; but ſtill their exports and imports are nearly equal, and the quantity of imported goods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by every nation, bears a very ſmall proportion to what they conſume of their own manufacture. This is true even of the Spaniards, though national pride or indolence ſeems to furniſh them as an exception to this general rule. They depend on other nations for many important manufactures. The conſequence is obvious. Though the Spaniards poſſeſs the rich mines of Mexico

and Peru, by neglecting uſeful manufactures, they are become a poor nation, and they are every year decreaſing in numbers and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>We obſerve that moſt other nations maintain a kind of barter or exchange of manufactures with one another, but ſtill the great body of the inhabitants, rich and poor, are cloathed in the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of their own country. Is this the caſe in the United States? With us the maſter and his ſlave, the farmer, the mechanic and merchant, are all cloathed, from head to foot, in foreign manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures; this is not becauſe we have not hemp, flax and cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſufficient. There is no country where thoſe articles are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with leſs trouble, nor is there any difficulty in procuring wool; but our imports are not confined to cloathing: no ſmall ſhare of our furniture is of Britiſh manufacture. Saws, hammers, hoes and axes, are alſo imported as though the wolf had made war againſt our iron as well as againſt our ſheep. In every ſmall town we are cheriſhed with Iriſh butter and beef, and with Britiſh ale, porter and cheeſe, as though the country did not produce hops, barley or black cattle. Leſt abſurdity ſhould not go on ſtilts, and folly ride on the great horſe, we make large importations of hazle and oak ſprouts, under the name of <hi>walking canes.</hi> Surely there is no ſcarcity of wood among us; but our ſticks are not <hi>foreign.</hi> In excuſe for all thoſe follies, we are told, that a man has a right to uſe any of the comforts of life which he can pay for. This may be true, but he has no right to uſe the luxuries of life which he cannot pay for; and perhaps it may be queſtioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has a right to give examples, and introduce follies that may prove ruinous to his fellow citizens. Under the head of luxuries we may fairly include every imported article, becauſe this country certainly produces all the neceſſaries of life. It is hardly requiſite to viſit a large town in order to determine whether the luxury of dreſs is become an offence againſt decency, as well as a ſure road to bankruptcy. In this remark, no particular reference is made to the dreſs of either ſex, for they are equally attentive to the privilege of being in faſhion. It is true that ſome doubts have ariſen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the meaning of the word <hi>faſhion.</hi> In moſt countries <hi>faſhion in dreſs</hi> is underſtood to mean the form and quality of cloathing, which is uſed by the moſt reſpectable inhabitants, or by the great majority of the nation. From late obſervations, we are taught to ſuſpect that the word has a different meaning in the United States. Among us a perſon is underſtood to be in perfect faſhion, who is rigged off with ſomething that has not been ſeen nor heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſtate. On this principle it is that we have ſeen new forms of head dreſs, like bullets in a pop-gun, kick one another out ſo faſt, that we could hardly learn their names as they paſſed in

What a pity it is that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions ſhould wear out in London, before they can arrive at New-York or Philadelphia! If there was a glaſs in the moon we might catch the faſhions as they riſe. How does it fare with nations who have no change in the faſhion of their cloaths? Have the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in thoſe countries fewer charms, or have the men leſs diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than we have who are ſubject to weekly revolutions? Surely the whim of this day has no more intrinſic beauty than the whim of yeſterday.</p>
               <p>In old nations, where manufactures flouriſh, and where wealth is unequally diſtributed, ſome of the inhabitants being exceedingly rich, and the bulk of them miſerably poor, it is wiſe in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to encourage luxury and caprice in dreſs; by thoſe means the wealth of the rich circulates through the hands of the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing poor. What is ſound policy in thoſe countries muſt be folly and madneſs among us. When we encourage luxury, it is to enrich another nation, and to make our own citizens poor. Can there be a greater treaſon committed againſt the States!—The Chineſe and Japaneſe, great, politic and wiſe nations, are diſtinguiſhed by a national dreſs. The Dutch, though they are ſurrounded by nations who are changeable as the moon, have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to little change in dreſs for 200 years. Their commerce does not, like the commerce of France and England, depend on their manufactures, and nothing leſs than rigid oeconomy could make them reſpectable.—Nothing but NECESSITY can juſtify us in the uſe of any foreign manufacture; doubtleſs the word <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> is very ambiguous; moſt people contend that what they buy is neceſſary, provided they can barely diſcover the uſe of it. We have ſeen the daughter of a labouring mechanic perform her after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon's viſit, dreſſed out in more lace, ribbons, gauze and ſilk than her father could have earned in twelve months in any part of Europe. Were thoſe things <hi>neceſſary!</hi> We have ſeen a young Buck, the ſon of a planter, who ſcarcely ſold one hogſhead of tobacco in the year, on his way to a quarter-race, fitted out, for the ſake of propriety, with white ſilk ſtockings under his boots, a pair of <hi>durable</hi> black ſilk breeches, and more ſilver on his ſaddle and bridle, than the value of his father's eſtate, if his debts were paid. Thoſe were a few of his <hi>neceſſaries.</hi> It is very obſervable that in other countries people who live by their induſtry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>are obliged to pay their debts,</hi> do not find ſuch things neceſſary. It is alledged that in England the food, raiment, and other neceſſaries of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

man coſt him annually about 7l. 10s. ſterling; deduct a moderate allowance for food, fuel, and houſe-rent, how much will remain for clothes? The 'Mareſchal de Vauban, conſidering what taxes may be paid by a labouring man in France, eſtimates his annual expence in clothing at ſomewhat leſs than 40 ſhillings of our money; this includes the cloathing for himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wife, and two children. It may be noted that half of the ſubjects both in France and England come within the foregoing predicament, they are mechanics or day labourers. Compare their expence with our's in the article of dreſs; and it muſt be admitted that an epidemic madneſs has laid hold of us. It is alledged, that the citizens of the United States have contracted debts within the laſt three years with the ſubjects of Great Britain to the amount of near ſix mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars; conſequently our eſtates are mortgaged for that ſum. Painful ſenſations muſt ariſe to every man who loves his country from the proſpect of ſuch beginnings. Thus it was that Corſica was mortgaged to the more induſtrious citizens of Genoa for ſilks and velvets, and it was afterwards ſold to a foreign power. We ſhall be told in excuſe for imported luxuries, that we buy goods cheaper than we can make them, and a man earns more in his tobacco or corn field, than he could earn at a loom, or by other manufactures. Theſe poſitions are fallacious and ill-founded.—Both experiment and calculation prove them to be falſe. During the late war goods were dear, and we did not run into debt, for we bought few—manufactured ſome—and were frugal. Since the peace goods have been cheap, and we have nearly become bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts. It appears that our earnings in the field have not been equal to the price of the goods that we have conſumed.—Every domeſtic manufacture is cheaper than a foreign one, for this plain reaſon, by the firſt nothing is loſt to the country, by the other the whole value is loſt—it is carried away never to return. It is perfectly indifferent to this ſtate, or to the United States, what may be the price of domeſtic manufactures, becauſe that price remains in the country. Every man is ſuppoſed to be employed in ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion—he is a mechanic, or he is employed in raiſing proviſions for thoſe who are. In Great Britain the farmers are to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers as four to three; in this ſtate, where proviſions are more eaſily raiſed, the number may be equal, becauſe the labour of one man in the field is more than ſufficient for the nouriſhment of two. Let the manufacturer demand what he pleaſes for the produce of his labour, the farmer can eaſily ſettle the account by ſelling his proviſions accordingly. The annual conſumption of goods in this ſtate has been eſtimated at a million of dollars, or rather at 1,200,000 dollars. What is the reſult! 1,200,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020887_0015_0FB14934A4433018"/>
in ſpecie, or produce to that value, have been ſent out of the ſtate, or muſt be ſent, and we are ſo much the poorer. Suppoſe the whole of thoſe goods had been manufactured within the ſtate, or a ſufficient quantity for our conſumption, and that they had coſt the conſumers, or been valued at two millions of dollars; would the citizens of this ſtate have loſt 800,000 dollars by this difference in price! The very reverſe would have happened.—They would have gained, or they would have ſaved, 1,200,000 dollars; for there was not a ſingle dollar to have been ſent out of the country. No man is to ſay that a thing may be good for indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals which is not good for the public, or that our citizens may thrive by cheap bargains, while the nation is ruined by them.—He is neither a politician nor a patriot who would uſe ſuch a cloak. Let us turn our attention to manufactures, and the ſtaple of our country will ſoon riſe to its proper value; for we have already glutted every foreign market. By this expedient inſtead of uſing fictitious paper we ſhall ſoon obtain hard money ſufficient—inſtead of toiling in the field, and becoming poor that we may enrich the manufacturers of other countries, we ſhall proſper by our own labour, and enrich our own citizens.</p>

               <p>IT has ever been found that ſpeculative reaſonings are weak and inconcluſive when oppoſed to the prejudices or paſſions of a nation. There is ſomething ſo bewitching in luxury and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that nothing ſhort of hard NECESSITY can baniſh them; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this great reformer is not far diſtant. When a man ſees his fellow citizens poſting at full ſpeed to deſtruction—when he ſees them attempt to mortgage their whole eſtate for a whiſtle and bells, and the legiſlatures of ſome of the ſtates holding a candle to the prevailing folly, by cheriſhing the idle at the expence of the induſtrious, he comforts himſelf that the race is nearly run. It was not ſufficient that the whole produce of our country on the laſt three years has been exchanged for luxuries—all the hard mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that could be collected was alſo exported, but there was ſtill a remnant of hard money in many of the ſtates—the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it for the neceſſary purpoſes of exchange, and merchants could not get it out of their hands. In order to baniſh this rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

of hard money, our legiſlatures are following one another in making a paper tender. By this happy expedient people will be enabled to ruin themſelves, every farthing of ſpecie, which ſeems to be obnoxious, will be exported, and we ſhall be as poor and pennyleſs as Tartars.</p>
               <p>When our merchants are involved in a general bankruptcy, and when the officious friendſhip of foreign merchants is ſufficiently puniſhed, who tempted us to run in debt, there will be an end to the importation of foreign goods, and neceſſity will effect what prudence could not.</p>
               <p>I have ſome times looked for thoſe marks of political virtue, thoſe proofs of ſelf denial which produced the revolution. I have expected to ſee aſſociations formed by gentlemen in the ſeveral ſtates for promoting American manufactures. For as ſoon as we can make our own cloaths and our own arms, we ſhall be perfectly independent. Surely the man who is cloathed in American ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, which he wears for the ſake of enriching his native country, and relieving his fellow citizens, may be allowed to have ſome claims to <hi>patriotiſm,</hi> which is the moſt <hi>honorable garb</hi> that can be worn.</p>
               <p>While we are conſidering of the various means by which our fellow citizens may be relieved from a ſcarcity of money, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of dreſs claims our particular attention. Our intereſt and our honour are united in recommending a <hi>national dreſs,</hi> national pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices are uſeful, they attach people to thoſe of their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and induce them to aſſiſt one another. In moſt caſes a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal language anſwers the purpoſe of diſtinction; but we have the misfortune of ſpeaking the ſame language with a nation who, of all people in Europe, have given, and continue to give us few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proofs of love. We do not count it an honour to imitate the forms of government that prevail in Europe—why ſhould we think it honorable to imitate the faſhion of their coats? <hi>"O imitatores, ſervile pecus!"</hi> Why ſhould we imitate the dreſs of a man from London, more than of a man from Iſpahan, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Surely we do not mean this imitation as a mark of homage to a Briton—nor do we pay it as tribute, though it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us tributary. We do not mean to acknowledge that Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons are ſuperior to ourſelves in every thing, whence we ſhould imitate and ſtrive to copy them. How then are we to account for this ſycophantiſm? Though it was profitable, we are placed thereby in a point of view ſo humiliating, and ſo offenſive to the common feelings of men, that we ought to break the fetters and give another proof of our being free. But ſince the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Engliſh faſhions cannot coſt the United States leſs than five million of dollars per annum; every argument from oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

as well as pride would ſeem to recommend a national dreſs. What would be the beſt form of a national dreſs from head to foot—a dreſs to be adopted and perſevered in? This queſtion may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be anſwered by ſome perſon who ſhall attempt the change. If a few reſpectable citizens in every ſtate ſhould undertake the change, beyond doubt it would ſoon become univerſal. It is true that national dreſs, like their ſeveral forms of government, has been eſtabliſhed in moſt countries by a long proceſs of time and accidents; but the Americans have had the reſolution to ſhake off a ſet of prejudices, and at once to eſtabliſh a new ſyſtem of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Such a nation might eaſily ſhake off the trammels of Engliſh faſhion in the hat or coat, eſpecially when it is conſidered that great ſavings and other ſolid advantages would accrue from ſuch a meaſure. If a national dreſs ſhould be adopted, we ſhall have nothing to apprehend from the effects of caprice. We are not to fear lest every adventurer who arrives among us with a new figaro on his back or head ſhould eclipſe our dreſs, and claim the greater attention of the ladies. It will conſtantly be found that the national dreſs in every country, is more decent and more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to people at large, than any new adventitions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> foreign dreſs. Every ſtranger who comes among us will think it <hi>beſt</hi> to aſſume the dreſs of the country. If he affects to become a citizen he will find it <hi>neceſſary.</hi> It is the privilege of a conquering nation to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe its dreſs upon the conquered; this becomes a mark of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. There has been a notable exception to this rule. When the Tartars conquered China, the Chineſe had the good fortune to preſerve their dreſs, and the Tartars ſubmitted to a change; hence the Tartars in that very empire are conſidered as ſecondaries and inferiors. Whether we ſhall ſubmit to the perpetual rule and cuſtoms of England, and acknowledge ourſelves ſubordinate, is a queſtion that is not like to be determined ſpeedily. The preſent appearances are againſt us. I have mentioned the Engliſh, becauſe it is certain that we do not copy French dreſs, though that alſo would be folly.</p>
               <p>The meaſures to which I have referred would certainly relieve us from a ſcarcity of money, but they are rather to be effected by the ſpirit of the nation, than by legiſlative interpoſition. They are rather to be effected by voluntary patriotic aſſociation, than by expreſs and particular ſtatutes. It is impoſſible to foretell where any ſalutary meaſure is to have its beginning; but as the amendment in queſtion will doubtleſs be produced by the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſundry cauſes, I ſhould naturally expect that ſome of the Eaſtern ſtates would give us the example. Not becauſe the citizens of thoſe ſtates are at this time diſtinguiſhed by the fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their dreſs; for we believe that no people in the united
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020887_0018_0FB1493924C16898"/>
States have ſought more greedily to ruin themſelves, by the luxury of dreſs, than ſome of the inhabitants of the Eaſtern States. Nor is it becauſe the tradeſmen or mechanics in thoſe ſtates have any particular claim to patriotiſm; for if it be true, that as ſoon as the legiſlature of Maſſachuſetts had impoſed a heavy tax on certain imported goods, to encourage the manufacture of ſimilar article at home, the mechanics raiſed the price of thoſe very articles by the full amount of the tax. For inſtance, two dollars being the tax that was laid on beaver hats, the hatters immediately added two dollars to the eight dollars they had formerly demanded for a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as if they wiſhed by extravagance to provoke a repeal of the law, or to promote ſmuggling. If ſuch reports are well founded, and if ſuch inſtances of extortion are common among the mechanic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the eaſtern ſtates, we are not to look for proofs of ſignal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm among them. The Eaſtern ſtates are particularly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced with reſpect to foreign commerce; they produce nothing fit for exportation; the fiſhery cannot be conſidered as theirs, for it is common, and the trifling amount of lumber and live ſtock, the produce of the country, that is exported, cannot be ſufficient to cloath one-tenth of the inhabitants. In the mean while it is very obſervable, that no people can be more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſituated for the purpoſe of extending manufactures than the citizens of Maſſachuſetts, New-Hampſhire, Connecticut, and Rhode-Iſland. The climate is extremely healthy, nor is it too warm for a white man to labour through the whole ſummer. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſlavery, which has ever been found unfriendly to manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, does not prevail among them. A great proportion of the inhabitants are contiguous to one another in ſmall towns, which are the proper nurſeries of manufactures; and moſt of thoſe towns are ſituated on or near a water carriage. The citizens are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally induſtrious and tractable; whatever raw materials they want can eaſily be procured from the ſouthern ſtates. As the number of citizens increaſe in the manufacturing towns, proviſions may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſcarce, but the corn and rice of the ſouthern ſtates muſt afford them a convenient and conſtant ſupply. Veſſels that are not employed by winter in the fiſhery, may be uſefully engaged in carrying proviſions in exchange for manufactures; for in ſuch a ſoil and climate as the ſouthern ſtates, there muſt ever be a redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of proviſions. Surely then it may be expected that the citizens of the eaſtern ſtates will be among the firſt manufacturers. There we ſee a people who cannot long perſevere in the courſe they have been running; a people who are perſuaded by every argument of prudence and ſound policy to adopt other meaſures; are we not to expect ſome uſeful, ſome great and patriotic exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from that quarter!</p>

If other arguments are wanted to induce us to promote dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic manufactures, and a national dreſs, we had beſt conſider the queſtion concerning imported goods, as it affects our own reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, compared with the revenue of a foreign kingdom. When the ſubject is viewed in this light we muſt admit, that our preſent meaſures are neither ſupported by patriotiſm, nor by any other civil or political virtue. The amount of foreign goods annually conſumed in N. Carolina has been eſtimated at more than one milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of dollars, perhaps we may fairly ſtate the amount of Britiſh goods at that ſum, conſequently the ſubjects of Great Britain are enriched by our follies, to the amount of £.400,000 the year. How much do we contribute towards the taxes of Great Britain by ſuch a conſumption of her manufactures? This is a queſtion that has not been fully conſidered, but I think the amount may fairly be ſtated at ſeven hundred thouſand dollars by the year. To ſome Americans this computation may appear very extravagant; but gentlemen who have ſeen the burdens that are borne in foreign countries will not think it too large. It is generally alledged, that a man pays fifteen ſhillings for the uſe of government out of every twenty ſhillings that he ſpends in England. Some have ſtated the public tax at ſeventeen ſhillings in the pound. Let us take an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the article of beer. The land pays a tax; the barley which grows on it, when malted, pays an exciſe of ſix-pence by the buſhel; hops pay one penny by the pound; the beer, when brewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pays an exciſe, in ſome caſes, greater than the original value; and all the perſons who labour in the premiſes, contribute towards the national revenue by their ſundry conſumptions, to the amount of three-fourths of the whole price of their labour; this alſo muſt be charged on the beer. Surely the conſumer of beer pays more than ſeventeen ſhillings to government for every twenty ſhillings which he expends in that liquor. But I have taken four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſhillings in the pound, as a moderate eſtimate of the ſum that a man in America pays towards the ſupport of government in Great Britain, who conſumes Britiſh manufactures. It follows of courſe, that we have for the laſt three years been paying into the Britiſh treaſury a tax, upwards of £.200,000 a year. Strange liberality; while our own taxes are neglected, our government degraded, and our private debts unpaid, we are freely giving up the laſt farthing for the ſupport of a foreign government.

If the genera uſe of Britiſh goods in theſe ſtates could be improved ſo as to bring a fifth-part of the ſum into our treaſury that it brings into the treaſury of Great Britain, our civil government would be well ſupported, our foreign loans diſcharged, our national honor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and our citizens fully relieved from the burden of poſitive taxes.

               <p>IN all governments the relief of the poor ſhould be one of the chief objects of legiſlative attention. Every citizen demands juſtice and protection from government; theſe ſhould not—they cannot be refuſed; but the poor man has other claims. His wants and his ſufferings muſt be in proportion to his degree of poverty; humanity requires that his ſufferings be relieved or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſo far as may conſiſt with the ſteady and impartial admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice. It does not conſiſt either with honeſty or ſound policy, that the rich ſhould be defrauded or plundered for the ſake of the poor; but the fiſcal and oeconomical laws of every ſtate ſhould be ſo framed as to encourage and aſſiſt the poor in their uſual employments. The neceſſary burdens of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be ſo faſhioned as to preſs on their ſhoulders in the moſt convenient and eaſy manner that is poſſible. The general payment of taxes is abſolutely neceſſary to the ſupport of any government, but when money is remarkably ſcarce, it muſt be difficult for the poor man to pay his taxes, and in many caſes he may find it impoſſible to make the annual payments, without the public ſale of ſome part of his property. Every diſtreſs of this kind ought to be prevented, if poſſible. Perhaps the moſt eaſy and moſt effectual method of preventing the poor man from being diſtreſſed in the payment of taxes, is by altering the general form of taxation, or by ſubſtituting an EXCISE in the place of a tax on property, which is common in North Carolina.</p>
               <p>That tax, or additional price, which in moſt countries is laid upon certain goods when they are ſold for conſumption, is called Exciſe.

of rum that he ſells; and the ſhop-keeper may be obliged to pay half a crown for every yard of ſilk or cloth that he ſells. This tax is very different from the Cuſtoms, or duties that are uſually paid on the importation of foreign goods. It is a ſubſequent tax, and frequently much heavier. In many caſes it is laid on articles of domeſtic production. In England ſeveral millions ſterling are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually raiſed by an exciſe: in France the revenue from an exciſe is larger; and in Holland almoſt the whole of the national expences are paid by different exciſes. Almoſt every thing in that country, which a man eats or drinks, is ſubject to an exciſe: and in ſome caſes the exciſe is nearly equal to the prime coſt. It has frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been ſaid, that when the citizens of any ſtate are obliged to raiſe a certain ſum of money by the means of taxation, there can be little difference by what name the tax is called, or how it is laid; but this opinion is ill founded. The capitation tax or land tax, ſuch as are uſual among us, are inevitable and poſitive taxes; they are not to be averted. The induſtrious cannot elude them—the unfortunate cannot eſcape them: every citizen muſt take out his purſe and pay the amount. But the exciſe is a negative or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tax. When it is laid on foreign goods, no man is obliged to pay any part of it; and when it is laid on domeſtic luxuries, no prudent man will pay much of it. It will frequently happen, that the moſt virtuous and induſtrious citizens are greatly diſtreſſed by domeſtic ſickneſs; and it will happen that whole counties are diſtreſſed by intemperate ſeaſons and ſhort crops. In all ſuch caſes, the exciſe operates as a relief to the citizen; for he buys no luxuries on that year, and conſequently he pays no taxes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided luxuries only are exciſed. Let us ſuppoſe a very frequent caſe:—A poor man is poſſeſſed of 500 acres of poor land, hardly worth 100 dollars. His land tax will be 25, and his poll or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal tax 15 ſhillings. Does it not frequently happen that the public officer, at the ſeaſon for collecting taxes, finds ſuch a man without 40 ſhillings in his pocket? Perhaps he is ſeldom poſſeſſed of ſo much money at a time. It would certainly be ſtrange if the pooreſt man in the ſtate, who is not a cripple, could not earn, in the courſe of the year, three times the ſum that has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, beſides what is neceſſary for the ſupport of his family; but oeconomy and a provident foreſight are not the characteriſtics of the poor. In fact, the poor in theſe ſtates are generally poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want thoſe qualities: wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Or why ſhall we make it neceſſary for a man to treaſure up money for ſeveral months, who never cared for to-morrow? The land tax, or the perſonal tax, may appear at firſt ſight to be ſmall
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020887_0022_0FB1493F24C5E508"/>
burdens, but experience has taught us that they are not eaſily borne. On the other hand, the moſt indolent or moſt careleſs citizen cannot poſſibly be incommoded by an exciſe. If he ſhould have no money in the courſe of the year, nor any thing to ſell, he will not be able to buy any thing, and conſequently will not pay any tax. Whenever he ſhall be able to buy any foreign commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities he will pay his tax in buying the goods, for the exciſe is added to the price of the goods: it is paid by the merchant.—Suppoſe the exciſe on rum to be one ſhilling the gallon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoever buys one gallon of rum muſt pay a tax of one ſhilling, for in this caſe the rum will coſt him ſix ſhillings inſtead of five. The ſame rule may be applied to every article of foreign make. Prudence would dictate, that articles which are leaſt neceſſary, and articles which may ſooneſt come to perfection in the ſtate, ſhould bear the heavieſt tax. The natural and conſtant operation of this tax in favour of the poor, is twofold. It is a voluntary tax, and it is a ſpur to induſtry. No man pays the tax, who is not able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to buy foreign luxuries, therefore it is voluntary. The man who is diligent, and manufactures for himſelf, has no occaſion for thoſe luxuries, therefore it is a ſpur to induſtry. In a word, all taxes on property are burdens on the good citizen:—they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage induſtry. All exciſes, or taxes on conſumption, are taxes on luxury and diſſipation:—they puniſh idleneſs, and promote in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. Can we heſitate in making our choice?</p>
               <p>The opinions of men have been variouſly affected in different countries on the queſtion concerning an exciſe or a land tax, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their paſſions or their prejudices. In England the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe has been unpopular, becauſe the multitude who are poor ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that they are chiefly affected by ſuch taxes. They continue to prefer a land tax, becauſe none of themſelves have any lands. Doubtleſs a land tax is very proper in that country, becauſe the owners are wealthy; but in America the caſe is different, the pooreſt of our citizens commonly poſſeſs a little land.

The revenue of the Roman empire in its proſperous days, aroſe chiefly from exciſe and cuſtoms. That jealous and wiſe nation did not readily ſubmit to a perſonal tax, nor a land tax. There was a very hurtful trade carried on between Rome and the Eaſt Indies, by the way of Alexandria and the Red Sea. By this trade a large balance of ſilver was exported from the empire; frequently to the amount of three millions of dollars by the year. The returns were chiefly in ſilks, jewels, and ſpices—perfect luxuries; for which

reaſon their Eaſt-India trade was charged with a heavy exciſe<note n="*" place="bottom">If we admit that the exciſe on Eaſt-India goods was equal, as we are told, to an eighth part of their price, and if we alſo admit, as Pliny alledges, that Eaſt-India goods were ſold in Rome at one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for one on the prime coſt, and that 3,733,332 dollars and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, were annually tranſmitted to India for the payment of thoſe goods, the exciſe muſt have exceeded 46 million of dollars annually; but though ſilk may have ſold, as it is affirmed, for its weight in gold, the general advance ſeems to have been ſtated too large; be this as it may, it was very proper that a trade ſo deſtructive of money ſhould be compelled to contribute greatly to the public revenue.</note>. Auguſtus ventured to impoſe a tax of five per cent. on legacies and inheritances, which was very productive, with the advantage of being a negative tax.

                  </gap>fian: from that period direct or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive taxes became univerſal. What was the condition of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man people under the adminiſtration of cuſtoms, exciſes, and other negative taxes, compared with the times in which the land tax, the poll tax, and other poſitive taxes became univerſal!—it was an age of gold compared to that of iron. Humanity is ſhocked with the tales of wo that are told. Parents are ſaid, during the latter age, to have ſold their children, and to have ſold themſelves, into ſlavery, in order to ſhun the burden of taxes. All wiſe governments have thought it their duty, on ſpecial occaſions, to offer bounties for the encouragement of domeſtic manufactures; but an exciſe on foreign goods muſt operate as a bounty. Suppoſe that our annual imports into theſe ſtates are worth £. 4,000,000, an exciſe equal to a tenth part would bring 1,100,000 dollars into the treaſuries; this would be a very reſpectable addition to the revenues of theſe ſtates, and would operate in proportion as a bounty for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of domeſtic manufactures. It is true, that as our manufactures increaſe, our revenue by exciſe muſt decreaſe; but our abilities to pay taxes by ſome other means, muſt increaſe much faſter than the exciſe decreaſes. Thus an exciſe of 2s. may be paid in the purchaſe of a pair of imported ſhoes, which are ſuppoſed to be worth 10s. the tax goes into the treaſury, but ten ſhillings, the coſt of the ſhoes, is ſent out of the country. On the next year ſuch a pair of ſhoes is made in the country; in that caſe, the two ſhillings is ſunk in the revenue, but ten ſhillings are ſaved in the ſtate, and ſome of the citizens are ſo much the richer.</p>
               <p>When I ſay that an exciſe is more favourable to the poor than a poll tax, or a land tax, or any other tax on property, and that

it tends to promote induſtry and wealth, I muſt conſtantly be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to mean an exciſe on luxuries, or imported goods; and I would alſo be underſtood to mean an exciſe that is impartially laid, and fairly collected.—Our expectations on this head are not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine;—nor is the proſpect very pleaſing; for ſome of the laws that we have hitherto made for collecting duties, are ſhamefully defaced by the want of public ſpirit; they are full of ambiguities, through which the knaviſh and the cunning may creep. In North-Carolina it was enacted, that a merchant importing goods by land, to the value of £. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould be obliged to pay duties on the ſame; but a planter might import goods to the value of pound;. 20, though he imported them for ſale or merchandize, without paying any duty. The author of ſuch a clauſe muſt have forgot that he was bound to ſerve the public rather than himſelf, and that the revenues of the ſtate are not to be ſacrificed to the convenience of a few individuals.</p>
               <p>The general advantage of a ſumptuary law, or an exciſe upon imported goods, is ſo obvious, that I queſtion whether any objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can be made to it, beſides the expence of collecting the tax, and the probability of frauds being committed in ſecreting the goods.—Surely the expence of collecting any tax cannot be an object when the happineſs and proſperity of a ſtate is contraſted with diſcontent, poverty, and diſgrace. If the expence of collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the revenue ſhould amount to ten per cent. no part of that money would be loſt to the country, and the diligence of public officers might prove the means of enriching the country. In all places, and at all times, it has been too common for merchants to endeavour to defraud the revenue by ſmuggling goods. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of this offence ſeems at length to have altered men's ideas concerning the turpitude of perjury, or the baſeneſs of ſtealing; and there are men who would ſteal from the nation, or defraud the revenue, who would not on any account cheat a private ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen.

I have ſaid, that an exciſe is more favourable to the poor than a land or poll tax; I will venture an additional ſentiment—There never was any government in which an exciſe could be of ſo much uſe as in the United States of America. In all other countries taxes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as grievances—in the United States an exciſe on foreign goods would not be a grievance—like medicine to a ſick man it would give us ſtrength. It would cloſe that waſteful drain by which our honor and our wealth are conſumed. What though money was not wanted—though we did not owe a florin to any foreign nation—though we had no domeſtic debt—and though the expences of civil government could be ſupported for many years without a tax—ſtill it may be queſtioned, whether an exciſe would not be deſirable. It is ſurely the beſt expedient by which we can promote domeſtic manufactures, and the condition in which we now live—our general dependence on a foreign country for arms and cloathing—is diſhonorable—it is extremely dangerous.</p>

               <p>IN all ages of the world, and in all governments in which people have been oppreſſed, their chief complaints have ariſen from the weight of their taxes, or other impoſitions of a ſimilar ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. Some tyrants there have been, whoſe cruelty has extended to life as well as property: But the common diſtinction between tyrants has been, that one of them has impoſed more grievous taxes, or has laid them on with leſs regard to the convenience or to the abilities of the ſubject. Hence it is that governments are preferred where the power of taxing is in the hands of the people, becauſe it is preſumed that they will impoſe ſuch taxes as are moſt profitable, and moſt eaſily paid.</p>
               <p>It may happen nevertheleſs, that in a republican government, the general ſyſtem of taxing, ariſing from prejudice or inattention, may not be of that kind which is moſt conducive to the eaſe or proſperity of the people. This I take to be the cauſe in many of the ſtates; and as the ſubject is extremely intereſting, the reader
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020887_0026_0FB149455BDD8F68"/>
will doubtleſs excuſe me, though I detain him ſomewhat longer in conſidering the particular equity, as well as the general opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an exciſe or impoſt, by which the whole of the national debt may be diſcharged. Part of our taxes muſt be paid in ſpecie, and ſome part of them may be paid in paper. Intereſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of our foreign debt—the ſalaries of our miniſters in foreign and ſome departments—and the pay of ſuch troops as are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily employed in the ſervice of the United States, muſt be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in hard money. We ſhall ſtate the expences of the federal government at 400,000 dollars by the year; for we preſume that great oeconomy will be uſed till we are able to pay our debts, and that we ſhall try to be juſt before we are generous. The ſtates have not hitherto been called upon for any thing more than the intereſt of the foreign debt; but the principal of the French loan, as well as that from Holland. is to be paid off by inſtalments, and the firſt of thoſe payments is to be made in the year 1787, from which time ſome part of the principal is to be paid off every year.—Within twelve years the debt is to be reduced to a quarter of its preſent ſize, but in the mean while the payments of the principal and intereſt will amount to near one million of dollars by the year. This muſt be paid in ſpecie, or in ſuch payments as will command ſpecie to that value; but there is a conſiderable debt which may poſſibly be diſcharged by paper. The annual tax that may be paid in this manner is very uncertain: for though we ſhould diſcover that ſome of the ſtates have, by aſſuming a conſiderable part of the continental debt, and by other means, nearly paid their quota of the domeſtic debt contracted by the United States, ſtill it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the particular debts contracted by the ſtates, or thoſe which they have aſſumed, muſt be paid. Certificates have been iſſued for the amount of thoſe debts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by one claſs of auditors or another; how is the certificate debt of this ſtate to be reduced? how is it to be diſcharged! Theſe are difficult queſtions—they are beyond the powers of ordinary calculation—conjecture itſelf can hardly reach them. It has been alledged, that our certificate debt bears ſome reſemblance to that many headed monſter of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity which defied all danger; whenever one of its heads was cut off, two other heads aroſe to ſupply the loſs.—Debts of this kind cannot be reduced to the common rules of finance.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen that a tax is to be collected annually for the uſe of the federal treaſury in ſpecie, unleſs we are willing to forfeit our honor, and give up all pretenſions to national character. Is it probable that we ſhall be able to raiſe half of this ſum by all the various taxes on property? I think not. It is certain that the whole of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>xes for the preſent year, after the civil liſt of the

ſtate is paid off, will not produce half the ſum in ſpecie required for the uſe of the federal treaſury. Let the poll tax, or land tax, be increaſed to three times the ſum that is now demanded, and there would ſtill be a deficiency; but the conſequence would be great diſtreſs to the poorer claſs of citizens, and multitudes would be conſtrained to fly into the weſtern territory: thouſands would complain of the ſcarcity of money; more paper muſt be coined; that paper would again depreciate, and the taxes muſt again be doubled. Thus we ſhould for ever be climbing the hill, and for ever ſinking to the bottom. But we have other objections to taxes on property—they are extremely unequal—they cannot be juſtified except by neceſſity, and ſuch neceſſity does not appear. Is it equal or juſt, that a citizen who lives near a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The laſt mentioned takes his lumber, and every thing that his farm produces, to a ready market; the other can get nothing for his lumber; corn itſelf is of no uſe to him when money is wanted, and there are few things his farm produces that will pay much more than the expence of carrying them to market. Thoſe people complain at preſent, and their complaints are well founded, though our taxes are ſo ſmall as hardly to deſerve the name; what would they ſay if the taxes were ſuch as the honor and ſafety of the nation requires? Let us conſider, on the other hand, the effects of a ſubſtantial tax on lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries. As it would be an eaſy matter to raiſe the whole ſum that is wanted both for the federal treaſury, and for our own civil liſt, by an exciſe on foreign goods, I conceive that all other taxes might be given up, except a ſmall land tax. Under ſuch an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the public revenue, the whole of our paper money might be called in within the ſpace of three or four years; for in that time the induſtrious citizen may have diſcharged his private debts; and as he will not be called on for the payment of taxes, there can be no honeſt reaſon for making more paper. The immediate and neceſſary conſequence of ſuch taxes will be the increaſe of domeſtic manufactures, and the general circulation of hard money. Let us raiſe 1,000,000 dollars on the next year by impoſts and exciſe, the conſequence will be, that on the following year we ſhall import leſs goods, by at leaſt the amount of 500,000 dollars, and thus we ſhall become £. 200,000 the richer—that is to ſay, we ſhall have paid off ſo much of our debt, or being out of debt we ſhall have laid up ſo much hard money; for whenever our exports exceed our imports, the balance returns in ſpecie. If any man has doubts concerning the effects of large taxes on foreign manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020887_0028_0FB1494821814158"/>
he ſhould turn his eyes to the Eaſtern ſtates, and he will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that during the late war, ſundry manufactures had there been carried to conſiderable perfection. We had not been ſix months in the enjoyment of peace, before thoſe manufactures were all ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The mechanic is generally the firſt who perceives the effects of a pernicious commerce, for the ſupport of his family depends on his daily labour. Hence it is that the merchant may be profited by a particular branch of commerce, and may promote it diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, while his country is ſinking into a deadly conſumption. It is the duty of the ſtateſman, either to check or to promote the ſeveral ſtreams of commerce by taxes or bounties, ſo as to render them profitable to the nation. Thus it happened in Maſſachuſetts—A tax of 25 per cent. was lately impoſed on nails, and the poor o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant is correct, there are at leaſt 250 labourers employed at this hour in the manufacture of nails in that little town. The effects of ſumptuary laws muſt be extremely favourable to the induſtrious citizen, who lives one or two hundred miles from any navigable water. In thoſe parts the land in general is fertile, and proviſions are cheap, for it cannot be ſent to a foreign market—There it is that the manufactures of linen, woollen, and iron may flouriſh.—The citizen near the coaſt may poſſibly indulge in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Such are the preſent advantages and future effects that may be expected to ſpring from large and general taxes on foreign goods. Let us contraſt this with our preſent condition and ſyſtem of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. We have ſtated, in a former letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Britiſh manufactures, to the value of one million of dollars, we contribute at leaſt 700,000 towards the revenues of that nation, while our own are periſhing; but there are other misfortunes and other marks of ſervitude, to which we are ſubjected by our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent arrangements, and the general uſe of Britiſh goods. In the ſeveral ſtates, to the ſouthward of Delaware, it is agreed, that three fourths of the produce is exported and a ſimilar ſhare of the returns are made in Britiſh bottoms. It will be found that for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting lumber and bringing back the returns, at leaſt, one half of the property is paid to the carrier. Tobacco, our chief ſtaple, is exported on better terms. They who have ſhipped tobacco for London, have the ſatisfaction to find, that after all charges are paid that is to ſay, freight, commiſſions, brokerage, ſtorage, and a variety of other expences, real or imaginary, there is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020887_0030_0FB1494B237EDA60"/>
remaining two thirds of the value for which it was ſold; in ſome caſes three fourths of the value have been ſaved. The freight of the returns muſt be added, and we ſhall ſtate the whole, though it is conſiderably below the mark, at 32⅓ per cent. Some part of thoſe goods are carried in American bottoms, by which ſomething is ſaved to the country under all the preſent burdens of that trade; for this reaſon, we ſhall ſtate the average loſs at 30l. per cent. From this computation it appears, that when produce is ſhipped for London in one of the Southern ſtates, to the value of one million of dollars, the Britiſh merchant draws from that ſum at leaſt 300,000 dollars, under the name of freight, and other contingencies; this money is for ever loſt to the country, and the remaining 700,000 which are returned us in dry goods, muſt have contributed to the revenues of Great-Britain at leaſt 490,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. We take them burdened with that expence. Surely our preſent commerce is of the moſt extraordinary kind. Poverty is not the moſt humiliating circumſtance by which it is attended; for under the name of freemen, we are little better than ſlaves; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded by national bankrupty; burdened by private debts, and conſtantly labouring in the ſoil for the benefit of another empire. When good and evil are before us, we prefer the latter. We have it in our power to promote manufactures, to bring thouſands of induſtrious tradeſmen from foreign countries, to diſcharge our debts, and become reſpectable rich and powerful:—inſtead of that, we are fluttering about in foreign dreſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN the courſe of theſe letters I have tried to explain the true cauſe of the preſent ſcarcity of money, the ſureſt and beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of obtaining a ſufficient ſupply of ſubſtantial coin, and the ſafeſt method of adminiſtering the public revenue, ſo as to prevent
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020887_0031_0FB1494CA3599368"/>
the poor from being oppreſſed while money is ſcarce. We are told by medical people, that in diſcovering the true cauſe of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, a conſiderable progreſs is made towards its cure. It might appear ſtrange, that a fact ſo obvious as the true cauſe of the general ſcarcity of money ſhould have eſcaped the notice of any perſon; but it muſt be remembered, that when troubles are occaſioned by our own vices, we are generally dextrous at evaſions, and ingenious at fictions; for if we confeſſed our fault, it would be expected that we ſhould amend. Our farmers contend that the merchants are the cauſe of all our troubles—they export the ſpecie and make it ſcarce. The merchant will have it that our commercial ſyſtem is bad,—his profits are too ſmall, for which reaſon he cannot pay his debts; but all of them, who are in debt, are agreed that it is hard living in this country. Strange poſitions! the farmer buys fineries—his family are idle—all the crop that he can ſell, does not pay for half the goods he has bought; but he wants more fineries and more rum. He can get no more credit, and he pulls out all the ſpecie that lay in his cheſt. Is the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to be blamed for ſhipping this ſpecie, when the extravagance or indolence of the planter could furniſh him with nothing elſe to ſhip? As for the merchants, or people who are ſo called, their complaints are juſt as well founded as thoſe of the planter. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of adventurers from the Britiſh dominion, have added to the thouſands of our own citizens who are too lazy to plow, or labour at any other calling, and for this good reaſon, are become mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, or more properly traders. This tribe increaſes much faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any other claſs of citizens; and this claſs we have to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, beſides the misfortune of paying for their goods; but when any of thoſe gentlemen find it inconvenient to pay their debts, they gravely complain of the ſcarcity of money, becauſe our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial ſyſtem is bad. Certainly part of our ſyſtem is bad; for by proper regulations, nine tenths of thoſe merchants that are here might be exchanged for ten times the number of mechanics, who would render much more ſervice to the public and to themſelves. The general charge of its being hard to live in America, has a worſe foundation if poſſible than the other complaints. There is not at this time a civilized country on the face of the earth, in which a poor man may live with ſo much caſe as in the United States of America. The modes of living are various in the different ſtates; I ſhall take an example from a Southern ſtate; namely, North-Carolina.</p>
               <p>The neceſſaries of life are food and cloathing. Three-fourths of the labour of the human ſpecies is, doubtleſs, employed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing food.

The produce of our labour is greater, and the labour we employ is leſs. Every man who has viſited foreign countries, knows with what diligence farmers and mechanics are obliged to labour through the year. In the winter their work begins before day, and in ſummer it continues through the day. They have little reſpite, nor time for ſpending money. If one of them is accoſted, he ſeldom ſtops to anſwer the queſtion—his work muſt go on. This is not the caſe in North Carolina, nor have we any examples of what other people call induſtry. If my calculations are right, and ſome of them are annexed,<note n="*" place="bottom">When the land is good, a labourer, by the help of an ordinary horſe, hardly worth 20 dollars, may raiſe 750 buſhels of corn in the ſeaſon; he may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Two labourers, when there are two in a family, may raiſe near twice the quantity, and one good horſe is ſufficient for both. This corn is planted in May, and the care of it is finiſhed on July, except that it is pulled on No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember. One quart of corn by the day is ſufficient to make bread for a grown perſon; there are countries in which the ſame quantity of wheat or rye is the whole allowance of a ſoldier; and if we lived as three-fourths of the inhabitants of other countries are obliged to live, this would be the end of our calculation; but one pound of pork or beef is the daily attendant on our bread, elſe we complain of hard fare. Our farmers plant peaſe among the corn, and each labourer may count on the addition to his crop of 50 buſhels of peaſe with very little trouble. The planter, and his wife, and three children, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to eat 50 buſhels of corn in the year; fifty buſhels more may be reſerved for the occaſional uſe of his horſe and his hogs; this is ſufficient when we conſider, that hogs not only ſupport but frequently fatten themſelves in the woods. The aſſiſtance of peaſe and potatoes is employed when neceſſary: the remaining three-fourths of the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's crop of corn may be ſold and employed as prudence or folly ſhall dictate. If any man ſhall caſt his eye on this note, who is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtate of farming in the lower diſtricts of North-Carolina, he might wonder that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Perhaps it may be noted, that the computation is made for a farmer who has land of his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but no allowance has been made for the payment of taxes, nor for the rents which are to be paid by the miſerable tenants. To this it may be replied, that the preſent land tax is five ſhillings for the hundred acres, and poll tax is fifteen ſhillings; ſuch debts are ſoon diſcharged by an induſtrious man in a country like th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The day's labour of a carpenter or maſon, brings him from eight to twelve ſhillings, clear of his proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and corn is ſold at three to four ſhillings the buſhel. As for the rents by which tenants are frequently grieved, no account is to be made of them in a ſtate where nineteen farmers out of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cultivate their own land.

amendment, for we have not altogether forgot the little we knew of the mechanic arts, nor the few habits of induſtry that we had formerly acquired. In a few years we may be reduced to a new ſyſtem by which we ſhall be more wealthy and leſs dependent. Perhaps I deceive myſelf, but I think that I love my country, and that no man living is more deſirous to ſerve it, but I am not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—on the contrary I shew it as a fortunate event, that our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial hopes have been diſappointed, and a check given to the baneful ſpirit of luxury, and the general uſe of Britiſh goods that was prevailing. Perhaps the time is not very diſtant when we ſhall be a frugal and virtuous nation. We are not to thank Great-Britain for the favor ſhe has done us, for ſhe did not intend thoſe commercial reſtrictions for our good; let her continue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude us from her Weſt-Indies, and contrary to good faith to withhold the Weſtern poſts; the leſs we gain by commerce the fewer of manufactures we ſhall buy, and the ſooner we ſhall make our own cloathing.

The balance of the cargo was abſorbed in charges.

               <p>The hiſtory of our planters is rather more ſimple. Diſcarding their wheels and looms, they uſed nothing but what was Britiſh.

If it is true that men have not virtue enough to bear a government that is perfectly free, the proof is like to come from this quarter. If there was a ſtate in this union, in which it was treaſon to attempt the making of paper, ſuch a ſtate would become the aſylum of honeſty, arts and induſtry; and if any of the new ſtates in the Weſtern country ſhall happily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide this guard, as part of her conſtitution, that ſtate will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly flouriſh with ſingular ſpeed; it will give a new proof that men are moſt happy when their property is ſafe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that all men approve of virtue, whatever may be their practice.</p>
               <p>The reader is fully poſſeſſed of the plan that was propoſed in the firſt of theſe letters, for giving relief under the preſent ſcarcity of money. The relief given by paper money is neither durable nor honeſt. Nothing but frugality and induſtry can bring us ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial relief: but the operations of induſtry, and the progreſs of manufactures are ſlow. Specie, which is baniſhed, cannot imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately return; and the poor man, in the mean while, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed for money to pay his taxes. In order to obviate this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, it is propoſed that the expence of government be paid by an exciſe on all foreign manufactures, or by ſumptuary taxes which are equally intended to promote domeſtic manufactures, and to give immediate relief to every induſtrious family. By a ſteady perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in this plan, the poor would be relieved from the burden of taxes—our citizens would be enabled to diſcharge their debts—we ſhould increaſe daily in wealth—our country would be the reſort of ingenious artiſts—public and private credit would re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
