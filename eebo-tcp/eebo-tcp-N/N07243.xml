            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is the beſt reaſon I can give why you had them not before.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>weekly Gazette</hi> of the 4th of June and 16th of July, are two letters from "THE CAMP" at Ninety-Six and Fort Prince George, dated the 27th
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009243_0004_1030C8D5850366C8"/>of May, and 2d of July, 1760, the firſt of which furniſhes only a few hints; the laſt ſeems calculated (notwithſtanding its being dated the day before) to be explanatory of the colonel's laſt letter, in which manner it will be chiefly made uſe of.

            <p>Before I leave this matter, I would deſire the reader to obſerve, that, excepting in this ſuſpicious poſtſcript, Col. M********Y is no where m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ioned, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or otherwiſe, throughout this very long and wonderful letter that col. Grant has ſo particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted. The reaſon of this obſervation you will ſoon diſcover.</p>
            <p>As I ſhall make great uſe alſo of the colonel's firſt letter, dated from Keehowee the day after the ſucceſs at the Lower-Settlements, publiſhed in both ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes, I muſt beg the favour of you to reprint that letter too, immediately after the letter N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 81 from Ninety-Six, and both before the colonel's adopted and ſecond letters, that gentlemen may, without the trouble of referring back to their old news-papers (which may perhaps be miſlaid) be poſſeſſed, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced manner, of my <hi>principal</hi> authorities in one view, and thereby more eaſily judge, whether the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and reaſonings from thence are fair and to the purpoſe: but, 'tis neceſſary to obſerve here, that the two paſſages in the colonel's firſt letter, printed in <hi>italicks,</hi> were, at the time of its publication, ſuppreſſed, for obvious prudential reaſons.</p>
            <p>Referring my reader to my principal vouchers, the letters juſt mentioned, which will be printed at the end (eſpecially to the three laſt) for all matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the firſt campaign in 1760, let me here inform him, in a few words, that I ſhall endeavour to prove the following propoſitions:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> That col. Grant had the principal direction of the firſt campaign.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> That he loſt two fine opportunities that campaign, of relieving Fort Loudoun, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and effectually reducing the Cherokees.</item>

                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009243_0007_1030C8DD81A16390"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That our Rangers did not deſerve the cruel treatment they met with ſeem him — <hi>N.B.</hi> It will be neceſſary to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>After theſe three propoſitions are diſcuſſed, I ſhall paſs to the colonel's ſecond camp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ign in 1761, in order, <hi>firſt,</hi> to diſcover, if the former was of any, and what, uſe to the ſecond, as a matter of mere experience. And here it will be ſhewn.</p>
            <p>That col. Grant remedied <hi>none</hi> of the matters he complained of in his firſt campaign; that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct glaringly demonſtrates, his whole dependance was on the <hi>known</hi> cowardice of the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ians; for which and other reaſons, he might have gone to the Valleys with eaſe, in the time he took <hi>before</hi> he returned to Keehowee, and ſeveral times afterwards. The ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the colonel has reduced us to with the Indians, will be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ewn to be very ſhameful and precarious; and that he may be ſent to us perhaps a third time to compleat his work, the conſequence of which will be pointed at.</p>
            <p>I am now, in the firſt place, to prove, from the colonel's letters, eſpecially from the firſt, that he had the principal direction of the campaign in 1760; and conſequently, that to him we and our poſterity will be long indebted, in the higheſt degree, for the mighty wonderful ſeats done therein. This having bean of late made a queſtion by ſome few, who, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſince col. Grant favoured us with his laſt viſit, have complimented col. M—y with it, makes it neceſſary to diſcuſs it here in limine; and how can we decide this point better, than by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of theſe two letters, which were both laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the legiſlature of the province, and the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by authority, the only one that was ſo during that campaign? Col. M —y, 'tis generally believed, had the THE NAME, which is not worth diſputing about: but who <hi>aſſumed the</hi> THING is the queſtion. It plainly appears then, by the firſt letter, beyond all contradiction, ſo much ſo, that it is needleſs to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with any quotations, that col. Grant thought
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009243_0008_1030C8E36753BBD8"/>himſelf at leaſt upon an <hi>equal</hi> footing with col. M— —y, from the ſhare he claims of the merit in plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ordering, as well as in executing the ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enterprize there mentioned; which, though it is amazing to think, how he could <hi>aim</hi> at making it of half the importance <hi>he did,</hi> may be truly called a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducted ſoldier-like tranſaction; the only one in both campaigns worth relating. In HIS ſuppoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it, in regard to the moſt eſſential object of the war, a Peace, does he not ſtep ſtill higher? when <hi>alone</hi> declaring, <hi>"the correction you will allow has been pretty ſevere; and I dare ſay, the whole nation will readily come into terms, and will not be very fond of breaking them; and I think peace with them is a deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble event for this province;"</hi> which moſt improbable dare-ſay, that he takes ſo much care to aſſure his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is peculiarly his own (for col. M—y's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this grand concern he is left to gueſs at) we find prevailed (by what immediately follows in that letter, which deſerves the reader's particular attention) and undoubtedly occaſioned the long unhappy delay at Fort Prince George, at that moſt critical juncture, when a moment's time ought not even to have been riſqued. This in all probability was the great cauſe (as I ſhall endeavour to ſhew more at large by and by) of the loſs of Fort Loudoun; the maſſacre of great part of the garriſon; and of the laſting diſhonour then <hi>brought upon</hi> his majeſty's arms; together with the long tram of misfortunes and heavy taxes, entailed upon the province ever ſince, and for years to come, even ſuppoſing the Indians to continue quiet, which I am afraid I may in my turn "<hi>dare ſay" too</hi> they will not very long (ſhould the French but have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſupplying them) even if we ſubmit to pay for our people they have <hi>ſtill</hi> priſoners amongſt them.</p>
            <p>To return from this digreſſion, does not col Grant alſo aſſume a right of adviſing his honour, and correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding with him, when he ſays, <hi>"it will be neceſſary you ſhould write a letter to encourage ſome of the Rangers to go to Fort Loudoun,"</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c and "I <hi>ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009243_0011_1030C8EB8C36A5E0"/>the particular remarkable caſe, wherein col. M—y, for once, contrary to col. Grant's opinion, <hi>"reſolved to take advantage of the Indians negligence,"</hi> &amp;c. and in the other ſituation, that col. Grant, contrary to col. M—y's judgment <hi>"thought it adviſeable to return to Fort Prince George,"</hi> to which col. M—y as uſual, but with great reluctance, conſented, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the deſtruction of the Middle Settlements, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, would not have been deferred, to produce thoſe glorious laurels reaped there the ſucceeding campaign, at leaſt without trying a ſecond <hi>"bruſh"</hi> with the Indians: and here I cannot help lamenting (ſuppoſing this to be true) how unfortunate it was for the province, that col. M—y, if he was <hi>clearly</hi> commander in chief, who had begun this campaign with ſo ſpirited and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful a ſpecimen of his judgment at Twelve-Mile creek, ſhould ever afterwards, and moſt unhappily at Etchowih, give it up (begging col. Grant's pardon, with all his accompliſhments) to an officer every way ſo manifeſtly <hi>beneath</hi> him.</p>
            <p>If there can be any perſon unacquainted with any of the gentlemen that were on that campaign, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that has been ſaid, ſtill remains dubious in this point, he is requeſted to compare the printed accounts of the two campaigns in 1760 and 1761 to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and the great ſimilarity, or rather "SAME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS" of the tranſactions, and miraculous relations of both, will, if any thing can, amply convince him, that none but one and the ſame great negotiating genius, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably ſkilled in Indian politicks, preſided throughout.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole of this matter, as it appears, by theſe two letters and from other circumſtances, that col. Grant had the greateſt ſhare in the direction of all the principal actions of this campaign, even in thinking <hi>"it adviſeable to return to Fort Prince George"</hi> which his over-nice delicacy to col. M—y, to be ſure, made him deſirous to conceal; I ſhall therefore moſt readily concur with him, in giving him the credit of them all, excepting that which took its riſe from Twelve-Mile creek, which he muſt pardon me, for the reaſon juſt now mentioned, for doubting of his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009243_0012_1030C8F187E656C0"/>right to any ſhare in, unleſs in entirely marring the good effects of it, by that ſingular ill-timed <hi>"dare ſay"</hi> of his, which not only rendered that action altogether uſeleſs, but made it prejudicial too. Henceforward, when I ſpeak of the colonel, without mentioning any name, I would be underſtood to mean col. GRANT, and him only.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſhew, that the colonel loſt two fine opportunities in 1760, of relieving Fort Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doun, and gloriouſly and effectually finiſhing the war with the Cherokees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt and beſt opportunity of all was loſt, by the ill judged unaccountable delays at Keehowee, after the ſurprize of the Lower Settlements: for, had a proper and ſpeedy advantage been taken of the apprehenſions thoſe Indians were then undoubtedly under, the army might, immediately after that ſtroke, have run through all the towns in the nation, with little hazard, as the terror of it would have ſpread, faſter than the troops could have marched, and they would have been in the midſt of the Indian towns, one after another, in all probability, before the Cherokees could have had time to recollect themſelves, and act properly in their own defence: beſides this, the uncommonneſs of the thing, would have made a durable impreſſion on thoſe ſavages, and not unlikely on their abettors, the Creeks too, to the honour and dread of his majeſty's arms for many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the laſting ſecurity of this his province. This ſuppoſition col. Grant cannot poſſibly object to as improbable, becauſe he has ſaid, "<hi>we ſhall make uſe of Tiſtory, &amp;c. to inform their nation, that though they</hi> ARE IN OUR POWER, <hi>we are ready to</hi> GIVE <hi>them peace</hi>"? From this ſpeech to our lieutenant governor too, whom ſurely he would not, for the good of his majeſty's ſervice and the ſafety of the province, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deceive, it plainly appears, he cannot deny this ſtep to have been feaſible. Now let us ſee if it was not abſolutely neceſſary too. Had the attempt been made, and ſucceſs crowned it, the utmoſt expectations and wiſhes of the people would have been thereby an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, together with general Amherſt's intentions,

Grant had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the nation to be "IN HIS POWER? but as he did, what could be his motive to heſitate? was there a moment to ſpare? Is it uſual, when a garriſon is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the laſt extremity, to deſiſt from taking all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of an enemy, eſpecially a ſavage one, when not only our friends liberties, but their lives too, were <hi>known</hi> to be at ſtake? why then were three weeks ſuffered <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feelingly</hi> to be trifled away at Keehowee, for runners to go backwards and forwards upwards of 300 miles, by that means give ſome of the Rangers time and occaſion to cool, be diſguſted, and deſert; our friendly Indians to leave us; and the Cherokees an opportunity to recover their ſpirits and deſpiſe us, to ſteal our horſes, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect themſelves together by calling in all their hunters? and, above all, to riſque the lives of above 200 fellow-ſubjects at Fort Loudoun, then looked upon by the Indians as their <hi>certain</hi> prey? when, by col. Grant's largeſt accounts, we had but 40 Indian priſoners, and all of them, excepting two or three, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (and the women they are known to regard very little) to inſure our 200. Could it be thought, the

               </gap>s beſides to what terms they almoſt pleaſed, then ſo evidently, for the ſake of that garriſon, <hi>juſt falling with it</hi> into their own power? Are not theſe natural and obvious arguments that muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to occur at the time? and if juſt, where then was the leaſt ſhadow of a reaſon, to ſupport that moſt improbable, prepoſterous, and preſumptuous <hi>"dare-ſay,"</hi> the cauſe of ſo many and ſuch laſting miſchiefs and diſgraces?</p>
            <p>But here give me leave to obſerve, that though the expectations of the army's proceeding to Fort Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doun were ſo general, as to be the ſubject of moſt converſations, eſpecially after the troops left our back ſettlements, and the paſſage of a letter, juſt now quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, from the <hi>"the Camp"</hi> at Ninety-Six, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe deſigns, which had alſo reached the fort at Keehowee, where it was heard, that it was fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to relieve Fort Loudoun, and they wiſhed it might be done in time. I ſay, that notwithſtanding this, it ſhould be aſſerted ſo roundly, after the return from Etchowih, that the army never intended to go to Fort Loudoun at all, appears, amongſt the many extraordinaries done and ſaid, and <hi>unſaid</hi> at that time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the moſt extraordinary of all; eſpecially when col. Grant ſays, in his firſt letter, "WE <hi>ſhall ſend off an expreſs this evening to capt. Demere, &amp;c. to tell the Little-Carpenter, that he may come down with ſome other headmen, to treat; but that it muſt be done in a few days, or he may expect to ſee</hi> ALL <hi>the towns in the</hi> UPPER <hi>nation in aſhes.</hi>" For God's ſake, what could be the view of this cruel tantalizing meſſage to that unfortunate gentleman? for ſuch it muſt be, if never intended to be performed: what purpoſe could it anſwer but to throw him off his guard, by making him depend on relief (which he certainly did) that was never intended, and thereby prevent his making a puſh in time, before the ſtrength of the garriſon was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009243_0015_1030C8F827CDC220"/>too much exhauſted by ſhort allowance and bad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions? and farther, to make his majeſty's arms appear ſtill more contemptible to the Indians, by ſuch deſpicable childiſh threats, mere gaſconading! which I am ſorry to ſay has been kept too ſteadily to ever ſince, and with juſt as much ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the colonel ſays, "<hi>in</hi> MY OWN <hi>opinion, 'tis next to impoſſible for us to think of proceeding over the mountains; and if they had not been ſurprized, the very country we have been in was impractible, if they had ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> much doubt of." This is the firſt hint of any objection to go to Fort Loudoun, which was ſo new and ſurprizing to the aſſembly, that, in their anſwer to his honour the lieutenant-governor's congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory meſſage, ſent them on the ſucceſs at the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Towns, together with the colonel's letter, they could not help joining with his honour in ſentiments, and words too, that "<hi>that important event might be a means of reſtoring and eſtabliſhing peace with the Indians upon a ſure and laſting foundation,</hi> IF PROPERLY IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROVED." Theſe words of his honour, were then thought ominous, and to allude to the above expreſſion of the colonel's.—How could the colonel, conſiſtent with the above declaration, <hi>write to his honour, "the nation was in our power,"</hi> and threaten, if the upper Indians, or thoſe <hi>"over the mountains"</hi> did not come <hi>"to treat,"</hi> to lay all <hi>"their towns in aſhes"?</hi> or, how could he deſire the governor <hi>"to encourage ſome of the Rangers to carry flour and cattle to Fort Loudoun"?</hi> Could part of the Rangers do, what was <hi>"next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible"</hi> for the whole army to do? I believe the colonel was, reſolv'd indeed, not to proceed, <hi>"over the mountains;"</hi> and, that his <hi>"own opinion"</hi> SHOULD prevail, notwithſtanding <hi>"he much doubted of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians ſpirit,"</hi> the only thing that could prevent him, —but more of this by and by.</p>
            <p>If it was never intended to go <hi>"over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains"</hi> to Fort Loudoun, what can be the pretence for not puſhing immediately as far as was? the utmoſt expedition was required, as well to return to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as to relieve that garriſon; this would have

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>ſaved time at leaſt, and added no little weight and authority to the expreſs to the Little-Carpenter. If the meſſenger, together with Tiftowih and the Old-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior of Eſtatowih, could have aſſured the upper nation, that the army ſet out with them, the Little Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would then have had ſomething to work upon their fears, and urge them to ſecure the garriſon for their friends, by laying them in immediately the corn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which in all probability would have been done too, had the army marched with the meſſengers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 'tis well known they were much frightened when they firſt heard of the troops deſtroying the Lower Towns: but when they had time and opportunity GIVEN them: to make uſe of evaſions, was there room to expect any other? eſpecially, as the army's unaccountable halting muſt certainly look ſuſpicious, and give theſe wily people juſt reaſon to think (as 'tis <hi>known</hi> they did) that the colonel was afraid of proceeding further; and in the interim while they were amuſing us, muſt not this ſuſpicion, eſpecially at that moſt critical junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be a fine topic for their warriors to enlarge upon in their town-houſes, to excite their nation to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a reſiſtance which that circumſtance, and that ONLY, made ſo likely would terminate in their favour to the utmoſt of their moſt <hi>ſanguine</hi> wiſhes?</p>
            <p>I am very ſorry to be obliged to acknowledge here, that the province did not, juſt at that time, properly conſult <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The ſmall-pox then raging in Charles-Town, prevented the public buſineſs being carried on in a proper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as conſiderably above half the members of the houſe, upon that account, were afraid of coming to town, which in all probability was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reaſon of matters being carried in that uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon manner at that time; for they no ſooner met in larger numbers at the ſorry, but every thing went in a prudent, proper, and ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the troops arrived here, and marched into the Cherok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> one of the cauſes of their return; but the impractabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of carrying their wounded with them: And that there was no complaint of this ſort, when the army marched from Ninety-Six to the nation, appears by the letter dated from thence (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 81) which tells us 138 were LEFT, as ſcouting parties, to guard the back ſettlements, a ſervice that might have been done according to law by the militia of the province; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ſettlers thereabouts would have chearfully done that <hi>ſafe and eaſy</hi> duty for the ſhort time wanted, if thoſe ſcouts could not have been ſpared. In ſhort, more men would have been rather an incumbrance than of any ſervice, and was thought ſo at the time, and I believe found ſo the year following, upon account of the additional number of waggons, &amp;c. that muſt have been got: beſides, the ſame letter (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 81) alſo ſays, <hi>"it is but juſtice, to mention the hearty manner in which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is the more readily undertaken, and particularly ſcrutinized, as I think the poltroonry that whole corps, and indeed all our people (excepting three captains) is accuſed of, an <hi>oblique</hi> reflection on the province: for whoever can ſuppoſe ſo conſiderable a ſample arrant cowards, muſt imagine moſt of the reſt only wanted opportunity to prove themſelves ſo too; for it ſeems hinted, that capt.

If ſo, is there any probability of any party's being ſo owl-eyed as to diſcover theſe three holes? farther, who, the leaſt acquainted with the Indians cuſtoms, can think, that they would leave their friends bodies ſo expoſed, upon ſo ſuſpicious a place as the field of battle, for above two days; when, at ſix miles diſtance from the army, they had ſo many fine opportunities, during that time, of carrying them off, at leaſt of burying them, when they took the pains to throw them into holes? and if they were buried, as letter 87 ſays "<hi>the next day</hi> (the 28th) <hi>the Indians went to bury their dead, and they ſcratched up ours and left them above ground;</hi>" is it credible, that any man would wait to dig them up and count them, when 'tis well known the army marched that night, and the ſucceeding day, to their old camp near War-Woman's creek, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame letter, is 30 miles? What time, in this caſe, had any party, ſuppoſing them equipped with ſpades, if not, with long nails, to be ſo dangerouſly curious? If there was a party, who was the officer?
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009243_0030_1030C927D0939760"/>If a ſingle perſon was ſo hardy, what was his name and character? Theſe were queſtions often aſked, by numbers of gentlemen of the aſſembly, beſides others, when the army returned, eſpecially when it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſcrutinize into the particulars of the colonel's letters, to take off that fatal influence they had upon too many (which I pointed out in my laſt) who could not think any gentleman that regarded his character, and eſpecially one that bore ſo conſiderable a commiſſion in his majeſty's ſervice, would attempt to aſſert any thing ſo roundly, of ſuch conſequence too, that he could not ſupport: But, notwithſtanding this ſtrict enquiry, by ſuch numbers, neither the party, nor a ſingle man of any character, could ever be named, that ſaw this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable phoenomenon, though from the colonel's own words <hi>"were found"</hi> and thoſe of his adopted letter N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 87 <hi>"we had occaſion to ſee,"</hi> &amp;c. this muſt be thought to be a notorious and general fact, that every man in the army knew, or might know, the certainty of.</p>
            <p>Now, though I deſpiſed taking any advantage, to prove the point before us, from the laſt article, which is given up as altogether fabulous; yet the colonel muſt not be allowed to take any, in his marvellous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the wounded, repreſented to be, <hi>every one</hi> of them, in a terrible condition, beyond probability: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it may be called a traveller's letter altogether, for not one thing in the ordinary way happened to this gentleman during that campaign. The return referred to in letter N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 87, tells us, there were 20 killed and 77 wounded, 67 rank and file, 1 drummer, 1 ſerjeant, Mr. Monro, ſurgeon's mate, and 7 commiſſion offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, viz. enſign Eddington, and capt. Peter Gordon, of the Royals; capt. Sutherland, lieut. McMartin and lieut. McKinnon, of the Highlanders; lieut. Tatnal, of the provincials; and capt. Farrel, of the waggoners. This account correſponds better with the colonel's <hi>"above ſixty men,"</hi> than it does with his <hi>"many officers;"</hi> however, that's a trifle. What I would chiefly obſerve, is, that of the eight gentlemen here named, only the two firſt were diſabled, the reſt very

               </gap> certain the whole ſix thought nothing of it. Now, if out of eight officers <hi>named,</hi> we find only two, that is, the fourth part of them, much hurt, after being told too, that "none <hi>of them can walk,</hi> every one <hi>of them muſt have an attendant:</hi>" Have we not occaſion to ſuſpect, from thence; from the <hi>ſtory</hi> of the dead bodies; and that of the Rangers (wherein <hi>"I am ſorry that I cannot ſay any thing in"</hi> his <hi>"favour,"</hi> and it would be too indelicate to ſay he <hi>"behaved moſt infamouſly"</hi> to them; that the remainder of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, returned by the lump, were not in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in proportion, eſpecially as it is well known, that not more than 3 or 4 at moſt died before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my reached the Congarees: indeed I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by thoſe that were in the action, by ſome, that not above a dozen, by others, not exceeding 20 at furtheſt, were ſo badly off as the colonel repreſents, however, let us allow 27 were, and that the other 50, if left in a good poſt, would have been able to give their aſſiſtance, <hi>only</hi> to defend it if attacked, which that they ought to have been I ſhall attempt to ſhew preſently.</p>

Now, Sir, the miſt being ſo far cleared away, as to enable us to diſcern things a little more in then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural proportions, let us return to our point, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether the actual condition of the army at this time at Etchowih, only 20 killed, 27 at moſt diſabled, and 50 ſlightly hurt, made it adviſeable for the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, merely out of compaſſion for the wounded, to <hi>return;</hi> not run off, by no means, my gentle render, think ſo; none but Rangers act ſo <hi>"moſt infamouſly"</hi> as that: The colonel, he, truly, at midnight (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 87) <hi>"(leaving the huts ſtanding and fires burning.)"</hi> "STOLE" away, very <hi>quie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> aſtoniſhing effect this inconceivable piece of <hi>ſmart</hi> generalſhip muſt have had upon the ſavages! In ſhort, this warlike ſtratagem, equally ſurprized all ſides. The Indians were as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in the morning, to find the troops were on their march back, as <hi>they,</hi> it is well known, were <hi>and</hi> ſurprized at midnight, with ſuch marching orders; and the whole province was ſurprized at the reaſons given, after ſo many and ſo great encouragements that the colonel, by his own accounts, appears to have had to proceed. Could it be expected, to penetrate into the Cherokee country without one general <hi>"bruſh,"</hi> even before, and much leſs after, the ſuſpicious and ſhameful delays at Keehowee, which ſerved no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but to inſtil a mechanical unknown courage into the Indians, by finding their continual inſults tamely (and as THEY ſaid) <hi>not warrier-like</hi> borne by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel? After ſo many incitements for the Indians to ſtand one general <hi>"bruſh,"</hi> could it be expected to loſe fewer men than he did? Did the colonel think there would be no wounded? If he thought otherwiſe, why did not HIS inſuperable difficulties, about them, prevail at Keehowee, and prevent his marching from thence at all? He tells us himſelf, <hi>"we might have gone to any town in the nation;"</hi> and who doubts it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009243_0033_1030C932B181CC30"/>to proceed with the wounded."</hi> Why was not a poſt fixed, to ſecure them? He no where gives us the reaſon; and does not venture to ſay <hi>openly</hi> himſelf, that he had not men enough to ſpare, for that purpoſe: however, as he ſays ſo through his adopted letter (87) let us quote that entire curious paſſage here, "<hi>the towns of the Middle-Settlements, ſatisfied by this time that they could not obſtruct our progreſs, had nothing for it but to carry</hi> every thing <hi>away; and our number of wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed made it</hi> IMPRACTICABLE" (his own word) "<hi>to carry them farther: we had no</hi> FORT <hi>to lodge them in, nor could we</hi> SPARE <hi>a detachment to cover them; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity could not allow of their being left a ſacrifice, for the ſake of burning a parcel of empty houſes.</hi>" Here, Sir, the whole difficulty, that occaſioned this famous <hi>return,</hi> is ſaid to be, the want of <hi>forts,</hi> and want of <hi>ſpare</hi> men to cover the wounded. Did not capt. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gordon <hi>glaringly</hi> ſhew, how eaſily both theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences might be obviated? Did not that brave officer, from the beſt poſt he could FIND, beat off the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent attacks of "THE INDIANS," repeated for ſo many hours, notwithſtanding he was then ſo hampered with ſuch a number of pack-horſes <hi>before,</hi> and cattle <hi>behind?</hi> And did he not do it effectually, ſo as to ſave "EVERY THING;" not ſo much as (87) <hi>"a bag of flour loſt by the enemy, or a bullock."</hi> Is not this a KNOWN and <hi>allowed</hi> fact, that capt. Gordon did ſo? If he had not, I don't know what the colonel would have done for his breakfaſt next morning, or his troops either, unleſs their knapſacks were full; but perhaps he would rather have gone without, to have had a better excuſe for returning. The leaving the cattle and pack-horſes <hi>ſix miles behind</hi> him, for <hi>ſo many hours,</hi> looks a little ſuſpicious; eſpecially after he had wrote from Keehowee, "<hi>in</hi> MY OWN <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, 'tis next to impoſſible, for us to proceed over the mountains,</hi>" and ſeems, as if he was determined, to make <hi>his</hi> opinion good. What elſe can account for ſuch conduct? If two hundred men, which were the moſt that capt. Gordon had with him, including pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials, Rangers, packhorſe-men, &amp;c. could, from
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009243_0034_1030C935BAD09460"/>the beſt poſt they could <hi>find,</hi> or rather <hi>no poſt at all,</hi> defend themſelves ſo long <hi>"and ſave every thing,"</hi> what danger could there be, when a poſt might have been CHOSEN OUT, intrenched and ſtockaded, in little time and with eaſe, of a few men, <hi>free from all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,</hi> defending the wounded from any attacks whatever of the Indians? Would not their feeble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, ſo far from being dreaded, been laughed at? Were Indians alone ever known to attack the ſlighteſt ſtockade or entrenchment by aſſault, much leſs the cowardly Cherokees? Might not what materials the ruined houſes did not ſupply have been eaſily furniſhed from the neighbouring woods? Would not this have eaſed the wounded greatly, ſuppoſing they had been left at Etchowih, where, by the colonel's corrected account of letter 87, there were proviſions full ſufficient for theſe people, without taking any from the army, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a little beef, for a change? Though it would perhaps have been rather more ſpirited, and anſwered ſeveral good purpoſes, to have carried the wounded with them one very eaſy march more (not <hi>even</hi> 30 miles) or a ſecond, if they were not attacked in the firſt, and then left them in a poſt: Would not 20 men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the 50 that were ſo ſlightly hurt, with a few ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles from the Rangers or provincials, been fully ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this purpoſe? beſides, carrying the diſabled a march or two, might have deceived the Indians, and made them conjecture, this poſt was more for the tired men, or other purpoſes, than entirely with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſecure the wounded. Is there any reaſon to think the colonel might not have taken theſe ſteps, and proceeded as far at leaſt as he did the ſecond cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, but that he did not try? And did not every motive, that could poſſibly actuate the mind of a man of honour, urgently preſs the experiment at that time, even ſuppoſing the riſque had been much greater? Was he not convinced his enemies were contemptible? Were not the full 1180 regulars, rank and file, he had with him, including ſerjeants, equal to any in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſervice?

            <p>If general Amherſt's orders were ſo contrary (which is hardly credible) to his declaration to his honour the lieutenant governor, why did not the troops imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately return after the ſurprize of the Lower Towns, without a moment's loſs of time? It would certainly have been leſs prejudicial to have done ſo, and looked like diſpatch, and not improbably have anſwered all the purpoſes thoſe forces were ſent for; the general's, by rejoining him early enough to be of ſervice upon that moſt important campaign he was then engaged in; and ours, by the miſchief being done ſo ſuddenly and unexpectedly, and the troops immediately vaniſhing, having ſuch a ſtrong reſemblance to the Indians own manner of fighting, which they dread <hi>indeed,</hi> that they might not unlikely, through apprehenſions of ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other dreadful and unlook'd for viſit in a different quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have been ſo intimidated as to give us the ſatisfaction we wanted. 'Tis ſurprizing this had no weight with the colonel, one ſo <hi>thoroughly verſed</hi> in Indian matters! As the affair was managed, that large detachment was not of the leaſt ſervice any where that campaign; for it joined the general (as was before ſuppoſed it would) too late; when his glorious buſineſs was compleated; though the troops were uncommonly fortunate, for the time of year, in getting expeditiouſly over the bar, and in having an unuſual fine paſſage to New-York. To us indeed, the army may be ſaid to have been of prejudice, for the ſtroke at the lower ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though a fine one for a beginning, loſing all its favourable weight, by the <hi>ſuſpicious</hi> delays at Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howee, and the <hi>lamentable</hi> retreat from Etchowih that preſently followed, ſerved only to exaſperate thoſe Indians the more, which was, very ſoon after, woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully experienced by our back ſettlers: And our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives in aſſembly, as ſoon as they were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the troops were on their march back, were ſo

            <p>Amongſt ſo many ſcarce plauſible excuſes that the colonel makes for his RETURN, as he calls it, is it not ſurprizing, that the only ſhort and ſufficient one (had it been true) ſhould not be ſo much as once hinted, throughout this curious apologetical letter; I mean that which was verbally propagated, with ſo much induſtry, when the colonel, ſeveral days before the army, made his appearance amongſt us, that the troops were <hi>obliged</hi> to come away as they did, and that it was <hi>never intended</hi> to go to Fort Loudoun at all. <hi>Had</hi> experience ſhewn it to be ſafer and eaſier, after ſuch reports had anſwered their <hi>intended</hi> purpoſes, to unſay an hundred of them, ever ſo univerſally ſpread, rather than one unguarded aſſertion expreſſed in writing?</p>

            <p>How will the colonel clear the following paſſage of a glaring contraction, not to ſay impoſition. <hi>"'Tis really unlucky, that a peace could not be brought about; we have ſucceeded in every thing we have attempted:"</hi> Was not this peace attempted?

            <p>Let us now proceed to make ſome remarks on the ſecond campaign, in 1761: in order, amongſt other things, to diſcover, if the firſt was of any, and what uſe, to the ſecond, as a matter of mere experience.</p>
            <p>Here, Sir, I muſt acknowledge myſelf extremely puzzled, to find out any improvement made in the ſecond, upon the firſt campaign, notwithſtanding the colonel was ſo many months appointed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand before he took the field. The marches were certainly much more ſlow and tedious now than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and excepting that the pack horſes were divided into brigades, and theſe ſeverally interſperſed, and guarded by the different corps, a general <hi>ſameneſs</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently runs through both, This <hi>"diſpoſition"</hi> the colonel tells us, <hi>"was right in the country we were to act in,"</hi> and to be ſure it <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo; otherwiſe, were it not too preſumptuous, one would be apt to think that diſpoſition was more <hi>rightly</hi> calculated for the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> he was to act <hi>againſt,</hi> than for the <hi>country</hi> he was to act <hi>in;</hi> and nothing can more evidently <hi>demonſtrate,</hi> that the colonel's chief dependance, <hi>from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> was, on the <hi>known</hi> cowardice of the Indians, than his ſetting out with <hi>this order of march;</hi> for had they ſuddenly and vigorouſly attacked any one corps, might not that have been cut to pieces before the next ſaw its danger, or if it did, could have come to its aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in time, when itſelf was ſo encumbered with two or three brigades of proviſion-horſes, beſides batt horſes, between it and the other.</p>
            <p>From the complaints in 1760, for want of poſts and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009243_0040_1030C9486836FBA0"/>ſpare men, it might have been reaſonably imagined, that the colonel would, as he had it in his power, have remedied thoſe HIS then inſuperable difficulties, for ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly HE could not pretend to be any ſtranger, either to the Indians want of ſpirit, way of fighting, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural advantages of ſituation, after he had before (87) "<hi>penetrated into their country, in ſpight of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted force of lower, middle, and upper Cherokees, I mean ſuch as were diſpoſed for war, which moſt of them were, excepting a few old men:—and what is equal to forcing our way to their town and deſtroying them, have returned and carried a large train of wounded men, ſixty miles at leaſt, through</hi> the moſt hazardous country in the world, <hi>in</hi> ſpight <hi>of</hi> all <hi>their efforts to diſtreſs us.</hi>" If any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty ſtill occurred to him, had he not time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to get abundant ſatisfaction, while in Charles-Town and in our ſettlements, regarding the ſituation, diſtance, number of warriors and houſes, &amp;c. of every town in the nation; and to provide himſelf with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt intelligent guides, void of any <hi>"little deſign,"</hi> and worth more then <hi>"a ſhilling"?</hi> Is it not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to think, this <hi>experienced</hi> officer, ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with every thing that could be neceſſary for the campaign, would take care to provide accordingly? eſpecially, when he had ſo much time, and might have taken <hi>much more</hi> if he thought proper, as there was no neceſſity for taking the field ſo early as he did.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing him thus furniſhed with every thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for it would be a reflection on his military ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to think otherwiſe, we will endeavour to ſee, preſently, if with the troops he had when he marched from Keehowee, whether he might not have gone to the Valleys at leaſt.</p>
            <p>Might it not, I ſay, have been expected, that the colonel would certainly have fixed poſts as he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, to ſecure the wounded, which we were told, <hi>"in a remote frontier is a diſtreſſing circumſtance,"</hi> and <hi>"it was abſolutely impracticable to proceed with them," "nor could we ſpare a detachment to cover them."</hi> (87) Were there any complaints for want of men this laſt ſummer, or any other aſſiſtance whatever?

            <p>The colonel told us in 1760, <hi>"deſtroying an Indian town may be creditable, but 'tis in fact a matter of no great conſequence, when the ſavages have time to carry off their effects;—we might have gone to any town in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion"</hi> but "<hi>then we ſhould have found it, or indeed rather them all, abandoned."</hi> 'Tis true, the corn-fields were deſtroyed laſt ſummer, as far as the colonel went; but would not theſe have been abandoned too the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well as the houſes, and therefore as <hi>eaſily</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed?

The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, in 1760, in one reſpect, would have run leſs riſque than he did the year after, as the grand deſign was, or ought to have been then, the relief of Fort Loudoun: there would have been no neceſſity for ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the troops to deſtroy the corn fields, which might have been omitted 'till their return: they might have puſhed forward with all expedition, in one compact body, 'till they had firſt anſwered that moſt material purpoſe.

The battalion corps were as good troops as the former, but there were but few of them. The 380 Royal, he had both campaigns.

               </gap>, as it had been deſcribed to him, better, 'tis not much matter; this place was only three miles farther, and that whole day's march, ſuppoſing he had gone there, would not have been, at moſt, above ſix miles, only one fifth part ſo far as the march the year before, upon his return to Keehowee, when there were fewer carriers, abundantly more wounded, and they too, by deſcription, in a far worſe condition,

Suppoſing then the colonel had puſhed to Cownih the day after the action, letting alone the interjacent towns 'till his return, ſome of them might have been uſeful in his march back. This day, the 13th, ſuppoſe an expreſs had been ſent off to Ninety-Six, as before to capt. Ruſſel, for a freſh ſupply of proviſions to be ſent to Keehowee, to wait the colonel's orders. And, at Cowhih let us halt the next day, the 14th; when parties might have been ſent out to deſtroy the Indian houſes, or rather huts, at Eyoree, only two miles diſtant from his camp, and the corn-fields thereabouts and about Cowhih, in all about 40 houſes and 200 acres of corn; this would have been eaſy work for that day, and diſcovered whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Indians were inclinable for another bruſh.

The next day, and for two days afterwrds, ſuppoſe 700 of the detachment that had halted at Cowhih, had been ſent, with 300 others, to deſtroy the 120 houſes and 180 acres of corn at Uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, Cowhihtchih, and Burning-Town, the fartheſt of them only ſeven miles diſtant from Cowhih, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from town to town, this work would have been
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009243_0049_1030C96760841CA8"/>as ſafe as eaſy; for, after the affair at Eyoree, that at Stickowih branch, and that of capt. Peter Gordon the year before, the colonel muſt have been convinced, no body of Indians would dare to interrupt ſo large a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. The 21ſt, at night, let us ſuppoſe theſe troops return to the colonel at Cowhih. The next day, the 22d, halt at Cowhih, and deſtroy thoſe hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The 23d, the whole army march back to Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſih, only 3 miles: a ſufficient detachment of light troops might have been ſent before, to deſtroy the 160 houſes and 420 acres of corn at that place, and at Taffih, Whatogah, Canugah, and Noihowih, in the way thither. And the next day, the 24th, ſuppoſe the army halt at Noucaſih, and complete yeſterday's work if neceſſary. Now the Middle Settlements alſo, on this ſide Stickowih branch, are completely deſtroyed; the colonel has been allowed ſufficient time too, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days, to march backwards and forwards from town to town, not 30 miles, beſides <hi>the day</hi> the army is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do nothing elſe but march from Etchowih to Cowhih, only 6 miles, which are included in the 30, to deſtroy in all 390 houſes and 800 acres of corn, and 70 of theſe houſes and 100 acres of the corn cloſe to his camp too at Cowhih; was it not abundantly more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and difficult, beſides dangerous, to march backwards and forwards full 40 miles, with only his 1448 rank and file, to deſtroy the 190 houſes and 530 acres of corn on Stickowih branch, and at Ellijoy in his way back to Cowhih? which he did in leſs than half the time. But ſuppoſing the detachment left at Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hih had been ordered, might it not, in the time it had, have completed a poſt, ſufficient, with 100 tired men, to have ſecured all the wounded, and what proviſions were left, only for a few days? This poſt need not to have been very ſtrong; a few ſcouts might have been ordered to watch it; the army too would have been all round it; and then the whole body, when both diviſions joined again, might have been employed in deſtroying thoſe middle towns, &amp;c. by detachments, which would have ſaved ſeveral days. However, as one would be determined to differ from the colonel as little
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:009243_0050_1030C968F8264868"/>poſſible, all poſſible contrivance has been made uſe of, to go the moſt <hi>round-about way to work</hi> that could be thought of, and I believe it would puzzle any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity but the colonel's to ſpin out the time one day longer; beſides all this, the colonel had the whole ſummer before him; ſuppoſing he had firſt of all laid in a ſufficient ſtock of proviſions at the Dividings, he might have taken his own time and way too, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted every thing we wiſhed for, long before the 16th of October, when, and not before, he left Keehowee to march downwards. The 25th of June, let us march from Noucaſih to the Dividings, only 22 miles: when the colonel was laſt at Etchowih, only 3 miles within Noucaſih, he could go with all his wounded, LOADED pack-horſes, and litters, from thence to his camp near War-Woman's creek, full <hi>thirty</hi> miles: this ſhews he can make no difficulty here, unleſs he is ſo very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as never to be able to make <hi>one ſingle</hi> good march, upon the ſame ground too, but when 'tis a <hi>ſtolen</hi> one.</p>
            <p>Now we are at the Dividings, let us halt the next day, the 26th. On the 27th, ſuppoſe 500 men had been diſpatched to Fort Prince-George, without or with all the ſick and wounded, with the pack-horſes, to bring back the freſh ſupply of proviſions that was ordered from Cowhih the 13th (to be ſure it would have been <hi>hurrying</hi> matters too much, to have left or ſent ſuch orders <hi>before</hi>); and the ſame day, ſuppoſe 1200 light troops, free from any incumbrance, only ſix or eight days proviſion each, had been diſpatched to the Valleys, might not theſe men have done that work too with eaſe, and returned back again to the Dividings in that time; the whole march, backwards and forwards, not exceeding 100 miles at fartheſt; as good a route too as any the troops had gone yet; and the ſeven Valley towns lay all in one open valley, from the firſt to the laſt not exceeding 12 miles. Theſe 8 days would have brought the 4th of July, when at leaſt 10 days proviſion would have been left for the colonel's detachment at the Dividings; indeed there would have been more, becauſe the 500 with the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009243_0051_1030C96A94988988"/>ſick, &amp;c. that went away 8 days before, need not to have carried above three days proviſion with them at moſt, ſo their allowance would have been ſaved for the remaining five days, and in fact <hi>

Here are 124 miles marched in five ſucceeding days (ſhould be ſix from 28th of May to 2d of June) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a halt, and three of then encumbered with waggons, that is, 20 or 25 miles a day for 5 or 6 days together. Now is there any more than one ſingle day's march, according to the foregoing ſcheme, ſo long? the only long one propoſed is 22 miles; the reſt are very eaſy indeed. In the march to the Valleys, eight days are allowed to <hi>light</hi> troops, free <hi>the whole time</hi> from <hi>all</hi> incumbrances <hi>but their proviſion,</hi> to march <hi>only</hi> an hundred miles at fartheſt, not thirteen miles a day. Is there any compariſon between the marches in 1760 and laſt ſummer?

(horſes and cattle, to be ſure, are not worth notice.) Notwithſtanding this, we ſtill finally confirmed and ratified the peace the 18th of December: and why could we not have done it as well in September, and ſaved our 500 pounds, not tribute, to be ſure, the Indians won't take it in that light, but charity-money, beſides other expences? Indeed the dread of ill uſage to our unhappy fellow ſubjects amongſt them, was the principal motive in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for giving that ſum; next to the colonel's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement having ſo uſeleſsly exhauſted our funds, and diſguſted our people in general, that it would be next to impoſſible for the province to raiſe any reſpectable body of men, even to oppoſe them ſhould they break out again, and much more has he put it out of our power to raiſe troops for other purpoſes: Beſides, as the peace WAS FINALLY RATIFIED, the aſſembly, though they <hi>did not approve</hi> of its being ſo without our priſoners being FIRST delivered up, yet, that <hi>they</hi> might throw no impediment in the way of ſo deſirable an event, were induced to vote this ſum. But I would aſk here, if there was a pin to chuſe, between the eight <hi>acting</hi> headmen the Little-Carpenter had with him in September, and thoſe that attended him in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember? Why did they not the laſt time bring our priſoners? They told us truly they were ſtill a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſo they have been ever ſince, to this day, poor fellows! Inſtead of getting any ſkins by their long hunt, I wiſh they may be able to ſave their own. —Surely capt. Watts muſt have been right, when he ſaid, in the council-chamber, at the time the peace was ratifying, that the Little-Carpenter, <hi>"demanded preſents, by way of ranſom, for the priſoners not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered."</hi> I wiſh no miſtake has happened, as it is believed we ſhall find that to be the caſe, directly or indirectly, at laſt, if we have them at all, which is much doubted by many.—What the repreſentatives of the province, at this time thought of this peace, and

                     <p>
                        <hi>WHAT is this they are going to do with me and my people now? It is not enough, for the people of Carolina, to be always telling me lies; but now, the</hi> Dreadful Warrior, <hi>as they call him (for my part, I will call him the</hi> Corn-Puller) <hi>is making a ſtrong houſe at Ninety-Six, for me and my people, while they ſtay there, and then to drive us to Charles-Town like a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of ſheep. The houſe has two apartments, one for the men and one for the women. And now that is true what the Virginia people and col. Byrd ſaid, that Carolina and col. Grant ſpoke with two tongues; and when I was laſt in Carolina I ſaw it; for I was promiſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I come, to get proviſions, rum, freſh horſes, &amp;c. and I never got either, but ſtarved me. And now, when I bear what they are going to do with me, I and all my people will turn back.</hi>—Upon which Mr. Mackintoſh enquiring <hi>how he came by this news,</hi> the Carpenter ſaid, <hi>from
<note n="*" place="bottom">The Cherokees are known to deſpiſe their wenches, and diſregard all they ſay.</note> two wenches who left col. Grant at Ninety-Six making the ſtrong houſe.</hi>—Mr. Mackintoſh told him, <hi>how ridiculous it was, for him to believe wenches, who he knew went always about telling lies,</hi> and deſired <hi>be might ſend down an Indian fellow with a white man, to convince him what a lie they invented.</hi>—The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter ſaid, <hi>it was poſſible they might lie, as well as the people of Carolina; but to-morrow I will come, and give you a talk to ſend to the governor and col. Grant;
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:009243_0064_1030C998C2236CA0"/>but you muſt give me a great deal of flour and beef, for I am not alone, I have got a great many with me. I want to aſk you, what you will give for each priſoner that is come down; if you pay well for thoſe that it come now, all the reſt will come down; if not, I know not bew it ſhall be; one hundred and fifty weight of leather a piece is the leaſ? you can give for them, for I was told to deliver them to you.</hi>—Mr. Mackintoſh told him, <hi>he heard they was to be given in exchange for their own people.</hi>—The Carpenter ſaid, <hi>that col. Grant told him, their people in Charles-Town</hi> HE <hi>took in war, and it was what</hi> ME <hi>would, to deliver them up; if they got nothing for them they brought down now, they would bring no more down.</hi>—Mr. Mackintoſh told the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, <hi>he could not preſume to ſay any more on that head, but that he would write to the governor and</hi> col. Grant <hi>to-morrow when be came to the fort.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, you plainly ſee the aukward and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſituation the colonel's fine management has reduced us to with the Cherokees, even with our old friend too the Little-Carpenter. The expence this province alone (excluſive of any aſſiſtance) has been at in the war with theſe ſavages, for very little more than two years, amounts to upwards of £. 750,000 currency, more than equal to £. 107,000 ſterling, of which full two-thirds might have been ſaved, had the colonel, in 1760, only marched immediately after the ſurprize at the Lower Settlements, without any delays, and loſs of time ſpent in negotiations with the Indians, which no body, as ever I heard of, thought he had <hi>any</hi> buſineſs with; the province wanted his aſſiſtance <hi>only</hi> to fight them.</p>
            <p>The Indians remain ſtill quiet, and perhaps they may continue ſo 'till the French are able to ſupply them, tho' even this is very doubtful, for the ſpring is not yet far enough advanced, ſo as to cover the trees with leaves, and give them the opportunity of that ſecure cover they ſo much value in war. Our priſoners are <hi>ſtill</hi> out upon the hunt, and if they are permitted to keep them (as well as the horſes and cattle) or are paid for them,

Do not all their talks, all their behaviour, plainly ſhew, they will do only what <hi>they</hi> pleaſe, and are ſo far from fearing, that they deſpiſe us and make us their <hi>dupes;</hi> and will keep in with us juſt as long as it ſuits their humour, or 'till they can be ſupplied elſewhere, and no longer?</p>
            <p>The colonel, very ſoon after his return from the French, after the affair at Fort Duqueſne, was ſent to us the <hi>firſt</hi> time, and did worſe than nothing: He was ſent to us again, a <hi>ſecond</hi> time, and did twice as much: And, 'tis very probable, he has not yet ſhewn us half he can do in the ſame way; another expedition may be ſtill neceſſary; the Valleys, the Upper towns, the principal aggreſſors, have not yet loſt any of "THEIR <hi>moſt valuable effects;</hi>" only ſuppoſe (no unlikely thing) that thoſe ſhould break out again, may we not have the colonel ſent to us a <hi>third</hi> time "<hi>to bring them to</hi> REASON"? and does the province want any thing more, than his preſence a third time, as a commander in chief, to make all our eſtates as purely <hi>negative,</hi> as the pay of the ſoldiers and many of the officers was to them, when the monopolizing company of ſuttlers took their laſt leave of the camp.</p>

'Tis high time, Mr. Timothy, to finiſh this tedious letter. The matters mentioned therein, happened dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the three difficult and laborious aſſemblies I had the honour to ſerve in. Whether my remarks are to the purpoſe, or no, the candid reader will certainly be the beſt judge: I am ſure, he will at leaſt be convinced, that I have not, in that time, been inattentive to the moſt materials concerns of the public. I ſhall hardly ever trouble you with a third letter. I am conſcious of no prejudices againſt any man, or that I have exceeded the bounds that truth, honour, ſincerity, and duty to the public preſcribe.</p>
            <p>Prejudices of MOST ſorts, of a <hi>national</hi> nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, are contemptible to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but ALL thoſe of a <hi>domeſtic</hi> nature, are not only ſo, but infamous and hurtful too, and ſubverſive of the true general intereſt of the community. I call all thoſe <hi>demeſtic</hi> prejudices between man and man, where any ſet of individuals of the ſame monarchy, becauſe they happen accidentally to be born in this ſtreet, this pariſh, this county, or this larger diviſion of it, or for any other as partial trifling diſtinction whatever, are influenced thereby in their interdealings, connections and judgments, to the injury of their fellow ſubjects born in a different part. All the individuals of the ſame monarchy, from one extreme to the other, ought to be thought <hi>countrymen,</hi> and have ſuch a regard for each other as is conſiſtent with the whole. The ſmall limited preferences that nature may point out among friends and relations, can be but few, and if not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried beyond <hi>her</hi> bounds, <hi>cannot</hi> have a bad tendency, as <hi>none</hi> of her rules have. All the men in a pariſh, and more ſo in a large diviſion of a monarchy, cannot be thought to <hi>know</hi> each other; time and accident ought to be allowed their due effect with all ſubjects alike; and nothing can be more deſpicable and prejudicial to a community, than for any ſet of men, to make the intervention of what they <hi>contractedly</hi> call a <hi>countryman,</hi> the <hi>fine quâ non,</hi> or teſt of their ſincerity, friendſhip, and favours. Is not this dividing a kingdom againſt itſelf, the conſequence of which we know very well from
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:009243_0070_1030C9AA791F8CE8"/>the higheſt authority?—There cannot be many, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, amongſt us, if any, of theſe narrow deſtructive ſentiments; but if there ſhould, they ought to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied: And, if a contrary behaviour, of impartiality and generoſity among their fellow ſubjects, receiving them with open arms every were, will not open their eyes, and make their little hearts glow with more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and grateful ſentiments, and reſtore them to their true, general, and equal gravitation, they muſt be left to <hi>feel</hi> the natural conſequences <hi>ſuch a ſelfiſh behaviour,</hi> when <hi>generally</hi> perceived, <hi>muſt</hi> occaſion. NOTHING can poſſibly be ſaid for ANY of theſe <hi>domeſtic</hi> preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices between man and man; they muſt be ALL as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious as hurtful. As to SEVERAL of the <hi>national</hi> while mankind are divided into different monarchies and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and, according to the fluctuating ſituation of all human affairs, frequently involved unhappily into a ſtate of war with each other, SOMETHING may be faid in <hi>their</hi> favour: for inſtance, under the many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and prudent officers at this time in his majeſty's navy, may not, and has not, a good uſe been frequently made, of that common prejudice that our moſt uſeful experimental philoſophers, the honeſt Britiſh tars have among them, that one Briton is as good as ſix Frenchmen. In ſhort, <hi>national</hi> prejudices between man and man may be <hi>ſometimes</hi> ſerviceable; but <hi>domeſtic,</hi> are <hi>always</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and abominable, and whatever may be thought,

Peter Gordon. A few light horſe went in front to make diſcoveries, with a few more on the flanks, but where the ground was very ſuſpicious, platoons of grenadiers and light infantry, were ordered out to ſcour the thickets, and other places of ambuſcade, the grenadiers and light infantry were followed by the Highlanders, and the Royal fell in the rear, next a baggage guard of regulars, in front of the baggage and packhorſes, which were led by offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſervants and waggoners, who were armed before we left fort Prince George; <hi>in the center of the packhorſes was an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer and twenty men from the picquet, and in the rear of the whole was the captain of the picquet with 50 men and one offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> FOLLOWED <hi>by the cattle under the care of a body of rangers.</hi>

               <p>"After marching 12 miles, four Indians were diſcovered, one of which was apprehended by Beamer the guide; he told COLONEL GRANT that the Indians did not expect us ſo ſoon, but to this HE paid no credit, as he was fatisfied they muſt have ſeen us every day on our march, (the Indian is ſtill in cuſtody.) After marching a mile farther, we came to an ugly kind of plain, covered with wood and bruſh ſo thick that one could ſcarce ſee three yards diſtance in ſome places; and an ugly muddy river, with ſteep clay banks running through it, overlooked on one fide by a very high mountain, and on the other by hilly uneven ground, a ſituation, in all its parts, well adapted to the Indian method of fighting, and through this infernal place muſt our road inevitably go, becauſe the creek or river was only practicable for the baggage and proviſion horſes in one place.</p>

We left that place the 24th, and foor perceived that our guides had miſinformed us about the reads, very likely from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, a few perhaps had ſome little deſign in repreſenting things in as favourable a light as poſſible, in order to induce us to go on, that they might have ſome chance of recovering their horſes, or ſome of their other effects; but let that be as it will, they are very bad judges of the ſort of road neceſſary for the march of a body of troops, and when we came to have a little bruſh, they knew no road at all, I muſt except from the number Beamer, who is hardy and intelligent, and Boyl and the Collier have merit; Jones behaved well 'till he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the others are not worth a ſhilling.</p>
               <p>"'Tis next to impoſſible for troops to go to the Middle-Settlements without forming poſts at different places: if the people who are in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the country had ſpirit to defend it, there are paſſes innumerable; the whole country the ſtrongeſt and moſt difficult I ever was in; a very few men properly conducted might retard the march of an army.

About SIX miles from that place, we found a conſiderable body of Indians, of the Lower, Middle, and Upper Settlements, with ſome Creeks and Chactaws (if we can believe people who pretend to know their language). They were poſted upon very advantageous ground, had taken poſſeſſion of every paſs, and ſeemed determined to defend the town in the beſt manner they could; but the troops behaved ſo remarkably well, that the Indians were drove from poſt to poſt, and the detachment arrived in very good order at Etcheé, though I muſt own the march was troubleſome, the difficulties of the country not to be imagined, and the fire of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, though at a diſtance, as they have a number of rifles, did execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
