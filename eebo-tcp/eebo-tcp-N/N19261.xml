            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>PREFACE.</head>
               <p>THAT the ſubſequent Letters were written by a tender father, in a declining ſtate of health, for the inſtruction of his daughters, and not intended for the Public, is a circumſtance which will recommend them to every one who conſiders them in the light of admonition and advice. In ſuch domeſtic intercourſe, no ſacrifices are made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, to cuſtoms, to faſhionable opinions. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal love, paternal care, ſpeak their genuine ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, undiſguiſed and unreſtrained. A father's zeal for his daughter's improvement, in whatever can make a woman amiable, with a father's quick apprehenſion of the dangers that too often ariſe, even from the attainment of that very point, ſuggeſt his admonitions, and render him attentive to a thouſand little graces and little decorums, which would eſcape the niceſt moraliſt who ſhould undertake the ſubject on unintereſted ſpeculation. Every faculty is on the alarm, when the objects of ſuch tender affection are concerned.</p>
               <p>In the writer of theſe Letters paternal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſole parent; death having before deprived, the young ladies of their excellent mother. His own precarious ſtate of health inſpired him with the moſt tender ſolicitude for their future welfare; and though he might have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> that the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

on made by his inſtruction and uniform example could never be effaced from the memory of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet his anxiety for their orphan condition ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him this method of continuing to them thoſe advantages.</p>
               <p>The Editor is encouraged to offer this Treatiſe to the Public, by the very favourable reception which the reſt of his father's works have met with. The Comparative View of the State of Man and other Animals, and the Eſſay on the Office and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Phyſician, have been very generally read; and, if he is not deceived by the partiality of his friends, he has reaſon to believe they have met with general approbation.</p>
               <p>In ſome of thoſe tracts the Author's object was to improve the taſte and underſtanding of his reader; in others, to mend his heart; in others, to point out to him the proper uſe of philoſophy, by ſhewing its application to the duties of common life. In all his writings his chief view was the good of his fellow-creatures; and as thoſe among his friends, in whoſe taſte and judgment he moſt confided, think the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of this ſmall work will contribute to that general deſign, and at the ſame time do honour to his memory, the Editor can no longer heſitate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their advice in communicating it to the Public.</p>

                  <salute>MY DEAR GIRLS,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU had the miſfortune to be deprived of your mother at a time of life when you were inſenſible of your loſs, and could receive little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit either from her inſtruction or her example. Before this comes to your hands, you will likewiſe have loſt your father.</p>
               <p>I have had many melancholy reflections on the forlorn and helpleſs ſituation you muſt be in, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it ſhould pleaſe God to remove me from you, before you arrive at that period of life when you will be able to think and act for yourſelves. I know mankind too well: I know their falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, their diſſipation, their coldneſs to all the duties of friendſhip and humanity. I know the little attention paid to helpleſs infancy. You will meet with few friends diſintereſted enough to do you good offices, when you are incapable of making them any return, by contributing to their intereſt or their pleaſure, or even to the gratification of their vanity.</p>
               <p>I have been ſupported under the gloom natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſing from theſe reflections, by a reliance on the goodneſs of that Providence which has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025067_0008_0FCE49D59D7CACF0"/>
preſerved you, and given me the moſt pleaſing proſpect of the goodneſs of your diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; and by the ſecret hope that your mother's virtues will entail a bleſſing on her children.</p>
               <p>The anxiety I have for your happineſs, has made me reſolve to throw together my ſentiments relating to your future conduct in life. If I live for ſome years, you will receive them with much greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſuited to your different geniuſes and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. If I die ſooner, you muſt receive them in this very imperfect manner,—the laſt proof of my affection.</p>
               <p>You will all remember your father's fondneſs, when perhaps every other circumſtance relating to him is forgotten. This remembrance, I hope, will induce you to give a ſerious attention to the advices I am now going to leave with you. I can requeſt this attention with the greater confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as my ſentiments on the moſt intereſting points that regard life and manners, were entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſpondent to your mother's whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and taſte I truſted much more than my own.</p>
               <p>You muſt expect that the advices which I ſhall give you will be very imperfect, as there are many nameleſs delicacies in female manners of which none but a woman can judge. You will have one advantage by attending to what I am going to leave with you; you will hear, at leaſt for once in your lives, the ginuine ſentiments of a man who has no intereſt in flattering or deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you. I ſhall throw my reflections together without any ſtudied order, and ſhall only, avoid confuſion, range them under a few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>I ſhall not repeat what I have there ſaid on this ſubject, and ſhall only obſerve, that from the view I have given of your natural character and place in ſociety, there ariſes a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of conduct peculiar to your ſex. It is this peculiar propriety of female manners of which I intend to give you my ſentiments, without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on thoſe general rules o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>While I explain to you that ſyſtem of conduct which I think will tend moſt to your honour and happineſs, I ſhall, at the ſame time, endeavour to point out thoſe virtues and accompliſhments which render you moſt reſpectable and moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the eyes of my own ſex.</p>

                  <p>THOUGH the duties of religion, ſtrictly ſpeaking, are equally binding on both ſexes, yet certain differences in their natural character and education, render ſome vices in your ſex par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly odious. The natural hardneſs of our hearts, and ſtrength of our paſſions, inflamed by the uncontrouled licence we are too often indulged with in our youth, are apt to render our manners

Your ſuperior delicacy, your modeſty, and the uſual ſeverity of your education, preſerve you, in a great meaſure, from any temptation to thoſe vices to which we are moſt ſubjected.

                  <p>There are many circumſtances in your ſituation that peculiarly require the ſupports of religion to enable you to act in them with ſpirit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.

You muſt bear your ſorrows in ſilence, unknown and unpitied. You muſt often put on a face of ſerenity and cheerfulneſs, when your hearts are torn with anguiſh, or ſinking in deſpair.

                  <p>But you are ſometimes in very different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that equally require the reſtraints of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The natural vivacity, and perhaps the natural vanity of your ſex, is very apt to lead you into a diſſipated ſtate of life that deceives you, under the appearance of innocent pleaſure; but which in reality waſtes you, ſpirits, impairs your health, weakens all the ſuperior facultie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Religion is rather a matter of ſentiment than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. The important and intereſting articles of faith are ſufficiently plain. Fix your attention on theſe, and do not meddle with controverſy. If you get into that, you plunge into a chaos, from which you will never be able to extricate yourſelves.

                  <p>Avoid all books and all converſation that tend to ſhake your faith on thoſe great points of religion which ſhould ſerve to regulate your conduct, and on which your hopes of future and eternal happineſs depend.</p>

                  <p>I wiſh you to go no further than the Scriptures for your religious opinions. Embrace thoſe you find clearly revealed. Never perplex yourſelves about ſuch as you do not underſtand, but treat them with ſilent and becoming reverence.

                  <p>I wiſh you to be regular in your attendance on public worſhip, and in receiving the communion.

There is a levity and diſſipation in the preſent manners, a coldneſs and liſtleſſneſs in whatever relates to religion which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to infect you, unleſs you purpoſely cultivate in your minds a contrary bias, and make the devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal taſte habitual.</p>
                  <p>Avoid all grimace and oſtentation in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties. They are the uſual cloaks of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procriſy; at leaſt they ſhew a weak and vain mind.</p>
                  <p>Do not make religion a ſubject of common converſation in mixed companies. When it is introduced, rather ſeem to decline it. At the ſame time, never ſuffer any perſon to inſult you by any fooliſh ribaldry on your religious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but ſhew the ſame reſentment you would naturally do on being offered any other perſonal inſult. But the ſureſt way to avoid this, is by

a modeſt reſerve on the ſubject, and by uſing no freedom with others about their religious ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Cultivate an enlarged charity for all mankind, however they may differ from you in their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious opinions. That difference may probably ariſe from cauſes in which you had no ſhare, and from which you can derive to merit.</p>

Never indulge this, eſpecially where your friends or acquaintances are concerned. Let the days of there misfortunes, when the world forgets or avoids them, be the ſeaſon for you to exerciſe your humanity and friendſhip, the ſight of human miſery ſoftens the heart, and makes it better: it checks the pride of health and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

and the diſtreſs it occaſions is amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated by the conſciouſneſs of doing your duty, and by the ſecret endearment which nature has annexed to all our ſympathetic ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>Women are greatly deceived, when they think they recommend themſelves to our ſex by their indifference about religion. Even thoſe men who are themſelves unbelievers, diſlike infidelity in you. Every man who knows human nature, connects a religious taſte in your ſex with ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſenſibility of heart; at leaſt we always conſider the want of it as a proof of that hard and maſculine ſpirit, which of all your faults we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the moſt. Beſides, men conſider your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as one of their principal ſecurities for that female virtue in which they are moſt intereſted. If a gentleman pretends an attachment to any of you, and endeavours to ſhake your religious principles, be aſſured he is either a fool, or has deſigns on you which he dares not openly avow.</p>
                  <p>You will probably wonder at my having edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated you in a church different from my own. The reaſon was plainly this: I looked on the differences between our churches to be of no real importance, and that a preference of one to the other was a mere matter of taſte. Your mother was educated in the Church of England, and had an attachment to it, and I had a prejudice in favour of every thing ſhe liked. It never was her deſire that you ſhould be baptiſed by a cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman of the Church of England, or be educated in that Church. On the contrary, the delicacy of her regard to the ſmalleſt circumſtance that could affect me in the eye of the world, made her anxiouſly inſiſt it might be otherwiſe. But I could not yield to her in that kind of generoſity.

When I loſt her, I became ſtill more determined to educate you in that Church, as I feel a ſecret plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in doing every thing that appears to me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my affection and veneration for her memory.

                  <p>ONE of the chief beauties in a female character, is that modeſt reſerve, that retiring delicacy, which avoids the public eye, and is diſconcerted even at the gaze of admiration.—I do not wiſh you to be inſenſible to applauſe; if you were, you muſt become, if not worſe, at leaſt leſs amiable women: but you may be dazzled by that admiration which yet rejoices your hearts.</p>
                  <p>When a girl ceaſes to bluſh, ſhe has loſt the moſt powerful charm of beauty. That extreme ſenſibility which it indicates, may be a weakneſs and incumbrance in our ſex, as I have too often felt; but in yours it is peculiarly engaging. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, who think themſelves philoſophers, aſk why a woman ſhould bluſh when ſhe is conſcious of no crime? It is a ſufficient anſwer, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has made you to bluſh when you are guilty of no fault, and has forced us to love you becauſe you do ſo.—Bluſhing is ſo far from being neceſſarily an attendant on guilt, that it is the uſual companion of innocence.</p>
                  <p>This modeſty, which I think ſo eſſential in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025067_0016_0FCE49DD27FA0628"/>
your ſex, will naturally diſpoſe you to be rather ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in company, eſpecially in a large one.—Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſenſe, and diſcernment will never miſtake ſuch ſilence for dulneſs. One may take a ſhare in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation without uttering a ſyllable. The expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the countenance ſhews it, and this never eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes an obſerving eye.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be glad that you had an eaſy dignity in your behaviour at public places, but not that confident eaſe, that unabaſhed countenance, which ſeems to ſet the company at defiance. If, while a gentleman is ſpeaking to you, one of ſuperior rank addreſſes you, do not let your eager atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and viſible preference betray the flutter of your heart: let your pride on this occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you from that meanneſs into which your vanity would ſink you. Conſider that you expoſe yourſelves to the ridicule of the company, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front one gentleman only to ſwell the triumph of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, who perhaps thinks he does you honour in ſpeaking to you.</p>
                  <p>Converſe with men even of the firſt rank with that dignified modeſty which may prevent the approach of the moſt diſtant familiarity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently prevent them from feeling themſelves your ſuperiors.</p>
                  <p>Wit is the moſt dangerous talent you can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. It muſt be guarded with great diſcretion and good nature, otherwiſe it will create you many enemies.

delicacy, and a ſtill greater one to dignity of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. It may ſometimes gain you applauſe, but will never procure you reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Be even cautious in diſplaying your good ſenſe. It will be thought you aſſume a ſuperiority over the reſt of the company. But if you happen to have any learning, keep it a profound ſecret, eſpecially from the men, who generally look with a jealous and malignant eye on a woman of great parts, amd a cultivated underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>A man of real genius and candour is far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to this meanneſs; but ſuch a one will ſeldom fall in your way; and if by accident he ſhould, do not be anxious to ſhew the full extent of your knowledge. If he has any opportunities of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, he will ſoon diſcover it himſelf; and if you have any advantages of perſon or manner, and keep your own ſecret, he will probably give you credit for a great deal more than you poſſeſs, The great art of pleaſing in converſation conſiſts in making the company pleaſed with themſelves. You will more readily hear them talk yourſelves into their good graces.</p>
                  <p>Beware of detraction, eſpecially where your own ſex are concerned. You are generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of being particularly addicted to this vice—I think, unjustly. Men are fully as guilty of it when their intereſts interfere. As your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts more frequently claſh, and as your feelings are quicker than ours, your temptations to it are more frequent; for this reaſon be particularly tender of the reputation of your own ſex, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they happen to rival you in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.

It is always in your power to avoid theſe. No man but a brute or a fool will inſult a woman with converſation which he ſees gives her pain; nor will he dare to do it, if ſhe reſent the injury with a becoming ſpirit. There is a dignity in conſcious virtue which is able to awe the moſt ſhameleſs and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned of men.</p>

After all, I wiſh you to have great eaſe and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your converſation; I only point out ſome conſiderations which ought to regulate your behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Have a ſacred regard to truth. Lying is a mean and deſpicable vice. I have known ſome women of excellent parts, who were ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to it, that they could not be truſted in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This weakneſs did not proceed from a bad heart, but was merely the effect of vanity, or an unbridled imagination. I do not mean to cenſure that lively embelliſhment of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous ſtory, which is only intended to promote in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent mirth.</p>
                  <p>There is a certain gentleneſs of ſpirit and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners extremely engaging in your ſex; not that indiſcriminate attention, that unmeaning ſimper, which ſmiles on all alike. This ariſes either from an affectation of ſoftneſs, or from perfect inſipidity.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſpecies of refinement in luxury, juſt beginning to prevail among the gentlemen of this country, to which our ladies are yet as great ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as any women upon earth; I hope, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Every one who remembers a few years back, is ſenſible of a very ſtriking change in the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſpect formerly paid by the gentlemen to the ladies; their drawing rooms are deſerted, and after dinner and ſupper the gentleman are impatient till they retire. How they came to loſe this reſpect, which nature and politeneſs ſo
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025067_0020_0FCE49E0DCD9B248"/>
well entitle them to, I ſhall not here particularly inquire. The revolutions of manners in any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try depend on cauſes very various and complicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſhall only obſerve, that the behaviour of the ladies in the laſt age was very reſerved and ſtately. I would now be reckoned ridiculouſly ſtiff and formal. Whatever it was, it had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the effect of making them more reſpected.</p>
                  <p>A fine woman, like other fine things in nature, has her proper point of view, from which ſhe may be ſeen to moſt advantage. To fix this point requires great judgement, and an intimate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the human heart. By the preſent mode of female manners, the ladies ſeem to expect that they ſhall regain their aſcendency over us, by the fulleſt diſplay of their perſonal charms, by being always in our eye at public places, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with us with the ſame unreſerved freedom as we do with one another; in ſhort, by reſembling us as nearly as they poſſibly can.—But a little time and experience will ſhow the folly of this expectation and conduct.</p>
                  <p>The power of a fine woman over the hearts of men, of men of the fineſt parts, is even beyond what ſhe conceives. They are ſenſible of the pleaſing illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they cannot, nor do they wiſh to diſſolve it. But if ſhe is determined to diſpel the charm; it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is in her power; ſhe may ſoon reduce the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to a very ordinary girl.</p>
                  <p>There is a native dignity in ingenuous modeſty to be expected in your ſex, which is your natural protection from the familarities of the men, and which you ſhould feel previous to the reflection that it is your intereſt to keep yourſelves ſacred from all perſonal freedoms. The many name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs charms and endearments of beauty ſhould be reſerved to bleſs the arms of the happy man to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025067_0021_0FCE4A1C393D0BB0"/>
whom you give your heart, but who, if he has the leaſt delicacy, will deſpiſe them if he knows that they have been proſtituted to fifty men before him. The ſentiment, that a woman may allow all innocent freedoms, provided her virtue is ſecure, is both groſsly indelicate and dangerous, and has proved fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to many of your ſex.</p>
                  <p>Let me now recommend to your attention that elegance, which is not ſo much a quality itſelf, as the high poliſh of every other. It is what diffuſes an ineffable grace over every look, every motion, every ſentence you utter; it gives that charm to beauty, without which it generally fails to pleaſe. It is partly a perſonal quality, in which reſpect it is the gift of nature; but I ſpeak of it principally as a quality of the mind. In a word, it is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of taſte in life and manners;—every virtue and every excellency in their moſt graceful and amiable forms.</p>

                  <head>AMUSEMENTS.</head>
                  <p>EVERY period of life has amuſements which are natural and proper to it. You may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the variety of your taſtes in theſe, while
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025067_0022_0FCE49E1A12C6A98"/>
you keep within the bounds of that propriety which is ſuitable to your ſex.</p>
                  <p>Some amuſements are conductive to health, as various kinds of exerciſe; ſome are connected with qualities really uſeful, as different kinds of women's work, and all the domeſtic concerns of a family; ſome are elegant accompliſhments, as dreſs, dancing, muſic, and drawing. Such books as improve your underſtanding, enlarge your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and cultivate your taſte, may be conſidered in a higher point of view than mere amuſements. There are a variety of others, which are neither uſeful nor ornamental, ſuch as play of different kinds.</p>
                  <p>I would particularly recommend to you thoſe exerciſes that oblige you to be much abroad in the open air, ſuch as walking and riding on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. This will give vigour to your conſtitutions, and a bloom to your complexions. If you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom yourſelves to go abroad always in chairs and carriages, you will ſoon become ſo enervated, as to be unable to go out of doors without them. They are like moſt articles of luxury, uſeful and agreeable when judiciouſly uſed; but when made habitual, they become both inſipid and pernicious.</p>
                  <p>An attention to your health is a duty you owe to yourſelves and to your friends. Bad health ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fails to have an influence on the ſpirits and temper. The fineſt geniuſes, the moſt delicate minds, have very frequently a correſpondent delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of bodily conſtitution, which they are too apt to neglect. Their luxury lies in reading and late hours, equal enemies to health and beauty.</p>
                  <p>But though good health be one of the greateſt bleſſings of life, never make a boaſt of it, but enjoy it in grateful ſilence. We ſo naturally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025067_0023_0FCE4A1DA52A5BC8"/>
the idea of female ſoftneſs and delicacy with a correſpondent delicacy of conſtitution, that when a woman ſpeaks of her great ſtrength, her extraordinary appetite, her ability to bear exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive fatigue, we recoil at the deſcription in a way ſhe is little aware of.</p>
                  <p>The intention of your being taught needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, knitting, and ſuch like, is not on account of the intrinſic value of all you can do with your hands, which is trifling, but to enable you to judge more perfectly of that kind of work, and to direct the execution of it in others. Another principal end is to enable you to fill up, in a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably agreeable way, ſome of the many ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ltary hours you muſt neceſſarily paſs at home. It is a great article in the happineſs of life, to have your pleaſures as independent of others as poſſible. By continually gadding abroad in ſearch of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you loſe the reſpect of all your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, whom you oppreſs with thoſe viſits, which, by a more diſcreet management, might have been courted.</p>
                  <p>The domeſtic oeconomy of a family is entirely a woman's province, and furniſhes a variety of ſubjects for the exertion both of good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ence and good taſte. If you ever come to have the charge of a family, it ought to engage much of your time and attention; nor can you be excuſed from this by any extent of fortune, though with a narrow one the ruin that follows the neglect of it may be more immediate.</p>
                  <p>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the greateſt loſs what to adviſe you in regard to books. There is no impropriety in your reading hiſtory, or cultivating any art or ſcience to which genius or accident lead you. The whole volume of Nature lies open to your
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025067_0024_0FCE49E55DFDDF28"/>
eye, and furniſhes an infinite variety of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If I was ſure that Nature had given you ſuch ſtrong principles of taſte and ſentiment as would remain with you, and influence your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conduct, with the utmoſt pleaſure would I endeavour to direct your reading in ſuch a way as might from that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſte to the utmoſt perfection of truth and elegance. "But when I reflect how eaſy it is to warm a girl's imagination, and how difficult deeply and permanently to affect her heart; how readily ſhe enters into every refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſentiment, and how eaſily ſhe can ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice them to vanity or convenience;" I think I may very probably do you an injury by arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially creating a taſte, which, if Nature never gave it you, would only ſerve to embarraſs your future conduct. I do not want to <hi>make</hi> you any thing: I want to know what Nature has made you, and to perfect you on her plan. I do not wiſh you to have ſentiments that might perplex you; I wiſh you to have ſentiments that may uniformly and ſteadily guide you, and ſuch as your hearts ſo thoroughly approve, that you would not forego them for any conſideration this world could offer.</p>
                  <p>Dreſs is an important article in female life. The love of dreſs is natural to you, and therefore it is proper and reaſonable. Good ſenſe will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate your expence in it, and good taſte will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you to dreſs in ſuch a way as to conceal any blemiſhes, and ſet off your beauties, if you have any, to the greateſt advantage. But much delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and judgement are required in the application of this rule. A fine woman ſhews her charms to moſt advantage, when ſhe ſeems moſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them. The fineſt boſom in nature is not ſo
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025067_0025_0FCE4A1F510AF210"/>
fine as what imagination forms. The moſt perfect elegance of dreſs appears always the moſt eaſy, and the leaſt ſtudied.</p>
                  <p>Do not confine your attention to dreſs to your public appearances. Accuſtom yourſelves to an habitual neatneſs, ſo that in the moſt careleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, in your moſt unguarded hours, you may have no reaſon to be aſhamed of your appearance. You will not eaſily believe how much we conſider your dreſs as expreſſive of your characters. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, levity, ſlovenlineſs, folly, appear through it. An elegant ſimplicity is an equal proof of taſte and delicacy.</p>
                  <p>In dancing, the principal points you are to attend to are eaſe and grace: I would have you to dance with ſpirit; but never allow yourſelves to be ſo far tranſported with mirth, as to forget the delicacy of your ſex. Many a girl dancing in the gaiety and innocence of her heart, is thought to diſcover a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhe little dreams of.</p>
                  <p>I know no entertainment that gives ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to any perſon of ſentiment or humour, as the theatre. But I am ſorry to ſay there are few Engliſh comedies a lady can ſee, without a ſhock to delicacy. You will not readily ſuſpect the comments gentlemen make on your behaviour on ſuch occaſions. Men are often beſt acquainted with the moſt worthleſs of your ſex, and from them too readily form their judgement of the reſt. A virtuous girl often hears very indelicate things with a countenance no wiſe embarraſſed, becauſe in truth ſhe does not underſtand them. Yet this is, moſt ungenerouſly, aſcribed to that command of features, and that ready preſence of mind, which you are thought to poſſeſs in a degree
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025067_0026_0FCE49E645133D78"/>
far beyond us; or, by ſtill more malignant obſervers, it is aſcribed to hardened effrontery.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes a girl laughs with all the ſimplicity of unſuſpecting innocence, for no other reaſon but being infected with other people's laughinging: ſhe is then believed to know more than ſhe ſhould do. If ſhe does happen to underſtand an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thing, ſhe ſuffers a very complicated diſtreſs. ſhe feels her modeſty hurt in the moſt ſenſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and at the ſame time is aſhamed of appearing conſcious of the injury. The only way to avoid theſe inconveniencies, is never to go to a play that is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly offenſive to delicacy. Tragedy ſubjects you to no ſuch diſtreſs.—Its ſorrows will ſoften and enable your hearts.</p>
                  <p>I need ſay little about gaming, the ladies in this country being as yet almoſt ſtrangers to it. It is a ruinous and incurable vice; and as it leads to all the ſelfiſh and turbulent paſſions, is peculiarly odious in your ſex. I have no objection to your playing a little at any kind of game, as a variety in your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements, provided that what you can poſſibly loſe is ſuch a trifle as can neither intereſt you, nor hurt you.</p>
                  <p>In this, as well as in all important points of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſhew a determined reſolution and ſteadineſs. This is not in the leaſt inconſiſtent with that ſoftneſs and gentleneſs ſo amiable in your ſex. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it gives that ſpirit to a mild and ſweet diſposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which it is apt to degenerate into inſipidity. It makes you reſpectable in your own eyes, and dignifies you in ours.</p>

                  <head>FRIENDSHIP, LOVE, MARRIAGE.</head>
                  <p>THE luxury and diſſipation that prevails in genteel life, as it corrupts the heart in many reſpects, ſo it renders it incapable of warm, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and ſteady friendſhip. A happy choice of friends will be of the utmoſt conſequence to you, as they may aſſiſt you by their advice and good offices. But the immediate gratification which friendſhip affords to a warm, open, and ingenuous heart, is of itſelf a ſufficient motive to court it.</p>
                  <p>In the choice of your friends, have your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal regard to goodneſs of heart and fidelity. If they alſo poſſeſs taſte and genius, that will ſtill make them more agreeable and uſeful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. You have particular reaſon to place confidence in thoſe who have ſhewn affection for you in your early days, when you were incapable of making them any return. This is an obligation for which you cannot be too grateful. When you read this, you will naturally think of your mother's friend, to whom you owe ſo much.</p>
                  <p>If you have the good fortune to meet with any who deſerve the name of friends, unboſom your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them with the moſt unſuſpicious confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It is one of the world's maxims, never to truſt any perſon with a ſecret, the diſcovery of which could give you any pain; but it is the maxim of a little mind and a cold heart, unleſs where it is the effect of frequent diſappointments and bad uſage. An open temper, it reſtrained but by tolerable prudence, will make you, on the whole, much happier than reſerved ſuſpicious
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025067_0028_0FCE49E7A3710368"/>
one, although you may ſometimes ſuffer by it. Coldneſs and diſtruſt are but the too certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of age and experience; but they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant feelings, and need not be anticipated before their time.</p>
                  <p>But however open you may be in talking of your affairs, never diſcloſe the ſecrets of one friend to another. Theſe are ſecret depoſits, which do not belong to you, nor have you any right to make uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>There is another caſe, in which I ſuſpect it is proper to be ſecret, not ſo much from motives of prudence, as delicacy; I mean in love matters. Though a woman has no reaſon to be aſhamed of an attachment to a man of merit, yet Nature, whoſe authority is ſuperior to philoſophy, has annexed a ſenſe of ſhame to it. It is even long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a woman of delicacy dares avow to her own heart that ſhe loves; and when all the ſubterfuges of ingenuity to conceal it from herſelf fail, ſhe feels a violence done both to her pride and to her mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. This, I ſhould imagine, muſt always be the caſe where ſhe is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of a return to her attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch a ſituation, to lay the heart open to any perſon whatever, does not appear to me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the perfection of female delicacy. But perhaps I am in the wrong. At the ſame time I muſt tell you, that, in point of prudence, it concerns you to attend well to the conſequences of ſuch a diſcovery. Theſe ſecrets, however important in your own eſtimation, may appear very trifling to your friend, who poſſibly will not enter into your feelings, but may rather conſider <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> as a ſubject of pleaſantry. For this reaſon love ſecrets are of all others the worſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

as no man of ſpirit and delicacy ever valued a heart much hackneyed in the ways of love.</p>
                  <p>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, therefore, you muſt have a friend to pour out your hearts to, be ſure of her honour and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy. Let her not be a married woman, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if ſhe lives happily with her huſband. There are certain unguarded moments, in which ſuch a woman, though the beſt and worthieſt of her ſex, may let hints eſcape, which at other times, or to any other perſon than her huſband, ſhe would be incapable of; nor will a huſband in this caſe feel himſelf under the ſame obligation of ſecrecy and honour, as if you had put your confidence origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in himſelf, eſpecially on a ſubject which the world is apt to treat ſo lightly.</p>
                  <p>If all other circumſtances are equal, there are obvious advantages in your making friends of one another. The ties of blood, and your being ſo much united in one common intereſt, from an additional bond of union to your friendſhip. If your brothers ſhould have the good fortune to have hearts ſuſceptible of friendſhip, to poſſeſs truth, honour, ſenſe and delicacy of ſentiment, they are the fitteſt and moſt unexceptionable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidants. By placing confidence in them, you will receive every advantage which you could hope for from the friendſhip of men, without any of the inconveniencies that attend ſuch connexions with our ſex.</p>
                  <p>Beware of making confidants of your ſervants. Dignity not properly underſtood very readily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into pride, which enters into no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe it cannot bear an equal, and is ſo fond of flattery as to graſp at it even from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and dependants. The moſt intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidants, therefore, of proud people, are valets-de-chamber and waiting-women. Shew the utmoſt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025067_0030_0FCE49EB4D1A7248"/>
moſt humanity to your ſervants; make their ſituation as comfortable to them as poſſible: but if you make them your confidants, you ſpoil them, and debaſe yourſelves.</p>
                  <p>Never allow any perſon, under the pretended ſanction of friendſhip, to be ſo familiar as to loſe a proper reſpect to you. Never allow them to teaze you on any ſubject that is diſagreeable, or where you have once taken your reſolution. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will tell you, that this reſerve is inconſiſtent with the freedom which friendſhip allows; but a certain reſpect is as neceſſary in friendſhip as in love. Without it you may be liked as a child, but you will never be beloved as an equal.</p>
                  <p>The temper and diſpoſition of the heart in your ſex make you enter more readily and warmly into friendſhips than men. Your natural propenſity to it is ſo ſtrong, that you often run into intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which you ſoon have ſufficient cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of; and this makes your friendſhips ſo very fluctuating.</p>
                  <p>Another great obſtacle to the ſincerity as well as ſteadineſs of your friendſhips, is the great claſhing of your intereſts in the purſuits of love, ambition, or vanity.

and if he perſiſts to teaze her, he makes himſelf equally the object of her ſcorn and averſion.</p>
                  <p>The effects of love among men are diverſified by their different tempers. An artful man may counterfeit every one of them ſo eaſily as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on a young girl of an open, generous, and feeling heart, if ſhe is not extremely on her guard. The fineſt parts in ſuch a girl may not always prove ſufficient for her ſecurity. The dark and crooked paths of cunning are unſearchable and inconceivable to an honourable and elevated mind.</p>
                  <p>The following, I apprehend, are the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine effects of an honourable paſſion among the men, and the moſt difficult to counterfeit. A man of delicacy often betrays his paſſion by his too great anxiety to conceal it, eſpecially if he has little hopes of ſucceſs. True love, in all its ſtages, ſeeks concealment, and never expects ſucceſs. It renders a man not only reſpectful, but timid to the higheſt degree in his behaviour to the woman he loves. To conceal the awe he ſtands in of her, he may ſometimes affect pleaſantry, but it ſits awkwardly on him, and he quickly relapſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeriousneſs, if not into dulneſs. He magnifies all her real perfections in his imagination, and is either blind to her failings, or converts them into beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Like a perſon conſcious of guilt, he is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that every eye obſerves his; and to avoid this, he ſhuns all the little obſervances of common gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry.</p>
                  <p>His heart and his character will be improved in every reſpect by his attachment. His manners <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> become more gentle, and his converſation more agreeable: but diffidence and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> always make him appear to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

in the company of his miſtreſs. If the faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation continue long, it will totally depreſs his ſpirit, and extinguiſh every active, vigorous, and manly principle of his mind. You will find this ſubject beautifully and pathetically painted in Thomſon's Spring.</p>
                  <p>When you obſerve in a gentleman's behaviour theſe marks which I have deſcribed above, reflect ſeriouſly what you are to do. If his attachment is agreeable to you, I leave you to do as nature, good ſenſe, and delicacy ſhall direct you. If you love him, let me adviſe you never to diſcover to him the full extent of your love, no, not although you marry him. That ſufficiently ſhews your preference, which is all he is intitled to know. If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e has delicacy, he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> for no ſtronger proof of your affection for your ſake; if he has ſenſe, he will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> aſk it for his own. This is an unpleaſant truth, but it is my duty to let you know it. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent love cannot ſubſiſt, at leaſt cannot be expreſſed, for any time together on both ſides; otherwiſe the certain conſequence, however concealed, is ſatiety and diſguſt. Nature in this caſe has laid the reſerve on you.</p>
                  <p>If you ſee evident proofs of a gentleman's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, and are determined to ſhut your heart againſt him, as you ever hope to be uſed with generoſity by the perſon who ſhall engage your own heart, treat him honourably and humanely. Do not let him linger in a miſerable ſuſpenſe, but be anxious to let him know your ſentiments with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to him.</p>
                  <p>However people's hearts may deceive them, there is ſcarcely a perſon that can love for any time without at leaſt ſome diſtant hope of ſucceſs. If you really wiſh to undeceive a lover, you may do
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025067_0036_0FCE49F2E2ED48C0"/>
it in a variety of ways. There is a certain ſpecies of eaſy familiarity in your behaviour which may ſatisfy him, if he has any diſcernment left, that he has nothing to hope for. But perhaps your particular temper may not admit of this: you may eaſily ſhew that you want to avoid his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but if he is a man whoſe friendſhip you wiſh to preſerve, you may not chuſe this method, becauſe then you loſe him in every capacity. You may get a common friend to explain matters to him, or fall on many other divice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> you are ſeriouſly anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to put him out of ſuſpenſe.</p>
                  <p>But if you are reſolved againſt every ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, at leaſt do not ſhun opportunities of letting him explain himſelf. If you do this, you act barbarouſly and unjuſtly. If he brings you to an explanation, give him a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>e, but reſolute and deciſive anſwer. In whatever, way you convey your ſentiments to him, if he is a man of ſpirit and delicacy, he will give you no further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor apply to your friends for their interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This laſt is a method of courtſhip which every man of ſpirit will diſdain. He will never whine nor ſue for your pity: That would morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him almoſt as much as your ſcorn. In ſhort, you may poſſibly break ſuch a heart, but you can never bend it. Great pride always accompanies delicacy, however concealed under the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the utmoſt gentleneſs and modeſty, and is the paſſion of all others the moſt difficult to conquer.</p>
                  <p>There is a caſe where a woman may coquette juſtifiably to the utmoſt verge which her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will allow. It is where a gentleman pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely declines to make his addreſſes, till ſuch time as he thinks himſelf perfectly ſure of her
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:025067_0037_0FCE4A2C9EDF6588"/>
conſent. This at bottom is intended to force a woman to give up the undoubted privilege of her ſex, the privilege of refuſing; it is intended to force her to explain herſelf, in effect, before the gentleman deigns to do it, and by this means to oblige her to violate the modeſty and delicacy of her ſex, and to invert the cleareſt order of nature. All this ſacrifice is propoſed to be made merely to gratify a moſt deſpicable vanity in a man who would degrade the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> woman whom he wiſhes to make his wife.</p>
                  <p>It is of great importance to diſtinguiſh whether a gentleman, who has the appearance of being your lover, delays to ſpeak explicitly, from the motive I have mentioned, or from a diffidence inſeparable from true attachment. In the one caſe, you can ſcarcely uſe him too ill; in the other, you ought to uſe him with great kindneſs: and the greateſt kindneſs you can ſhew him, if you are determined not to liſten to his addreſſes, is to let him know it as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>I know the many excuſes with which women endeavour to juſtify themſelves to the world, and to their own conſciences, when they act otherwiſe. Sometimes they plead ignorance, or at leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, of the gentleman's real ſentiments. That may ſometimes be the caſe. Sometimes they plead the decorum of their ſex, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins an equal behaviour to all men, and forbids them to conſider any man as a lover till he has directly told them ſo. Perhaps few women carry their ideas of female delicacy and decorum ſo far as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o. But I muſt ſay, you are not intitled to plead the obligation of theſe virtues in oppoſition to the ſuperior ones of gratitude, juſtice and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. The man is intitled to all there, who
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:025067_0038_0FCE49F4652C5B80"/>
prefers you to the reſt of your ſex, and perhaps whoſe greateſt weakneſs is this very preference. The truth of the matter is, vanity, and the love of admiration, is ſo prevailing a paſſion among you, that you may be conſidered to make a very great ſacrifice whenever you give up a lover, till every art of coquetry fails to keep him, or till he forces you to an explanation. You can be fond of the love, when you are indifferent to, or even when you deſpiſe the lover.</p>
                  <p>But the deepeſt and moſt artful coquetry is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by women of ſuperior taſte and ſenſe, to engage and fix the heart of a man whom the world and whom they themſelves eſteem, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are firmly determined never to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him. But his converſation amuſes them, and his attachment is the higheſt gratification to their vanity: nay, they can ſometimes be gratified with the utter ruin of his fortune, ſame and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. God forbid I ſhould ever think ſo of all your ſex! I know many of them have princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, have generoſity and dignity of ſoul that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate them above the worthleſs vanity I have been ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <p>Such a woman, I am perſuaded, may always convert a lover, if ſhe cannot give him her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, into a warm and ſteady friend, provided he is a man of ſenſe, reſolution and candour. If ſhe explains herſelf with a generous openneſs and freedom, he muſt feel the ſtroke as a man; but he will likewiſe bear it as a man: what he ſuffers, he will ſuffer in ſilence. Every ſentiment of eſteem will remain; but love, though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires very little food, and is eaſily ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025067_0039_0FCE4A32D627B508"/>
though paſſion ſubſides, yet a man of a candid and generous heart always retains a tenderneſs for a woman he has once loved, and who has uſed him well, beyond what he feels for any other of her ſex.</p>
                  <p>If he has not confided his own ſecret to any body, he has an undoubted title to aſk you not to divulge it. If a woman chuſes to truſt any of her companions with her own unfortunate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, ſhe may, as it is her own affair alone; but if ſhe has any generoſity or gratitude, ſhe will not betray a ſecret which does not belong to her.</p>
                  <p>Male coquetry is much more in excuſable than female, as well as more pernicious; but it is rare in this country. Very few men will give themſelves the trouble to gain or retain any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's affections, unleſs they have views on them either of an honourable or diſhonourable kind. Men employed in the purſuits of buſineſs, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition or pleaſure, will not give themſelves the trouble to engage a woman's affections, merely from the vanity of conqueſt, and of triumphing over the heart of an innocent and defenceleſs girl. Beſides, people never value much what is entirely in their power. A man of parts, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and addreſs, if he lays aſide all regard to truth and humanity, may e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This ambiguity of behaviour, this art of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in ſuſpenſe, is the great ſecret of coquetry in both ſexes. It is the more cruel in as, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

we can carry it what length we pleaſe, and continue it as long as we pleaſe, without your being ſo much as at liberty to complain or expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; whereas we can break our chain, and force you to explain, whenever we become impatient of our ſituation.</p>
                  <p>I have inſiſted the more particularly on this ſubject of courtſhip, becauſe it may moſt readily happen to you at that early period of life when you can have little experience or knowledge of the word; when your paſſions are warm, and your judgments not arrived at ſuch full maturity as to be able to correct them. I wiſh you to poſſes ſuch high principles of honour and generoſity as will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you incapable of deceiving, and at the ſame time to poſſeſs that acute diſcernment which may ſecure you againſt being deceived.</p>

deſpicable, than her thinking it eſſential to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be married. Beſides the groſs indelicacy of the ſentiment, it is a falſe one, as thouſands of women have experienced. But if it was true, the belief that it is ſo, and the conſequent impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to be married, is the moſt effectual way to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>You muſt not think from this that I do not wiſh you to marry; on the contrary, I am of opinion, that you may attain a ſuperior degree of happineſs in a married ſtate, to what you can poſſibly find in any other. I know the forlorn and unprotected ſituation of an old maid, the chagrin and peeviſhneſs which are apt to infect their tempers, and the great difficulty of making a tranſition, with dignity and cheerfulneſs, from the period of youth, beauty, admiration and reſpect, into the calm, ſilent unnoticed retreat of declining years.</p>
                  <p>I ſee ſome unmarried women, of active vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous minds, and great vivacity of ſpirits, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading themſelves; ſometimes by entering into a diſſipated courſe of life, unſuitable to their years, and expoſing themſelves to the ridicule of girls, who might have been their grand children; ſometimes by oppreſſing their acquintances by impertinent intruſions in their private affairs; and ſometimes by being the propagators of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and defamation. All this is owing to an exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berant activity of ſpirit, which, if it had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In ſhort, I am of opinion, that a married ſtate, if entered into from proper motives of eſteem and affection, will be the happieſt for yourſelves, make you moſt reſpectable in the eyes of the world, and the moſt uſeful members of ſociety: but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I am not enough of a Patriot to wiſh you to marry for the good of the public;—I wiſh you to marry for no other reaſon but to make yourſelves happier. When I am ſo particular in my advices about your conduct, I own my heart beats with the fond hope of making you worthy the attachment of men who will deſerve you, and be ſenſible of your merit.

you do not allow gentlemen to become acquainted with you, you can never expect to marry with attachment on either ſide—Love is very ſeldom produced at firſt ſight, at leaſt it muſt have, in that caſe, a very unjuſtifiable foundation.

                  <p>There is one advice I ſhall leave you, to which I beg your particular attention:—Before your affections come to be in the leaſt engaged to any man, examine your tempers, your taſtes, and your hearts, very ſeverely, and fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>If you have hearts diſpoſed by nature for love and friendſhip, and poſſeſs thoſe feelings which enable you to enter into all the refinements and delicacies of theſe attachments, conſider well, for Heaven's ſake, and as you value your future happineſs, before you give them any indulgence.

But if you find on a ſtrict ſelf-examination that marriage is abſolutely eſſential to your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, keep the ſecret inviolable in your own boſoms, for the reaſons I formerly mentioned; but ſhun as you would do the moſt fatal poiſon, all that ſpecies of reading and converſation which warms the imagination, which engages and ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the heart, and raiſes the taſte above the level of common life; if you do otherwiſe, confider the terrible conflict of paſſions this may afterwards raiſe in your breaſts.</p>
                  <p>If this refinement once takes deep root in your minds, and you do not obey its dictates, but marry from vulgar and mercenary views, you may never be able to eradicate it entirely, and then it will embitter all your married days. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of meeting with ſenſe, delicacy, tenderneſs, a lover, a friend, an equal companion, In a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, you may be tired with inſipidity and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſhocked with indelicacy, or mortified by indifference. You will find none to compaſſionate, or even underſtand your ſufferings; for your huſbands may not uſe you cruelly, and may give you as much money for your clothes, perſonal expence, and domeſtic neceſſaries, as is ſuitable to their fortunes. The world would therefore look on you as unreaſonable women, and that did not deſerve to be happy, if you were not ſo. To avoid theſe complicated evils, if you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined at all events to marry, I would adviſe you to make all your reading and amuſements of ſuch a kind, as do not affect the heart nor the imagination, except in the way of wit or humour.</p>
                  <p>I have no view by theſe advices to lead your taſtes; I only want to perſuade you of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of knowing your own minds, which, though
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025067_0046_0FCE49FE4C0B86D0"/>
ſeemingly very eaſy, is what your ſex ſeldom at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on many important occaſions in life, but particularly on this of which I am ſpeaking. There is not a quality I more anxiouſly wiſh you to poſſeſs, than that collective deciſive ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which reſts on itſelf which enables you to ſee where your true happineſs lies, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it with the moſt determined reſolution. In matters of buſineſs, follow the advice of thoſe who know them better than yourſelves, and in whoſe integrity you can confide; but in matters of taſte, that depend on your own feelings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult no one friend whatever, but conſult your own hearts.</p>
                  <p>If a gentleman makes his addreſſes to you, or gives you reaſon to believe he will do ſo, before you allow your affections to be engaged, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in the moſt prudent and ſecret manner, to procure from your friends every neceſſary piece of information concerning him; ſuch as his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for ſenſe, his morals, his temper, fortune, and family; whether it is diſtinguiſhed for parts and worth, or for folly, knavery, and loathſome hereditary diſeaſes.

to marry, none of theſe chimerical notions will give you any pain; nay, they will very quickly appear as ridiculous in your own eyes, as they probably always did in the eyes of your huſbands. They have been ſentiments which have floated in your imaginations, but have never reached your hearts.

                  <p>Marriage, indeed, will at once diſpel the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment raiſed by external beauty; but the virtues and graces that firſt warmed the heart, that reſerve and delicacy which always left the lover ſomething further to wiſh, and often made him doubtful of your ſenſibility or attachment, may and ought ever to remain. The tumult of paſſion will neceſſarily ſubſide; but it will be ſucceeded by an endearment, that effects the heart in a more equal, more ſenſible, and tender manner. But I muſt check myſelf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I have thus given you my opinion on ſome of the moſt important articles of your future life, chiefly calculated for that period when you are juſt entering the world. I have endeavoured to avoid ſome peculiarities of opinion, which, from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the general practice of the world, I might reaſonably have ſuſpected were not to well founded. But, in writing to you, I am afraid my heart has been too full, and too warmly intereſted, to allow me to keep this reſolution.

This may have produced ſome embarraſſments, and ſome ſeeming contradictions.

               <salute>MY DEAR JENNY,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WAS there any probability that a letter from me would be permitted to reach <hi>your hand alone,</hi> I ſhould not have choſen this leaſt eligible method of writing to you. The public is no way concerned in family affairs, and ought not to be made a party in them; but my circumſtances are ſuch as lay me under the neceſſity of either communicating my ſentiments to the world, or of concealing them <hi>from you:</hi> the latter would, I think, be the breach of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable duty, which obliges me to waive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of the former.</p>
            <p>A long train of events, of a moſt extraordinary nature conſpired to remove you, very early from the tender care of an affectionate mother. You were then too young to be able to form any right judgement of her conduct; and ſince that time it is very probable that it has been repreſented to you in the moſt unfavourable light. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral prejudice againſt me I never gave myſelf the uſeleſs trouble of any endeavour to remove. I do not mean to infer from hence that the open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>This notion, ſtrongly imbibed before reaſon had gained ſufficient ſtrength to diſcover its fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy was the cauſe of an inconſiderate conduct in my ſubſequent life, which marked my charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a diſadvantageous impreſſion.

               </gap>ery vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thought; and that the outward freedom of my deportment proceeded merely from a great gaiety of temper, and from a very high flow of ſpirits, never broke (if the expreſſion may be allowed) into the formal rules of decorum. To ſum up the whole in a few words, my private conduct was what the ſevereſt prude could not condemn; my public, ſuch as the moſt finiſhed coquet alone would have ventured upon; the latter only could be known to the world, and conſequently, from thence muſt their opinion be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Had your father been amongſt the number of thoſe who were deceived by appearances, I ſhould have thought it my duty to leave no method un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſay'd to clear myſelf in his opinion; but that was not the caſe. He knows that many of thoſe appearances which have been urged againſt me, I was forced to ſubmit to, not only from his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but by his abſolute command; which, contrary to reaſon and to my own intereſt, I was, for more than twelve years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> weak enough impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly to obey; and that others, even ſince our ſeparation, were occaſioned by ſome particular inſtances of his behaviour, which rendered it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to act with ſafety in any other manner. To <hi>him</hi> I appeal for the truth of this aſſertion, who is conſcious of the meaning that may hereafter be explained to you. Perfectly acquainted with my principles and with my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſpoſition, his heart, I am convinced never here condemned me. Being greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed that my father's will gave to me an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent fortune; which will he imagined I was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

'This I ſincerely believe to be the truth of the caſe, though I too well know his <hi>tenacious</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to expect a preſent juſtification; but, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhall arrive on the verge of eternity, if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon holds her place at that awful moment, and if Religion has then any power on his heart, I make no doubt, he will at that time acquit me to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and with truth he muſt then confeſs, that no part of my behaviour to him ever deſerved the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have met with.</p>
            <p>Sorry am I to be under the neceſſity of pointing out faults in the conduct of another, which are, perhaps, long ſince repented of, and ought in that caſe to be as much forgotten as they are moſt truly forgiven.

Remember that from this common Parent of the unverſe you received your life; that to His general providence you owe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it; and to his bounty you are indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all the health, eaſe, advantages, or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which help to make that life agreeable. A ſenſe of benefits received naturally inſpires a grateful diſpoſition, with a deſire of making ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able returns. All that can hear be made, for innumerable favours every moment beſtowed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is a thankful acknowledgement, and a willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. In theſe be never wanting. Make it an invariable rule to begin and end the day with a ſolemn addreſs to the Deity. I mean not by this what is commonly, with too much propriety, called <hi>ſaying of prayers,</hi> namely, a cuſtomary repetition of a few good words, without either devotion or attention; than which nothing is more inexcuſable and affrontive to the Deity; it is the homage of the heart that can alone be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by him. Expreſſions of our abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on, and of our entire reſignation to him; thankſgivings for the mercies already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; petitions for thoſe bleſſings it is fit for us to pray for; and interceſſions for all our fellow-creatures, compoſe the principal parts of this duty; which may be comprized in a very few words, or may be more enlarged upon, as the circumſtances of time and diſpoſition may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               </gap>. A good heart, joined to a tolerable underſtanding, will ſeldom be at a loſs for proper words with which to clothe theſe ſentiments; and all perſons, being beſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their own particular circumſtances, may reaſonably be ſuppoſed beſt qualified for adapting their petitions and acknowledgements to them; but for thoſe who are of a different opinion, there are many excellent forms of prayer already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Among theſe, none that I know of, are equal to Doctor Hoadly's, the late Biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, which I recommend to your peruſal and uſe. In the preface to them, you will find better inſtructions on this head than I am capable of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to theſe I refer you.</p>
            <p>It is acknowledged that our petitions cannot in any degree alter the intention of a Being, who is in himſelf invariable, and without a poſſibility of change; all that can be expected from them is, that, by bettering ourſelves, they will render us more proper objects of His favourable regard; and this muſt neceſſarily be the reſult of a ſerious, regular, and conſtant diſcharge of this branch of our duty; for it is ſcarcely poſſible to offer up our ſincere and fervent devotions to Heaven every morning and evening, without leaving on our minds ſuch uſeful impreſſions as will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſpoſe us to a ready and cheerful obedience, and will inſpire a filial fear of offending, the beſt ſecurity virtue can have. As you value your own happineſs, let not the force of bad examples ever lead you into an habitual diſuſe of ſecret prayer: nor let an unpardonable negligence ſo far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> you, as to make you reſt ſatisfied with a formal,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:025067_0061_0FCE4A824AF7F7D8"/>
cuſtomary, inattentive repetition of ſome well-choſen words: let your heart and attention always go with your lips, and experience will ſoon convince you, that this permiſſion of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the Supreme Being is the moſt valuable prerogative of human nature; the chief, nay the only ſupport under all the diſtreſſes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities to which this ſtate of ſin and miſery is liable; the higheſt rational ſatisfaction the mind is capable of on this ſide the grave; and the beſt preparative for everlaſting happineſs beyond it. This is a duty ever in your own power, and therefore you only will be culpable by the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it.</p>
            <p>Public worſhip may not always be ſo, but whenever it is, do not wilfully neglect the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the church, at leaſt on Sundays; and let your behaviour there be adapted to the ſolemnity of the place, and to the intention of the meeting. Regard neither the actions nor the dreſs of others: let not your eyes rove in ſearch of acquaintance, but in the time of divine ſervice avoid, as much as poſſible, all complimental civilities, of which there are too great an intercourſe, in moſt of our churches. Remember that your only buſineſs there is to pay a ſolemn act of devotion to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD, and let every part of your conduct be ſuitable to this great end. If you hear a good ſermon, treaſure it in your memory, that you may reap all the benefit it was capable of impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if you ſhould hear but an indifferent one, ſome good things muſt be in it; retain thoſe, and let the remainder be buried in oblivion. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule not the preacher, who no doubt has done his beſt, and who is rather the object of pity than of contempt, for having been placed in a
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:025067_0062_0FCE4A4A9E2796D8"/>
ſituation of life, to which his talents were not equal; he may perhaps be a good man, though he is not a great orator.</p>
            <p>I would alſo recommend to you the early and frequent participation of the Communion, or what is commonly called Receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the indiſpenſible duty of every chriſtian. There is no inſtitution of our religion more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, plain, and intelligible than this, as delivered to us by our Saviour; and moſt of the elaborate treatiſes written on the ſubject have ſerved only to puzzle and to diſturb weak minds, by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dark veil of ſuperſtition and of human invention over a plain poſitive command, given by him in ſo explicit a manner as to be eaſily comprehended by the meaneſt capacity, and which in doubtleſs in the power of all his ſincere followers to pay an acceptable obedience to. Nothing has more contributed to the neglect of this duty, than the numerous well-meaning books that have been written to enjoin a month's or a week's preparation, as previouſly neceſſary to the due performance of it; by theſe means fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the minds of many with needleſs terror, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it even out of the power of ſome to receive it at all, and inducing great numbers to reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with doing it only once or twice in a year, on ſome high feſtival; whereas it was certainly the conſtant cuſtom of the apoſtles and primitive chriſtians on every Sunday; and it ought to be received by us as often as it is adminiſtered in the church we frequent, which in moſt places is but once in a month. Nor do I think it excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, at any time, to turn our backs upon the table we ſee prepared for that purpoſe, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of not being fit to partake worthly of it.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025067_0063_0FCE4A83B032C2A8"/>
The beſt, the only true preparation for this, and for every other part of religious duty, is a good and virtuous life, by which the mind is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept in ſuch a devotional frame, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but a little recollection to be ſuited to any particular act of worſhip or of obedience that may occaſionally offer; and without a good and virtuous life, there cannot be a greater or more fatal miſtake than to ſuppoſe that a few days or weeks ſpent in humiliation and prayer will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us at all the more acceptable to the Deity, or that we ſhould be thereby better fitted for any one inſtance of that duty which we muſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally pay, to be either approved by him, or to be advantageous to ourſelves: I would not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adviſe you to read any of thoſe weekly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives, which are too apt to lead the mind into error, by teaching it to the reſt in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ere ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of piety, wherein there is nothing rationally ſatisfactory. The beſt books which I have ever met with on the ſubject, are Biſhop HOADLY's <hi>Plain Account of the Nature and End of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper,</hi> and NELSON's <hi>Great Duty of frequenting the Chriſtian Sacrifice.</hi> To the former are annexed the prayers which I before mentioned: theſe are well worth your attentive pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal; the deſign of the inſtitution is therein fully explained, agreeable both to ſcripture and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſincere practice of religious duties natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally leads to the proper diſcharge of the ſocial, which may be all comprehended in that one great general rule of <hi>doing unto others as you would they ſhould do unto you;</hi> but of theſe, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly herafter.—I ſhall firſt give you my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice concerning EMPLOYMENT, it being of great moment to ſet out in life in ſuch a method as may be uſeful to yourſelf and benificial to others.</p>
            <p>Time is invaluable, its loſs is irretrievable! The remembrance of having made an ill uſe of it muſt be one of the ſharpeſt tortures to thoſe who are on the brink of eternity! and what can yield a more unpleaſing retroſpect than whole years idled away in an irrational inſignificant manner, examples of which are continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes!

Diverſions, properly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, are not only allowable, they are abſolutely neceſſary to youth, and are never criminal but when taken to exceſs; that is, when they engroſs the whole thought, when they are made the chief buſineſs of life; they then give a diſtaſte to every valuable employment, and, by a ſort of infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leave the mind in a ſtate of reſtleſs impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

This is the unfortunate diſpoſition of many; guard moſt carefully againſt it, for nothing can be attended with more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conſequences. A little obſervation will convince you, that there is not, amongſt the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies, a ſet of more miſerable beings than theſe who cannot live out of a conſtant ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diverſions. Theſe people have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the more ſatisfactory pleaſure to be found in retirement; thought is inſupportable, and conſequently ſolitude muſt be intolerable to them; they are a burthen to themſelves, and a peſt to their acquaintance, by vainly ſeeking for happineſs in company, where they are ſeldom acceptable: I ſay vainly, for true happineſs exiſts only in the mind, nothing foreign can give it. The utmoſt to be attained by what is called a gay life, is a ſhort forgetfulneſs of miſery, to be felt with accumulated anguiſh in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of reflection. This reſtleſs temper is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the product of a too eager purſuit of pleaſure in the early part of life, to the neglect of thoſe valuable improvements which would lay the foundation of a more ſolid and permanent felicity. Youth is the ſeaſon for diverſions, but it is alſo the ſeaſon for acquiring knowledge, for fixing uſeful habits, and for laying in a ſtock of ſuch well-choſen materials, as may grow into a ſerene happineſs, which will encreaſe with every added year of life, and will bloom in the fulleſt perfection in the decline of it. The great art of education conſiſts in aſſigning to each its proper place, in ſuch a manner that the one ſhall never become irkſome by intrenching on the other.—Our ſeparation having taken from me the

            <p>It is an excellent method to appropriate the morning wholly to improvement; the afternoon may then be allowed to diverſions. Under this laſt head, I place company, books of the amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing kind, and entertaining productions of the needle, as well as plays, balls, &amp;c. which more commonly go by the name of diverſions: the afternoon, and evening till ſupper, may by theſe be employed with innocence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; but let not one of them ever be ſuffered to intrude on the former part of the day, which ſhould be always devoted to more uſeful employments. One half hour, or more, either before or immediately after breakfaſt, I would have you conſtantly give to the attentive peruſal of ſome rationally pious author, or to ſome part of the New Teſtament, with which, and indeed with the whole Scripture, you ought to make yourſelf perfectly acquainted, as the baſis on which your religion is founded.

            <p>Theſe, my dear, are but a few of thoſe mental improvements I would recommend to you. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no branch of knowledge that your capacity is equal to, and which you have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of acquiring, that, I think, ought to be neglected. It has been objected againſt all female learning, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that of houſehold oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, that it tends only to fill the minds of the ſex with a concerned vanity, which ſets them above their proper buſineſs; occaſions an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to, if not a total neglect of, their family affairs; and ſerves only to render them uſeleſs wives, and impertinent companies. It muſt be confeſſed, that ſome reading ladies have given but too much cauſe for this objection; and could it be proved to hold good throughout the ſex, it would certainly be right to confine their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements within the narrow limits of the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, of the kitchen, and the confectionary: but, I believe, it will, upon examination, be found, that ſuch ill conſequences proceed chiefly from too great an imbecility of mind to be capable of much enlargement, or from a mere affectation of knowledge, void of all reality. Vanity is never the reſult of underſtanding. A ſenſible woman will ſoon be convinced, that all the learning her utmoſt application can make her miſtreſs of, will be from the difference of education, in many

directly influence your conduct in life—<hi>Our rule of faith</hi> ſhould be taken from the ſcripture alone, which we muſt underſtand for ourſelves; therefore the controverted opinions of others ſerve in general rather to puzzle than to improve the mind.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Novels and Romances,</hi> very few are worth the trouble of reading: ſome of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps do contain a few good morals, but they are not worth the finding where ſo much rubbiſh is intermixed. Their moral parts indeed are like ſmall diamonds amongſt mountains of dirt and traſh, which, after you have found them, are too incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to anſwer the pains of coming at: yet, ridiculous as theſe fictirious tales generally are, they are ſo artfully managed as to excite an idle curioſity to ſee the concluſion, by which means the reader is drawn on, through a tireſome length of fooliſh adventures, from which neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, pleaſure, or profit, ſeldom can accrue, to the common cataſtrophe of a wedding. The moſt I have met with of theſe writings, to ſay no worſe, it is little better than the loſs of time to peruſe. But ſome of them have more pernicious conſequences. By drawing characters that never exiſt in life, by repreſenting perſons and things in a falſe and extravagant light, and by a ſeries of improbable cauſes bringing on impoſſible events, they are apt to give a romantic turn to the mind, which is often productive of great errors in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of fatal miſtakes in conduct. Of this I have ſeen frequent inſtances, and therefore adviſe you ſcarce ever to meddle with any of them.</p>
            <p>In juſtice however to a late ingenious author, this Letter muſt not be reprinted, without my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that, ſince the laſt edition was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, I have accidentally met with one exception

to my general rule, namely, <hi>The Vicar of Wake-field.</hi> That novel is equally entertaining and inſtructive, without being liable to any of the objections that occaſioned the above reſtriction. This poſſibly may not be the only unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able piece of the kind, but as I have not met with any other, amongſt a number I have peruſed, a ſingle inſtance does not alter my opinion of that ſort of writing; and I ſtill think, the chance is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a thouſand to one againſt the probability of obtaining the ſmalleſt degree of advantage from the reading any of them, as well as that very few are to be found from which much injury may not be received.</p>
            <p>WORKS OF THE NEEDLE that employ the fancy, may, if they ſuit your inclination, be ſometimes a pretty amuſement; but let this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment never extend to large pieces, beyond what can be accompliſhed by yourſelf without aſſiſtance. There is not a greater extravagance, under the ſpecious name of good houſewifery than the furniſhing of houſes in this manner.

This indeed was at the age of ſeventeen, when the thoughtleſs inexperience of youth could alone excuſe ſuch a piece of folly

—<hi>Embroideries in gold, ſilver, or ſhades of ſilk,</hi> come within a narrower compaſs. Works of that kind which may, without calling in expenſive aſſiſtance, or tiring the fancy, be finiſhed in a ſummer, will be a well-choſen change of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and may, as there are three of you, be made much more agreeable, by one alternately reading aloud, while the other two are thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.—All kinds of what is called <hi>plain-work,</hi> though no very polite accompliſhment, you muſt be ſo well verſed in, as to be able to cut out, make, or mend your own linen. Some fathers, and ſome huſbands, chuſe to have their daughters and their wives thus attired in the labour of their own hands, and, from a miſtaken notion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this to be the great criterion of frugal oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.

<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025067_0083_0FCE4A97E5E58DA8"/>
an argument of great folly to engage in any thing without doing it well; but this is a diverſion which I hope you will have no fondneſs for, as it is in itſelf, to ſay no worſe, a very inſignificant amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>With perſons for whom you can have no eſteem, good-breeding may oblige you to keep up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of ceremonious viſits, but politeneſs enjoins not the length or frequency of them. Here inclination may be followed without a breach of civility: there is no tax upon intimacy but from choice; and that choice ſhould ever be founded on merit, the certainty whereof you cannot be too careful in previouſly examining. Great caution is neceſſary not to be deceived by ſpecious appearances. A plauſible behaviour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, upon a ſuperficial knowledge, creates, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion in favour of particulars, who, upon a nearer view, may be found to have no claim to eſteem.

               </gap>eak off; and yet that breach may be attended with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable inconveniencies; nay, perhaps, with very material and laſting ill conſequences: prudence, therefore, here enjoins the greateſt circumſpection.</p>
            <p>Few people are capable of friendſhip, and ſtill fewer have all the qualifications one would chuſe in a friend. The fundamental point is a virtuous diſpoſition; but to that ſhould be added a good underſtanding, a ſolid judgement, ſweetneſs of temper, ſteadineſs of mind, freedom of behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and ſincerity of heart. Seldom as theſe are to be found united, never makes a boſom friend of any one greatly deficient in either. Be ſlow in contracting friendſhip, and invariably conſtant in
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025067_0084_0FCE4A644CD8E508"/>
maintaining it. Expect not many friends, but think yourſelf happy, if, through life, you meet with one or two who deſerve that name, and have all the requiſites for the valuable relation. This may juſtly be deemed the higheſt bleſſing of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Uninterrupted health has the general voice; but, in my opinion, ſuch an intercourſe of friendſhip, as much deſerves the preference, as the mental pleaſures, both in nature and degree, exceed the corporeal. The weakneſſes, the pains of the body may be inexpreſſibly alleviated by the converſation of a perſon, by affection endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by reaſon approved; whoſe tender ſympathy partakes your afflictions, and ſhares your enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; who is ſteady in the correction, but mild in the reproof of your faults; like a guardian angel, ever watchful to warn you of unforeſeen danger, and, by timely admonitions, to prevent the miſtakes incident to human frailty and to ſelf-partiality: this is the true office of friendſhip, With ſuch a friend, no ſtate of life can be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unhappy; but, deſtitute of ſome ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, Heaven has ſo formed our natures for this intimate ſociety, that amidſt the affluence of fortune, and in the flow of uninterrupted health, there will be an aching void in the ſolitary breaſt, which can never otherwiſe know a plenitude of happineſs.</p>
            <p>Should the Supreme Diſpoſer of all events be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on you this ſuperlative gift, to ſuch a friend let your heart be ever unreſervedly open. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal no ſecret thought, diſguiſe no latent weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but bare your boſom to the faithful probe of honeſt friendſhip, and ſhrink not if it ſmarts beneath the touch; nor with tenacious pride diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the perſon who freely dares to condemn ſome
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:025067_0085_0FCE4A99601DD510"/>
favourite foible; but, ever open to conviction, hear with attention, and receive with gratitude, the kind reproof that flows from tenderneſs. When ſenſible of a fault, be ingenuous in the confeſſion—be ſincere and ſteady in the correction of it.</p>
            <p>Happy is her lot, who in a Huſband find this invaluable friend! Yet ſo great is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, ſo diſproportioned the chances, that I could almoſt wiſh the dangerous die was never to be thrown for any of you: but as probably it may, let me conjure ye all, my dear girls, if ever any of you take this moſt important ſtep in life, to proceed with the utmoſt care and with deliberate circumſpection. Fortune and Family it is the ſole province of your father to direct in: he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly has always an undoubted right to a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice, though not to a compulſive one. As a child is very juſtifiable in the refuſal of her hand, even to the abſolute command of a father, where her heart cannot go with it; ſo is ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely culpable in giving it cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. Here I muſt take ſhame to myſelf; and for this unpardonable fault, I do juſtly acknowledge that the ſubſequent ill conſequences <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy marriage were the proper puniſhment. This, and every other error in my own conduct, I do, and ſhall, with the utmoſt candour, lay open to you; ſincerely praying that you may reap the benefit of my experience, and that you may avoid thoſe rocks, which, either by careleſſneſs, or ſometimes, alas, by too much caution, I have ſplit againſt! But to return:—</p>
            <p>The chief point to be regarded in the choice of <hi>a companion for life,</hi> is a really virtuous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, an unaffected goodneſs of heart. Without
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:025067_0086_0FCE4A65C65959D8"/>
this, you will be continually ſhocked by inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and pained by impiety. So numerous have been the unhappy victims to the ridiculous opinion, "<hi>A reformed libertine makes the beſt huſband,</hi>" that, did not experience daily evince the contrary, one would believe it impoſſible for a girl who has a tolerable degree of common underſtanding to be made the dupe of ſo errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a poſition, which has not the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon for its foundation, and which a ſmall ſhare of obſervation will prove to be falſe in fact. A man who has been long converſant with the worſt ſort of women, is very apt to contract a bad opinion of and a contempt for the ſex in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Incapable of eſteeming any, he is ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of all, jealous without cauſe, angry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out provocation, and his own diſturbed imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a continual ſource of ill humour. To this is frequently joined a bad habit of body, the natural conſequence of an irregular life, which gives an additional ſourneſs to the temper. What rational proſpect of happineſs can there be with ſuch a companion? And that this is the general character of thoſe who are called reformed rakes, obſervation will certify—But, admit there may be ſome exceptions, it is a hazard upon which no conſiderate women would venture the peace of her whole future life. The vanity of thoſe girls who believe themſelves capable of working mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this kind, and who give up their perſons to men of libertine principles, upon the wild ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of reclaiming them, juſtly deſerves the diſappointment which it will generally meet with; for, believe me, a wife is, of all perſons, the leaſt likely to ſucceed in ſuch an attempt. Be it your care to find that virtue in a lover which you muſt
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:025067_0087_0FCE4A9EC8C28208"/>
never hope to form in a huſband. Good-ſenſe and good-nature are almoſt equally requiſite. If the former is wanting, it will be next to impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you to eſteem the perſon of whoſe behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our you may have cauſe to be aſhamed; and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eſteem is as neceſſary to happineſs in the married ſtate as mutual affection: without the latter, every day will bring with it ſome freſh cauſe of vexation; 'till repeated quarrels produce a coldneſs, which will ſettle into an irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able averſion, and you will become not only each other's torment, but the object of contempt to your family and to your acquaintance.</p>
            <p>This quality of Good-Nature is, of all others, the moſt difficult to be aſcertained, on account of the general miſtake of blending it with Good-Humour, as if they were in themſelves the ſame; whereas, in fact, no two principles of action are more eſſentially different. And this may require ſome explanation.—By Good-Nature I mean, that true benevolence which partakes the felicity of all mankind; which promotes the ſatisfaction or every individual within the reach of its abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; which relieves the diſtreſſed, comforts the afflicted, diffuſes bleſſings, and communicates happineſs, as far as its ſphere of action can extend, and which, in the private ſcenes of life, will ſhine conſpicuous in the dutiful ſon, the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate huſband, the indulgent father, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend, and the compaſſionate maſter both to man and beaſt: whilſt Good-Humour is nothing more than a cheerful, pleaſing deportment, ariſing either from a natural gaiety of mind, or from an affectation of popularity, joined to an affability <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> behaviour, the reſult of good-breeding, and a ready compliance with the taſte of every company.
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:025067_0088_0FCE4A674D6D4568"/>
This kind of mere good-humour is, by far, the moſt ſtriking quality; 'tis frequently miſtaken for, and complimented with, the ſuperior name of real good-nature. A man by this ſpecious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance has often acquired that appellation, who, in all the actions of his private life, has been a moroſe, cruel, revengeful, ſullen, haughty tyrant. Let them put on the cap whoſe temples fit the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wreath! On the contrary, a man of a truly benevolent diſpoſition, and formed to promote the happineſs of all round him, may ſometimes, perhaps from an ill habit of body, an accidental vexation, or from a commendable openneſs of heart above the meanneſs of diſguiſe, be guilty of little ſallies of peeviſhneſs, or of ill-humour, which, carrying the appearance of ill nature, may be unjuſtly thought to proceed from it, by perſons who are unacquainted with his true charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and who take ill humour and ill-nature to be ſynonimous terms, though in reality they bear not the leaſt analogy to each other. In order to the forming a right judgment, it is abſolutely neceſſary to obſerve this diſtinction, which will effectually ſecure you from the dangerous error of taking the ſhadow for the ſubſtance; an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievable miſtake, pregnant with innumerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent evils!</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid it plainly appears, that the criterion of this amiable virtue is not to be taken from the general opinion; mere good-humour being, to all intents and purpoſes, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in this particular to eſtabliſh the public voice in favour of a man utterly devoid o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

of domeſtic conduct, that the real character can with any certainty be drawn. Theſe undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed proclaim the man; but, as they ſhun the glare of light, nor court the noiſe of popular applauſe, they paſs unnoticed, and are ſeldom known 'till after an intimate acquaintance. The beſt method, therefore, to avoid the deception in this caſe, is to lay no ſtreſs on outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, which are too often fallacious, but to take the rule of judging from the ſimple, unpoliſhed ſentiments of thoſe, whoſe dependent connections give them an undeniable certainty; who not only ſee, but hourly feel the good or bad effects of that diſpoſition to which they are ſubjected. By this I mean, that if a man is equally reſpected, eſteemed, and beloved by his tenants, by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents and domeſtics; from the ſubſtantial farmer to the laborious peaſant: from the proud ſteward to the ſubmiſſive wretch, who, thankful for employment, humbly obeys the mental tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

in a huſband, you may be ſecure of happineſs. Without the two former, it is unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable: without the latter, in a tolerable degree, it muſt be very imperfect.</p>
            <p>Remember, however, that infallibility is not the property of man, or you may entail diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment on yourſelf, by expecting what is never to be found. The beſt men are ſometimes inconſiſtent with themſelves. They are liable to be hurried by ſudden ſtarts of paſſion into expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and actions which their cooler reaſon will condemn. They may have ſome oddities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, ſome peculiarities of temper; they may be ſubject to accidental ill-humour, or to whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical complaints: blemiſhes of this kind often ſhade the brighteſt character, but they are never deſtructive of mutual felicity, unleſs when they are made ſo by an improper reſentment, or by an ill-judged oppoſition. Reaſon can never be heard by paſſion; the offer of it tends only to enflame the more. When cooled, and in his uſual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the man of underſtanding, if he has been wrong, will ſuggeſt to himſelf all that could be urged againſt him: the man of good nature will, unupbraided, own his error: immediate contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is, therefore, wholly unſerviceable, and highly imprudent; an after repetition equally unneceſſary and injudicious. Any peculiarities in the temper or behaviour ought to be properly repreſented in the tendereſt and in the moſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, and if the repreſentation of them is made diſcreetly, it will generally be well taken: but if they are ſo habitual as not eaſily to be altered, ſtrike not too often upon the unharmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſtring; rather let them paſs as unobſerved: ſuch a chearful compliance will better c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

your union; and they may be made eaſy to yourſelf, by reflecting on the ſuperior good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities by which theſe trifling faults are ſo greatly over-balanced.—You muſt remember, my dear, theſe rules are laid down, on the ſuppoſition of your being united to a perſon who poſſeſſes the three eſſential qualifications for happineſs before-mentioned. In this caſe, no farther direction is neceſſary, but that you ſtrictly perform the duty of a wife, namely, to love, to honour and obey. The two firſt articles are a tribute ſo indiſpenſibly due to merit, that they muſt be paid by inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they naturally lead to the performance of the laſt, which will not only be an eaſy, but a pleaſing taſk, ſince nothing can ever be enjoined by ſuch a perſon that is in itſelf improper, and few things will, that can with any reaſon be diſagreeable to you.</p>
            <p>Here ſhould this ſubject end, were it not more than poſſible for you, after all that has been urged, to be led by ſome inferior motive to the neglect of the primary caution; and that, either from an opinion too haſtily entertained, from an unaccountable partiality, or from the powerful prevalence of perſuaſion, you may be unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately induced to give your hand to a man whoſe bad heart and moroſe temper, concealed by a well-practiſed diſſimulation, may render every flattering hope of hapineſs abortive.—May Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in mercy, guard you from this fatal error! Such a companion is the worſt of all temporal ills; a deadly potion, that imbitters every ſocial ſense of life, damps every riſing joy, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes that chearful temper which alone can give a true reliſh to the bleſſings of mortality.

But the bare poſſibility of the event makes it not unneceſſary to lay down a few rules for the maintaining ſome degree of eaſe, under ſuch a deprivation of happineſs.

duty to diſobey; all requeſts that are inconſiſtent with prudence, or incompatible with the rank and character which you ought to maintain in life, it is your intereſt to refuſe. A compliance with the former would be criminal; a conſent to the latter highly indiſcreet; and it might thereby ſubject you to general cenſure: for a man capable of requiring from his wife what he knows to be in itſelf wrong, is equally capable of throwing the whole blame of ſuch miſconduct on her, and of afterwards upbraiding her for a behaviour to which he will, upon the ſame principle, diſown that he has been acceſſary. Many ſimilar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have come within the compaſs of my own obſervation. In things of a leſs material nature, that are neither criminal in themſelves nor perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in their conſequences, always acquieſce, if inſiſted on, however diſagreeable they may be to your own temper and inclination. Such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance will evidently prove that your refuſal, in the other caſes, proceeds not from a ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, but merely from a juſt regard to that ſuperior duty, which can never be infringed with impunity. Paſſion may reſent, but reaſon muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this conduct; and therefore it is the moſt likely method, in time, to make a favourable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. But if you ſhould fail of ſuch ſucceſs, you will at leaſt enjoy that ſatisfactory ſelf-approbation, which is the inſeparable attendant of a truly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and rational deportment.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="unknown:025067_0094_0FCE4A6EA6EB9B98"/>
the more ſupportable will it be to thoſe who are under its baneful influence. When all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to pleaſe are ineffectual, and when a man ſeems determined to find fault with every thing, as if his chief pleaſure conſiſted in tormenting thoſe about him, it requires a more than common degree of patience and reſolution to forbear ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering reproaches, which ſuch a behaviour may be juſtly allowed to deſerve: yet it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the maintaining any tolerable degree of eaſe, not only to reſtrain all expreſſions of reſentment, but to withhold even thoſe diſdainful looks which are apt to accompany a contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſilence; and they both equally tend only to encreaſe the malady. This infernal delight in giving pain is moſt unwearied in the ſearch of matter for its gratification, and can either find, or unaccountably can form it, in almoſt all the occurrences of life; but, when ſuffered unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and unregarded to run its malicious courſe, it will quickly vent its blunted arrows, and will die of diſappointment; whilſt all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to appeaſe, all complaints of unkindneſs will but ſharpen againſt yourſelf the weapon's edge, and, by proving your ſenſibility of the wound, will give the wiſhed-for ſatisfaction to him who inflicts it. Prudence, in this caſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects more than ordinary circumſpection, that every part of your behaviour may be as blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as poſſible, even to the abſtaining from the leaſt appearance of evil; and after you have, to the utmoſt of your power, ſtrove to merit appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, expect not to meet with it: by theſe means you will eſcape the mortification of being diſappointed, which, often repeated, is apt to give a gloomy ſourneſs to the temper, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible

with any degree of contentment. You muſt, ſo ſituated, learn to be ſatisfied with the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of acting right, according to your beſt abilities, and, if poſſible, you ſhould look with an unconcerned indifference on the reception of every ſucceſsful attempt to pleaſe.</p>
            <p>This, it muſt be owned, is a hard leſſon of philoſophy; it requires no leſs than an abſolute command over the paſſions; but let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that ſuch a command will itſelf moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply recompenſe every difficulty; it will compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate every pain, which it may coſt you to obtain it: beſides, it is, I believe, the only way to preſerve any tranquillity of mind, under ſo diſagreeable a connection.</p>
            <p>As the want of underſtanding is by no art to be concealed, by no addreſs to be diſguiſed, it might be ſuppoſed impoſſible for a woman of ſenſe to unite herſelf to a perſon whoſe defect, in this inſtance, muſt render that ſort of rational ſociety which contributes the chief happineſs of ſuch an union, impoſſible; yet, here, how often has the weakneſs of female judgment been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous! The advantages of great ſuperiority on rank of fortune have frequently proved ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible a temptation, as, in opinion, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh not only the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But however weak this motive muſt be acknowledged, it is more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:025067_0096_0FCE4AAA2826F610"/>
than another, which, I fear, has ſometimes had an equal influence on the mind; I mean, ſo great a love of ſway, as to induce her to give the preference to a perſon of weak intellectuals, in hopes thereby of holding, uncontrouled, the reins of government. The expectation is, in fact, ill-grounded obſtinacy; and pride being generally the companion of folly, the ſillieſt people are uſually the moſt tenacious of their opinions, and conſequently, the hardeſt of all others to be manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. but admit the contrary, the principle is in itſelf bad; it tends to invert the order of nature, and to counteract the deſign of Providence.</p>
            <p>A woman can never be ſeen in a more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light than when ſhe appears to govern her huſband. If, unfortunately, the ſuperiority of underſtanding is on her ſide, the apparent conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of that ſuperiority betrays a weakneſs that renders her contemptible in the fight of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate perſon, and it may, very probably, fix in his mind a diſlike never to be eradicated. In ſuch a caſe, if it ſhould ever be your own, remember that ſome degree of diſſimulation is commendable, ſo far as to let your huſband's defect appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved. When he judges wrong, never flatly contradict, but lead him inſenſibly into another opinion, in ſo diſcreet a manner that it may ſeem entirely his own; and let the whole credit of every prudent determination reſt on him without indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fooliſh vanity of claiming any merit to yourſelf. Thus a perſon of but an indifferent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity may be ſo aſſiſted as, in many inſtances, to ſhine with a borrowed luſtre, ſcarce diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the native, and, by degrees, he may be brought into a kind of mechanical method of acting properly, in all the common occurrences
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:025067_0097_0FCE4A76B670FB30"/>
of life. Odd as this poſition may ſeem, it is founded in fact; and I have ſeen the method ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully practiſed by more than one perſon, where a weak mind, on the governed ſide, has been ſo prudently ſet off as to appear the ſole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector; like the ſtatute of the Delphic god, which was thought to give forth its own oracles, whilſt the humble prieſt, who lent his voice, was by the ſhrine concealed, nor ſought a higher glory than a ſuppoſed obedience to the power he would be thought to ſerve.</p>
            <p>From hence it may be inferred, that by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect propriety of behaviour, eaſe, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at leaſt, are attairable with a companion who has not the moſt exalted underſtanding; but then, virtue and good-nature are preſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or there will be nothing to work upon.</p>
            <p>A vicious ill-natured fool being ſo untractable and tormenting an aſſociate, there needs only to add jealouſy to the compoſition, to make the curſe compleat. This paſſion, once ſuffered to get footing in the heart, is hardly ever to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated: it is a conſtant ſource of torment to the breaſt that gives it reception, and is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

With a perſon of this unfortunate diſpoſition, it is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to avoid the leaſt appearance of concealment. A whiſper in a mixed company, a meſſage given in a low voice to a ſervant, have, by the power of a diſturbed imagination, been magnified into a material injury. Whatever has the air of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy raiſes terror in a mind naturally diſtruſtful.

It is much more commendable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly to incur the cenſure of a trifling diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by a circumſtantial unaſked relation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant incidents, than to give any room for apprehending the leaſt degree of reſerve. Such a conſtant method of proceeding, together with a reaſonable compliance, is the moſt likely to cure this painful turn of mind; for, by with-holding every ſupport that could give ſtrength to it, the want of matter to feed on may probably in time cauſe its extinction. If, unhappily, it is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional, ſo interwoven with the ſoul as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, in a manner, inſeparably united with it, nothing remains but to ſubmit patiently to the Will of Heaven, under the preſſure of an unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable evil; to guard carefully againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequence of repeated undeſerved ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, namely, a growing indifference, which too frequently terminates in averſion; and, by conſidering ſuch a ſituation as a trial of obedience and reſignation, to receive the comfort that muſt ariſe from properly exerciſing one of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted of the chriſtian virtues.

            <p>You will find it a very good method ſo to regulate your ſtated expences as to bring them always one-fourth part within your certain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual income: by theſe means you will avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at any time diſtreſſed by unforeſeen accidents, and you will have it more eaſily in your power materially to relieve thoſe who deſerve aſſiſtance. But the giving trifling ſums, <hi>indiſcriminately,</hi> to ſuch as appear neceſſitous, is far from being commendable; it is an injury to ſociety; it is an encouragement to idleneſs, and helps to fill the ſtreets with lazy beggars, who live upon miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied bounty, to the prejudice of the induſtrious poor. Theſe are uſeful members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; and on them ſuch benefactions might be ſerviceably beſtowed. Be ſparing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this kind of indiſcriminate donations; they are too conſtantly an inſignificant relief to the receives, ſuppoſing them really in want; and frequently repeated, they amount to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum in the year's account. The proper objects of charity are thoſe, who, by unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able misfortunes, have fallen from affluent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances

Appropriate a certain part of your income to the relief of theſe real diſtreſſes.

            <p>As your fortune and ſituation are yet undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, I have purpoſely laid down ſuch rules as may be adapted to every ſtation. A large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gives greater opportunity of doing good, and of communicating happineſs in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive degree; but a ſmall one is no excuſe for with holding a proportionate relief from real and deſerving objects of compaſſion. To aſſiſt them is an indiſpenſible duty of chriſtianity. The firſt and great commandment is, To love GOD with all your heart; the ſecond, To love your neighbour as yourſelf: <hi>Whoſo ſeeth his brother in need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> or how the love of his neighbour? If dificient in theſe primary duties, vain are the hopes of acceptance built on a partial obedience to the leſſer branches of the law!—Inability is often pleaded as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for the want of charity, by perſons who make no ſcruple of daily laviſhing on their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, what, if better applied, might have made an indigent family happy through life. Theſe perſons loſe ſight of real felicity, by the miſtaken purſuit of its ſhadow: the pleaſures which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs their attention die in the enjoyment, are often ſucceeded by remorſe, and always by ſatie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whereas the true joy, the ſweet complacency

            <p>However ſmall your income may be, remember that a part of it is due to merit in diſtreſs. Set by an annual ſum for this purpoſe, even though it ſhould oblige you to ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

If your ſtock will not admit of frequent draughts upon it, be the more circumſpect with regard to the merit of thoſe you relieve, that bounties not in your power to repeat often, may not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied. But if Providence, by a more ample fortune, ſhould bleſs you with a larger ability of being ſerviceable to your fellow-creatures, prove yourſelf worthy of the truſt repoſed in you by making a proper uſe of it. Wide as your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence can extend, turn the cry of diſtreſs and danger into the ſong of joy and ſafety; feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the afflicted, give medicine to the ſick, and, with either, beſtow all the alleviation their unfortunate circumſtances can admit of. Thus may you truly make a friend of the unrighteous Mammon. Thus you may turn the periſhable goods of fortune into everlaſting bleſſings. Upon earth you will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that happineſs you impart to others, and you

            <p>A perſon who has once experienced the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a right action, will be led by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of preſent ſelf-intereſt, as well as by future expectation, to the continuance of it.

A good diſpoſition finds a ſuperlative pleaſure in returning good for evil; and, by an inexpreſſible ſatisfaction of mind in ſo doing, feels the preſent reward of obedience: whereas a ſpirit of revenge is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with happineſs, an implacable temper being a conſtant torment to its poſſeſſor; and the man who returns an injury, feels move real miſery from the rancour of his own heart, than it is in his power to inflict upon another.</p>
            <p>Should a friend wound you in the moſt tender part, by betraying a confidence repoſed, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence forbids the expoſing yourſelf to a ſecond deception, by placing any future truſt in ſuch a perſon.

This is in general allowed to be the duty of every individual to all, as a member of ſociety; but it is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly inſtanced in the preſent caſe to ſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, that not even a breach of friendſhip, the higheſt of all provocations, will cancel the duty, at all times equally and unalterably binding—the duty of promoting both the temporal and eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all your fellow-creatures by every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in your power.</p>

            <p>If thoſe with whom you have any degree of intimacy are guilty of what to you appears either wrong or indiſcreet, ſpeak your opinion to them with freedom, though you ſhould even loſe a nominal friend by ſo doing. Silence makes you, in ſome meaſure, an acceſſary to the fault; but having thus once diſcharged your duty, reſt there—they are to judge for themſelves: to repent ſuch admonitions is both uſeleſs and impertinent, and they will then be thought to proceed rather from pride than from good-nature. To the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned only are you to ſpeak your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of their conduct: when they are
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:025067_0109_0FCE4AE45F216FC8"/>
cenſured by others, ſay all that truth or probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will permit in their juſtification.</p>
            <p>It often happens, that upon an accidental quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel between friends, they ſeparately appeal to a third perſon. In ſuch caſe, alternately take the oppoſite ſide, alledging every argument in favour of the abſent party, and placing the miſtakes of the complainer in the ſtrongeſt light. This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod may probably at firſt diſpleaſe, but is always right, as it is the moſt likely to procure a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. If that, takes place, each, equally obliges, will thankfully approve your conduct; if not, you will have the ſatisfaction of at lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> endeavouring to have been the reſtorer of peace. A contrary behaviour, which generally proceeds from the mean deſire of pleaſing by flattery at the expence of truth, often widens a trifling breach into open and irreconcileable enmity. People of this diſpoſition are the worſt ſort of incendiaries the greateſt plague of human ſociety, becauſe the moſt difficult to be guarded againſt, from their always wearing the ſpecious diſguiſe of pretended approbation and friendſhip to the preſent, and equally deceitful reſentment againſt the abſent perſon or company.</p>
            <p>To enumerate all the ſocial duties would lead me too far; ſuffice it, therefore, my dear, in few words to ſum up what remains.</p>
            <p>Let truth ever dwell upon your tongue.</p>
            <p>Scorn to flatter any, and deſpiſe the perſon who would practiſe ſo baſe an art upon yourſelf.</p>

            <p>Examine every part of your conduct towards others by the unerring rule of ſuppoſing a change of places. This will certainly lead to an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial judgment. Do then what appears to you right, or in other words, <hi>what you would they ſhould do unto you;</hi> which comprehends every duty relative to ſociety.</p>
            <p>Aim at perfection, or you will never reach to an attainable height of virtue.</p>
            <p>Be religious without hypocriſy, pious without enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>Endeavour to merit the favour of GOD by a ſincere and uniform obedience to whatever you know, or believe, to be his will; and ſhould afflictive evils be permitted to cloud the ſun-ſhine of your brighteſt days, receive them with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; ſatisfied that a Being equally wiſe, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient, and beneficent, at once ſees and entends the good of His whole creation; and that every general or particular diſpenſation of His provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards the rational part of it, is ſo calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as to be productive of ultimate happineſs, which nothing but the miſbehaviour of individuals can prevent to themſelves.</p>
            <p>This truth is ſurely an unanſwerable argument for abſolute reſignation to the Will of GOD; and ſuch a reſignation, founded upon reaſon and choice, not enforced by neceſſity, is unalterable peace of mind, fixed on too firm a baſis to be ſhaken by adverſity. Pain, poverty, ingratitude,

calumny, and even the leſs of thoſe we hold moſt dear, may each tranſiently affect, but united can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mortally wound it. Upon this principle, you will find it poſſible not only to be content, but cheerful, under all the diſagreeable circumſtances this ſtate of probation is liable to; and, by making a proper uſe of them, you may effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally remove the garb of te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Believe me this is not mere theory. My own experience every moment proves the fact undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably true. My conduct in all thoſe relations which ſtill ſubſiſt with me, nearly as human im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection will allow, is governed by the rules here laid down for you; and it produces the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant rational compoſure which conſtitutes the moſt perfect felicity of human life: for with truth I can aver, that I daily feel incomparably more real ſatisfaction, more true contentment in my preſent retirement, than the gayeſt ſcenes of feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mirth ever afforded me. I am pleaſed with this life, without an anxious thought for the continuance of it, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

My ſoul, unſtained by the crimes unjuſtly imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, moſt ſincerely forgives the malicious authors of theſe imputations; it anticipates the future pleaſure of an open acquaittal, and in that expectation loſes the pain of preſent undeſerved cenſure.

How wrong ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance was, has been clearly proved by many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in which it has been ſince moſt ungenerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt ungratefully urged as a circumſtantial argument againſt me.</p>
            <p>It muſt indeed be owned, that for the two or three laſt years, tired with a long ſeries of repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſults, of a nature almoſt beyond the power of imagination to conceive, my temper became ſoured: a conſtant fruitleſs endeavour to oblige was changed into an abſolute indifference about it; and ill humour, occaſioned by frequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment—a conſequence I have experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally warned you againſt—was perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too much indulged. How far the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled provocations may be allowed as an excuſe for this, Heaven only muſt determine, whoſe goodneſs has thought fit to releaſe me, from the painful ſituation; though by a method, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, not the moſt eligible, as it is the cauſe of a ſeparation <hi>from my children alſo,</hi> and thereby has put it out of my power to attend in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I could have wiſhed to their education; a duty that inclination would have led me with equal care and pleaſure more amply to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Nothing therefore is ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken as the education which they give to young women: they deſign them to pleaſe; they give them no inſtructions but for the ornament and graces of the body; they flatter their ſelf-love; they give them up to effeminacy, to the world, and to falſe opinions; they give them no lectures o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> virtue and fortitude: ſurely it is unreaſonable or rather downright madneſs to imagine that ſuch an education ſhould not turn to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>It may be neceſſary, my Daughter, to obſerve all the outward rules of <hi>Decorum;</hi> but this is not enough to gain you the eſteem of the world; 'tis the ſentiments of the mind that form the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a perſon; that lead the underſtanding; that govern the will; that ſecure the reality and duration of all our virtues: but religion ſhould be the principle and foundation of theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

'Tis not enough for the conduct of young perſons to oblige them to do their duty; they muſt be brought to love it. Authority is a tyrant only over the outward behaviour, it has no ſway over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſentiments. When one preſcribes a conduct, we ſhould repreſent the reaſons and the motives

            <p>'Tis ſo much for our intereſt to practiſe virtue, that we ſhould never conſider it as our enemy, but rather as the ſource of happineſs, of glory, and of peace.</p>
            <p>You are juſt coming into the world; enter it, my daughter, with ſome principles; you cannot fortify yourſelf too much againſt what you will meet with there: bring along with you all your religion; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it in your heart by your ſentiments; confirm it in your mind by proper reflections, and by reading adapted to encourage it.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more neceſſary, and indeed more happy for us than to keep up a ſentiment that makes us love and hope; that gives us a proſpect of an agreeable futurity; that reconciles all times; that inſures all the duties of life; that anſwers for us to ourſelves, and is our gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee with regard to others. What a ſupport will you find from religion under the miſfortunes that threaten you! for a certain number of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes muſt fall to your ſhare.

            <p>Women that have cultivated their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with nothing but the maxims of the world, are preſented at laſt with an univerſal blank, and find themſelves in a terrible want of thought and employment, the moſt irkſome ſituation in life. As they advance in age the world quits them, and reaſon tells them they ſhould quit the world; but where muſt they go for relief? The time paſt

               </gap>ears. Religion alone calms all our uneaſineſs, and comforts us under all misfortunes; by uniting you to God, it reconciles you with the world, and your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too.</p>
            <p>A young perſon when ſhe comes into the world frames to herſelf an high notion of the happineſs reſerved for her. She ſets herſelf to obtain it; 'tis the ſource of all her cares. She is always on the hunt after her notion, and in hopes of finding a perfect happineſs: this is the occaſion of lightneſs and inconſtancy.</p>
            <p>The pleaſures of the world are deceitful; they promiſe more than they perform; the queſt of them is full of anxiety: their enjoyment is far from yielding any true ſatisfaction, and their loſs is attended with vexation.</p>
            <p>To fix your deſires, think that no ſolid or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs is to be found any where but in your own breaſt. Honours and riches have no charms that are laſting for any length of time; their poſſeſſion extends our view, and gives us new deſires. Pleaſures when they grow familiar, loſe their reliſh. Before you have taſted them, you may do without them; whereas enjoyment makes that neceſſary to you, which was once ſuperfluous, and you are worſe at your eaſe than you were before; by enjoying them you grow uſed to them, and when you loſe them, they leave you nothing but emptineſs and want. What affects us ſenſibly is the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from one circumſtance of life to another; the interval between a miſerable ſeaſon and a happy one. The ſenſe of pleaſure wears off as ſoon as we grow habituated to it. 'Twould be a

            <p>'Tis commonly ſaid there are two prejudices with which every body muſt comply; Religion and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. 'Tis a wrong expreſſion to call Religion a prejudice. A prejudice is an opinion that may be ſubſervient to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as well as truth: the term ought never to be applied but to things that are uncertain; and Religion is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o.</p>
            <p>Honour is indeed an invention merely human; yet nothing is more real than the evils that people ſuffer who would get rid of it; 'twould be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſhake it off; we ſhould rather do all we can to fortify, a ſentiment that ought to be a rule
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025067_0120_0FCE4AEFC9DBE918"/>
to our conduct, ſince nothing is more deſtructive o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our quiet, or makes our life more unequal, than to think one way and act another. Poſſeſs your heart as much as is poſſible with ſentiments for the conduct that you ought to obſerve; fortify this prejudice of Honour in your mind; you cannot be too ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly nice on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>Never warp in the leaſt from theſe principles; never entertain a notion, as if the virtue of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was a virtue only enjoined by cuſtom; nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low yourſelf to think you have ſufficiently diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your obligations, if you can but eſcape the eyes of the world. There are two courts before which you muſt inevitably appear in judgment, your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and the World; you may poſſibly get clear of the World, but you can never get clear of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Secure her teſtimony in favour of your honeſty; 'tis what you owe to yourſelf; but withal do not neglect the approbation of the public, for a contempt of reputation naturally leads to a contempt of virtue.</p>
            <p>When you are a little acquainted with the world, you will find that there is no need of the ſanctions and terror of laws to keep you within the bounds of your duty; the example of ſuch as have deviated from it, and the calamities that have ever attended them, is enough to ſtop any inclination in the midſt of its career; for there is no coquet but muſt own, if ſhe would be ſincere, that it is the greateſt misfortune in the world to be forgot and neglected.</p>
            <p>Shame is a paſſion that might be of excellent advantage to us, if we managed it well: I do not mean th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

us from evil out of fear of diſhonour: we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this ſhame is ſometimes the ſureſt guard of the women's virtue; there are very few virtuous for virtue itſelf.</p>
            <p>There are ſome great virtues, which, when they are carried to a certain degree, make a great many defects be over-looked; ſuch as extraordinary va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the men, and extreme modeſty in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Agrippina, the wife of Germanicus, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of all her faults on account of her chaſtity. This Princeſs was ambitious and haughty; but, ſays Tacitus, <q>all her paſſions were conſecrated by her chaſtity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If you are ſenſible and nice in the point of reputation, if you are apprehenſive of being attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to eſſential virtues, there is one ſure means to calm your fears and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> your nicety; 'tis to be virtuous. Make it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> great care to refine your ſentiments: let them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e reaſonable and full of honour. Be ſure always to keep well with yourſelf; 'tis a ſure income of pleaſures; and will gain you praiſe, and a good reputation to boot: in a word, be but truly virtuous, and you'll find admirers enough.</p>
            <p>The virtues that make a figure in the world do not fall to the women's ſhare; their virtues are of a ſimple and peaceable nature: Fame will have nothing to do with us. 'Twas a ſaying of one of the Antients, that <q>the great virtues are for the men!</q> he allows the women nothing but the ſingle merit of being unknown; and <q>ſuch as are moſt praiſed, (ſays he) are not always the perſons that deſerve it beſt; but rather ſuch as are not talked of at all.</q> The notion ſeems to me to be wrong; but to reduce this maxim into prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, I think it beſt to avoid the world, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:025067_0122_0FCE4AF1E1FF8D60"/>
a figure, which always ſtrike at modeſty, and he contented with being one's own ſpectator.</p>
            <p>The virtues of the women are difficult, becauſe they have no help from glory to practiſe them. To live at home; to meddle with nothing but one's ſelf and family; to be ſimple, juſt, and modeſt, are painful virtues, becauſe they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. One muſt have a great deal of merit to ſhun making a figure, and a great deal of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to bring one's ſelf to be virtuous only to one's own eyes. Grandeur and reputation ſerve for ſupports to our weakneſs, for ſuch in reality is our deſire to diſtinguiſh and raiſe ourſelves. The mind reſts in the public approbation, but true glory conſiſts in being ſatisfied without it. Let it not enter then into the motives of your actions; 'tis enough that it is the recompence of them.</p>
            <p>Be aſſured, my Daughter, that perfection and happineſs cling together; that you can never be happy but by virtue, and ſcarce ever unhappy but by ill conduct. Whoever examines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtrictly, will find that they never had any grievous affliction, but they occaſioned it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſome fault, or by being wanting in ſome duty. Anxiety always follows the loſs of innocence; but virtue is ever attended with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſatisfaction, that is a conſtant ſpring of felicity to all its votaries.</p>
            <p>Do not however imagine that your only virtue is modeſty; there are abundance of women that have no notion of any other, and fancy, that by practiſing it they diſcharge all the duties of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: they think they have a right to neglect all the reſt, and to be as proud and cenſorious as they pleaſe.

Modeſty was forgot; and when ſhe was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to him, he could not tell where to place her: ſhe was therefore allowed to comfort with all the reſt. Ever ſince that time ſhe is inſeparable from them; ſhe is the friend of Truth, and betrays the lie that dares attack it; ſhe is in a ſtrict and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate union with Love; ſhe always attends, and frequently diſcovers and proclaims it: Love, in a word, loſes his charms, whenever he appears with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her; there is not a more glorious ornament for a young lady than modeſty.</p>
            <p>Let the chief part of your finery then be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty; it has great advantages; it ſets off beauty, and ſerves for a veil to uglineſs: mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty is the ſupplement of beauty.

            <p>A good taſte avoids all exceſſive niceneſs; it treats little things as little ones, and gives itſelf very little trouble about them. Neatneſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed agreeable, and deſerves to be ranked among things that are graceful, but it commences little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when it is carried to an exceſs; it is a much better temper to be careleſs in things of little conſequence than to be too nice about them.</p>
            <p>Young perſons are very ſubject to the ſpleen; as they are quite deſtitute of knowledge, they run with eagerneſs towards ſenſible objects; the ſpleen, however, is the leaſt evil that they have to dread: exceſſive joys are no part of the train of virtue. All violent and moving pleaſures are dangerous. Though one is diſcreet enough not

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a ſort of ſoftneſs diffuſes itſelf over the ſoul, and takes away its reliſh for every thing that is called virtue: it ſtops and makes you cool in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of your duty. A young perſon does not ſee the conſequences of this flattering poiſon, the leaſt miſchief of which is to diſturb the quiet of life, to deprave the taſte, and render all ſimple pleaſure in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pid. When one ſees a young perſon happy enough not to have had her heart touched (as there is a natural diſpoſition in us to a union, and this diſpoſition has not been exerciſed), ſhe eaſily complies, and gives herſelf naturally to the perſon deſigned for her.</p>
            <p>Be very cautious on the article of plays, and the like public diverſions. There is no dignity in ſhewing one's ſelf continually, nor is it an eaſy matter to preſerve a ſtrict modeſty in a conſtant hurry of diverſions. It is miſtaking one's intereſt to frequent them: if you have beauty, you muſt not wear out the taſte of the world by ſhewing yourſelf continually: you muſt be ſtill more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved if you want graces to ſet you off; beſides the conſtant uſe of diverſions leſſons the reliſh of them.</p>
            <p>When all your life has been ſpent in pleaſures, and they come to leave you, either becauſe your taſte for them is over, or becauſe your reaſon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids you the enjoyment of them, your mind finds itſelf in a moſt uneaſy ſituation for want of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. If you would therefore have your pleaſures and amuſements laſt, uſe them only as diverſions to relieve you after more ſerious occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations. Entertain yourſelf with your own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025067_0128_0FCE4AF88045B7A8"/>
keep up that correſpondence, and the abſence of pleaſures will not leave you any time upon your hands nor any hankering after them.</p>
            <p>It behoves us therefore to huſband our taſtes; there is no reliſhing life without them, but innocence only can preſerve them in their integrity; irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity is ſure to deprave them.</p>
            <p>When we have a ſound heart, we make an advantage of every thing, and turn it into a ſource of pleaſure. We come frequently to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with a ſick man's palate; we fancy our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves nince, when we are only ſurfeited and ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of taſte. When we have not ſpoiled our mind and heart by ſentiments that ſeduce the fancy, or by any flaming paſſion, it is eaſy to find delight: health and innocence are the true fountains of joy. But when we have had the misfortune to habituate ourſelves to vehement pleaſures, we become inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to moderate ones. We ſpoil our taſte by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, and uſe ourſelves ſo much to violent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that we cannot take up with ſuch an are ſimple and regular.</p>
            <p>We ſhould always dread ſuch great emotions of the ſoul as leave us flat and out of ſorts. Young perſons have the greater reaſon to fear them, in that they are leſs capable of reſiſting what flatters their ſenſe. "Temperance," ſaid one of the Antients, <q>is the beſt caterer for lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury.</q> With this temperance, which makes the health both of mind and body, one has always a pleaſing and an equal joy; one has no need of diverſions and expence; reading, work, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, afford a purer joy than all the train of the greateſt pleaſures. In a word, innocent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are of moſt advantage; they are always ready at hand; they are beneficient, and are never
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:025067_0129_0FCE4AC6693A0FD8"/>
purchaſed at too dear a rate. Other pleaſures flatter, but they do miſchief: they alter the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the mind, and ſpoil it like that of the body.</p>
            <p>Be regular in all your views and in all your actions; it would be happy if our fortune was ſuch as to make computations of our income unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; but as yours is narrow, it obliges us to be regular. Be diſcreet in the article of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; if you do not obſerve a moderation in them, you will ſoon ſee your affairs in diſorder; as ſoon as you lay aſide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>economy, you can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for nothing.</p>
            <p>Pompous living is the high road to ruin, and the ruin of people's fortune is almoſt always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with corruption of manners: but in order to be regular, it is no way neceſſary to be covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Remember that avarice is of little ſervice, and diſhonours a perſon infinitely. All that one ſhould aim at in a regular management, is to avoid the ſhame and injuſtice that always attend an irregular conduct. We muſt retrench ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous expences only to be a better condition to afford ſuch as decency, friendſhip and charity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to make.</p>
            <p>It is good order, and not the looking into little matters, that turns to any great account. Pliny, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Never mind the wants that vanity creates. "We muſt be," they ſay, "like others;" this <hi>like</hi> goes a vaſt way.

               </gap> confidence in herſelf; but this docility muſt not be carried too far. In point of religion, indeed, it muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to authority; but on any other ſubject it muſt receive nothing but from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

By carrying docility too far, you do an injury to your reaſon; you make no uſe of your own judgement and underſtanding, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired for want of exerciſe. You ſet too narrow bounds to your ideas, when you confine them to thoſe of other people. The teſtimony of men only deſerves credit in proportion to the degree of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty which they have acquired by examining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to facts. There lies no preſcription againſt truth: it is for all perſons and of all times. In a word, as a great man ſays, "To be a Chriſtian, one muſt believe implicitly: but to be a wiſe man, one muſt ſee clearly."</p>
            <p>Accuſtom yourſelf to exerciſe your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make more uſe of it than of your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. We fill our heads with the notions of other people, and take no care to form any of our own. We fancy that we have made a great progreſs, when we load our memory with hiſtories and facts; but this is of very little ſervice to perfect our underſtanding. We muſt uſe ourſelves to thinking.

When you feel yourſelf agitated with a ſtrong and violent paſſion, deſire it to allow you a little time, and compound with your weakneſs; if without hearing it a moment, you are for ſacrificing every thing to your reaſon and your duty, there is room to fear that your paſſion may rebel, and grow ſtronger than ever. You are under its command, and muſt manage it with addreſs: you will receive more help than you think of from ſuch a conduct: you will find ſome ſure remedies even in your paſſion. If it be that of hatred, you will ſee that you have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo much reaſon to hate and revenge your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as you at firſt imagined.

            <p>If your heart has the misfortune to be attacked by love, theſe are the remedies to ſtop its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: Think that its pleaſures are neither ſolid nor conſtant; they quit you; and if this was all the harm they would do you, 'tis enough. In paſſions the ſoul propoſes itſelf an object, and is more intimately united to it either by deſire or enjoyment, than it is to its own being; it places all its felicity in its poſſeſſion, and all its miſery in the loſs of the object. Yet this felicity of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, this good of the ſoul's choice, is neither ſolid nor laſting: it depends upon others; it depends upon yourſelf; and you cannot anſwer either for others or for yourſelf.</p>
            <p>Love in the beginning offers you nothing but flowers, and hides all the danger from you; it impoſes on you; it always takes ſome form which is not its own: the heart being in ſecret intelligence with it conceals its inclination from you, for fear of alarming your reaſon and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. You fancy it is a mere amuſement; it is only the perſon's wit or good ſenſe that pleaſes us. In a word, Love is almoſt always unknown till he has got the maſtery. As ſoon as he comes to be felt, fly that inſtant, and hearken not to the complaints of your heart: Love is not rooted out of the ſoul with ordinary efforts, it has too many partizans within us: as ſoon as it has ſurprized you, every thing is on its ſide againſt you, and nothing will ſerve you againſt Love. It is the moſt cruel ſituation a rational perſon can be in; where there is nothing to ſupport you; where you have no ſpectator but yourſelf.

            <p>Politeneſs is a deſire of pleaſing: nature gives it, education and the world improve it. Politeneſs is a ſupplement to Virtue.

In ruder times, when Virtue bore a greater ſway, they knew leſs of Politeneſs; it came in with Voluptuouſneſs: it is the daughter of Luxury and Delicacy. It has been diſputed, whether it approaches neareſt to vice or virtue. Without pretending to decide the queſtion, or define politeneſs, may I be allowed to ſpeak my ſentiments of it?

               </gap> imitation too of humility. True politeneſs is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt; and as it aims to pleaſe, it knows that the way to carry its point, is to ſhew that we do not prefer ourſelves to others, but give them the firſt rank in our eſteem.</p>
            <p>Pride keeps us off from ſociety: our ſelf love gives us a peculiar rank, which is always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with us. Such a high eſteem of ourſelves as makes others feel it, is almoſt always puniſhed with an univerſal contempt. Politeneſs is the art of reconciling agreeably what we owe to others, and what one owes to one's ſelf; for theſe duties have their bounds, which when they exceed, 'tis flattery with regard to others, and pride with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to yourſelf; 'tis the moſt ſeducing quality in nature.</p>
            <p>The moſt polite perſons have generally a good deal of ſweetneſs in their converſation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging qualities: 'tis the girdle of Venus; it ſets off, and gives graces and charms to all that wear it; and with it you cannot fail to pleaſe.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral degrees of politeneſs. You carry it to a higher point in proportion to the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of your way of thinking: it diſtinguiſhes itſelf in all your behaviour, in your converſation, and even in your ſilence.</p>
            <p>Perfect politeneſs forbids us to diſplay our parts and talents with aſſurance; it even borders upon cruelty, to ſhew one's ſelf happy when we have certain miſfortunes before our eyes. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the world is enough to poliſh our outward behaviour; but there muſt be a good deal of delicacy to form a politeneſs of mind. A nice politeneſs formed with art and taſte, will
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:025067_0156_0FCE4B151EF1BCD8"/>
make the world excuſe you a great many failings, and improve your good qualities. Such as are defective in point of behaviour have the greater need of ſolid qualities, and make ſlow advances in gaining a reputation. In a word, politeneſs coſts but little, and is of vaſt advantage.</p>

But as there is no holding our peace always, it is fit for us to know that the principal rule for ſpeaking well is to think well.</p>
            <p>When your notions are clear and diſtinct, your diſcourſe will be ſo too; let a proper decorum and modeſty run through them.

'Tis a ſaying of one of the Antients, <q>that we ought to conſider them as unhappy friends.</q> Remember that the vaſt difference between you and them is owing merely to chance; never make them uneaſy in their ſtate of life, or add weight to the trouble of it. There is nothing ſo poor and mean as to be haughty to any body that is in your ſervice.</p>
            <p>Never uſe any harſh language; it ſhould never come out of the mouth of a delicate and polite perſon. Servitude being ſettled in oppoſition to the natural equality of mankind, it behoves us to ſoften it. What right have we to expect our ſervants ſhould be without faults, when we are giving them inſtances every day of our own? Let us rather bear with them.

            <p>One ſhould keep up authority in one's family, but it ſhould be a mild authority. We ſhould not indeed always threaten without puniſhing, for fear of bringing our treats into contempt; but we ſhould not call in authority till perſuaſion has failed. Remember that humanity and chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty put all the world on the ſame foot. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and heat of youth, joined to the falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they give you of yourſelf, make you look upon your ſervants as creatures of a different ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; but how contrary are ſuch ſentiments to the modeſty that you owe to yourſelf, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity you owe to others.</p>
            <p>Never reliſh or encourage the flattery of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and to prevent the impreſſion which their fawning ſpeeches frequently repeated may make upon you, conſider that they are hirelings paid to ſerve your weakneſſes and pride.</p>
            <p>If by misfortune, Daughter, you ſhould not think ſit to follow my Advice and Precepts, though they be loſt upon you, they will ſtill be uſeful to myſelf, as laying me under new obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
