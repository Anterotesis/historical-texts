            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>I Have a juſt Claim to thy utmoſt Candour, and am blameleſs, what fault ſoever there may be in this Publick Appearance; except it be a Fault to yield unto <hi>Thoſe</hi> who would take no Denyal, whoſe Perſons both by Inclination &amp; Duty, I love and honour, and to whoſe Advice I owe a great deference. Poſſibly I have gone beyond the Rules of Decency in the obſtinate Excuſes I have made, if it might have been to avoid both the Preaching and Publiſhing the following <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</hi> But I am Over-ruled: and only entreat on the one hand, that the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who have preſt me to this Service would not judge my back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to comply with their reſpectful deſires; nor on the other hand the <hi>Reader</hi> my weakneſs in Emitting a <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> with ſo many Defects; as I muſt needs own I ſee in <hi>this,</hi> &amp; yet could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply without making it anew, &amp; ſwelling it too big.</p>
            <p>I confeſs the <hi>Subject</hi> ſeems to me well choſen &amp; ſeaſonable, were the management anſwerable. A ſerious Call to the Exerciſe of <hi>Faith</hi> can never be unſuitable to a Chriſtian People: but peculiarly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is it in ſuch a Calamitous Day as this; a Day of Diſtreſs to the whole Proteſtant World. The Word of God almoſt every where and always calls us
<pb facs="unknown:001042_0003_0FAEECDBD701E868"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
to this <hi>Duty</hi>: and at times his Providence has the ſame voice, and loudly tells us — when it is eſpecially the Duty of the preſent Day</p>
            <p>I hope the <hi>Reader</hi> will not expect here an Eſsay to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the Doctrine of Faith, as it lies in the Body of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion: that would require a Volumn by it ſelf, &amp; a more maſterly hand to draw it Wherefore I have not attempted to conſider it any further than in its stricteſt connexion to the Character &amp; Duties of <hi>Souldiers</hi>: &amp; even as to them I have but given hints, &amp; left the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Chriſtian to infer more of his Duty.</p>
            <p>The Week after I had prepared this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to us the aſtoniſhing News of His Majeſty, King <hi>William's</hi> Death, our late moſt Gracious Soveraign: Which ſore Afflistion makes the <hi>Subject</hi> here diſcourſed on the more ſeaſonable. Wherefore <hi>I</hi> took the ſad Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to drop a Tear (as in duty bound) into the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Grief, which overflows our Bereaved Nation.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe God to give us all a moſt affectionate Regard, and deep Concern for the Proſperity of his Church: And may he make this poor <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> by his Grace accompanying it, to Subſerve hereunto, by putting us more on <hi>Faith and Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May <hi>the Bleſſing wherewith</hi> Moſes <hi>the man of God bleſſ'd the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>before his Death,</hi> come upon us &amp; all the People of God in the World <hi>1</hi> There is <hi>none like the God of</hi> Jeſhurun, <hi>who rideth upon the Heaven in thy Help, &amp; in his Excellency on the Sky. The Eternal God</hi> is thy <hi>Refuge, &amp; underneath</hi> are <hi>the Everlaſting Arms: Happy art thou, O</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: <hi>Who is like unto thee, O People Saved by the Lord, the Shield of thy help, and who is the Sword of thy Excellency!</hi>

            <p>THE Power of Great and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Examples</hi> is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by all men, that <hi>they have gain'd</hi> the preference to other modes of Inſtruction, both for Facility and Efficacy: they are more eaſily perceived, and do more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully incline to practice, than bare <hi>Precepts:</hi> they inſinuate into the minds of men, and leave very ſtrong Impreſſions there.

the evil practices of others, as <hi>Noah</hi> did the Old World; and bind us to imitate, leaving us ſteps which we ought to follow. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the bleſſed Patterns which the Chriſtian has before him to govern himſelf by, none are ſo commanding as the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saints on Sacred Record; the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of the Church; of whom we ought to be followers as they were of Chriſt. And of all the <hi>Graces</hi> which adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe holy men of God, no <hi>one</hi> ſhone in them more conſpicuous than <hi>Faith,</hi> and none more worthy or neceſſary than <hi>this</hi> to be imitated by us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith,</hi> which is a grace dignified in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as of the firſt Order and Magnitude, which is moſt beautiful and honourable in the ſight of God, and moſt beneficial unto us, both as to preſent priviledges, and future Bleſſedneſs. <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the principal precept of Chriſtianity, the root of Spiritual Life, and the comprehenſion of all Grace and Duty, the moſt uſeful part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian armour <hi>(above all taking the ſhield of Faith</hi>) and <hi>the Victory that overcometh the world. Faith, by which</hi> (as the Apoſtle in the Context teaches us) <hi>the Juſt ſhall live,</hi> which is to the <hi>Saving of the Soul,</hi> which <hi>is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> and <hi>without</hi> which <hi>it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001042_0006_0FAEECDE9D711430"/>
to pleaſe God. Faith,</hi> which is the praiſe of all the Saints:—In this eſpecially are they Examples to us, and ſo propoſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Apoſtle in the <hi>Chapter</hi> before us. Wherein the moſt excellent Perſons are celebrated for this moſt excellent <hi>Gift,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> for its bleſſed fruits and marvellous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. The particular Grace, or divine Gift here celebrated is <hi>Faith,</hi> the miraculous effects of it are many and various; which are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified on by an induction of many famous Inſtances among the Children of God, from <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo through the ſucceeding Worthies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in Scripture for the glorious Atcieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Faith. Among this ſo <hi>great a cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> the Saints of a <hi>Military Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> make a very conſiderable figure, both for Name and Exploits. And <hi>theſe</hi> were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the Apoſtle doth but name a few, and ſays, the time would fail him to ſpeak even of their Heroick Faith: <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>What ſhall I more ſay</hi>? He elegantly breaks off his enumeration, and intimates it to be a thing endleſs to go about to number, much leſs to enlarge on all that could be inſtanc'd in. <hi>For the time would fail me to tell of</hi> Gideon, <hi>and of</hi> Barak, <hi>and of</hi> Sampſon, <hi>and of</hi> Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teh, <hi>of</hi> David <hi>alſo and</hi> Samuel, <hi>and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; who through Faith ſubdued Kingdoms,—

               <p>It would be too great an excurſion here to Enquire, <hi>In what Caſes a Chriſtian State</hi> (which is alſo a Church of Chriſt) <hi>may Wage War?</hi> I ſhall only ſay, That to be ſure the <hi>Luſt of Dominion,</hi> whether temporal or ſpiritual; whether over mens civil proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and liberties, or over mens conſciences, doth ſufficiently authorize it. Which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very thing that fills the World with the noiſe and rumour of War at this day, the thirſt of an inſatiable Prince to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the world, and ſtretch all mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to his own ſize: the very Menace whereof will juſtifie the Confederacy againſt any ſuch baneful Power, not only as juſt, but alſo pious and neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Truth implyed in the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is, <hi>That the People of God always have been, and will be finally victorious over their Enemies, and ſaved from them.</hi> Not that Succeſs always waits on the juſt ſide, or that in particular Wars or Conflicts, God does not often give the victory to his own and his peoples Enemies.

of the Church, even whole Nations may be given as a prey to their teeth; and it has been at that paſs, that there has been no appearance of a true Iſraelite left; ſo that <hi>Elijah</hi> thought he had reaſon for that bitter complaint, 1 King. 19.10. <hi>I</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even <hi>I only am left, and they ſeek my life, to take it away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet nevertheleſs, the diſtreſſed Intereſt of God hath always out liv'd ſuch Oppreſſions and ſeeming Extirpations. There nave been <hi>Reſerves,</hi> whoſe <hi>knees have not bow'd to Baal,</hi> nor with <hi>their mouths</hi> have they <hi>kiſſed</hi> his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. Whom the Grace of God has kept, and his Providence guarded poſſibly even from the ſuſpicion of retaining their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; and at long run theſe poor Remains have ſeen the ruine of their proud Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and trampled on the Power that once tyranized over them. Let Antichriſtian Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants boaſt that they have made through work of it, and that their next Succeſſors ſhall ſcarce know what the name of a <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> means; yet God may have many <hi>Names</hi> there, whom we may name in a double ſence his Inviſible Church, who have not defiled their Garments, while the world wanders after the Beaſt. Thus it was in the tenth and laſt general Perſecution of the Church, under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and ſome of his Succeſſors: So incredible numbers of Chriſtians were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001042_0011_0FAEECE6556979D0"/>
that theſe Pagan Emperors thought their work compleated, &amp; in an ancient Inſcription they tell the World, <q>That they had effac'd the name and ſuperſtition of Chriſtians, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Worſhip of the Gods: i. e. <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Idolatries. But as Chriſtian Hiſtorians have well obſerved,</hi> 'They were ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that this only haſtened the deſtruction of Paganiſm, and ſhortly after Chriſtianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came victorious and triumphant over all the Powers and Artifices of Mankind.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The foes of Chriſt will be made his foot-ſtool; and let them <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>imagine</hi> what they will; their ſpite and their counſel He has equally <hi>in deriſion; He will break them with a rod of iron, and daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel.</hi> So <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſies of the Everlaſting Kingdom of Chriſt, Dan. 2.44. —<hi>The God of Heaven ſhall ſet up a Kingdom which ſhall never be destroyed; and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall not be left to other people,</hi> but it <hi>ſhall break in pieces and conſume all theſe Kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Another truth contained in the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is, <hi>That to God ultimately are all the Church her Salvations and Victories to be aſcribed.</hi> Not to Means nor Inſtruments, not to power nor policies, not to courage nor conduct: for as <hi>the whole Diſpoſal</hi> of every thing is of the Lord, ſo we can't aſcribe it to any leſſer
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001042_0012_0FAEECE6D80CE410"/>
cauſe, without denying God and his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providence, and placing our ſelves in Gods ſtead. An arrogance which even <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> have condemned and abhorred, who tho' they had very wretched Ideas of God, yet durſt they not deny this Honour to their lame <hi>Deities.</hi> So the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> tells us of the brave <hi>Timoleon,</hi> 
                  <q>That he did always modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcribe all his Succeſſes to the Sole favour of Providence, and would be often ſaying, <hi>that he was very thankful to God, who having a mind to preſerve</hi> Sicily, <hi>was pleaſed to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with the Name and Title of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance he vouchſafed it.</hi> And yet this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious <hi>Warriour</hi> had no better Notion of a Deity, than having built a Chappel in his houſe, he dedicated it unto <hi>Good Hap,</hi> and Sacrific'd thereunto as to ſome Sacred <hi>Genius</hi> that favour'd him.</q> And yet verily this ridiculous Superſtition of a blind Heathen will judge the profane Chriſtian, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more of God and his Providence, yet leſs reverences and honours him.</p>
               <p>We read of <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> that upon the firſt Conviction he received of the truth of Chriſtianity, he caus'd a Royal Standard <q>to be made in faſhion of a Croſs, and to be born before him in his Wars, as an Enſign of Victory and Safety: and when he had reſcued miſerable <hi>Rome</hi> from the Tyranny
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001042_0013_0FAEECE79011A9A8"/>
of <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and was Saluted by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the ſtyle of <hi>their Father, their Saviour, and the Author of all their Happineſs,</hi> he taught them to aſcribe all to God alone, and attribute nothing to him. Moreover, in the right hand of the <hi>Statues,</hi> that were erected to his Honour by Decree of Senate, he caus'd to be engraven the figure of the Croſs, with this Inſcription on it, <hi>In this Overcome</hi>
                  </q> Which action, however dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in its Conſequence, leading to Groſs Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, yet carries this Inſtruction in it too, That the Chriſtian Warriour is to expect all his Victories from, and to aſcribe all he gains unto, his <hi>Almighty and once Crucified Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Holy Scripture abounds with many plain Aſſertions to this purpoſe; teaching us, <hi>That the Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battel to the ſtrong: The Horſe is prepared againſt the day of Battel, but ſafety is of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 21.31. <hi>That there is no King ſaved by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of an Hoſt: a Mighty man is not delivered by much ſtrength: A Horſe is a vain thing for ſafety, &amp;c</hi> Pſal. 33.16, 17. We therefore find <hi>David</hi> after all his Victories giving the honour of them all to God, <hi>Thine, O Lord, is the Greatneſs, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majeſty</hi>: And ſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> on the banks of the Red Sea triumph in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001042_0014_0FAEECE85186C930"/>
                  <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſly; The Lord</hi> is <hi>my Strength and Song and he is become my Salvation: The Lord</hi> is <hi>a Man of War, the Lord</hi> is <hi>his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, The laſt and chief truth to be inſiſted on is, <hi>That nextly and principally under God, the Church her Salvations &amp; Victories, may be aſcribed to Faith.</hi> So in the <hi>Text, who through Faith ſubdued Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is neceſſary that this be <hi>firſt</hi> proved as to matter of Fact, and that we <hi>then</hi> enquire whence Faith receives this Power &amp; Efficacy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a matter of Fact aſſerted; and it is to be proved by Teſtimony</hi>; and this from the Record and Hiſtory of the Churches Wars, eſpecially that part of them which is tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by God Himſelf, in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Which do afford us many plain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Power and Prevalency of Faith, in the Victories which the people of God have from time to time gain'd over the Enemies of God. To name a few in the Order wherein they ly in Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Salvation and Victory of <hi>Iſrael at the Red Sea,</hi> was the fruit of Faith: <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>By Faith they paſſed through the Red-Sea, as by dry</hi> Land; <hi>which the Egyptians aſſaying to do were drowned.</hi> On the Bank of the Flood ſtood
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001042_0015_0FAEECE9420AA8C8"/>
the Believing Prophet, and iſſued out this only Order to the Army of Iſrael, <hi>Stand ſtill and ſee the Salvation of the Lord, which he will ſhew to you to day:</hi> This was all they had to do in this famous Overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſts; to wait upon God with a quiet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed frame of Spirit, and a believing expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Deliverance.</p>
               <p>What was it but Faith, that <hi>defeated Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck</hi>? In vain did <hi>Joſhua</hi> fight below, when <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount let down his Hand. The Rod of God in the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> did more than all the Spears, Darts, and Inſtruments of War, wielded by the whole Army of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>What but Faith ſubdued <hi>Jericho? v.</hi> 30. <hi>By Faith the Walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compaſsed about ſeven days.</hi> No bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Engines were applyed to lay level the Impregnable Walls, nor ladders to ſcale them. They compaſſed the City day after day, but ſcarce beſeiged it; and on the ſeventh day no <hi>general Aſſault</hi> was appointed, to carry the place by <hi>Storm:</hi> Only <hi>the Prieſts blew with the Trumpets,</hi> and Faith (<hi>which can remove Mountains,</hi>) ſhook down the ſtrong Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; her proud Walls and lofty Towers.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Gideons</hi> Faith that diſcomfited the <hi>Hoſt of Midian</hi>: It was the <hi>Sword of the Lord</hi> and not <hi>his</hi> that ſmote them. What weapons
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001042_0016_0FAEECE9FAFA5BB0"/>
of War did he and his poor Army bear? Every man his Trumpet, his Pitcher and his Lamp: Faith ſometimes needs no more to conquer by.</p>
               <p>Nor was it ſo much the <hi>Jaw-bone</hi> in <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> hand, that ſlew ſo many <hi>Heaps</hi> of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines:</hi> but Faith gave the <hi>Odd weapon</hi> temper and an edge; and ſtrengthned the hand that held it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Samuels</hi> Faith alſo routed the Invading Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, as we read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.10. <hi>And as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel was offering up the Burnt offering, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines drew near to Battel againſt Iſrael: but the Lord Thundred with a great Thunder on that day upon the Philiſtines, and diſcomfited them, and they were ſmitten before Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith ſtorm'd the Philiſtines <hi>Garriſon. Let us go over</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Heroick Prince,</hi> to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-bearer) <hi>unto the Garriſon of theſe Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed; it may be that the Lord will work for us: for</hi> there is <hi>no reſtraint to the Lord, to ſave by many or by few.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.6.</p>
               <p>By Faith <hi>David</hi> Encounter'd and Slew the formidable <hi>Monſter of Gath.</hi> His Faith ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Sauls</hi> leave to enter the liſts with the prodigious Champion: <hi>Thy Servant</hi> (ſaid he to King <hi>Saul) Slew both the Lion and the Bear: and this Uncircumciſed Philiſtine ſhall be as one of them, ſeeing he hath defyed the Armies of the Living God: David</hi> ſaid moreover,

                  <hi>The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the Lion and out of the paw of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philiſtine.</hi> And <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Go, and the Lord be with thee.</hi> Faith oppoſed a Shepherds Crook and a pitiful <hi>Sling</hi> to the Giants Armour and weighty Shield: <hi>Thou comeſt to me with a Sword and with a Spear, and with a Shield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hoſts the God of the Armies of Iſrael, whom thou haſt defyed.</hi> Some of the <hi>Fathers</hi> have made <hi>Davids</hi> Staff to be an <hi>Emblem</hi> of the Croſs of Chriſt; and the <hi>Stone</hi> he ſlung, an Emblem of the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Faith.</p>
               <p>To name no more, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by Faith over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Hoſts of blaſpheming <hi>Seunacherio.</hi> The good Kings Prayers obtained inviſible ſuccours, and <hi>the Angel of the Lord ſmote in the Camp of the Aſſyrians in one night,</hi> 185000 <hi>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let none <hi>ſay,</hi> that theſe Inſtances are fetch'd from the <hi>Age of Miracles,</hi> when wondrous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of God were frequent; but that Faith is not of any efficacy in our days under the Goſpel. I might <hi>Anſwer</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the grounds of Faith are more clearly revealed, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God who worketh Faith in us is more ſhed abroad, and the Primitive Chriſtians at leaſt even excelled the Old Teſtament Saints in Heroical acts of Fortitude. It was indeed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001042_0018_0FAEECED72F05050"/>
moſtly in a <hi>paſſive way,</hi> (like the Faith cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the <hi>cloſe</hi> of the <hi>Chapter</hi>) but yet in a ſhort time the Faith of the <hi>Confeſſors</hi> ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Empire. And when Chriſtianity had gain'd the Countenance of the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and had the Armies of the Empire for its defence, though Miracles grew rare, (as there was leſs need of them, and indeed if they were wrought on the Churches behalf, yet could be leſs diſcerned,) yet who dare thence infer that Faith then loſt its vertue or efficacy, and that ever ſince it has had no hand in the Church's deliverances or enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? God forbid, a Chriſtian ſhould make his Faith ſo vain a thing.</p>
               <p>But this will appear in a better light, if we proceed to the Second thing propoſed; which is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To enquire, <hi>Whence Faith receives its Power and Efficacy, to be able to effect ſuch Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and Victories for the people of God?</hi> And here it is neceſſary to obſerve, both that there is nothing in Faith to hinder or obſtruct the Chriſtian Souldier in Conquering his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and on the other hand, there is much implyed in Faith to promote and effect it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is nothing implyed in Faith to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and obſtruct the Christian Souldier in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obtaining victory in War.</hi> Indeed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001042_0019_0FAEECEE77F7A6E8"/>
were the conceits of ſome men juſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, never had Faith ſubdued Kingdoms; but <hi>Infidelity</hi> had run away with the Empire of the World, and all carnal Conqueſts. Did Religion only require of us <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a meer belief, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ordinary exerciſe of prudence and reaſon, or the uſe of proper means to defend our civil or ſacred Rights; then indeed a Chiſtian would be the moſt unmeet of all men to bear Arms, and would do leaſt with them. But it is far otherwiſe in truth: <hi>Faith neither ſuppoſes the uſe of Arms to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nor unlawful.</hi> Not <hi>needleſs,</hi> for it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Prudence</hi> in <hi>Exerciſe</hi>: it is quite another thing than <hi>Preſumption:</hi> it does not encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Drone to be idle, in expectation that the Dew to morrow morning will be tranſubſtantiated into <hi>Manna</hi>; nor the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to lay down his Arms, and look when the <hi>Stars in their Courſes</hi> will fight for him. Much leſs does Faith condemn the ſtudy and practice of War as <hi>unlawful.</hi> The ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Art of War is not only lawful, but alſo honourable, and a neceſſary duty: and ſo is it (when God calls us) actually to engage in it. Prayers wont do without ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Endeavours. While <hi>Moſes</hi> is in the Mount, <hi>Joſhua</hi> muſt fight below, and ſhew his utmoſt skill and courage too in Engaging.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001042_0020_0FAEECEF140F0668"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> went againſt <hi>Goliah</hi> in the name of the Lord of Hoſts, but yet he took a Sling in his hand. And obſerve it, That where God wrought without <hi>Means</hi> he uſually appointed ſome <hi>Sign,</hi> he required ſome <hi>Action</hi> from his People, before he would work for them: they muſt ſhout, or blow the Trumpets, or break their Pitchers and ſhew their Lamps, if they did no more. And where no ſuch poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, arbitrary ſign was appointed, they were always to uſe the ordinary means in Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Divine help. And ſo are we at this day: Faith looks unto God, but in the way of Bleſſing, which is the uſe of proper and appointed means. The Hiſtorian (if it be lawful to name here a Heathens notion of Truſt in God) records it as a ſhameful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Cowardize of King <hi>Perſens,</hi> 
                  <q>That when Battel begun, he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw under pretence of Sacrificing, while his Conqueror <hi>Emilius</hi> pray'd for Victory with his Sword in his hand.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is much imply'd in Faith to promote and effect Salvations and Victories for the People of God.</hi> And that in two reſpects; As it gives Courage and Reſolution, and as it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages the help of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith is a Grace which in its own nature tends to beget, and inſpire the Breaſt with Courage
<pb n="18"
                         facs="unknown:001042_0021_0FAEECEFD17F5AD8"

and Reſolution.</hi> It carries ſomething of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and aſſurance in the very name, and is a principle that prompts unto daring actions. It has been an old Obſervation, <hi>That the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in War are ſome of the very beſt or worst of men</hi>: the <hi>laſt</hi> act like wild Creatures, and 'tis their brutality and ſtupid thoughtleſsneſs that gives 'em boldneſs. But the gracious heart is truly valiant, and acts upon the beſt Principles while it ſhakes off Fear, and faces death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith tends to inſpire the breaſt with courage, in that <hi>it realizeth the Preſence of God, and confides in his Help.</hi> It enters the field of Battel with this <hi>ſenſe,</hi> that we have an abſolute Dependance on God in every thing we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake: that nothing can fall out beſide his order and allowance: that a more ſpecial Providence concerns it ſelf for the ſafety of his own Intereſt: that the preſence of God with us is ſecurity enough: that he can ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed means, and even work without them: give skill, or deprive of counſel: inſpire with courage, or diſpirit as he pleaſes. Now if the Faith of the Preſence of ſo glorious a <hi>Being</hi> with us, will not fill the Soul with courage, what can do it? <hi>The Lord is on my ſide, I will not fear, what can man do unto me? Pſal.</hi> 118 6. From <hi>hence</hi> ſlow'd Davids cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and he grows ſo confident upon it that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001042_0022_0FAEECF0CCD2C2B8"/>
he beats a <hi>Defyance</hi> to the whole World ſhould they arm againſt him ſingle and alone: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1, 2, 3. <hi>The Lord</hi> is <hi>my light, and my Salvation, whom ſhould I fear? The Lord is the strength of my Life, of whom ſhall I be afraid? When the wicked,</hi> even <hi>mine Enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my fleſh, they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fell. Though an Hoſt ſhould encamp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, my heart ſhall not fear: Though War ſhould riſe againſt me, in this will I be confident.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith ſees the Inviſible Hoſts that encamp where God vouchſafes to reſide; as <hi>Eliſha</hi> beheld the Mountain covered <hi>with Horſes &amp; Chariots of Fire,</hi> and could then comfort his diſpirited Servant, and bid him <hi>not fear, for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</hi> Even Heathens have took cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from the belief of the divine Preſence with them: When it was told <hi>Numa</hi> once that the Enemy was near, he anſwered with a ſmile, <hi>That he fear'd 'em not, let 'em come at their Peril, for he was then Sacrificing</hi> Much more may we expect from the Worſhippers of the True and Living God; and ſo indeed we find it to have been: When the army of Iſrael ſent for the Ark of the Covenant to the Camp to Save them, they received it with <hi>Shouting ſo that the Earth rang again</hi>: It gave new Spirit, life and vigour to them. On the contrary, how diſheartning is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001042_0023_0FAEECF160457980"/>
of the want of Gods gracious preſence with us, or his being with thoſe whom we are againſt? So the Philiſtines when they heard the noiſe of the ſhout in the Camp of the Hebrews, and underſtood that the Ark of the Lord was come into the Camp; they were terrifyed exceedingly, <hi>for they ſaid, God is come into the Camp: Wo unto us: Who ſhall deliver us out of the hand of theſe Mighty Gods</hi>? Deſpair ſeiz'd 'em to the laſt degree (though God made uſe of their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateneſs, (which next to Faith has done moſt wonders in War) to correct the fond and Superſtitious Confidence of his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who fooliſhly thought that the Ark, the outward Symbol of the Divine preſence only, could ſave them.) The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> in his Divine and Triumphant ſong, elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſents this Matter; how juſtly the Tokens of Gods Majeſtick Preſence daunt his Enemies, and may encourage his People: <hi>God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>came from Teman, and the holy One from Mount Paran, his glory covered the Heavens,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>Then I ſaw the tents of Cuſhan in affliction, and the Curtains of the land of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian did tremble,</hi> Hab. 3 7</p>
               <p n="2">2 Faith gives courage, <hi>in that it makes the Souldier act in Conſcience of Duty to God and his Intereſt.</hi> Some Liſt into War out of a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous delight in Blood, ſome for hire and

Plunder, and ſome for Fame and Poſts of Honour: but none of theſe will animate to Battel like the Conſcience of duty. To March againſt an Enemy with this thought, <hi>I owe this to God and to my Country; the Church of Chriſt requires this Service of me: the cauſe is Gods, and my call to engage in it is clear; I am in my way, and Religion forbids me coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſert and betray it</hi> —: What can more ſtrengthen the hands to fight?</p>
               <p>So I have ſeen in this Land, a devout and heavenly <hi>Commander (whoſe</hi> Praiſes ſhould be in the Churches, eſpecially on this occaſion and to this Audience) take leave of his friends with great comfort, preſs'd with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of duty to his Lord, and with love to his Members. He went out in the Spirit of the good <hi>Saint John,</hi> as one convinced that he ought even to <hi>lay down his life for the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>: and in the hour of Battel ſo he fought, with a boldneſs which Faith only could In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, and ſome extraordinary Impulſe only could warrant: He dyed truly like a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hero,</hi> encouraging his Souldiers, and praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God for the little advantage gained; and ſcarce ever was the Power and Fortitude of a gracious Principle more viſible than here. The Conſcience of duty ſhould be the beſt Argument in the Souldiers Breaſt, and the ſpring that impels him to act. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001042_0025_0FAEECF2D14B5288"/>
                  <hi>Joab</hi> uſed to his Brother <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Be of good Courage, and let us play the men for our People, and for the Cities of our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith is courageous, in that <hi>it acts in the hope of a bleſſed Immortality.</hi> Such is the Faith celebrated in the <hi>Context,</hi> which is <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for, &amp;c.</hi> Such was Abrahams Faith, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>For he looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> Such was the Faith of Moſes, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>For he had reſpect unto the Recompence of Reward.</hi> And ſuch was the Faith of all the reſt, who all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for a <hi>better Reſurrection, v.</hi> 35. And it was this <hi>bleſſed hope</hi> that heightned their Courage: for Death loſes its Terrors to him that has made his Peace with God, and is aſſured of going to Heaven. We may indeed well grow Giddy when the proſpect before us is only a Gulph without Bottom: the profane man may well ſtagger at the ſight and flinch back: But to lift up our eyes to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and be able to ſay, <hi>Let the worſt come that can, let Death meet me, yet I goe thither</hi>; What is there to diſpirit ſuch a Saint? Why does the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard turn back and fly from the Battel? Surely, tis the Conſcience of his own wicked life, and the wretch fears to die: Judgment and Hell are before him, and truly then the leaſt danger of Death is a fearful and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001042_0026_0FAEECF5E07FB3C0"/>
Riſque. But the Righteous <hi>hath hope in his Death</hi>; What great Hurt can he ſee in it? If he falls in Battel, he's yet Victorious in the beſt ſenſe, a Conqueror over his worſt Foes, and is near a better Triumph than Earthly Victors can have decreed them.</p>
               <p>We ſee then that Faith does in its own nature tend to inſpire courage, which is one reaſon why ſo much is aſcribed to it. But there is a better reaſon yet behind; which is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith is a Grace which doth eſpecially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Help of God.</hi> To be ſure, it is <hi>He</hi> giveth ſalvation unto Kings, and carries vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in His Almighty Hand. If then Faith engages God on our ſide, it renders us <hi>Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.</hi> Now this it does, (1.) By promiſe; and (2.) In it ſelf, being what God muſt needs delight in.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By Promiſe.</hi> It is the Soveraign Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, and his poſitive determination, that if we would engage his preſence and help, we muſt be found in the exerciſe of Faith. Of all thoſe <hi>Martial Saints</hi> in the Context 'tis ſaid that they <hi>obtained a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> thro' Faith; but without Faith it had been <hi>impoſſible for them to have pleaſed God,</hi> or obtained his help. In every ſtrait Faith is to be in Exerciſe, and in every difficulty it has the promiſe of Help from Chriſt: <hi>Mark</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:001042_0027_0FAEECF7133A7088"/>
9.23. <hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him that believeth.</hi> Suppoſe now that Faith were meerly an arbitrary Precept, and no other reaſon could be given for its obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation but the will and good pleaſure of God; yet ſince God requires it of us if we would engage his help, it muſt needs be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to, and effective of Salvation to the Church: for the <hi>Strength of Iſrael will not lie nor repent.</hi> Add unto this,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Faith in its own nature is a Grace wherein God cannot but delight.</hi> As without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, ſo on the exerciſe of <hi>it,</hi> it is impoſſible he ſhould be diſpleaſed; &amp; no doubt but he will afford his help where he places his delight. Now that Faith is ſo pleaſing and delightful to God is eaſily argued, and neceſſarily infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; in that,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>It takes us off from all unlawful means and actions, in whatſoever we engage.</hi> Theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit and loſe the Preſence and Protection of God, and are like <hi>Achan</hi> to the Army of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> to cauſe them <hi>not to ſtand before their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi> and to provoke God to ſay, <hi>I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the accurſed from among you.</hi> Faith puts the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Souldier upon ſeeing to it that the <hi>Cauſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001042_0028_0FAEECF782183D58"/>
be juſt</hi> wherein he engages, and his <hi>Call ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient.</hi> It will not act out of a delight to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, which is inhumane cruelty; nor for the luſt of Dominion, which is unjuſt Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and Pyracy. It will maintain truth and keep faith when once given, nor ſeek advantages by treacheries and perfidiouſneſs. It will keep up the reverend exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in Armies, and baniſh vices out of the Camp; where they too often do abound, — Debaucheries, Profaneneſs, Stealth, Sloth, Diſobedience to Superiours, criminal Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Envies, Contentions, Hatred, Murthers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where there is no regard had to theſe things, there is no ground to hope, for the Divine Preſence. God will not lead ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Hoſts, who if they gain Victories will but ſeek the Enlargement of Hell, to add to the Territories of Satan in the world, and to propagate their own vile ſpirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, profaneneſs, cruelty and luxury; in open contempt of Gods Name and Laws.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith in the Souldier muſt needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſing to God, <hi>for therein he moſt conſults Gods Glory.</hi> It takes him off from truſting in himſelf, or aſcribing ſucceſs to means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. It debaſes ſecond cauſes in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> that He may be exalted. Pſal, 44.6, 8. <hi>I will not trust in my bow, neither
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001042_0029_0FAEECF88DE22360"/>
ſhall my ſword ſave me, In God we boaſt all the day long.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Faith owns the Being and Providence of God: and gives him the Glory of his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Perfections. It confeſſes his Power, his Righteouſneſs, Truth, Wiſdom and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; relying on theſe, and reſigning to them. Now God delights to ſee his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (and more his Children) acknowledge him in all their ways: for the End of all things is his Glory. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, <q>That the <hi>Romans</hi> of old thought it of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Publick Safety, if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates reverenced the Gods, than if they overcame their Enemies.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith muſt needs be pleaſing to God, and of great efficacy with him, becauſe <hi>it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> us upon Prayer; and ſerious, humble, fervent, conſtant ſeeking to him.</hi> Faith is moſt exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and beſt expreſs'd in Prayer; and Faith makes Prayer prevalent. <hi>The Lord is far from the wicked; but he heareth the Prayer of the Righteous. Prov.</hi> 15.29. And again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.18, 19. <hi>The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him; to all that call upon him in truth. He will fulfil the deſire of them that fear him; he will alſo hear their cry, and will ſave them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith gives us ſuitable <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> of Soul in Prayer. It comes from a gracious heart,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001042_0030_0FAEECF8FAC2DCA8"/>
the frame of the mind is good, and heavenly and devout.</p>
               <p>And Faith fills the mouth with proper <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> to plead with God in Prayer. It will plead the Divine <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi>: an Argument moſt ſuited to a gracious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It will plead the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of help, which God has made to his People: and the Truth of God affords a faſt hold for Faith. It will plead the <hi>Helpleſsneſs</hi> and wretched weakneſs of the People of God in themſelves, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.2. <hi>Then I ſaid, O Lord God, forgive I beſeech thee: by whom ſhall Jacob ariſe, for he is ſmall?</hi> It will plead the <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> and Blaſphemy of the Enemies of God: <hi>Wherefore ſhould the Heathen ſay, where is their God?</hi> and, <hi>Lord! What wilt thou do for thy great Name?</hi> Finally, It will plead Gods <hi>All ſufficiency</hi>: that he is able to ſave; That <hi>Our Father in Heaven is greater than all, and none can ſnatch them out of his hand.</hi> Thus Faith will pray and <hi>wrestle,</hi> and carry Heaven <hi>by violence,</hi> and like a <hi>Prince have power with God and prevail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly and laſtly,</hi> Faith cannot but be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to God, and of great efficacy with him, in that <hi>it implies Holineſs both of heart and life.</hi> This is aſcribed to Faith, that it <hi>purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart,</hi> and is Twin with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. It infers a new Nature, and the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001042_0031_0FAEECF9A883F2C0"/>
work of Sanctification to be wrought in us. And conſequently it implies a holy life, and exemplary Converſation: together with the <hi>Being,</hi> the <hi>Practice</hi> alſo of all other Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Graces. Faith looks unto Chriſt as our <hi>Great Commander,</hi> the Captain of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, prepares to follow him our <hi>Leader,</hi> is careful to obſerve his Orders, dutiful to his Commands.</p>
               <p>And will Chriſt forſake ſuch his faithful Followers? Will he not afford unto ſuch his Preſence and Aſſiſtance? What qualifies us for it, or gives a title to it, according to the promiſes of truth and grace, if not Holineſs. Pſal. 5. ult. <hi>Thou Lord, wilt bleſs the Righteous, with favour wilt thou compaſs him as with a ſhield</hi>: Unto <hi>the Righteous Nation,</hi> that <hi>keepeth the truth,</hi> God <hi>will appoint Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks: thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee, Iſa.</hi> 26.1, 2, 3. This was Gods Covenant with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, as <hi>Moſes</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers it among the Bleſſings of Obedience, Deut. 28 9, 10 <hi>The Lord ſhall eſtabliſh thee an Holy People unto himſelf, as he hath ſworn unto thee, if thou ſhalt keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways: And all People of the earth ſhall ſee that thou art called by the name of the Lord, and they ſhall be afraid of thee.</hi>

                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:001042_0032_0FAEECFA511202A8"/>Thus Faith engages the Almighty's Help by attracting his delight: and from him come the Churches Victories and Salvations.</p>

               <p>The only <hi>Inference</hi> I ſhall offer, is, That we may hence learn <hi>one great reaſon of the poor Condition which the Intereſt of Chriſt in the World is fallen into at this day.</hi> Truly, the Church of Chriſt has lately been in ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and bleeding circumſtances: the doleful cries of ſuffering Saints have been loud, and ſo have the Blaſphemies of their Oppreſſors. What Convulſions do the Nations at this day feel under the preſages of bloody War, and threatned with a deluge of <hi>Popery</hi>? The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Intereſt is far leſs potent, and at a lower ebb, than in Ages paſt. And what may be the reaſon of this ſore frown of God upon his Intereſt? Alas, the reaſon is too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <hi>Faith, and the neceſſary fruits of Faith are wanting.</hi> 'Tis partly through foul avow'd Apoſtacies from the Truth, and more thro' the general corruption of Manners among thoſe that retain a <hi>Form of Godlineſs.</hi>

now</hi>? Where her Triumphs? Why does ſhe not Increaſe, and enlarge her Borders? And may I not as well ask again, (as I remember an excellent Perſon doth in a like caſe) <hi>Where is Faith to be found in Exerciſe</hi>? Where are Believers? How cold and dead is our modern Profeſſion? Can Faith be without Holineſs and good Works? or can it conſiſt with profaneneſs, debaucheries, and every abomination? Theſe are the Foes that lay waſte the Heritage of God: <hi>Theſe</hi> the falſe Traitors that undermine the Church.

No wonder <hi>Amaleck pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails,</hi> when there are ſo few holy and <hi>clean hands lift up</hi> in the Mount. So that if the Church of Chriſt have loſt ground inſtead of gaining, yet it argues not that Faith could not have rendered <hi>it</hi> victorious, and can yet do it: but it is rather a <hi>ſhrewd ſign that Faith is wanting.

When Tyranny was trampling on the State, and Popery ſtood ready to mount the Pulpit, when Law and Religion were forc'd to couch before the <hi>Aſſumed Abſoluteneſs of the Court,</hi> and were Sold at a cheap price by Mercenary <hi>Judges.</hi> Dejected <hi>Britain</hi> then call'd for our dutiful Tears and Prayers, under ten thouſand O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of evil, and no door of Deliverance viſible. Then God <hi>aroſe, for the Oppreſſion of the Poor, for the ſighing of the Needy, to ſet him in ſafety from him that puffeth at him.</hi> Then God moved the <hi>Brave and Generous Prince</hi> to attempt our Deliverance: God gave him <hi>Faith and unknown Hopes,</hi> elſe however Mighty His Mind was, he could not have
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001042_0039_0FAEED02964723E8"/>
engaged a Power ſo Unequal. We ſtood amaz'd at the Miraculous Salvation: We wonder'd how it was effected, and could only adore the Might and Grace of God our Saviour. Millions of Prayers went up from gracious hearts, and <hi>Faith ſubdued,</hi> or rather Sav'd, <hi>Three Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lo here an Inſtance of what Courage Faith can inſpire, and what Help it can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage from God. By <hi>this</hi> which we have ſeen at home, and in our day, we may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, That <hi>Faith</hi> can yet <hi>Subdue Kingdoms, eſcape the Edge of the Sword,</hi> make <hi>Valiant in Fight, and put Armies of Aliens</hi> to the Rout.</p>
               <p>Let all this ſtrengthen your hands, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage your heart in the work wherein you are Engaged. Be always in this Spirit; let Faith animate you, and it will alſo proſper you.</p>
               <p>Here I had ended my <hi>Addreſs</hi> to you, but that the Providence of God has put a more <hi>Melancholly Argument</hi> in my mouth, and ſent us the loudeſt call imaginable to the duty now preſs'd upon us <hi>The Death of the beſt of Kings, and moſt Renown'd in Arms, is an awful Alarm to us, to be the more in the Exerciſe of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:001042_0040_0FAEED03517861B0"/>It cannot be deny'd but that among all means and inſtruments of Safety, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſuch a <hi>Soveraign,</hi> both at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Table, and in the Field of War was moſt to be relyed on. <hi>A Prince of Une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual'd Wiſdom, Courage and Vertue.</hi> How confidently could we rely on God under ſuch a <hi>Judge and Saviour,</hi> miraculouſly rais'd up for us? While he Preſided in every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, directed in every Important Step, in Perſon headed the moſt great Attempts, and by his Example ſpirited the backward to the boldeſt Actions? If Greatneſs of Mind, Magnanimity and Courage; if expertneſs in War and Inſight into Policies and Stratagems; if a conſpicuous Piety and Reverence of God-,—might promiſe help. A <hi>Prince</hi> in whom his Army as it were liv'd, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd in his Name and Conduct. A <hi>King</hi> of many Prayers, the delight of his People, the Sanctuary of Oppreſſed Nations, the Scourge of Tyrants, and in the prime of his Age.</p>
               <p>Snatch'd away in ſo critical a point of time, when the World ſeems juſt entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to War, and the eyes of all men were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, their greateſt Expectations (under God) from him, and <hi>Empires</hi> &amp; <hi>States</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Determinations, to take their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by. The Fall of ſuch a <hi>Prince,</hi> &amp; in ſuch
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001042_0041_0FAEED0427150910"/>
a time, how general is the Calamity! Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it will heighten the Pride of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemies and Oppreſſors of Mankind; and <hi>Faith</hi> muſt ſupport and reſpirit the <hi>Berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> Intereſt of God in the World. <hi>The God of Armies, the Lord of Hoſts yet lives! The God of Jacob is our Refuge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I little thought, <hi>Gentlemen of the Artillery,</hi> to have Mourn'd before you this day, the loſs of <hi>Him who was the Head and the Glory of your Order.</hi> How juſtly may you now <hi>Fold up</hi> your <hi>Flying Enſign,</hi> and hide it under ſome <hi>Sable Veil: March</hi> — not in wonted chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and <hi>State,</hi> but with folded Arms, and dejected Eyes, and <hi>trail your Pointed Weapons in the duſt</hi>: Nor let your <hi>Warlike Muſick</hi> ſound, but in <hi>Hoarſe and Solemn Notes of Grief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet to deſpond, though under this <hi>Amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſpenſation,</hi> were an Injury to the Great God, who firſt <hi>gave</hi> what he has <hi>taken away</hi>; who has oft' delivered, <hi>and in whom we trust that He will yet deliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are too apt to <hi>Deify</hi> Mortal men, and Idolize thoſe whom God honours to be the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of His Church's ſafety. Far be it from us to do <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>deny the God that is above.</hi> Let us remember thoſe, who through Faith <hi>out of Weakneſs were made ſtrong</hi>: Let

us pray to God, for a <hi>double Portion</hi> of the Spirit of Wiſdom, Courage, Piety, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to be poured out upon <hi>Her Preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, Our Sovereign: God Grant the</hi> QUEEN <hi>a Long and Victorious Reign, to finiſh all that which has been ſo Happily and Piouſly undertaken for the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               <p>So it becomes us to Hope and Pray,—but always with this <hi>Caution,</hi> which God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has ſeen it neceſſary to give us— <hi>Put not your Truſt in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom</hi> there is <hi>no help.</hi> His <hi>Breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Earth: in that very day his thoughts periſh.</hi> (His noble Purpoſes, his good and great Deſigns die with Him.)
