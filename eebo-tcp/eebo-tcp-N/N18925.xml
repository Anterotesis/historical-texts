            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Whereas it is of the greatest Importance, for the Peace and good Order of this Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, that the Election of Officers should be free, regular, and uninfluenced: It is therefore Voted and Resolved, That in future the following Rules shall be observed:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That at the stated Meetings to be hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en on the first Monday in January, each Member attending shall furnish himself with a List of such Names as he shall choose to put in Nomination for the four Charter Officers, and the Members of the Committee of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence, at the ensuing Election, not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024618_0019_0FC7DC40DFC1E5E8"/>
exceeding the Number of Twenty-six—And the first Business to be proceeded on that Day, after the President takes the Chair, shall be the Appointment of a Committee of three Members to sort and count the Nomination Votes.—After said Committee is chosen, the President shall call on the Members for their Votes, and the aforesaid Committee shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to count the same, and report to the President the Names of the Twenty-six highest in said Vote,—a List of which shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made out by the Secretary, and read aloud at the Table; and each Member of the Association shall, previous to the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be furnished, by the Secretary, with a printed Copy of the same.</p>
               <p n="2">2. At the Election, on the first Monday in April annually, each Member shall, when called upon by the President for the Time being, bring in his Ballot for Officers singly, from the printed List.—The Votes shall then be counted by a Committee of Three, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Association for that Purpose; and if it so happens, that any Name, not in the Nomination List, should be voted for, such Vote shall be thrown out without being count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—After the Ballots are counted, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee shall report to the President, and he shall declare the Name of the Person elected
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024618_0020_0FC7DC43A785CC40"/>
to each Office, except to the Presidency, which shall be declared by one of the said Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee.</p>
               <p n="3">3d.
