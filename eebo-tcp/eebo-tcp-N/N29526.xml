            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS the Indians within the Eastern parts of this his Majesties Province, for some time past in open Rebellion, have lately made their Submission, a new recognized their Obedience and Subjection to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and engaged to live peaceably &amp; quietly with his Majesties Subjects, the <hi>English</hi>; which probably will invite divers of the former Inhabitants and Proprietors of Lands there, speedily to return. And forasmuch as the regular Settlement of the said Country is of great import, for the better securing of His Majesties Interests: And the future peace and tranquility of his Majesties Subjects not a little depending on a due regulating of Trade with the said <hi>Indians,</hi> which the Government have resolved to keep intirely under their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate direction and management, that no abuse or injustice may be done the <hi>Indians therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do therefore, with the Advice and Consent of the Council, hereby strictly forbid all and every of his Majesties Subjects to Build and Settle in the parts of this Province, to the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Town of <hi>Wells,</hi> without first applying themselves unto, and having approbation and directions of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Council for the same; As also to have any Trade, Dealings or Commerce with the <hi>Indians</hi> in the said Eastern parts, or to truck, barter, buy or sell, to or with them or any of them (other than such persons as are or shall be imployed by the Government for that affair) as they will answer their contempt at their utmost peril.</p>
            <p>Given at the Council Chamber in <hi>Boston</hi> the Ninth day of <hi>February.</hi> In the Tenth year of His Majesties Reign. <hi>Annoque Domini.</hi> 1698.</p>
