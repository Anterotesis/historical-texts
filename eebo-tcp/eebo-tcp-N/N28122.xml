            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE great ſoul of our beloved Waſhington, has left the world.—Accounts, not to be diſputed, have announced his death.—It is an event long to be remembered by Americans.— The melancholy tidings have vibrated on our ears, in ſaddeſt accents; they have penetrated our hearts, exciting ſenſations not to be deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and have produced, in copious effuſion, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, but unavailing tears.—On this day, the anniverſary of that which gave him to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and to mankind—the day, which, in honor of his virtues, you were uſed to devote to feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and joy; we are met, for the firſt time, in the houſe of God, to deplore our loſs of him;— to weep over his urn; and to collect ſuch inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from his death, as the ſolemn event is ſuited

            <p>With the millions of America, therefore, we unite in paying an affectionate tribute of reſpect to the memory of this firſt of Americans;—this friend of religion, of liberty, and of man.</p>

            <p>The ſeveral important doctrines ſuggeſted in the text, if taken into conſideration and treated abſtractly, would be found worthy of our moſt ſerious attention; but this our time, and other exiſting circumſtances, will not admit.

            <p>In the execution of this deſign, let us conſider, the greatneſs of the loſs and affliction we have ſuſtained, in the death of the illuſtrious General, and late Preſident, Waſhington;</p>

            <p>Point out the proper method of improving the important, mournful event.</p>
            <p>The firſt intention has its accompliſhment in our taking a juſt view of the character, ſervices, and influence of this great man; and of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of our country.</p>
            <p>The character of the General is ſo conſpicuous in the American hiſtory, where his great actions are recorded;—has been preſented to our view

in ſuch a variety of engaging forms, in tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions intimately connected with our firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts and tendereſt feelings; and has, juſtly, been ſo often the ſubject of eulogy, that it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary we ſhould enter into a particular inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: and were we to attempt it, the limits of a volume would be found too confined.— Where alſo ſhould we find the Raphael-hand that could draw it to the life, and preſent it to our view in all its pleaſing attitudes and glowing colours?</p>
            <p>Leaving, therefore, this arduous ſervice to a maſter's hand, we ſhall only attempt a ſketch.</p>
            <p>In treating of his character, we muſt briefly touch on his hiſtory.</p>
            <p>General George Waſhington was the third ſon of an opulent gentleman of Virginia, who traced his deſcent from the eldeſt of two brothers of the name, who had migrated to that country from York or Lancaſhire, in Great Britain, about the year 1660. They were men of property when they left their native land, and ſecured to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as ſettlers in this, the uſual advantages attendant on wealth and reſpectability of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which both themſelves and deſcendants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have uniformly poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>The General was born on the eleventh day of February, old ſtile, in the year 1732. While very young, he began to manifeſt that greatneſs of mind, and excellency of diſpoſition, which have ſince ſhone ſo conſpicuouſly in his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His companions at ſchool have declared, that they never diſcovered in him any profanity in language, or indecency of behaviour; and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037484_0007_100D19F82EF30718"/>
that they often ſuffered reproof, from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or guardians, by the compariſon which was drawn between his conduct and theirs.</p>
            <p>Though he did not enjoy the advantages of a collegiate education, yet, he was furniſhed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a competent tutor, with an opportunity of gaining acquaintance with claſſical learning. But ſo ſtrong was his inclination for the mathemat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks, that his genius could not be long confined to the ſtudy of the dead languages. In mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſcience he was ſaid to have made conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable progreſs; as well as in whatever belongs, in general, to an Engliſh education. That logick and oratory muſt in ſome early part of his life, have engaged his ſerious attention, is very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concluded, from the claſſical purity and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egance of his ſtile; and from the clear, conciſe, and nervous manner of his reaſoning.</p>
            <p>A reſpectable teſtimony has been given to his improvement in ſcience, by the emulation with which ſeveral of the moſt eminent American ſeminaries conferred on him their literary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</p>
            <p>When he began his military career we are not quite certain; as the hiſtorical accounts and other ſources of information which have been conſulted, reſpecting this and ſome other conſequent tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of his life, are not ſo particular as could be wiſhed. By ſome accounts, it is ſaid he had acted as an adjutant; and by others, that he raiſed a company of volunteers in the capacity of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, for the defence of the Virginia frontiers. In either of theſe caſes, and both are probable, he muſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037484_0008_100D19F9B27F0C38"/>
have entered on military ſervice when very young, and made rapid advances; for we find him with the rank of major at the age of 21, when, in the year 1753, he was ſent by governor Dinwiddie to negociate with the French commandant on the Ohio. In the following year, he diſtinguiſhed himſelf as colonel commandant on the Ohio ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the total defeat of a party of French ſent to diſlodge him; and by his ſubſequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the unfiniſhed fort Neceſſity, againſt a force vaſtly ſuperior to his own. In the year 1755 he was preſent at the battle of Mononga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hela, and acted as aid to general Braddock. Had his prudent advice and courageous offer been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by that haughty, confident commander, it is probable the fatal and ſhameful defeat of the day would have been prevented: and had not his courage and conduct, at the head of the provincial troops, interpoſed, after the fall of Braddock, the remainder of the Britiſh regulars muſt have been cut to pieces.</p>
            <p>Having thus eſtabliſhed, in early life, an exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed character for courage, prudence, patriotiſm, and wiſdom, mature beyond his years, he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, or before, the peace of 1763, from mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary employments; at leaſt, from the regular ſervice; but was generally, if not always, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of the people in the provincial aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. In this ſtation, the principles of liberty, of government, and of general law, muſt have ſeriouſly employed his mind.—By this previous acquaintance with both military affairs and legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Divine Providence gradually prepared him for thoſe high ſtations which he afterwards fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:—for
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037484_0009_100D19FB375BEBB8"/>
the important part he acted in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutionary war, and in the eſtabliſhment, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization and government of theſe United States.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of Virginia, ſenſible of his abilities and worth, appointed him one of that band of worthies, which compoſed the congreſs of '74; and on the 15th of June 1775, congreſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him commander in chief of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can armies.</p>
            <p>Under his conduct they ſupported, amid mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diſadvantages, an arduous and ſucceſsful op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, during an eight years war, againſt the ſuperior force of Britiſh and auxiliary veterans, headed by their ableſt generals. By him they were conducted to victory and renown.</p>
            <p>Having finiſhed the defenſive, revolutionary war, which terminated in the acknowledged inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, freedom, and peace of his country, he voluntarily reſigned his commiſſion, on the the 23d of July, 1783, into the hands from which he received it; and retired, covered with glory, to the peaceful ſhades of private life.</p>
            <p>But within the compaſs of four years, the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, and call of his country, again requiring him to engage in national tranſactions; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a member, and preſident of the convention, which framed the conſtitution of the United States: And on its adoption by the States, was, by the unanimous voice of the citizens, called to the firſt magiſtracy in the union. Having fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed the conſtitutional term of his appointment, as Preſident; a ſecond unanimous vote, re-elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the ſame important office; and had he not voluntarily retired, a third, or fourth, in all
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037484_0010_100D19FDE7A477D0"/>
probability, had this been requiſite, would have continued him in it to the end of his life.</p>
            <p>Long worn in the fatigues and dangers of the field, and preſſed with the weighty, complicated cares of government, he muſt, at this time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, have ſighed for repoſe; eſpecially at his advanced ſtage of life, and when all the charms of relative and domeſtic enjoyment united their influence to invite him to his pleaſing home.</p>
            <p>His intention and hope therefore, were, no doubt, fully expreſſed in the declaration made to the citizens at large, in his farewell addreſs:— "Of appearing no more in a public character." But once more his country called, and he obeyed. The hoſtile appearance in Europe, reſpecting A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica:—Threats and inſults, menacing a blow, rouſed all the patriot and ſoldier in his breaſt. He ſpurned the thoughts of eaſe, of indulgence, and, as it were, even the infirmities of age, when the honor and ſafety of his country required exertion! —Again he accepted the command of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can forces; again he appeared terrible in arms!</p>
            <p>In the cares, rather than the dangers, of this new appointment (for the laſt were not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) he ſuffered, at the high diſpoſal of all-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Heaven, the arreſt of death, on the 14th of December, 1799.—With manly fortitude he met the awful ſummons; and in the 68th year of his age, complacently ſurrendered his ſoul into the hands of his Creator and his God.</p>
            <p>By a regular view of his character, we ſhall diſcover in him, a man endowed with ſuperior gifts of nature—a great general—an able ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and juſt magiſtrate—a <hi>true</hi> patriot—a man of exalted virtues, and religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037484_0011_100D1A012E20BF10"/>The firmneſs and vigor of his conſtitution, the manly, dignified appearance of his perſon, the comprehenſion of his mind, the correctneſs of his judgment, and his perſuaſive powers in eloquence, or written addreſſes, were at once happy and honorable to himſelf, and eminently uſeful to mankind.</p>
            <p>He poſſeſſed, in an eminent degree, the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a great general;—wiſdom and foreſight in forming his plans; promptneſs and courage in the execution. Impenetrable ſecrecy watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over his military councils; prudence and quick diſcernment directed his choice and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in agents. The influence he exerted over an heterogeneous body of raw, inexperienced ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, of which his army generally conſiſted, ſo as to unite and inſpire them with patience and fortitude, under all the wants, and diſadvantages they ſuffered; and to face with courage the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy, ſuperior in numbers, diſcipline, and the means of war, whenever a proper occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, was truly admirable. Add to this, his ſkillful manoeuvring, ſo as to deceive, delay, or elude the foe; and the command he maintained over himſelf. In dangers and ſufferings he was not unreaſonably depreſſed; in victory not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, vainly elated, or ſecure. He was the eye, the ear, the heart, the ſoul of the army: Ever attentive, ever watchful:—Alive to the wants and ſufferings of the ſoldiers; but reſolute to reſtrain their irregularities and check their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence.—As a general, he was honored by the great Frederick.</p>
            <p>He gave an earneſt of his great abilities as a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037484_0012_100D1A036B909E50"/>
ſtateſman, by firſt ſuggeſting the idea of a federal government, in the circular letter he addreſſed to the governors of the different ſtates, at the cloſe of the war: And he eminently diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, during his eight years adminiſtration, as Preſident of the United States.</p>
            <p>They appear by his recommendations to the national legiſlature; by the prudent uſe he made of the power lodged in his own hands; by his appointments to office; and by his ſuppreſſion of inſurrection. But the higheſt honor is done to his character as a ſtateſman, by his placing this country in a ſtate of neutrality, when the flames of war were kindling in Europe; by the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual meaſures he took to counteract the attempts of thoſe who would have drawn or plunged us into them; and by the excellent maxims and counſels of his farewell addreſs.</p>
            <p>So juſt was his adminiſtration, that he might, with the greateſt propriety, have addreſſed the citizens of the United States, in the language of Samuel, the Prophet and Judge of Iſrael: "Whoſe ox have I taken; whoſe aſs have I taken; whom have I defrauded; or whom have I oppreſſed?"</p>
            <p>But to his country he was <hi>more</hi> than juſt:— He was the true, the generous patriot. For her welfare he conſecrated the ſervices of his early youth, of his manly prime, and of his declining years. For the arduous ſervices of commander in chief of the armies, and preſident of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, during a term of near twenty years, he received no pecuniary compenſation: His gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous ſoul refuſed it! He ſought no rewards but
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037484_0013_100D1A06741FDB58"/>
the rewards of virtue! He laboured, only to render his country free, independent, and happy!—What opportunities had he at the head of the army, for amaſſing wealth, had this been his object? And what rewards might he not have received had he yielded, like the traitor Arnold, to the overtures which propoſed his betraying the cauſe of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
            <p>His conduct uniformly juſtified the declaration he made on his appointment as general, that "in aſſuming the character of a ſoldier, he did not relinquiſh that of a citizen." That unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted care he exerciſed to preſerve the military, in due ſubordination to the civil power, reflects the higheſt honor on his public character; and proves the genuineneſs of his patriotiſm.—He might, like Cromwell and others, have ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the legiſlature with armed men; have obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on their deliberations to awe them with his preſence; and, to effect the purpoſes of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have amuſed the people with the cry of liberty and republicaniſm. But ſo far was he from adopting ſuch meaſures; that when by deſigning men, through the medium of the army's wants, rebellion and violence were exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and were ready to burſt forth with deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fury; he, to his immortal honor, riſked all his popularity with the ſoldiers and their love of him; exerted all his eloquence and influence; interpoſed his authority, and— prevented the evil. It was his intention that his country ſhould be <hi>really</hi> free, and that the ſource of power ſhould be preſerved pure. He well knew, that when ſoldiers dictate to a ſtate, her liberties are gone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:037484_0014_100D1A08C6787E80"/>The conduct he obſerved toward the Britiſh admiral, Lord Howe, and the adjutant-general Patterſon; and to the French ambaſſador, Genet, ſhows, that however he would patiently bear <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi> injuries, or in a dignified manner overlook ſlights of a <hi>private</hi> nature, he would ſuffer none which affected the honor of his <hi>country.</hi> His concern for her honor, and happineſs, extended to future ages—hence that valuable legacy, his farewell addreſs.</p>
            <p>So much has been already ſaid of his virtues (and muſt be ſaid when his character is the theme) that it is only neceſſary to enumerate ſome of the chief of that bright aſſemblage which appeared in him. His temperance, candor, courage, mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, modeſty, juſtice, humanity, magnanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, benevolence, and generoſity, ſhone forth through the whole circle of his public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life.—The tears ſhed over André, whom political juſtice and the laws of war ſuffered not to live, and his concern for Aſgil, ſhew his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in an amiable light, having in them even an enemy for its object. His generoſity to his country extended to the expenditure of money in her cauſe, as well as to his free perſonal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.—Shares in the canals of Virginia to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable amount, which that ſtate preſented to him under impreſſions of gratitude and reſpect, were by him appropriated to the important uſe of educating the American youth.—Beſides this, he gave, yearly, a liberal ſum, from his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, for the ſupport of a ſchool in Alexandria; and by his will the benefaction is rendered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.—Of his hoſpitality and kindneſs many were partakers.—His eminently poſſeſſing the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037484_0015_100D1A0A4B5588F8"/>
relative, domeſtic, and ſocial virtues was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidenced by ſighs and tears in the late mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſcene which was exhibited at Mount Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, when his beloved remains, amid his weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing family, friends, and neighbours, were depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſilent manſion of the dead.</p>
            <p>His modeſty caſt a ſoftening ſhade over all his other virtues. It attended him to the laſt, when his praiſe filled every mouth but his own, and his fame had extended to every part of the civilized world.—Amid all his attainments he retained a ſenſe of the imperfections of human nature: theſe, as a wiſe man, he diſcovered in himſelf: the diſcovery, united with a ſenſe of his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his God, prevented him from becoming vain: and both theſe, as a good man, he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to acknowledge.</p>
            <p>That the General poſſeſſed a high ſenſe of the importance and excellency of religion, his public declarations on almoſt every occaſion abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted. God's ſuperintending Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; his ſpecial interpoſition in favor of the juſt and innocent; his attention to the prayers of his ſupplicating people; and the neceſſity of religion, for the ſupport of morality, virtue, and the true intereſts of civil ſociety; are articles which he has fully ſtated in them, and zealouſly ſupported. In the ſtile of genuine devotion, and gratitude, he acknowledged the interpoſition of Heaven in the great events of the revolution, and pledged himſelf to ſupplicate the Almighty in behalf of his country, and of his companions in arms.— With ſuch profeſſions he entered on his offices, of general and preſident; and with ſuch he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from them. But as no words can ſo well
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037484_0016_100D1A0C94F5B900"/>
expreſs his views, and feelings, as his own; let us hear him on ſome of theſe occaſions.</p>
            <p>In his laſt general orders, at the diſbanding of the army, he ſays:—"And being now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe his laſt public orders, to take his ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate leave of the military character, and bid a final adieu to the armies he has ſo long had the honor to command; the commander in chief, can only again offer in their behalf his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to their grateful country, and his prayers to the God of armies.—May ample juſtice be done them here; and may the choiceſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's favors both here and hereafter attend thoſe, who under the divine auſpices, have ſecured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable bleſſings for others!—With theſe wiſhes, and this benediction, he is about to retire from ſervice.—The curtain of ſeparation will ſoon be drawn—and the military ſcene, with him will be cloſed for ever!"</p>
            <p>On delivering his commiſſion to the preſident of congreſs, his words are: "I reſign with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the appointment I accepted with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a diffidence in my abilities to accompliſh ſo arduous a taſk; which was ſuperſeded, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by a conſciouſneſs of the rectitude of our cauſe, the ſupport of the ſupreme power of the union, and the patronage of Heaven.</p>
            <p>"The ſucceſsful termination of the war has verified the moſt ſanguine expectations; and my gratitude for the interpoſitions of Providence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes with every review of the momentous conteſt.—I conſider it as an indiſpenſible duty to cloſe this laſt act of my official life, by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the intereſts of our deareſt country to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037484_0017_100D1A0E1A7B4818"/>
the protection of Almighty God, and thoſe who have the ſuperintendency of them to his holy keeping!"</p>
            <p>Theſe ſentiments are yet more fully expreſſed in the ſuperexcellent ſpeech delivered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, at his entering into office as preſident; and make a diſtinguiſhed figure in his valedictory addreſs to the American people. To theſe I refer you.—</p>
            <p>His regular attendance on divine worſhip, and frequently enjoining an obſervance of it, while in office; the reſpect the miniſters of religion experienced in his company and at his table— and, above all, his ſtrict morality and many vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, on his own principles ſhowed, that theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions were not words of courſe; but the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſentiments of his heart. The whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires to induce the belief, that he was more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the ſublime doctrines of chriſtianity, and their gracious, experimental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the heart, than there was occaſion to declare in theſe communications he made to the public.</p>
            <p>In a word, he was the friend, the father, the ornament of his country!</p>
            <p>His public ſervices, recorded in the page of hiſtory, too numerous, too vaſt to be here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, we ſhall not now attempt to repeat. But retaining, as he did, the powers of body and mind, in an eminent degree, he was ſtill capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of rendering many more of eſſential import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.—Let us turn our attention to,—</p>
            <p>His influence in the nation; and the exiſting circumſtances of our national affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:037484_0018_100D1A107431F810"/>His virtue was tried—his character was known: His abilities were acknowledged—his exeperience was great: He poſſeſſed the confidence and the love of his country. He was a kind of rallying point to all its citizens who poſſeſſed the leaſt ſhare of virtue; however diverſified in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thoſe who did not approve all his meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures; yet never for a moment, called in queſtion the uprightneſs of his intentions.—While he lived, all competition for the command of the army was in a manner impoſſible.—An Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can army was, at all times, ready to follow him in any enterpriſe; to face with him any danger. He was reſpected by our friends;—he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to our enemies.</p>
            <p>Unhappily for America, at this time, when it has pleaſed the great Arbiter of heaven and earth to call him hence; union in principles and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic meaſures, though greater than at a former period, is not ſo complete as it ought to be. War ſtill deluges the nations of Europe in blood. Our differences with one of the moſt potent are not yet adjuſted;—and the rival powers, at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, are endeavouring to gain an aſcendency in our councils; or to awe us into compliance with their wiſhes and intereſts. At this event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful period,—while the dark clouds of political commotion ſtill hover in our eaſtern and ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern horizon, portending a ſtorm; and while it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains uncertain, whether our ſtate veſſel ſhall have to contend with the conflicting elements, or be anchored ſafe in the haven of peace; our ableſt pilot is ſnatched from the helm!—While the alarm of war is ſtill ſounding; the chariot
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037484_0019_100D1A144C678D68"/>
and horſemen of our American Iſrael has taken his upward flight!—The loſs is great; it is ſenſibly felt by all. The venerable preſident, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, the public miniſters, the army, the ſemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of learning, the churches and miniſters of Chriſt, the people of the United States at large, acknowledge it, and mourn.</p>
            <p>But let us now conſider the reaſons which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our ſubmiſſion to the divine will, manifeſted in this event.</p>
            <p>A forcible one occurs at firſt view: It is the act of God:—Of him, who has a ſovereign right and propriety in, and over all worlds, and all their inhabitants:—Of him whoſe goodneſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
            <p>Had the ruffian hand of an aſſaſſin, or the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies to liberty, perpetrated, or but attempted, his death; thouſands, I had almoſt ſaid, millions, of ſwords would have been drawn by patriotic A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, and in their hands have flamed for vengeance. But to oppoſe the will of heaven, or murmur at its accompliſhment, is impiety, folly, and madneſs. In the acts of God, unerring wiſdom, united with juſtice and goodneſs, directs all events, both of the moral and natural world.</p>
            <p>Waſhington was to America the valuable gift of God: he had a right to reſume his own gift at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The event we mourn is the common lot of man: "The Fathers, where are they? And the Prophets, do they live for ever?"</p>
            <p>To the good man, death is deſirable: It ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates the toils and ſufferings of life; and leads to perfect bliſs—to never-ending joys.</p>
            <p>Our beloved patriot had lived to a good old
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037484_0020_100D1A15D1A810B8"/>
age. Had he lived much longer, he muſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common courſe of nature, have ſuffered thoſe infirmities and decays, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, if not deſtroy the comfort and uſefulneſs of life; and rob it of reſpectability. Greatneſs in ruins is a mournful ſight: To himſelf, therefore, <hi>this</hi> might be the moſt deſirable time for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
            <p>To which we may add, he had for his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and the honor of his country, completed a long courſe of great and dignified actions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tarniſhing his reputation; in ſuch a manner as to give him full rank, if not precedence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the great characters of ancient or modern times;—and to make his example uſeful to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages. Did Greece boaſt of Solon, Ariſtides, Leonidas, Timoleon, Epaminondas, and Aratus? or Rome, of Romulus, the Bruti, Cincinnatus, Fabius, Scipio, the Antonines, or Cato? Does modern Europe glory in her Frederick, Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus Adolphus, Marlborough, Hampden, or Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:—as heroes, ſtateſmen, or patriots? It is ſufficient for America that ſhe has had a Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington.—Heaven has made him to us both a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and a Joſhua.— His example will live, though his body returns to its primeval duſt.</p>
            <p>The cauſe in which this great man engaged, remains the ſame: and equally, we truſt, the care of heaven. 'Twas the ſpecial favor of God to him, and to his country, which made him ſo eminently virtuous, great, and ſucceſsful.—The genuine and enlarged liberty, both civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, brought about by the revolution, and in connexion with law and juſtice, conſtitutionally eſtabliſhed in theſe United States, are important
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037484_0021_100D1A1824A21CE0"/>
objects in God's moral government.—While theſe are preſerved inviolate; and while we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the interpoſition of the Deity, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his throne, fear his judgments, render thanks for his mercies, and honor religion by a temper and conduct correſpondent to its principles,—as this great patriot and our anceſtors have done; and as the body of our citizens, I truſt, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do;—America will remain the object of divine care and favor.—If, therefore, one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored agent is removed, another will be raiſed up to fill his place; to catch, as it were, his mantle, imbibe his ſpirit, and ſtand forth, under God, the guardian of our lives, liberties and laws.—'Twere impiety to repoſe in any creature, though an Archangel, our ultimate confidence for ſafety and defence.</p>
            <p>We have, indeed, as individuals, been found wanting in our returns of gratitude, for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifold and excellent bleſſings conferred on us by Providence. In too many inſtances we have abuſed our privileges; and perhaps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſome, have given that honor to the ſervants, which was due only to their Lord! This may be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their removal;—not out of diſpleaſure to them, nor ultimately to us; but for our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling:—that we may feel our dependence on God, fear his holy name, and henceforth make his everlaſting arm our truſt.</p>
            <p>This is an affecting conſideration. Under conviction of its truth, well may we be dumb with religious awe in the divine preſence as pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itents: and with ſilent admiration and gratitude contemplate his goodneſs, long-ſuffering, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; by which we are continued in the poſſeſſion
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037484_0022_100D1A19AB9C1000"/>
of ſo many valuable bleſſings; and by which we are encouraged to hope for bleſſings yet to come.</p>
            <p>Furniſhed with ſuch powerful reaſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole our grief, and ſilence our repining; let us turn our thoughts to the improvement we ſhould make of this mournful event:</p>
            <p>And, in the firſt place, let us learn ſincere and humble reſignation to the ſovereign pleaſure of Almighty God, in this, and every other afflicting diſpenſation of his providence. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, let us bring home to ourſelves the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have been ſuggeſted, reſpecting the character and prerogatives of Deity; the frailty, dependence, duty, and intereſts of man; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe arguments which immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the death of our departed friend. Thus let us moderate our grief and make it uſeful. Not to be affected on this occaſion, would argue want of ſenſibility—want of virtue: But to ſet bounds to our grief, and turn its tide into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per channel, is the work of reaſon and religion.</p>
            <p>The great events and happy conſequences of the revolution, in which General Waſhington acted ſo diſtinguiſhed a part, are ſo inſeparably connected with his hiſtory and character; that a review of the latter neceſſarily brings the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer before us in all their importance and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. By beholding them in this connexion, our love and veneration are encreaſed to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man, who was honored by heaven as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of ſo much good to his country: And we are conſtrained to offer our tribute of gratitude and praiſe to God for the gift of ſo valuable a citizen: —To thank him, alſo, that the excellent Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was continued to us ſo long, to guard the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037484_0023_100D1A1D6AA5C538"/>
liberties, his conduct and valor won;—to guide our councils, by his wiſdom; and, by his bright example, to teach us virtue.</p>
            <p>Let his grateful country honor his memory. Let her citizens recount the inſtances of his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſity and patriotiſm;—his heroic deeds, his toils, his dangers, and his triumphs!—This I am confident they are diſpoſed to do: And that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all deſcriptions of them, none will be found more forward and active therein, than the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſocieties I this day addreſs.—A ſociety formed by the officers of that patriotic army, which fought the battles of the glorious revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary war, under his conduct; to whom he ſtood in the honorable and near relation of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent General;—and another, compoſed of the moſt enlightened and reſpectable citizens, who have united for the expreſs purpoſe of perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the events, the principles, and the ſpirit of the revolution; can never be indifferent to the memory of Waſhington.</p>
            <p>No, much reſpected members of theſe ſocieties, you cannot, you will not ſuffer his virtues and achievements to be obliterated!—And that you, my Chriſtian brethren and fellow citizens, of every deſcription, will not withhold the grateful tribute of reſpect, your ſerious attendance on this occaſion is both an evidence and earneſt.— You will recollect, his ſleepleſs nights, and days of care; when he watched for the ſafety of his army, and for the freedom of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: how, in dangers and diſtreſs, he ſtood col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, with undaunted courage; relying on the aid of heaven.—With refined pleaſure you will recount, what my feeble voice cannot deſcribe,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037484_0024_100D1A1FAD961310"/>
how he moved ſublime before his martial bands, darting his experienced eye through the long ranks of war, leading them to victory!—How he drove Britain's warlike hoſts from Boſton!—How, with his little patriotic army, when the cauſe of liberty appeared almoſt expiring, he croſſed the Delaware, through the darkneſs, cold, and ſtorm; and, like the thunder of heaven, burſt on the numerous, ſecure, and nearly triumphant foe, at Trenton; withering their ſtrength and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating their confidence!—At York Town you will behold him, receiving with dignity the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of a powerful army; and the laurels of the Britiſh Hannibal fading in his preſence.—You will follow him, to that auguſt interview with congreſs, when he reſigned his military command; to the place where, in the view of liſtening and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring thouſands, he received the inveſtiture of his office, as Preſident!—Through the various walks of public and private life you will purſue him with your mental eye; witneſſing his philanthropy, juſtice, magnanimity, and piety—and then, will ſay: "This is the man, who has merited from his country, the firſt degree of love, reſpect, and veneration, that is due to mortals."</p>
            <p>Intimately connected with the reſpect due to his memory, is the ſacred duty of preſerving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate theſe rights and privileges; thoſe ineſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able liberties, civil and religious, for which he fought and laboured. Let it not be ſaid, that after his death, Americans have become indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to that cauſe which lay ſo near his heart; on his labours in which heaven ſo propitiouſly ſmiled —That cauſe which is ſo eſſential to our preſent happineſs, and as favorable to our future hopes—
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037484_0025_100D1A2162146168"/>
That cauſe which is intimately connected with the honor of God, and the intereſts of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's kingdom. Let us then feel for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of our country, and of mankind, as our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted patriot did; and like him, ſet our faces in a determined manner againſt tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; ſelfiſh intereſt and faction; diſſipation and folly; infidelity, vice, and immorality in all their various forms.—Let us cultivate the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, as well as mild virtues, and all that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the man.</p>
            <p>Theſe his example recommends to us. An example of virtue, in a high ſtation, reſembles the ſun in the firmament; unveiling his glories to every eye, and ſhedding his beams on all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round. Such was his.—It not only commands our reſpect; but invites our imitation. It proves alſo what great things are attainable, and may be expected, by thoſe who ſincerely engage, and ſtrenuouſly perſevere in virtuous purſuits.</p>
            <p>This example will teach the ſenator wiſdom, the ſtateſman juſtice and magnanimity; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot generoſity, the ſoldier heroiſm, and the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen, virtue. It will ſhow to our approving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and conſcience, that the foundation of every truly great character is laid in perſonal virtue, and a ſincere regard to religion. So true are the words of the Poet:
<q>
                  <l>Who errs in private never can act well.</l>
                  <l>Nor honor, faith, nor truth to ſuch belong.—</l>
                  <l>Who can be right, whoſe life is in the wrong?</l>
               </q>
To the riſing generation, eſpecially, this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is recommended. Let the American youth, fired with the laudable ambition of excelling in all that is great, virtuous, and amiable, improve
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037484_0026_100CDB28479BFF80"/>
the early part of their lives in forming their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter by this excellent model: Then may we expect to ſee future Waſhingtons ariſe, and ſtand forth the aſſertors and guardians of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's rights; the heroes and patriots of their day; the ornaments of human nature.</p>
            <p>But amidſt all our care to ſecure the honor and happineſs of our country; while fears of danger diſtreſs; or pleaſing expectations of proſperity and improvement, public or perſonal, expand the heart; we are arreſted by the direful alarm of death. Like the bellowing thunder from a gloomy cloud; or the volcano's horrid roar from the diſrupting earth, it ſhakes the confidence of mortals:—We hear the deafening ſound; our ſouls ſhudder at the ſhock; they ſtart at death's approach, and look down with awe on the vaſt ſcenes of eternity opening on their view. "It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after this, the judgment." "What man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death?"</p>
            <p>He is not bribed by wealth, nor reſtrained by power; he is blind to the charms of beauty, and deaf to the perſuaſive powers of eloquence. The ſprightly youth and the ſmiling infant, as well as the man of grey hairs, do feel alike the ſtroke of his fatal dart.—The great and good, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as the mean and vile, ſhall fall before him.</p>
            <p>Waſhington, the great, the virtuous, the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous, the brave, the father of his country, is numbered with the dead!—</p>
            <p>Anterior, or ſubſequent to this mournful event, within a few months, ſeveral others of the moſt diſtinguiſhed patriots, and prime actors in the great conteſt for American liberty and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037484_0027_100D1A27B60C1EE0"/>
have alſo fallen. Henry, whoſe bold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable ſpirit, fired with the love of liberty and his country's rights, ſtood forth the firſt to oppoſe the encroachments of uſurping power, in a manner that aſtoniſhed patriots themſelves;— who plead the equal rights of conſcience, and ſucceeded; whoſe irreſiſtable eloquence bore down all oppoſition, and flaſhed conviction on every mind; who, in times the moſt perilous, held with integrity the reins of government in a powerful neighbouring ſtate—Henry, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes of Virginia, the friend, the compat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of Waſhington, is alſo fallen.—The gallant Mifflin, famed in council and in the field, is num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with them:—And now,—mournful reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!—the amiable, the eloquent, the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rutledge, our late, honored governor; an early, tried, and ſteadfaſt patriot; the Tully of Carolina, has likewiſe bid adieu to mortal things.</p>
            <p>A few of theſe honored, firſt characters; of theſe virtuous patriots, and citizen-ſoldiers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, venerable in years as in virtue;—but they —ourſelves—the whole preſent generation, muſt ſoon—ſoon paſs from time, to an unknown world.</p>
            <p>"Nor man alone is mortal; empires die!" —This world itſelf ſhall ſuffer diſſolution—ſhall be wrapped in flames:—And all beyond is vaſt eternity!</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations ſhould awaken us to the calls of death; eſpecially to that ſolemn call, which this day claims our attention. Death is God's awful meſſenger, ſent on the moſt momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous errand to man.—He breaks the tender ties of relative, ſocial, and political connexion;— reduces our mortal frame to duſt;—diſlodges,

            <p>How, as rational, accountable creatures, ſhould we be concerned to meet, in a becoming manner, the unavoidable, grand event,—the change of death? What exertions ſhould we not make, to obtain an intereſt in the juſtifying righteouſneſs, atoning blood, and living interceſſion of the adorable Redeemer, who is the reſurrection and the life; and to be found faithful in his ſervice at the all-important moment, when we are ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned away to the world of ſpirits? That then, when we are bidding a long and laſt farewell to mortal things, and our eyes are cloſing in death; we may be comforted with the aſſurances of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love;—that while we are paſſing through the ſhades of that dark valley, where nature's light is extinguiſhed; the reviving rays of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory may dawn on our departing ſpirits, and the bright ſcenes of perfect bliſs open to our view.—So ſhall we eſcape the wrath and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which await the wicked; and enter into the joy of our Lord; into the ſublime, perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent joy of heaven, which no time can waſte, nor created power deſtroy.</p>
            <p>This happineſs is reſerved for all the righteous; —of this the departed ſpirits of the juſt already partake.</p>
            <p>On this principle, therefore, we found the laſt article of improvement, we have on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion contemplated to make, of that ſolemn event which this day commands our attention. Let us not indulge hopeleſs grief concerning the pious dead.—'Tis the command of revelation; the reaſon is obvious and concluſive. Was our

beloved Waſhington numbered among the pious, as well as the wiſe, the great, the brave?—of which we are furniſhed with ſo many pleaſing evidences;—And has he died their death?</p>
            <p>Then let us cheerfully ſubmit to the afflicting diſpenſation which has removed him from us; and in the contemplation of his perfect happineſs and endleſs reſt, diveſt our minds of every repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thought; and of every ſenſe of diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage we have ſuſtained by his death.</p>

            <p>At this important period, when the ravages of death, and the revolutions of empire are ended; when the trumpet of the Archangel has ceaſed to ſound, and the conflicting elements are gone to wreck, or have aſſumed a new and heavenly form;—when the tranſactions of judgment are paſt, and the everlaſting ſtates of men are by righteous retribution fixed;—when the grand ſchemes of Providence and Grace ſhall have their completion, and be unfolded;—then will the Divine Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Mercy toward the juſt, even in diſpenſations, which to us are now moſt dark and afflictive, burſt forth, in a flood of light and glory, on our aſtoniſhed and admiring eyes.</p>
