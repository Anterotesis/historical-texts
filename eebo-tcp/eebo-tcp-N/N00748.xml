            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>hfulness of those to whom God hath committed the Sword of Justice; but there are many things of this nature secret, which the method of God in his Judgments seems directly to point at. It is noted among the procuring cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Israels</hi> miseries, 2 <hi>King</hi> 17.9. That the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel did secretly those things that were not right in the sight of the Lord</hi>; probably this may referr to what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we read, in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.24. <hi>There were Sodomites in the land:</hi> However that be, it's certain the Prophets reckon up the sins of Whoredom and Adultery among the black Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of their abominations, and the causes of their calami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

these Ends, it is that many of the Hear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers of the following sollid and seasonable Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered just before the Execution of a person convicted of these horrid sins of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Adultery, have desired the publication of it; to which the Author hath consented, being desirous to further the right Improvement of such a sad Example, to deter others from the like abominations. As for the person Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for these sins, she is an awful instance of the infatuating, hardening and stupifying power of this bruitish Sin of Uncleanness, her love to, &amp; frequent practice of it, having occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her stifling many convictions, &amp; contracted a fearful stupidity and sottishness upon her, near the approaches of death. It is earnestly to be wished, that such Warnings and Examples might not be in vain; that all would so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To conclude therefore, let me perswade all to consider, the heinous nature, and dreadful effects of these sins; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle gives a particular account hereof, 1 Cor. 6.9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Its a sin against a mans own body, it is a defiling of that which should be the temple of God; it is a Sin loathsome in it self, and makes those who are guilty of it, loathsome to God, and to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sins, Prov. 23.27. <hi>A Whore is a deep ditch, and a narrow pit, the abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein.</hi> It is a Sin that dreadfully hardens and besots those who are guilty of it. Prov. 21.9 'tis said of the Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That persons would more carefully avoid the inducements to this Sin which are too common: Such are, over costly, light ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Attire, impudent and immodest cartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, filthy communications, idleness, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by which the body is inflamed, and modesty banished; the command that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the acts of Uncleanness, forbids also the occasions and tendencies to it; and unless there be a tenderness and watchfulness to avoid these, there will be little hopes, that gross pollutions will be avoided. Thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the following Warnings to the Blessing of God, and to the serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Rising Generation.</p>

God is not a man that he should lye, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ither the Son of man that he should repent; hath he said, and shall he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? God that said of old, that he would Chastize, as their Congregation had heard, God who is truth, and cannot lye, who after he had threatned his impenitent people in ancient times for their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy, warned them against flattering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with hopes of impunity, by saying, the Lord have spoken it; this God hath in his Word threatned thus to deal with Unclean Sinners, &amp; commanded them not to deceive themselves with hopes of a less punishment. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. these Exclusions from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, comprehend in them positive punishments, even the punishment of Eternal Damnation. If Sinners hearing the curses and threatnings of Gods Word, embolden themselves with promising themselves happiness, they will find themselves in the issue, separated to all evil. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20. <hi>For heaven and earth shall sooner pass away, than one jot or tittle of Gods word fail of its accomplishment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Because these are Transgressors of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Law of God, and Damnation is one to them on this account. <hi>Rom</hi> 6.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Every Sin is a transgression of the Holy Law of God</hi>; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

are as really due to them, and deserved by them in this their last end, as ever wages were to a man, at the end of his days work. God is neglected &amp; slighted, his holy Law trampled upon, for a little present carnal satisfaction; so that the Justice of God is concerned thus to deal with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because these their sins are of a scarlet and crimson dye, aggravated iniquities filling up the measure of other sins; not barely transgressions and violations of a holy Law of God, but brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his Law, with such aggravations, that ripen for Damnation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Uncleanness is an aggravated iniquity, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up the measure of other sins. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

A Sin that he leaves them to, that he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends good to; these are left of God, to go the way to Hell; and not escaping these sins, they may not think to escape damnation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.5. these expressions that the abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein, plainly intimates, that many previous and foregoing sinful courses, have provoked God to jealousie and hot displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and that he will leave them to this sin, to prepare them for a day of Vengeance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Sin that takes away the heart from God,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000902_0014_0FAC9C2E70250320"/>
and that which is good. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.11. It alienates and estrangeth the heart from God, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commandment; it causeth sinners to disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and slight promises and threatnings; it takes away the heart from thinking, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of God, and his Word, from delighting in God and his Commandments, from contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and studying how to please God, and obey his voice; so that they will not hearken to his voice, they will none of him; when the heart is thus taken off from God, and that which is good, the measure of sin will be filled up apace. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In that they are addicted and accustomed to this Sin, are hardened persons, and seldome truly repent. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.13.23. the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaks of these, as the most impudent and sham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. A Sin that hath ruined and made desolate Nations and Lands, guilty of it: It drowned the Old World; it brought down Fire and Brimstone on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> Gen. 19.13. <hi>Sodom</hi> had many other sins, as Pride, Idleness &amp; Gluttony; but this sin of Uncleanness made it a desolation; and a sin that eternally ruins and undoes the Soul. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.32.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:000902_0015_0FAC9C2EA4480E30"/>2.

That the cry of this sin, pierceth the very heavens, and brings down the Curse of God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.10, 11. he sinned in his wrath against his Brother; he finished that sin, in the murder of him. God admonished and warned him, for his passionateness, and angryness, but when he had committed this sin, saith God, <hi>Thou art cursed from the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Inasmuch as usually they are hardened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods fear, and contemners of God, that are thus guilty. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4 9 he doth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. What great reason Ministers, Parents and Heads of Families, have to warn all under their Charge against, and to restrain them from such sinful practices and courses. These Sins w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I fear the guilt of Innocent Blood lies also upon some that through a greedy desire to get gain, have made drunk the heathen, to the occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quarrels to death among themselves, and ploddings of death to others. Oh consider of the words and truth of God to you this day, and labour to get a pardon for your Blood-guiltiness. Here also is certainly matter of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening to all unclean Sinners, Adulterers or Fornicators: It may be there are not many before God, that have before man been convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Sin of Uncleanness is one great cause why the Land mourns this day, and is a sin for which many will despairngly mourn at last, unless they spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily repent.

Some are ready to say, as <hi>Hazael, are we Doggs, that we should do such things, and yet both do them, and have pleasure in them that do them</hi>: Yea though they know the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God against them who do such things. <hi>Solomons</hi> Wisdom was no preventive; grace it self is no preservative from soul acts of sin; where persons are carnally confident of their own strength. <hi>Peter</hi> after his boasts, is so sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a sorry damsel, that he denies Christ, and Curses and Swears.

causes to such sins; don't come nigh the door of her house, don't be out in evenings, &amp; among foolish vain jolly company, when you should be in your Closets, and on your knees before God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.14, 15. the young man spoken of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.1. <hi>was going the way to her house in the black and dark night</hi>; he is insnared. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.18, 19, 21. beware and take heed of Idleness, as that which will occasion your sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after this sort.

            <p n="4">4. Beware of giving way to other sins against the motions and strivings of Gods Spirit.

faults, if you would not have presumptuous sins have dominion over you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To warn them that have fallen into these sins, not to delay repentance; to beware of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to the continuing of the guilt of these sins upon your Souls, and Consciences. Oh hasten, escape for your lives; fly for refuge to Christ. Look not back, with a desire after them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 You have been antecedently guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other sins, ripening you for these; besides the guilt of these sins, you have the guilt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other.</p>

            <p n="3">3. All your former righteousness, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giousness will be disowned, if you live impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent under these sins. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. &amp; 32 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Remember them against your selves so as to be heartily judging and condemning of your selves for them. If you would not have God to loath you, loath and abhor your selves for your Violations of his holy Law: If you would not have God remember against you former iniquities, you must remember them against your selves. Your iniquities must be before you; and you must be judging your selves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God for them: So did <hi>Ezra, Chap.</hi> 9.15. So did <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 51.3, 4. This we are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled to. 1 Cor. 11.31. Thus did repenting <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Jer. 31.18.</p>

               </gap>ted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Beware that you dont flatter your selves as though you had repented before you have; repentance is not a saying before God with tears, that you are sorry for your transgressions: many turn, but not to the most High.</p>
            <p n="4">4. See that Christ as a Sanctifier and Justifier be sought after by you, in respect of the guilt you lie under: you had need improve Christ as a Justifier, and as an Advocate. Oh! then go to Christ as to him who only can Justify, acquit, and absolve you from the guilt of Sin. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.29. From the consideration of the Power and Dominion of Sin: you have need of Christ as your only Sanctifier. Your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Reformations, Tears, won't Justifie you: Christ must be a Satisfyer for you, or Gods Justice can't be Satisfyed. And you have no way to get power against corruption, but by going to Christ as your Sanctification: Your Vows, Promises, Resolutions, Fastings, won't mortifie and kill any one sin in you; 'tis Christ
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000902_0036_0FAC9C50634E0660"/>
must subdue your Sin in you, and for you.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Improve present influences from the Spirit of God to draw you to Christ. Unless God by his Spirit draw you, you will never come to the Son: the Number of your Sins won't make you go to Christ; the Greatness of your Sins won't make you go to Christ: natural desires of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and escaping Wrath &amp; Hell, won't bring you to Christ; these may cause you to play the Hypocrite, but they won't bring you to Christ: times of common Calamity &amp; Judgment won't drive you to Christ: thoughts and apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Deaths drawing near and just at hand, ready to arrest you, won't prevail with you to go to Christ. You that delay and put off your repentance when God is striving with you, take heed, you can't convert your selves when you will, without Gods Spirit. Look upon this poor object before your eyes, and then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether any, or all the forementioned things, will make you fly to Christ. Improve the Spirit while it is at work on your Souls.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Beware that you don't hearken to vain words and reasonings, tending to the lessening of your guiltiness, and your danger of Gods wrath and Judgment. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.6. Oh! <hi>know that for these things cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of disobedience.</hi> And since the Apostle hath cautioned thus, as to this sin; I would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly warn you, to take heed that you don't
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000902_0037_0FAC9C51286625D8"/>
by vain reasonings prevent your speedy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and turning to God: And shall in a few particulars shew you the Vanity of such reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as have a tendency to extenuate, and lessen your sin and danger, that you may not hearken to them, and deceive your own Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some are ready to reason away apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Divine anger, because 'tis so long since they were guilty of them; if they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted these sins to day, yesterday, or but a few weeks ago; they should be afraid, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get them pardoned: but its so long since, that they have almost forgotten them; and if God had been much provoked he would not have born with them thus long.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Consider.</hi> God remembers them all, as though committed but yesterday: they are seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up among his hid treasures. God said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. <hi>That he can set them in order before the sinners eyes.</hi> God won't only punish for a few of your latter sins only, but for all: If they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted when you were Young, he han't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got them, for he sayes, <hi>He will bring you into Iudgment,</hi> for all your Youthful sins. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 11.9. They that have gone to God aright, have gone for the pardon of former sins; sins of Youth, as well as latter transgressions.</p>
            <p n="2">2 God punisheth some men a long time after they have committed their sins. 'Tis true <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Sentence against an evil work is not speedily
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000902_0038_0FAC9C51E1A9D7F8"/>
executed, that the hearts of the Sons of men are set in them to do evil</hi>; its no argument that you shall escape punishment, because God hath not yet punished you. Though God did not destroy the people in the Wilderness presently, but bore with their evil manners for forty years, yet he wasted that Generation. Hear what God sayes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32. God waited on, and warned his people for twenty three years by his Prophet, and yet after all he destroyed them in his anger. <hi>Ier.</hi> 25.3, 7. <hi>Iude</hi> verse 5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may be you have been under a Judicial process ever since. Sinners are sometimes stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and don't observe the Strokes of God upon them; hear how unobservant they were that had been for so long a time under a course of Judgment. <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.19. compared with 20—24. The Judgments of God are sometimes more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and so more undiscerned; God layes his plagues on some mens Souls, when he layes them on other mens bodies; <hi>He sends leanness into some mens Souls,</hi> when he sends leanness on others Estates. Han't God let you alone and poured upon you a Spirit of deep sleep? given you eyes, that you should not see, nor perceive, nor be converted to this day? To be left of God to go on stupidly in impenitency, is a very great testimony of Divine Wrath. Soul plagues are the forest plagues.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The longer ago your sins were committed,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000902_0039_0FAC9C52A2EFB9C0"/>
the more hazardous your unconcernedness about repenting of them, &amp; getting a Pardon of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God wont be patient alwayes, though he is sometimes long suffering: if he waites on Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners till they bring forth briers and thornes, he would have them know, <hi>they are nigh to Cursing.</hi> Yea, such as are impenitent after much long suffering, may fear that <hi>they are Vessels fitted to destruction. Rom.</hi> 9.22. God sayes, <hi>I come three years looking for fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t, and find none, cut it down why cumbereth it the ground.</hi> Luk. 13.7. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Some are ready to argue that their sins are but little; if they had been left to gross acts of Fornication or Adultery, they acknowledge they should have had need to have hastened to Chrst for a pardon; but they were only guilty of some wanton dalliances, therefore they don't think God is very angry with them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though some sins comparatively consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are little, yet no sins absolutely considered are little and small, because against an Infinite God, and Violations and Transgressions of his holy Laws, and Commands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such little sins, if your Consciences were awakened and enlightned would fill you with great perplexity, and distress: As long as the commandment did not come, with Convictions of its exactness, and spirituality on <hi>Pauls</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he was <hi>alive</hi> and could do well enough; but when such an exposition, as Christ put upon
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000902_0040_0FAC9C5362907AF0"/>
the Commandment came, <hi>sin revived, and he dyed</hi>; he was slain, and could justifie himself no longer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God finds stubbornness &amp; rebellion which are as that Sin of Witchraft, where Sinners can see only humane frailty and sins of Infirmity. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. <hi>Saul</hi> saith, he had obeyed, then he had a good end in varying from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or the people are to blame, but God tells him of rebellion and stubbornness which were to him as Witchcraft and Idolatry: God tells him that he had in so doing rejected the Word of the Lord. Christ tells us, <hi>he that looks upon a Woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her in his heart.</hi> Hear what account God makes of that which you call a look, a cast of the eye, a little thing. <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.16, 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The more madness to break with God, and expose your Souls to Hell Torment for these things, that had but a little of pleasure to entice. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.19.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Little Sins make way for greater. One Sin allowed, stupifies and makes way for great ones; the greatest Sinner began with that which you call little. <hi>Eve</hi> first saw that the tree was good: <hi>Cain</hi> was first wroth with <hi>Abel,</hi> and then slew him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some are arguing thus; God is long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and patient; no hazzard of present dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11.8. If God strike Sinners dead
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000902_0041_0FAC9C542321D5E0"/>
presently, they should be afraid to put off Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pentance; but God waits and forbears; he waited long on the Old World, on <hi>Sodom,</hi> on many wicked men of old; they don't doubt but God will yet wait on them, they see no appearance of wrath as yet: to this, Consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is not this to despise the riches of Gods Grace and Patience, <hi>to the treasuring up wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2.4, 5. can't you be content without a treasure of wrath? that you can find in your heart thus to delay Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God did not exercise any patience towards the Fallen Angels, and he is under no obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to exercise any towards you. <hi>Iude</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. What reason can you give why God should wait any longer on you? can you do him more Services? God is very arbitrary in his waiting, longer or shorter on Sinners.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God doth not ordinarily wait so long on Gospel Sinners. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.28 no Sinners ripen sooner for cutting down in vengeance than Gospel Sinners. God makes very quick work with some. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. how quick and sudden was God with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi>?</p>
            <p n="4">4. God threatens to make quick work with them that harden themselves in Sins, in hopes of long-suffering. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.27, 28. So that you have no security in putting off repentance; its very hazzardous.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:000902_0042_0FAC9C54E220B5A8"/>4. Some will reason thus with themselves. God is very gracious and merciful, and pardons great Sins, and Sinners. God pardoned <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seh,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and other great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: If God had not proclaimed his Name to be gracious and merciful, <hi>slow to anger, &amp; forgiving Iniquity, Transgression and Sin,</hi> they should be afraid of delaying repentance; but inasmuch as God is so very merciful, they hope it will be no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard thing to perswade him to pardon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. To this consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he is a just and righteous God too, and pardons no Sinners but such as are penitent; it's true, God gives great Sinners encouragement to turn to him; and upon their repentance, <hi>he will forgive their iniquities, yea multiply to pardon</hi>; but remember he is a just God too; when he proclaims his Name with so much encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to repenting Sinners, he subjoyns that he will not at all acquit the guilty. <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.3. as merciful as God is, he will not shew mercy and grace to the wronging and injuring of his Justice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You take a course to be shut out of all mercy, and to have God appear shutting up all bowels, and pitty from you. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. Such reasonings are to be abominated. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you turn the grace of God to wantonness; when you improve it to encourage you on in ways of sin and rebellion.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:000902_0043_0FAC9C55A66CFD88"/>5. Some plead for themselves, that they are weak and ignorant; God hath not given them muck knowledge as others; wherefore their sin is not so provoking to God, as the sins of them that have more knowledge; they hope God will pity their weakness, and not be so very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere with them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One sin won't excuse you for another; a gracious act presently after a sinful one, will not excuse you before God; surely the pleading of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat which is a sin, will be no security for a sin. It's true, the more any sin against knowledge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he more aggravated is their sin; but ignorance is no defence against Gods anger; especially in such as you that have had your Education in <hi>New-England,</hi> under the plain convincing preaching of the Gospel. You must of necessity have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to attend to the Word preached, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ignorant, as to the plain principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; you must have set at nought Gods Counsels, and closed and shut your own eyes. What excuse will it be for you? if you are willingly ignorant; you did not see, because you shut your eyes, and would not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You know that such and such courses that you allow you selves in, are sins; and so your sins are not from weakness, but wilfulness. You know that Whoredom is a sin; that prophaning Gods Sabbaths is a sin, that Unbelief is a sin. You can't plead ignorance here.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:000902_0044_0FAC9C5661BB0668"/>3. God hath declared that your ignorance &amp; weakness shall be no expiation of his wrath? <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.11. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.6.</p>
            <p n="6">6. You say, you don't make such a profession of Godliness as some others do; if you made a very great profession, and did such things, you are ready to think, God would be very angry; you do therefore condemn lesser evils in Church members, and admire how they can be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sin will damn them that don't make a profession, as well as others. God will damn Heathen for their Impenitency, as well as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You do so far make a profession, that your sin will be aggravated. You pray in your Families, come and joyn in prayer, and hearing the Word of God. You do many things, tho' not all commanded Duties; you profess so high, that your sin will cast you down as low as Hell, if you repent not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By these things you incapacitate your selves from making a suitable profession. Will saying that you lived in sins and wickedness, that rendered you unfit for respecting all Gods Commandments, prevent <hi>your being beaten with many stripes? Luk.</hi> 12.47.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Some will say, that its not in their power to change their own hearts, and withstand temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: If they had sinned after such a sort, &amp;
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000902_0045_0FAC9C572207BF08"/>
had a power to have resisted temptations; they think God would have been very severe, but they can't change their own hearts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because you can't do that which is not your work, and what you can't, won't you do what is your duty, and what you can? though you can't change your hearts, you can reform your life. Many that have no principle of grace, reform their lives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis in your power not to run your selves into temptations, as you often do; you may as well on an evening, go into your Closet, and confess your sin, as go into bad company, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad places.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis your sin and madness then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God not to help you. Can't you repent of your selves? and will you run away from God, who only can? Will you sin away his help from you? He bids you turn, and he will pour out his Spirit: if you turn from him, and will not cherish the motions of his Spirit, you take a course to dye in your sins.</p>
            <p n="8">8. 'Tis your grief and sorrow that you do sin. If you were not affected and sinned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remorse, you conclude, God would say, <hi>shall not my Soul be avenged on such a Sinner</hi>? But you are sorry, you confess your sins with tears; you can say you are grieved at heart for your sins, you hope God will not be so exact with you.</p>

Some are grieved and sorrowful, but 'tis for the shame and punishment of their sins: they acted as though they had no shame in them, when their sins were hid from man, but when men know of them, they grieve and are sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Shame and fear of punishment, not the Violation of Gods law is the moving cause of some men and womens grief and sorrow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your grief and sorrow won't quench hell fire, nor wash away the stain of sin. If you cry night and day, and weep never so much; yea, you cover the Altar in this sense with tears, God won't regard: these are not the blood of Christ, <hi>which only cleanseth from iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Your sorrow and grief are but flattery &amp; dissimulation, so long as you take no heed to reform. You read of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that they appeared to men to be sorrowful: yea of those whose <hi>Fasts God abhorred,</hi> though they made a very plausible show of sorrow, because they did not reform sayes God, <hi>Will you call this a fast? and an acceptable day to the Lord?</hi> Isa. 58<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>3—8.</p>
            <p n="9">9. You say, you were sollicited, drawn in, and over perswaded by others to these sins; if you had enticed others, you had been very much to blame; but for your part you had no intention, not a thought in your heart to do such wickedness; but others would give you no quiet till you make one with them, and so you impute it to your being good natured
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:000902_0047_0FAC9C58A2515EB0"/>
and willing to gratifie others, rather than to the enmity of your heart against God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Could they that enticed you, do as much for you, or against you, as God could? Surely if you use this reasoning to be looked upon to be good natured persons, you lay your selves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to a just Censure for folly: Who that is wise will despise God, to please man?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you are so good natured, why don't you yield to God in his beseechings and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? you are stubborn, wilful and stout enough here: How earnestly hath God invited you to come to him? he hath not failed in giving you suitable and proper encouragements; God hath stood long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Others could not make you yield, if Sin within did not entice you, to a giving a consent. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.14. the Devil himself han't a power to make you yield; it may be you say, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seems to carry it in the favour of the young man, spoken of, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.21. <hi>that she forced him.</hi> To that I say; you would do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the Scripture relates it, as preparing him for such wickedness, and how fully he yielded; 'tis said, <hi>he was one void of understanding,</hi> one that had refused Christ as his Prophet, that would not come to him for <hi>Eye salve,</hi> and that he was out of his place, and idling away his time, seeking occasions of Sin; <hi>he was passing

through the Street, near her corner, and he went the way to her house</hi>; and then that he goes after her straightway, or suddenly as it may be rendred; she did not pull and drag him along, not forcibly drive him; but he comes after, not make a stand, a stop, or turn back; but goes after her straightway, and perseveres in the Sin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That God doth strike dead even such as these. <hi>Prov</hi> 7.23. God don't only take Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on them that entice, but on them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="10">10. You say the days are such days of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy, and the times so degenerate, that you should be a meer laughing stock if you did not sin; you are ready <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Better Sinners laugh at you here, than God laugh at you for ever. <hi>God will be ashamed of them that are ashamed of Him, before an Adulterous

It would be no damage but a benefit to get rid of such Company, whose favour you think to lose The Psalmist says, <hi>Depart from me you wicked men, I will keep the commands of my God.

            <p n="4">4. It may be your Conversion might be an occasion, not only of the Reformation, but sound Conversion of many others.

You would not hearken to the voice of your eminently pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father in law, warning of you.

Its true, if you refuse the calls of Christ in this life, he will call you in the next life to be punished, and condemned. Oh!

Come to him for that which he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World for, to be your Sanctifier; to have Sin taken away; that he would give you repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Christ is Exalted at the right hand of the Father, to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins. God hath sent him to bless his people in turning them from their iniquities.</hi> His Name is <hi>IESUS,</hi> and he will Save them that come unto him from their sins. You want Christ for this, how can you else think of going into the holy Heavens? <hi>Nothing that defiles enters there: Without Holiness you can't see God.</hi> Oh! then let that be upon your Soul, to have Christ for Sanctification.</p>

have now done something to turn away thine anger, and to procure thy favour. See what he sayes. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.18, 19, 21. And yet see what wellcome he met with. <hi>Verse</hi> 22. And don't you think to go because you have sorrowed, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and kept from Sinful courses. See how <hi>David</hi> went to God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.3, 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Come as a helpless, shiftless, lost Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Oh! Consider <hi>that in him the Fatherless findeth Mercy:</hi> As one that must have all from Christ. Oh! go to him as one that is lost, and knows not what to do of your self. <hi>Christ came to seek and save the lost.</hi>

just going out of the world. Oh consider, that you may Serve Christ, in making confession of you sin, warning of others, justifying God; oh come away, consider that Christ will call to you from off the Mercy Seat no more after a few hours; if you refuse now, how will you dare to make your appearance before the Throne of Justice? If you are afraid to come to Christ so affectionately calling you to come to him, where he is Sitting on his Throne of Mercy, &amp; holding forth the Scepter of Divine Grace? Oh! Come; behold now, even now, is yet an accepted time. Come, and give your self to Jesus Christ. Oh! Lift up your heart to God, to draw you, to turn you; and we will lift up our hearts and desires to God with you, and for you, that he would draw and turn you.</p>
