            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

It ſtood for trial upon a former day; but it happening, as it frequently does, without any imputation to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen named in the pannel, that a ſufficient number did not appear to conſtitute a full Special Jury, I thought it my duty to withdraw the cauſe from trial, till I could have the opportunity which is now open to me of addreſſing myſelf to you, who were originally appointed to try it. I purſued this courſe, however, from no jealouſy of the Common Juries, appointed by the laws for the ordinary ſervice of the Court, ſince my whole life has been one continued experience of their virtues; but becauſe I thought it of great importance, that thoſe, who were to decide upon a cauſe ſo very momentous to the public, ſhould have the higheſt poſſible qualifications for the deciſion. That they ſhould not only be men capable, from their education, of forming an enlightened judgment, but that their ſituations ſhould be ſuch as to bring them within the full view of their enlightened Country, to which, in character and in eſtimation, they were in their own turns to be reſponſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:032092_0004_0FF11ADC0B74F3F0"/>Not having the honour, Gentlemen, to be ſworn for the King, as one of his Counſel, it has fallen much oftener to my lot to defend indictments for libels, than to aſſiſt in the proſecution of them. But I feel no embarraſſment from that recollection; ſince I ſhall not be found to-day to expreſs a ſentiment, or to utter an expreſſion, inconſiſtent with thoſe invaluable principles for which I have uniformly contended in the defence of others. Nothing that I have ever ſaid, either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſionally or perſonally, for the Liberty of the Preſs, do I mean to deny, to contradict, or counteract. On the contrary, I deſire to preface the diſcourſe I have to make to you with reminding you, that it is your moſt ſolemn duty to take care it ſuffers no injury in your hands. A free and unlicenſed preſs <hi>(in the juſt and legal ſenſe of the expreſſion)</hi> has led to all the bleſſings, both of Religion and Government, which Great Britain, or any part of the world, at this moment enjoys, and is calculated ſtill farther to advance mankind to higher degrees of civilization and happineſs. But this freedom, like every other muſt be limited to be enjoyed, and, like every human advantage, may be defeated by its abuſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the defendant ſtands indicted for having publiſhed this book, which I have only read from the obligations of profeſſional duty, and which I roſe, from the reading of, with aſtoniſhment and diſguſt. Standing here, with all the privileges belonging to the higheſt Council for the Crown, I ſhall be entitled to reply to any defence that ſhall be made for the publication. I ſhall wait with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience till I hear it. Indeed, if I were to anticipate the defence which I hear and read of, it would be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aming, by anticipation, the learned Counſel who is to make it. For, if I am to collect it, even from a formal notice given to the proſecutors in the courſe of the proceedings, I have to expect, that, inſtead of a defence conducted according to the rules and principles of Engliſh law and juſtice, the foundation of all our laws, and the ſanctions of all our juſtice, are to be ſtruck at and inſulted—What is the force of that juriſdiction which enables the Court to ſit in judgment?—What but the Oath which his Lordſhip, as well as yourſelves, have ſworn upon the Goſpel to fulfil. Yet in the King's Court, where his Majeſty is himſelf alſo ſworn to adminiſter the juſtice of England, in the King's Court, who receives his high authority under a ſolemn Oath to maintain the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> as it is promulgated by God in the Holy Scriptures, I am nevertheleſs called upon, as Counſel for the proſecution, to produce a certain book deſcribed in the indictment to be the Holy Bible. No man deſerves to be upon the Rolls of the Court, who dares, as an Attorney, to put his name to ſuch a notice. It is an inſult to the authority and dignity of the Court of which he is an officer; ſince it ſeems to call in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the very foundations of its juriſdiction. If this is to be the ſpirit and temper of the defence; if, as I collect from that array of books which are ſpread upon the benches behind me, this publication is to be vindicated by an attack of all the truths which the Chriſtian Religion promulgates to mankind, let it be remembered that ſuch an argument was neither ſuggeſted nor juſtified by any thing ſaid by me on the part of the proſecution. <hi>In this ſtage of the proceedings,</hi> I ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032092_0005_0FF11ADE02F98538"/>
call for reverence to the ſacred Scriptures, not from their merits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded as they are, but from their authority in a Chriſtian Country; not from the obligations of Conſcience, but from the rules of Law. For my own part, Gentlemen, I have been ever deeply devoted to the truths of Chriſtianity, and my firm belief in the Holy Goſpel is by no means owing to the prejudices of education (though I was religiouſly educated by the beſt of parents), but ariſes from the fulleſt and moſt continued reflections of my riper years and underſtanding. It forms at this moment, the great conſolation of a life, which, as a ſhadow, muſt paſs away; and, without it, indeed, I ſhould conſider my long courſe of health and proſperity (perhaps too long and uninterrupted to be good for any man) only as the duſt which the wind ſcatters, and rather as a ſnare than as a bleſſing. Much, however, as I wiſh to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the authority of Scripture, from a reaſoned conſideration of it, I ſhall repreſs that ſubject for the preſent. But, if the defence ſhall be as I have ſuſpected, to bring them at all into argument or queſtion, I ſhall then fulfil a duty which I owe not only to the Court, as Counſel for the Proſecution, but to the Public, to ſtate what I feel and know concerning the evidences of that Religion which is reviled without being examined, and denied without being underſtood.</p>
               <p>I am well aware that by the communications of a Free Preſs, all the errors of mankind, from age to age, have been diſſipated and diſpelled, and I recollect that the world, under the banners of <hi>reformed</hi> Chriſtianity, has ſtruggled through perſecution to the noble eminence on which it ſtands at this moment, ſhedding the bleſſings of Humanity and Science upon the nations of the earth. It may be aſked, by what means the Reformation would have been effected, if the books of the Reformers had been ſuppreſſed, and the errors of condemned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded ſuperſtitions had been ſupported as unqueſtionable by the State, founded upon thoſe very ſuperſtitions formerly, as it is at preſent upon the doctrines of the Eſtabliſhed Church? Or how, upon ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, any reformation, civil or religious, can in future be effected?— The ſolution is eaſy—Let us examine what are the genuine principles of the Liberty of the Preſs, as they regard writings upon general ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, unconnected with the perſonal reputations of private men, which are wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>y foreign to the preſent inquiry. They are full of ſimplicity, and are brought as near perfection, by the Law of England, as perhaps is conſiſtent with any of the frail inſtitutions of mankind.</p>
               <p>Although every community muſt eſtabliſh ſupreme authorities, founded upon fixed principles, and muſt give high powers to Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates to adminiſter laws for the preſervation of the Government itſelf, and for the ſecurity of thoſe who are to be protected by it; yet, as infallibility and perfection belong neither to human eſtabliſhments, nor to human individuals, it ought to be the policy of all free eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as it is moſt peculiarly the principle of our own Conſtitution, to permit the moſt unbounded freedom of diſcuſſion, even by detecting errors in the Conſtitution or Adminiſtration of the very Government itſelf, ſo as that decorum is obſerved, which every State muſt exact from its ſubjects, and which impoſes no reſtraint upon any intellectual compoſition, fairly, honeſtly, and decently, addreſſed to the conſciences
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032092_0006_0FF11AE075647CD0"/>
and underſtanding of men. Upon this principle, I have an unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable right (a right which the beſt ſubjects have exerciſed) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the principles and ſtructure of the Conſtitution, and, by fair manly reaſoning, to queſtion the practice of its adminiſtrators. I have a right to conſider and to point out errors in the one or in the other; and not merely to reaſon upon their exiſtence, but to conſider the means of their reformation. By ſuch free, well-intentioned, modeſt, and dignified communication of ſentiments and opinions, all nations have been gradually improved, and milder laws and pure religions have been eſtabliſhed. The ſame principles, which vindicate civil conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions honeſtly directed, extend their protection to the ſharpeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies on religious faiths. This rational and legal courſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement was recognized and ratified by Lord Kenyon, as the Law of England, in a late trial at Guildhall, when he looked back with gratitude to the labours of the Reformers, as the fountains of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious emancipation, and of the civil bleſſings that followed in their train. The Engliſh Conſtitution, indeed, does not ſtop ſhort in the toleration of religious <hi>opinions,</hi> but liberally extends it to <hi>practice.</hi> It permits every man, EVEN PUBLICLY, to worſhip God according to his own conſcience, though in marked diſſent from the national Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, ſo as he profeſſes <hi>the general Faith,</hi> which is the ſanction of all our moral duties, and the only pledge of our ſubmiſſion to the ſyſtem which conſtitutes a State. Is not this ſyſtem of freedom of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, and freedom of worſhip, ſufficient for all the purpoſes of human happineſs and improvement?—And will it be neceſſary to either, that the Law ſhould hold out indemnity to thoſe who wholly abjure and revile the Government of their Country, or the Religion on which it reſts for its foundation?</p>
               <p>I expect to hear, in anſwer to what I am now ſaying, much that will offend me. My learned Friend, from the difficulties of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I know, from experience, how to feel for very ſincerely, may be driven to advance propoſitions which it may be my duty with much freedom, to reply to; and the Law will ſanction that freedom. But will not the ends of Juſtice be completely anſwered by that right, to point out the errors of his diſcourſe in terms that are decent and calculated to expoſe its defects; or will any argument ſuffer, or will public juſtice be impeded, becauſe neither private honour and juſtice, nor public decorum, would endure my telling my very learned Friend, that he was a fool, a liar, and a ſcoundrel, in the face of the Court, becauſe I differed from him in argument or opinion? This is juſt the diſtinction between a book of free legal controverſy, and the book which I am arraigning before you. Every man has a legal right to inveſtigate, <hi>with modeſty and decency,</hi> controverſial points of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion; but, no man, conſiſtently with a law, which only exiſts under its ſanctions, has a right not only broadly to deny its very exiſtence, but to pour forth a ſhocking and inſulting invective, which the loweſt eſtabliſhments, in the gradati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

merely in its abſtract theory, but in its daily and moſt applauded practice.—The intercourſe between the ſexes, and which, properly regulated, not only continues, but humanizes and adorns our natures, is the foundation of all the thouſand romances, plays and novels, which are in the hands of every body. Some of them lead to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every virtuous principle; others, though with the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, addreſs the imagination in a manner to lead the paſſions into dangerous exceſſes. But, though the Law does not nicely diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the various ſhades which diſtinguiſh theſe works from one another, ſo as that it ſuffers many to paſs, through its liberal ſpirit, that upon principle might be ſuppreſſed, would it or does it tolerate, or does any decent man contend that it ought to paſs by unpuniſhed, libels of the moſt ſhameleſs obſcenity, manifeſtly pointed to debauch innocence, and to blaſt and poiſon the morals of the riſing generation?—This is only another illuſtration to demonſtrate the obvious diſtinction between the works of an author, who fairly exerciſes the powers of his mind, in inveſtigating doctrinal points in the religion of any country, and him who attacks the rational exiſtence of every religion, and brands with abſurdity and folly the ſtate which ſanctions, and the obedient tools who cheriſh, the deluſion. But this publication appears to me to be as miſchievous and cruel in its probable effects, as it is manifeſtly illegal in its principles; becauſe it ſtrikes at the beſt, ſometimes, alas! the only refuge, and conſolation amidſt the diſtreſſes and afflictions of the world. The poor and humble, whom it affects to pity, may be ſtabbed to the heart by it. They have more occaſion for firm hopes beyond the grave, than thoſe who have greater comforts to render life delightful. I can conceive a diſtreſſed, but virtuous, man, ſurrounded by children, looking up to him for bread when he has none to give them, ſinking under the laſt day's labour, and unequal to the next, yet ſtill looking up with confidence to the hour when all tears ſhall be wiped from the eyes of affliction, bearing the burden laid upon him by a myſterious Providence which he adores, and looking forward with exultation to the <hi>revealed</hi> promiſes of his Creator, when he ſhall be greater than the greateſt, and happier than the happieſt of mankind. What a change in ſuch a mind might be wrought by ſuch a mercileſs publication?— Gentlemen, whether theſe remarks are the over-charged declamations of an accuſing Counſel, or the juſt reflections of a man anxious for the public freedom, which is beſt ſecured by the morals of a nation, will be beſt ſettled by an appeal to the paſſages in the work, that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the indictment for your conſideration and judgment. You are at liberty to connect them with every context and ſequel, and to beſtow upon them the mildeſt interpretation—[<hi>Here Mr. Erſkine read and commented upon ſeveral of the ſelected paſſages, and then proceeded as follows:</hi>]</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it would be uſeleſs and diſguſting to enumerate the other paſſages within the ſcope of the indictment. How any man can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally vindicate the publication of ſuch a book, in a country where the Chriſtian Religion is the very foundation of the law of the land, I am totally at a loſs to conceive, and have no ideas for the diſcuſſion of!

belief and practice of what is denied as falſehood, and reprobated as impiety, to deal with ſuch an anomolous defence? Upon what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is it even offered to the Court, whoſe authority is contemned and mocked at? If the Religion, propoſed to be called in queſtion, is not previouſly adopted in belief, and ſolemnly acted upon, what authority has the Court to paſs any judgment at all of acquittal or condemnation? Why am I now, or upon any other occaſion, to ſubmit to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's authority? Why am I now, or at any time, to addreſs twelve of my equals, as I am now addreſſing you, with reverence and ſubmiſſion? Under what ſanction are the witneſſes to give their evidence, without which there can be no trial? Under what obligations can I call upon you, the jury, repreſenting your country, to adminiſter juſtice?— Surely upon no other than that you are ſworn to adminiſter it under the oaths you have taken. The whole judicial fabric, from the King's ſovereign authority to the loweſt office of magiſtracy, has no other foundation. The whole is built, both in form and ſubſtance, upon the ſame oath of every one of its miniſters, to do juſtice, "AS GOD SHALL HELP THEM HEREAFTER."—What God? and what hereafter? That God, undoubtedly, who has commanded Kings to rule, and judges to decree with juſtice; who has ſaid to witneſſes, not by the voice of Nature, but in <hi>revealed</hi> Commandments, "THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE TESTIMONY AGAINST THY NEIGHBOUR;" and who has enforced obedience to them by the revelation of the unutterable bleſſings which ſhall attend their obſervances, and the awful puniſhments which ſhall await upon their tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>"But it ſeems this courſe of reaſon, and the time and the perſon are at laſt arrived, that are to diſſipate the errors which have overſpread the paſt generations of ignorance!—The believers in Chriſtianity are many, but it belongs to the few that are wiſe to correct their credulity! Belief is an act of reaſon; and ſuperior reaſon may therefore dictate to the weak.—In running the mind along the long liſt of ſincere and devout Chriſtians, I cannot help lamenting that Newton had not lived to this day, to have had his ſhallowneſs filled up with this new flood of light.—But the ſubject is too awful for irony.

But this extraordinary man, in the mighty reach of his mind, overlooked, perhaps, the errors, which a minuter inveſtigation of the created things on this earth might have taught him, of the eſſence of his Creator. What ſhall then be ſaid of the great Mr. Boyle, who looked into the organic ſtructure of all matter, even to the brute inanimate ſubſtances which the foot treads on. Such a man may be ſuppoſed to have been equally qualified with Mr. Paine, to "look through Nature, up to Nature's God." Yet

               <p>Againſt all this concurring teſtimony, we find ſuddenly, from Mr. Paine, that the Bible teaches nothing but "lies, obſcenity, cruelty, and injuſtice."

               <p>Gentlemen, there is but one conſideration more, which I cannot poſſibly omit, becauſe I confeſs it affects me very deeply. Mr. Paine has written largely on public Liberty and Government; and his laſt performance has, on that account, been more widely circulated, and principally among thoſe who attached themſelves from principle to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032092_0011_0FF11AEC81B38C00"/>
his former works. This circumſtance renders a public attack upon <hi>all revealed</hi> Religion, from ſuch a writer, infinitely more dangerous. The religious and moral ſenſe of the people of Great-Britain, is the great anchor which alone can hold the veſſel of the State amidſt the ſtorms which agitate the world: and if I could believe, for a moment, that the maſs of the people were to be debauched from the principles of Religion, which forms the true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of that humanity, charity, and benevolence, that has been ſo long the national characteriſtic, inſtead of mixing myſelf, as I ſometimes have done, in political reformations, I would rather retire to the uttermoſt corners of the earth to avoid their agitation; and would bear not only the imperfections and abuſes complained of in our own wiſe eſtabliſhment, but even the worſt government that ever exiſted in the world, rather than go to the work of reformation with a multitude ſet free from all the charities of Chriſtianity, who had no ſenſe of God's exiſtence but from Mr. Paine's Obſervation of Nature, which the maſs of mankind have no leiſure to contemplate; nor any belief of future rewards and puniſhments to animate the good in the glorious purſuit of human happineſs, nor to deter the wicked from deſtroying it even in its birth. But I know the people of England better. They are a religious people; and, with the bleſſing of God, as far as it is in my power, I will lend my aid to keep them ſo. I have no objections to the freeſt and moſt extended diſcuſſions upon doctrinal points of the Chriſtian Religion; and, <hi>though the law of England does not permit it,</hi> I do not dread the reaſoned argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Deiſts againſt the exiſtence of Chriſtianity itſelf, becauſe, as was ſaid by its Divine Author, if it is of God, it will ſtand. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual book, however erroneous, addreſſed to the intellectual world upon ſo profound and complicated a ſubject, can never work the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which this indictment is calculated to repreſs. Such works will only employ the minds of men enlightened by ſtudy to a deeper inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation of a ſubject well worthy of their deepeſt and continued contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. The powers of the mind are given for human improvement in the progreſs of human exiſtence. The changes produced by ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocations of lights and intelligences are certain in their progreſſions, and make their way imperceptibly, as conviction comes upon the world, by the final and irreſiſtible power of truth. If Chriſtianity be ſounded in falſehood, let us become Deiſts in this manner, and I am contented. But this book hath no ſuch object and no ſuch capacity; it preſents no arguments to the wiſe and enlightened. On the contrary, it treats the faith and opinions of the wiſeſt with the moſt ſhocking contempt, and ſtirs up men without the advantages of learning or ſober thinking to a total diſbelief of every thing hitherto held ſacred, and, conſequently, to a rejection of all the laws and ordinances of the State, which ſtand only upon the aſſumption of their truth.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I cannot conclude without expreſſing the deepeſt regret at all attacks upon the Chriſtian Religion by authors who profeſs to promote the civil liberties of the world. For, under what other auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices than Chriſtianity have the loſt and ſubverted liberties of mankind in former ages been re-aſſerted?—By what zeal, but the warm z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Each generation of mankind can ſee but a few revolving links of this mighty and myſterious chain; but, by doing our ſeveral duties in our allotted ſtations, we are ſure that we are fulfilling the purpoſes of our exiſtence—YOU, I truſt, will fulfil yours this day!</p>

            <p>A Mr. Fleming, one of the Clerks of the Bank, was the only wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs called on the part of the proſecution. He ſaid he purchaſed the book in queſtion of the Defendant, at his ſhop, on the 7th of February laſt.</p>
            <p>The NOTICE, which Mr. Erſkine mentioned in his ſpeech was here read, and Mr. John Martin, the Attorney for the Defendant, readily admitted that he had ſent it thoſe who were concerned for the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>Mr Kyd made a very ingenious ſpeech for the Defendant. He ſaid he would endeavour to diſcharge the duty which he owed to his client, in a manner that was conſiſtent with the dignity of that Court, and with that decency and ſolemnity which he felt belonged to the ſubject. The queſtion was, Whether the Author, when he wrote this book, felt as he wrote, and expreſſed himſelf as he felt?—He humbly ſubmitted, that the inferences, which Mr. Paine had drawn from the premiſes, were ſuch as he might have drawn with a fair and honeſt intention. Whether thoſe inferences were juſt or not was a totally different queſtion. But, if his Lordſhip and the Gentlemen of the Jury could diſcover no wicked or malicious intent, they would not puniſh a man for a mere error in judgment. If the Jury could collect no wicked intention in the author from reading the whole of this performance, he contended he was completely protected under the right which he and every other man had to exerciſe the powers of his mind in diſcuſſing any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſial points of religion. Suppoſing then the book had been written innocently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he might infer, as a general propoſition, that it was alſo publiſhed with an innocent intention. At the ſame time he admitted, that what was ſo written might be publiſhed from a malicious motive, for which the publiſher would be amenable to the laws of his country. The learned Counſel next ſelected ſeveral paſſages from this perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, to ſhew, that the Author felt the moſt profound reverence and veneration for the Supreme Being, and denied the truth of Revelation only becauſe he could not reconcile it to the character and attributes of the Deity. It was ſtated in that publication, that the law of Nature was engraven on every man's heart, and that he might clearly collect the knowledge of that duty which he owed to his Creator from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of his works. M. Kyd next endeavoured to juſtify the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032092_0013_0FF11AF2505215D8"/>
charges made upon the Bible by the Author by a variety of paſſages which he ſelected, but which at the deſire of his Lordſhip and the Jury, he did not read, but only referred to them, and contended, that if theſe paſſages were found in any other book they would be conſidered as indecent and immoral. He appealed to the writings of Dr. Lardner, Dr. Bently, and other eminent Divines, in ſupport of the right of free diſcuſſion upon all ſubjects of a controverſial nature. He then ſpoke in ſevere terms of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> proſecution, which, he ſaid, would never have been inſtituted had it not been for Biſhop WATSON'S APOLOGY, which had been very widely circulated, and had excited a curioſity to read the book to which it was an anſwer; and to gratify that public curioſity it was, that this book, which he believed had been firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at Paris, was afterwards publiſhed in this country. Mr. Kyd inſiſted, at great length, upon the freedom of inquiry and a free preſs, and gave the Reformation and Revolution as two inſtances of the ineſtimable bleſſings which had reſulted from them to this country.</p>
            <p>Mr. Erſkine made a moſt eloquent reply. He ſaid, he was bound in reſpect to his Learned Friend, as a member of a moſt honourable pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He could not therefore help con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering him as entitled to a conſiderable degree of indulgence. Mr. Erſkine here adver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed to ſeveral of the paſſages ſelected from the Old Teſtament by Mr. Kyd, and explained the reaſon of their introduction into the ſacred Writings. The hiſtory of man, he ſaid, was the hiſtory of man's vices and paſſions, which could not be cenſured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adverting to their exiſtence; and many of the inſtances that had been referred to were recorded as memorable warnings and examples for the inſtruction of mankind. Mr. E. next entered moſt forcibly and deeply into the evidences of Chriſtianity, particularly thoſe that were founded on that <hi>ſtupendous</hi> ſcheme of Prophecy, which formed one of the moſt unanſwerable arguments for the truth of the Chriſtian religion. "It was not," he ſaid, "the purpoſe of God to deſtroy free agency by overpowering the human mind with the irreſiſtible light and conviction of Revelation, but to leave men to collect its truths, as they were gradually illuſtrated in the accompliſhment of the divine promiſes of the Goſpel." Bred, as he was, to the conſideration of evidence, he declared he conſidered the prophecy concerning the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of the Jewiſh nation, if there was nothing elſe to ſupport Chriſtianity, abſolutely irreſiſtible. The diviſion of the Jews into tribes, to preſerve the genealogy of Chriſt; the diſtinction of the tribe of Judah, from which he was to come; the loſs of that diſtinction when that end was accompliſhed; the predicted departure of the ſceptre from Iſrael; the deſtruction of the Temple of Jeruſalem, which imperial munificence in vain attempted to rebuild to diſgrace the prophecy; the diſperſion of this nation over the face of the whole earth; the ſpreading of the Goſpel throughout the world; the perſecutions of its true Miniſters; and the foretold ſuperſtitions which for ages had defiled its worſhip;—theſe were topics upon which Mr. Erſkine expatiated with

great eloquence, and produced a moſt powerful effect upon every part of the audience. He concluded with a vindication of the authors of this proſecution. He ſaid, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Gentlemen, before you proceed to decide on the merits of this or any other cauſe, it is proper to ſee whether the parties litigating ſtand in a fair light before you. I was extremely hurt when the learned Counſel for the Defendant thought fit to ſtate to you, with very conſiderable emphaſis, and a very determined tone of voice, that, this was a ſcandalous proſecution. I cannot help wiſhing that ſentence had not been uttered. Who commenced this proſecution I certainly know not. But from what fell from the very learned Counſel who has juſt ſat down, I am inclined to ſuppoſe it proceeded from a Society of Gentlemen, inſtituted for the moſt important of all purpoſes, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the morals of the people; a ſociety compoſed of Clergymen and Laymen of the moſt reſpectable character in the kingdom, who, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the country is overrun with profligacy and wickedneſs, which boldly raiſe their heads in defiance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to publiſh their apologies for the doctrines they had embraced. In what manner they did that, and whether they had the advantage of their adverſaries, or ſunk under the ſuperiority of their arguments, mankind for near two thouſand years have had an opportunity of judging. They have ſeen what Julian, Juſtin Martyr, and other Apologiſts, have written and have been of opinion the argument was in favour of thoſe very publications. The world has been lately favoured with another apology from a moſt learned and reſpectable Prelate, who calls his work, "<hi>An Apology for the Chriſtian Religion.</hi>" I ſhall not decide between the merits of the one and the other. The publications them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are in the hands of the world; and I ſincerely wiſh, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding language of the work to which I have juſt referred (I do not affect to uſe the very words), I ſincerely wiſh that the author of the work in queſtion may become a partaker of that faith in <hi>revealed</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which he has ſo groſsly defamed, and may be enabled to make his peace with God for that diſorder which he has endeavoured to the utmoſt of his power to introduce into ſociety. We have heard to-day; that the light of Nature and the contemplation of the works of Creation are ſufficient, without any other revelation of the Divine Will. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Plato, Xenophon, Tully, each of them in their turns, profeſſed they wanted other lights; and, knowing and confeſſing that God was good, they took it for granted the time would come when he would impart a farther revelation of his will to mankind. Though they walked, as it were, through a cloud darkly, they hoped their poſterity would almoſt ſee God face to face. This condition of mankind has met with reprehenſion to-day. But I ſhall not purſue this argument. Fully impreſſed with the great truths of Religion, which, thank God, I was taught in my early years to believe, and of which the hour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection and inquiry, inſtead of producing any doubt, has fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed me in. I expected the learned Counſel for the Defendant would have differed the caſe of the Publiſher from that of the Author of this work; that he would have endeavoured to convince you, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever guilt might belong to the Author, nothing was imputable to the Publiſher. He has however, to my utter ſurpriſe, exactly reverſed the caſe. He tells you it was originally publiſhed at Paris in 1794; that the feelings of the author's friends were wounded by this work, which I call a nefarious publication, and that it was in a great meaſure for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; and you are now called upon to judge of the merits or demerits of the Publiſher, who has brought forth a ſtill-born work, forgotten by every body, till he ventured, in defiance of the verdicts of mankind on the author's political works, to ſend it forth among the inhabitants of <hi>this</hi> country. Unleſs it was for the moſt malignant purpoſes, I cannot conceive how it was publiſhed. It is however for you to judge of it, and to do juſtice between the Public and the Defendant.</p>
