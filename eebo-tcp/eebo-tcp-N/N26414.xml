            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>UNTIL of late, there has been but one opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst protestant divines, as to the application of this descriptive branch of this very interesting prophecy. They have all united in applying it to the papal power. They have said it pointed, with precision, at the Bishop of Rome: That his standing is to be seen in several prophetic features in the field to which this passage belongs, and that the same is firmly supported by other correspond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent predictions, and prophetic aspects to be found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>n other parts of this book of Daniel, and in the writings of St. Paul and of St. John.</p>
            <p>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> late, however, Divines seem less united in the application of these prophecies to the Bishop of Rome than they, heretofore, had been accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
<pb facs="unknown:035128_0005_1000C062E7C0E528"/>
to be. Several reasons can be given for the change of sentiment. <hi>First,</hi> sympathy in the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of humanity, in the excision of the papal cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy by the national rod: <hi>Secondly</hi> fear, lest the same fate may approach the border of the protestant houshold, so far as we may have exposed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the jealousy and fury of the lawful hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by commiting fornication with the "kings of the earth:" and <hi>lastly,</hi> the mistake may have arisen from the very sudden, unexpected and violent means by which it is pleasing GOD to execute the exterminating decree upon the papal household. These things considered, there is little ground of surprise, that many protestant divines should have warped from the ancient, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and just interpretations of this prophecy, and have labored to accommodate the prophecies more to the circumstances of their own safety, than what the ancient interpretation, in the light of Heaven's, present awful exposition, seemed to warrant them to do. But of what avail will the windings and twistings of mutilated and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect parts of prophetic testimony be to those, whom the indignation of Heaven, by its all pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrating eye, is searching out!â€”Why hath not the falsity of papal interpretation screened the papal power? Why hath she not been able to parry the application of prophetic character from herself, by placing them to the account of Rome

               <q>THE dispensations of providence, in connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with the sure word of prophecy, justly raise our expectations, and may be considered as unequivocal tokens of signal success.â€” What ever may be the period from which the rise of antichrist is to be dated, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent his usurpations and tyranny are draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a close.

of the Redeemer's coming. The last strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the monster may be violent, and his expiring agonies protracted, but he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dying. The western and eastern an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, which with their combined influence, are perhaps considered in scripture as one, arose nearly at the same time and will fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</q>

We presume not, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to ascertain "the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power" but as we know that when the fig-tree putteth forth leaves the summer is nigh: so when we see all these things, <hi>we know that the coming of the son of man is near, even at the door.</hi>

The event we now behold, of consequence are better capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to designate the means by which this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw seems likely to be accomplished than to be totally dependant on the prophetic description.</p>
            <p>ON the subject of our own experience, on the evidence arising from matters of fact, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be, with safety said.</p>
            <p>IS it not evident, that the <hi>political stone</hi> which is now giving the deadly shock to the last section of the Babylonish Image, took its origin in these western climes? was it not cut out without hands from the Mountain of GOD'S universal provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in these United States? was it not the weighty stone which we all helped to lift, during the introduction and progress of that political re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>olution through which we have just now pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? did it not get its birth, at the moment wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>lst the alarm of British usurpation, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned devastation was sounded in our ears? How like electric fire did the animating principle of liberty, and determined opposition pervade the abodes of our collonial realms? how, in rapture, did Columbia's sons start from their fires, seize their arms, and march to the tune of Victory or Death! Boston harbor received the tea, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035128_0021_1000C07D2D9334B0"/>
poisonous, thro' the potion infused, by North's insidious hand. The Gaspee schooner was in flames; the king's authority was defied; and with arms in hand an appeal was made to Heaven for the justice of our cause. Twenty years expired, and these United States found themselves independent. Their standards were planted, where just now the proud insignia of the enemy braved the winds; threating never to leave our coasts until the keys of our graine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and of our commerce were laid at their feet! Delusive hope!â€”impotent wish! despotic thirst, for gold and for power, which the arm of proud despotism itself could not secure!</p>
            <p>AT this moment the stone cut out without hands, may be said to have ripened into form. But previous to the twenty years of American growth, like the winds of Eolus, impatient to be gone, it stretches its way across the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. As a cloud of political glory it accompanies Washington's sonÂ· Against the throne of Papal despotism it lets off its fire. At the door of the first born of Babylon's sons it gently knocks; but that the decree of Heaven may be fulfilled, an iron rod demolishes the incrustation, strikes down the door posts, and lays this branch of the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal family level with the dust. Provoked at this
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035128_0022_1000C07F5D0127D8"/>
event, like Bala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

None can be found. The stone braves all opposition and advances and strikes with redoubled strength the feet of the mighty image: It trembles, it reels to and fro, and threatens to fall.</p>
            <p>IN this appeal to facts, an answer is found, as to the means by which this Papal power is to be removed. GOD hath carved out an irresistable stone; He hath brought a strong westerly wind from these western climes which threatens totally to dismantle the tabernacles of the mystical wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; who in her doctrine, communion and government sits upon the shoulders of the kings of the earth.</p>
            <p>THIS same event and operation may be seen in the dispensation of the white horse, seen by St. John in the Revelations. In a political pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory and pioniering sense, George Washing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton mounted this prophetic horse in the opening of the American revolution. The Marquis La Fayette was borne through the tempest of the French Revolution by the same figure, as far as he succeeded; being dismounted, to take a walk in the dreary regions of Austrian Castles<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> prisons and dungeons, to illustrate the fate of Sons of

But where sir! can this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic scene be discovered, you may be ready to say? we have heard of Jannes and Jambres who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood Moses, and of Satan who labored, by fair promises, counterfeit application of scripture, and by vain and pompous shews to gain the hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Savior of mankind to himself, in the gospel section; but we have never heard that any one had attempted to counterfeit the millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial section: the work must be too great! none could attempt to seize the reins of the milleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al administration but such as GOD should appoint.</p>

The tempests have of late beat high; but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers passed, shall but sweeten the felicities which are to follow. If Heaven first visit our land, in the spirit of the second revolution, as it hath in the order of the first, if it adopt the mountain of our administration, as the first mountain on which the kingdom of glory shall be established, it will be easy to see that the <hi>Constellation</hi> shall always set her compass for the <hi>Insurgents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON this subject, to the mind of the writer, there appears little doubt. Much may depend
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035128_0030_1000C08E9A203B80"/>
on the faith of our political ark, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD, as the chief pilot, in all her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. Nothing is lost to our government, that it hath left the concerns of religion and of another world to the teachings of every man's own conscience, as unto GOD. It is a slander against the Heavens, to pretend to say that the things of GOD are indebted to the things of men for their support. Let GOD be true and every man a liar in this concern!</p>
            <p>NO sooner had she <hi>twenty years</hi> of our political operation built for us this political temple; than wisdom fell from GOD in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the millennial temple; from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of this federal edifice it was to break forth. Under its canopy it shall be nursed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and whilst European nations behold on these western shores of the Atlantic, the temple of freedom, over which our confederation spreads its wings; they shall see how delightful a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the approaching millenial confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it presents. For three years hath the wisdom of GOD been occupied in training to knowledge the instrument, appointed as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of divine communication. Such is the course of that divine teaching, and so multiplied and universal its forms of instruction, that no

event can happen, no piece can be named where instruction cannot be found.</p>
            <p>THE mountain of the LORD'S house, now forming, will ultimately establish itself in the tops of the mountains, and exalt itself above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it. Unto the mountain of the LORD, soon to be established in these United States, all nations, by their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, shall flow. They shall come to worship before GOD in Zion. It shall set, thro' this mode, GOD'S compass upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ethiopia and Seba shall come and bow down: and upon the distant mountains to the ends of the earth, the mount of the LORD shall be acknowledged. Through the instrumentality of this organ, the Prince of Peace shall speak peace to the nations, and they shall beat their swords into plow shears, and their spears into pruning hooks and they shall learn war no more. <hi>I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways, and he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives; not for price nor reward saith the LORD of Hosts; for lo! the labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature shall come over unto thee: and they shall be thine: in chains shall they come over and bow down, and

            <p>LEAVING prophetic illustrations, and waiting farther demonstration in support of what hath been said, either in view of illucidating the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of mystical Babylon, or the means by which she is overthrown, or the happy consequences which shall follow, it may now be proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the consideration of a few things anal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogus to the events of the day; of the present fourth of July 1799, which we are assembled to celebrate. This day commemorates the event of the declaration of our National Independence. That was an important day, both in relation to the benefits which it brought in its train, in a national point of view and in reference to the foundation of that national edifice from which is yet to beam forth, the light and glory of the world. Let, then, the day be celebrated as the hour which gave birth to the mighty events which of necessity, were needful to prepare the way for the peaceful empire of the Prince of Peace. Be astonished at the event which in the kingdom of providence, the hand of our GOD carved out thro' the instrumentality of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promising means! what could equal the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of the sons of July fourth, 1776, but the

But the fire of soul which was in them to possess, and to hand down to us, this fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and extensive habitation, seems, by inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to have descended to us their sons!

            <p>IF the benevolence of the Deity hath marked out for us such a possession, how loud the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the same sentiment of benevolence should meet a joyful welcome to our own breasts! that we may be the children of our father which is in Heaven, who maketh his son to shine on the evil and on the good, and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his rain on the just, and on the unjust!
