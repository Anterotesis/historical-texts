            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the Dismal and the Cloudy Dayes, which are now come upon us, there are especially two things exceeding Seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; namely, <hi>Fear</hi> and P<hi>rayer.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Frame</hi> of all the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to this <hi>Awful</hi> Day, is FEAR.

As F<hi>ear</hi> is the peculiar <hi>Plague</hi> of the Unhappy Times that are now rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over us; for we are fallen into those Times whereof it was long since foretold, in <hi>Luc.</hi> 21. 26. <hi>Mens hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will fail them for</hi> F<hi>ear, and for Looking after those things which are coming on the Earth:</hi> So, <hi>Fear,</hi> 'tis to be the peculiar <hi>Grace</hi> of these Times: <hi>these</hi> are the Times, wherein every one, that would be safe, must follow the pattern of him, concerning whom, we are informed, in Heb. 11. 7. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warned of God, of things not seen as yet, moved with Fear, he prepared an Ark, to the Saving of his House.</hi> There <hi>are,</hi> and one of the Ancients, tho' he <hi>saw not all things,</hi> could yet <hi>see</hi> that there ever <hi>were,</hi> four sorts of people in the world. There are some who, <hi>neither Hope nor Fear:</hi> Such are <hi>Atheistical</hi> Transgressors, to whom neither the Favour of God is Comfortable, nor His Anger For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable.

            </p>
            <p>Well then, To Quicken both our Godly F<hi>ear,</hi> and our Fervent P<hi>rayer,</hi> I have now Read you a <hi>Text,</hi> which cannot be unseasonable.</p>
            <p>One of <hi>Jobs</hi> Comforters, is here managing a Disputation against that Afflicted Saint, wherein, methinks, he deals but roughly with him; thereunto Instigated, no doubt, by misunderstanding certain passages in the Discourse of <hi>Job.</hi> It is the <hi>L</hi>ot of many a <hi>good man,</hi> to have many an <hi>Ill Charge</hi> injuriously made upon him. <hi>Defamations,</hi> the fruit of <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constructions,</hi> are among the most usual Trials of the Innocent. Holy <hi>Job</hi> is here charged, first, with S<hi>peaking</hi> unwisely, then, with <hi>Acting</hi> wickedly. As to the <hi>Latter,</hi> in our
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000652_0004_0FA99F736BCA1158"/>
Text, he is Indicted, for Neglecting both the <hi>Inward</hi> and the <hi>Outward</hi> Worship of God. <hi>Fear,</hi> is by a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche</hi> put for all the <hi>Inward,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> by a like <hi>Synecdoche</hi> put for all the <hi>Outward.</hi> The style of our Text, is indeed so Oriental, that we might as lawfully as usefully, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate it, with a very various <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase.</hi> But we shall confine our selves to the sense most obvious in our own Translation.</p>
            <p>The first Article of the Charge is, <hi>Thou Castest off Fear.</hi> By that <hi>Fear</hi> is meant Eminently, <hi>The Fear of God.</hi> When we say, <hi>The Word,</hi> we use to mean, <hi>The Word of God;</hi> as if there were no <hi>Word</hi> but <hi>Gods;</hi> for indeed there is none so considerable as that <hi>Word.</hi> Thus, <hi>The Fear,</hi> here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, may note, <hi>The Fear of God;</hi> inasmuch as there is no <hi>Fear</hi> to be like that, wherewith we are to <hi>Fear</hi> Him who can <hi>Cast both</hi> B<hi>ody and</hi> S<hi>oul into Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the mean time, what <hi>ground</hi> for this Charge? I answer, The
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000652_0004_0FA99F736BCA1158"/>
Charge seems grounded on those Expressions, of <hi>Job,</hi> wherein he complains, That <hi>the Righteous are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed with the Wicked,</hi> and, That <hi>the Tabernacles of Robbers prosper.</hi> Or, on those, wherein his Challenges made unto the most <hi>High</hi> God, have a sort of peremptoriness, not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that <hi>Lowliness</hi> of mind, with which the <hi>Fear of God</hi> would cause us to speak of all His Managements. Wherefore some of the Ancient and Eastern Versions carry it, as if it were here intimated that <hi>Job</hi> had been speaking to God, without the <hi>Modesty</hi> that became a poor Worm of the Dust!</p>
            <p>The Second Article of the Charge is, <hi>Thou Restrainest Prayer before God.</hi> What is here Translated <hi>Prayer,</hi> is promiscuously to be Englished, either M<hi>editation,</hi> or <hi>Supplication;</hi> and indeed, those are such <hi>Twins</hi> that the same Name would well befit both of them; one of them would still be Insignificant without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I may say of them, <hi>They
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000652_0005_0FA99F742B88D238"/>
are Lovely and Pleasant in their Lives, and in their Deaths they are not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again, What <hi>ground</hi> for this Charge? I answer, The Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> tell us, That the Charge is grounded on those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of <hi>Job,</hi> that seemed a Denial of <hi>Providence.</hi> To Deny <hi>Providence,</hi> is to Extinguish <hi>Prayer,</hi> for ever. Men will not be the <hi>Diligent seekers of God,</hi> except they Believe that <hi>God is a Rewarder of them who diligently seek him.</hi> Men will soon <hi>Leave off</hi> the <hi>seeking</hi> of God, if they don't Believe that God will <hi>cut off</hi> them that <hi>seek</hi> Him not. Now <hi>Jobs</hi> Assertions, as taken, yea, mistaken, would yield such Consequences, as this, That <hi>Prayer</hi> is to be <hi>Restrained,</hi> that is, Withdrawn, and Lessened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
            <p>But let all issue then in this Lesson</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Prayer may not be Restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fear must not be Rejected.</hi>

               <p>There is not only the Light of <hi>Scripture,</hi> Enforcing this Duty, but there is the Light of <hi>Nature</hi> too.

I Answer, PRAYER, is <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting of our Desire to God in Christ, for His Mercy, in his Time and His Way, and His Measure, to be obtained.</hi> That we may speak yet more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</p>
                  <p>First, The <hi>Object</hi> of Prayer, is GOD in CHRIST. It were a detestable <hi>Idolatry</hi> to make a proper <hi>Prayer,</hi> (which is, <hi>The Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a first cause</hi>) unto any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that <hi>God,</hi> whose Name alone is JEHOVAH, the Infinite and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>First Cause</hi> of all Things; a <hi>Daniel</hi> would sooner be torn to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with Hungry Lions, and the <hi>Children</hi> of God would sooner broil to Death in the Furnace heated by the <hi>Type</hi> of Antichrist, than commit such an <hi>Idolatry.</hi> It is the Rule in Math. 4. 10. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only thou shalt serve;</hi> and the Devil himself could not gainsay that Rule. Who should be the <hi>Object</hi> of Prayer, but the <hi>Hearer</hi> of Prayer? Now the <hi>Hearer</hi> of Prayer, must needs be an <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000652_0007_0FA99F76A1EF6890"/>
                     <hi>I will not Look upon you, unless you bring your Jesus with you.</hi> What are we to do with our <hi>Prayer?</hi> we have an <hi>Angel</hi> in Heaven, the Great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> unto whom we must carry and commit the <hi>Incense</hi> of our Prayer; yea, our Prayer will be no <hi>Incense,</hi> but the rank, filthy, lothsome <hi>Nidor,</hi> of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> which attends all our Sacrifices, will make our <hi>Prayer</hi> become an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination</hi> unto Him who dwells in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> except this Blessed <hi>Angel</hi> perfume it, with his Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We read in Rev. 8. 4. <hi>The Smoke of the Incense which came with the Prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God, out of the Angels Hand. Prayer</hi> was of old made with an Eye towards the <hi>Temple;</hi> Why, 'tis the Lord Jesus Christ who is the true <hi>Temple</hi> of God; it is in Him that <hi>there dwells the Fulness of the God-Head Bodily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the <hi>Nature</hi> of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 'Tis, <hi>A presenting of our Desire.</hi> In every Prayer, there is the <hi>Desire</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:000652_0008_0FA99F772D1B0AF8"/>
of some Good Thing; yea, but something more than such a <hi>Desire</hi> is also requisite; it must be a <hi>Desire</hi> some how brought forth unto the Lord. P<hi>rayer</hi> is that, whereof 'tis said in Phil. 4. 6. <hi>Let your Requests be made known unto God.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Desire</hi> becomes a <hi>Prayer</hi> only in our <hi>Minds:</hi> the silent out-goings of the <hi>Soul</hi> and W<hi>ill</hi> to God, are a most speaking Prayer. A P<hi>rayer</hi> may be made with <hi>Unuttered Groans,</hi> yea, with <hi>Unutterables.</hi> Thus 'tis said, in Lam. 3. 41. <hi>Let us Lift up our Heart unto God in the Heavens.</hi> This is indeed the main Ingredient of every P<hi>rayer;</hi> 'tis the most <hi>Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> Defect of any Prayer, when the <hi>Heart</hi> shall be found wanting there. But sometimes also the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> becomes a <hi>Prayer</hi> in our <hi>Mouths:</hi> the <hi>Arrows</hi> of Prayer are shot into Heaven with the Bowe of the Tongue. A P<hi>rayer</hi> should often be a <hi>Cry,</hi> and this, <hi>Going out from Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Lips.</hi> Thus 'tis said in Hos. 14. 2. <hi>Take with you words, and Turn

                  <p>Thirdly, For the <hi>Matter</hi> of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 'Tis <hi>Mercy to be obtained accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pleasure of God.</hi> The Outcry of P<hi>rayer,</hi> is, for <hi>Mercy;</hi> the Language of it, is that in Psal. 51. 1. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy Loving Kindness.</hi> But the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God for which our P<hi>rayer</hi> is to be concerned, are more particularly what the S<hi>crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of God have taught us to Implore.

W<hi>e have not made our</hi> P<hi>rayer before the Lord our God</hi> The <hi>Restraint</hi> of Prayer, is the <hi>Neglect</hi> of such Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as is required in the Rule of <hi>P</hi>ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Men do <hi>Restrain</hi> P<hi>rayer,</hi> when their Prayer, for the <hi>Quality</hi> of it, is not according to that Rule, in Jam. 5. 16. <hi>The</hi> P<hi>rayer of a Righteous man, made with an Inwrought vehemency.</hi> Men do <hi>Restrain</hi> P<hi>rayer,</hi> when their Prayer, for the <hi>Duration</hi> of it, is not according to that Rule, in Luc. 18. 1. <hi>That men ought always to</hi> P<hi>ray, and not to Faint.</hi> Men do <hi>Restrain</hi> P<hi>rayer,</hi> when all the <hi>sorts</hi> and <hi>kinds</hi>

There are two Things that would cause P<hi>rayer</hi> to break forth; namely, Gods <hi>Command,</hi> and mans <hi>Conscience.</hi> The <hi>Command</hi> of God would fetch it out. It is the Edict of Heaven, in Isa. 55. 6. <hi>Seek the Lord while He may be found, Call ye upon Him, while He is near.</hi> Indeed, it is the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> lying every where, the whole Bible over; <hi>That the Eternal God should be Eternally</hi> P<hi>rayed unto.</hi> You'l see P<hi>rayer</hi> bespoke, in the Sacred <hi>P</hi>ages, dip where you will.

Our God whose <hi>Throne</hi> is in the <hi>Highest Heavens,</hi> would be <hi>Enthroned</hi> in the <hi>High Thoughts</hi> of our Souls; now 'tis by Prayer that we are put upon the Forming of such <hi>G</hi>od-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring <hi>Thoughts.</hi> It was said, of a very praying man, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>He saw Him, who is Invisible.</hi> In Prayer 'tis, that we, <hi>Lift up our Eyes,</hi> and so we have a more Distinct S<hi>ight</hi> of the <hi>Unseen</hi> God, in the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and suitable Thoughts of Him, so Raised in our minds.</p>

                  <p>Moreover; A Third End of <hi>Prayer</hi> is, That we may Express and Profess our <hi>Dependance</hi> on the God, who made us <hi>Depending Beings.</hi> What said the Psalmist? in Psal. 62. 8. <hi>Trust in him at all Times, ye People.</hi> Well, but how shall <hi>People</hi> show their <hi>Trust</hi> in God? It follows, <hi>Pour out your Heart before him.</hi> Our Out-pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Souls in Prayer, declare, That we must ascribe to God, all that we have, all that we hope, all that we ask; that nothing is owing to any <hi>Blind Chance</hi> at all. When we do by Prayer go to God, <hi>That He would Give us our Daily Bread,</hi> We do thereby say, That our <hi>Bread</hi> is none of our own till He give it us. 'Tis Theevery to take any thing without the Owners Leave: Wherefore 'tis
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000652_0014_0FA99F7BAB9D8ED0"/>
said, <hi>Every Thing is</hi> S<hi>anctified by Prayer;</hi> why, by Prayer for every thing, we do say, <hi>That</hi> God is the Right <hi>Owner</hi> of that Thing; <hi>That</hi> we may not meddle with it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God will allow us to have it; Yea, <hi>That</hi> we cannot come at it at all, except God confer it upon us.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore; A Fourth End of <hi>Prayer</hi> is, That we may nourish an Humble <hi>Communion</hi> with the God who <hi>Humbles Himself</hi> to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of us. 'Tis in Prayer that we come to a marvellous <hi>Familiarity</hi> with the Lord our God, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to that priviledge in Job. 22. 21. <hi>Acquaint now thy self with Him, and be at peace.</hi> The Intercourse be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween the Great God, and the Worms of the Dust, in this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, is indeed most Inexpressible! Hence <hi>Prayer</hi> is called, <hi>A Visit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God;</hi> God and man becoming Friends, most <hi>Friendly Visits</hi> are in this way mutually given to one another. And this <hi>Communion</hi> with
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000652_0014_0FA99F7BAB9D8ED0"/>
God, not only Emboldens our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to Him, while we <hi>Live;</hi> of our Neighbour 'tis said, <hi>Withdraw thy Foot from thy Neighbours House, Lest he be weary of thee, and so Hate thee;</hi> with our Maker 'tis not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so; No, He tells us, <hi>The oftner you come, the more welcome to me!</hi> So it Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens our Retreat to God, when we <hi>Dy.</hi> Oh! that my Hearers would sufficiently Lay to Heart, what I am now going to say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them! I say unto you, That it will be a Dreadful Thing for a Soul Departing to appear before a God whom it has altogether been a <hi>Stranger</hi> unto. A Devout Soul going before God, may Rejoyce with a most Heavenly Triumph, saying, <hi>My God, I know thee! This is the God, with whom I have spent many a good Hour, before my coming hither;</hi> much <hi>P</hi>rayer does procure for us, this Felicity! O but for a wicked Soul, at its Expiration to think, <hi>I am about meeting with a God, unto whom I never did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

speak one sollicitous word, about my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Interests!</hi> 'tis an horrible Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that must amaze that wicked Soul.</p>
                  <p>Once more; A Fifth End of <hi>Prayer</hi> is, That we may preserve such a <hi>good Order of Soul,</hi> at is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in order to our Happiness. It is said of some, in 2 Tim. 2. 22. <hi>They call on the Lord, out of a pure Heart.</hi> It is by Prayer, wherein we <hi>Call upon the Lord,</hi> that the <hi>Heart</hi> is made <hi>pure</hi> and kept what it is made. They that are often in the presence of <hi>Princes,</hi> must be <hi>alwayes</hi> Trim, Neat, and in a fit posture. By much Prayer to the Great-King, we main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain such a <hi>posture of</hi> S<hi>pirit,</hi> as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended when we are bidden to <hi>Pray-always.</hi> It is by our <hi>Disorderly Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that we gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w shy of God; as when <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned, he then gat out of the way; and if we were not so shy of God, we should <hi>Walk</hi> less <hi>Disorderly.</hi> Yea, by Prayer we Lay new and strong Engagements upon our selves unto <hi>Well doing.</hi> We
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000652_0015_0FA99F7C73AEFCD0"/>
speak unto <hi>our selves,</hi> when we so speak unto our God. When we <hi>Pray</hi> and say, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> we do after a sort <hi>Preach</hi> to our selves, and say, <hi>O my Soul, do thou Love and</hi> S<hi>erve, and Rely upon Gods, as thy Heavenly</hi> F<hi>ather!</hi> When we say, <hi>sanctify'd be thy Name,</hi> we say, <hi>O my Soul, Do thou Sanctify that Holy Name!</hi> When we say, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> we say, <hi>O my</hi> S<hi>oul, Do thou be a Loyal Subject of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom!</hi> When we say, <hi>Thy Will be done,</hi> we say, <hi>O my</hi> S<hi>oul, Do thou never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that Will!</hi> Thus 'tis, that we become gloriously <hi>prepared</hi> for the Favours of God: which is indeed the Thing that He is <hi>waiting</hi> for. <hi>Lord, Thou wilt prepare the Heart of the Humble, cause thine Ear to Hear them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, A Sixth End of <hi>Prayer,</hi> is, That we may <hi>Support,</hi> yea, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load</hi> our <hi>Hearts</hi> under our <hi>Griefs.</hi> What is <hi>Prayer,</hi> but the Disburthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul? We are Invited, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Cast all your care upon
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000652_0016_0FA99F7D34A186A8"/>
God:</hi> and it is Explained, in Phil 4. 6. <hi>Be careful for nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing by Prayer, and Supplication with Thanksgiving, Let your Requests be made known unto God. B</hi>y Prayer it is, that we Transmit our <hi>Care;</hi> and so we Interest our God in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that were otherwise too hard for us. When was it that the sorrowful <hi>Hannah</hi> became <hi>no more sad?</hi> It was when she had <hi>poured out her Soul unto the Lord.</hi> All unuttered <hi>Care,</hi> is like the Imprisoned <hi>Air;</hi> it makes a grievous Disturbance. When we have carried all our Cares unto God, by Prayer, we may come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with Triumphant Souls from the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> and Leave all our Troubles, all our Sorrows, all our Fears behind us there. Our <hi>Prayer</hi> will be our <hi>Hearts ease;</hi> and for this cause 'tis that our kind God, would be the <hi>God of our Prayer.</hi> Well. <hi>The Fear of God</hi> will never permit a man, to have a <hi>Low Esteem</hi> of such Inestimable Benefits. But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If <hi>Prayer</hi> be Restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000652_0016_0FA99F7D34A186A8"/>
What good <hi>cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> can be assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that <hi>Restraint?</hi> In truth, None but such as argues that men have cast off the <hi>Fear of God.</hi> As now,</p>
                  <p>I am sure, Men don't <hi>Fear God,</hi> if they don't feel that they W<hi>ant God.</hi> But this may be said of all P<hi>rayerless</hi> Ones. As they of old, in Jer. 2. 3. <hi>They said, we are Lords, we will come no more at thee;</hi> so these; They say, W<hi>e can do well enough without the Lord.</hi> They are not sensible of their own Weakness, their own Darkness, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual wretchedness without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Conduct of God.</p>
                  <p>Again, I am sure, men don't <hi>Fear God,</hi> if they are not willing to <hi>Serve God.</hi> But this also may be said of all P<hi>rayerless</hi> Ones. As it was complained, in Isa. 43. 22. <hi>Thou hast not called upon me, O Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, but hast been weary of me, O Israel:</hi> So when men are not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day C<hi>alling</hi> on God, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in proclaim themselves <hi>Weary</hi> of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000652_0017_0FA99F7DF5691880"/>
Him. And what an unworthy thing is this! The Lord may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of us, W<hi>herein have I weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee?</hi> W<hi>hat is there that should make thee loth to wait upon me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I add, It is by casting off the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> that men break their P<hi>eace with God.</hi> Now if mens <hi>Peace</hi> with God, were not broken, their P<hi>rayer</hi> to God, would not be remitted. The Psalmist found it so, in Psal. 32. 3. W<hi>hen I kept si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, my Bones waxed old, thro' my Roaring all the Day long.</hi> When our Prayers are <hi>silent,</hi> there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably some <hi>Old Roaring</hi> Guilt Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us. Many complain, <hi>They do not, they cannot</hi> P<hi>ray; a Prayerless Drowsiness has overtaken them, and they know not what's the matter with them.</hi> Why, 'tis well if there be not some unrepented Sin upon you, Grieving the Holy Spirit of God; it is <hi>That</hi> which is a <hi>Quench-Prayer</hi> in your Souls.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, What <hi>Fear of God</hi> can there be in them, that say, <hi>There
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000652_0017_0FA99F7DF5691880"/>
is no God at all?</hi> But such an <hi>Atheist</hi> is the Wretch, that Lives wholly without P<hi>rayer</hi> to God. Hence, we find those things conjoined, in Psal. 14. 1, 4. <hi>The Fool hath said in his heart, There is no God;</hi> it follows, <hi>They call not upon the Lord.</hi> When a man shall cast such a Contempt upon the God that made him, as to offer no Prayers unto His Maker, 'tis because of a cursed <hi>Atheism</hi> Lurking and Working in the Heart of such a <hi>Fool.</hi> The worst of <hi>Infidels,</hi> are not carried away with so much of <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Fear of God,</hi> would certainly produce P<hi>rayer to God,</hi> if that Fear were not <hi>Rejected,</hi> but maintained, manifested, Exercised. Those things go together in Psal. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>5. 18, 19. <hi>The Lord is nigh to all them that call upon him, He will fulfil the Desire of them that</hi> F<hi>ear Him.</hi> If men <hi>Fear God,</hi> they cannot but be D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ous to <hi>Call</hi> upon Him. What is very <hi>Godly</hi> Man? He is a P<hi>ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> man. So we are told, in Psal.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000652_0018_0FA99F7EB10C4A28"/>
32. 6. <hi>Every one that is Godly shall pray unto thee.</hi> A man does no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner begin to have the <hi>Fear of God</hi> in his Heart, but it may be said of that man, <hi>Behold, he prays!</hi> As for the Prayerless man, he does neither Obey the P<hi>recept,</hi> nor Credit the P<hi>ower,</hi> nor Adore the <hi>Goodness,</hi> of God; and I may say, <hi>How dwells the Fear of God in such a man.</hi> If men did <hi>Fear</hi> God, they would also <hi>Love</hi> the God whom they Fear. But that would cause them to say after the Psalmist, in Psal. 116. 1, 2. <hi>I Love the Lord, therefore I will call upon Him as long as I Live.</hi> Again, if men did <hi>Fear God,</hi> they would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Trust</hi> the God, whom they Fear. But that would cause them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to say after the Psalmist, in Psal. 116. 10. <hi>I believed, therefore have I spoken;</hi> i. e. <hi>I have prayed.</hi> To have done, The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God is in them that have the <hi>Fear</hi> of God. Now, that <hi>Spirit</hi> is, <hi>The Spirit of Grace, and of Supplication.</hi> Men have the <hi>Grace</hi> to be much in S<hi>upplication</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="unknown:000652_0018_0FA99F7EB10C4A28"/>
when that <hi>Spirit</hi> has once Renewed them, and possessed them; they have then a <hi>Spirit for</hi> P<hi>rayer</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. Thus you see a fair way made for our Designed</p>

I say first,</p>
               <p n="1">I. We are in such <hi>Fearful Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> as may justly give <hi>L</hi>oud Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums unto the Blackest of our <hi>Fears,</hi> and because unto our <hi>Fears,</hi> therefore also unto our <hi>Prayers.</hi> 'Tis not only the Threatning D<hi>rought</hi> now upon us, that bespeaks our <hi>Fears</hi> and our <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> tho' <hi>that</hi> be something.

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000652_0027_0FA99F862C74C490"/>
things, which have an Aspect upon us very formidable. We should be glad, of, <hi>Tokens for Good;</hi> but instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it may be said, as in Psal. 65. 8. <hi>They who dwell in the uttermost parts, are afraid at thy Tokens:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Particularly,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Let not Fear be east off:</hi> Are we not <hi>Afraid,</hi> Lest the <hi>Confusions</hi> which are to over-set and overwhelm, the whole World, in these Latter Dayes, do <hi>Come hither</hi> also. There is yet a <hi>Third Wo,</hi> wherewith Mankind is to be most horribly plagued, for its Opposition to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ; a <hi>Wo,</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison whereof, all the horrendous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations, brought first by the <hi>Sar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Is that <hi>Kingdom</hi> of our Lord so Loved, so Studied, so Embraced among our selves, that we need not Fear being reached by that astonishing <hi>Wo?</hi> I would to God it were so. Tho' it will be a <hi>Joyful</hi> D<hi>ay</hi> for them that

are to be <hi>Refreshed by the presence of the Lord,</hi> yet it will be a <hi>woful</hi> Day for them that <hi>Know not God, and obeynot His Gospel.</hi> The Fields will grow loth to nourish those Rebels; T<hi>here shall be Famines.</hi> The Air will grow Loth to let them Breathe; <hi>There shall be Pestilences.</hi> The Eyes of Heaven will grow loth to behold them: T<hi>he Lights of Heaven shall be</hi> D<hi>arkened.</hi> The <hi>E</hi>arth will grown under the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of them; <hi>There shall be Earth-quakes in divers places.</hi> There is to be Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted indeed, a further Accomplishment of that word, in Heb. 12. 26. <hi>Yet once more, I</hi> S<hi>hake, not the Earth only, but</hi> H<hi>eaven also.</hi> It is a Day of <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> and should it not be a Day of <hi>Heart-quakes</hi> too? Literal and Natural <hi>Earth-quakes</hi> are like to be multiplied in the approaching Age. The Subterranean <hi>Fires</hi> that are shortly to assist the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of this Globe, will get head apace, and <hi>Earth-quakes</hi> more stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous than the Late one upon our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Neighbours, will be thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned. As it was with a Burning Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that our God gave our His <hi>Law</hi> unto the Jewish World, so He terrify'd the World, with another Burning Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:000652_0028_0FA99F86EBB6A0C8"/>
when He gave out His <hi>Gospel</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gentile World. Throughout <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> people were then f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Why, our God is now coming to Judge the World for the Contempt of His <hi>Law,</hi> and of His <hi>Gospel;</hi> and He will in a more affrighting manner set the World in a Burning <hi>Fire,</hi> at His Coming: <hi>A Fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very Tempestuous round about Him.</hi> Proper <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> will probably abound in the Near Advances of That <hi>Notable Day of the</hi> L<hi>ord.</hi> But be sure, <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Earthquakes,</hi> there will be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now; State-quakes, Church-quakes, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-quakes, will now Rage at a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rate. As <hi>Jonah</hi> ran through <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi> proclaiming, <hi>Yet Forty</hi> D<hi>ays and the Great City shall be Overthrown.</hi> So do I now run thro' N<hi>ew-England,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, T<hi>here is a Great City going to be Overthrown; and yet within less than Twenty Years, the greatest Shakes are like to be given unto the World, that ever happened from the first Foundation of it.</hi>

Secondly. <hi>Let not Fear be cast off:</hi> Are we not <hi>Afraid,</hi> Lest when the S<hi>torms</hi> of Divine Vengeance do burst and break upon our own Sinful Nation, some <hi>Drops</hi> of the Storms do fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>our</hi> Heads. The Profanity, the Debauchery, the Superstition, wherewith our Nation has been infected, have Long been making a Loud Cry in the Ears of the L<hi>ord God of Sabaoth;</hi> So that he seems to say, as in Jer. 5. 9. <hi>Shall not I visit for these things, saith the Lord: Shall not my</hi> S<hi>oul be avenged on such a Nation as this?</hi> And when the Holy God shall <hi>visit</hi> for those things, it will be well, if <hi>Showers</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> be not Rained on a Land, where the <hi>Blood</hi> of His Dear Son has been treated as an <hi>Unholy Thing.</hi> Hence 'tis that many Thinking Men, in the Nation at this Day, are Looking upon one another with paleness in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wishing, <hi>O that we had Wings like a Dove!</hi> But especially, when they Look back upon the fierce <hi>Persecutions,</hi> which formerly flamed in that Land against the Pure Worship of our Lord, they conceive that they may see, <hi>Wrath coming unto the uttermost.</hi> And how

shall a share in that <hi>Wrath</hi> upon the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> be now avoided, by the most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of all her D<hi>aughters?</hi>

can say, How far that Holy God, may proceed in punishing us, <hi>yet seven times more for our Iniquities?</hi> in punishing us, <hi>above the Rest of the Families of the Earth?</hi> When we see what has befallen others, our Lord says to us, as in Luc. 13. 3, 5. <hi>Except ye Repent, ye shall all Likewise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi> Let me then say to you, <hi>Go to Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh!</hi> and again, <hi>Go to Asia!</hi> and once more, <hi>Go to the European Churches!</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Go to <hi>France,</hi> where the greatest Scourge of the World, more than seven years ago, coined <hi>Medals,</hi> on which 'twas brag'd, <hi>That he had then Reduced no less than twenty Hundred</hi> T<hi>housand Calvinists, from the Protestant Religion.</hi> A worse, thing surely than the Cutting of so many Throats!

the Eternal King, upon whom we are this Day attending When <hi>Daniel</hi> was, as <hi>we</hi> now are, <hi>Weary</hi> with Fasting, an <hi>Angel</hi> Flew from Heaven, till <hi>he</hi> was even <hi>Weary</hi> too (as the Original has it) with the Swiftness of his Motion, to bring him some comfortable Tidings.

               <p>But, what <hi>Hopes?</hi> I Reply,</p>
               <p>First, We have <hi>Hopes</hi> in the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Grace</hi> of our most Gracious God. O what an Heart-breaking Word is that, in Isa. 57. 17, 18. <hi>For the Iniquity of his Coveteousness, was I wroth, and smote him: and he went on frowardly in the way of his Heart:</hi> And what? must all now be Lost? No; There is yet <hi>Hope in Israel!</hi> You shall see what S<hi>overaign Grace</hi> can do. It follows, <hi>I have seen his Ways and will Heal him.</hi> And now, <hi>Lord, Be it unto thy</hi> P<hi>eople according to this thy Gracious Word!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Reply, Secondly; We have <hi>Hopes</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:000652_0034_0FA99F8B6E2EFF80"/>
in the Hastning <hi>Time of Reformation,</hi> which our God will Hasten in his Time. If the <hi>Man of</hi> S<hi>in</hi> Entred his Last <hi>Half Time!</hi> or his last Hundred and Eighty Years, as no doubt he did, at the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> which Commenced about the Year 1517. We may then have a <hi>Lively Hope,</hi> that we are within a very few years, of a <hi>Reformation,</hi> more Heavenly, more Extensive, more Glorious, than the Church of God has ever yet been favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with. But shall <hi>we</hi> be forgotten in this <hi>Time?</hi> We may presume that neither God, nor the King, will then forget us.</p>
               <p>I Reply, Thirdly; We have <hi>Hopes</hi> in the Yearly and Holy Fruits of our <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> that Blessed Nursery of our <hi>Israel.</hi> The Lord may say unto us, <hi>I have Raised up of your Sons for Prophets;</hi> for which that man among us, who is not now greatly Thankful to God, is not worthy the Name of, <hi>A New-Englandman.</hi> There is a most <hi>Hopeful</hi> produce of S<hi>cholars</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising out of that Society; <hi>Young men,</hi> admirably Accomplished in all parts of Literature; <hi>Young men</hi> of most Enlarged Souls; and, which is better still, <hi>Young Men,</hi> full of Piety; no Strangers to the N<hi>ew-Birth;</hi> nor unacquainted with High

Experiments in practical Religion; such as know what it is to be continually <hi>Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> as well as <hi>Praying</hi> for the Blessing of God, not upon themselves alone, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all concerned in them. <hi>Destroy not that</hi> P<hi>eople;</hi> saith our God; <hi>is there not a Blessing among them?</hi> And as for <hi>You,</hi> Brethren, that are thus coming on; Be Encouraged and Know, T<hi>hat the God of your</hi> F<hi>athers has a greater work for you to do for Him, than what He has yet Employ'd your Fathers in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Reply, Fourthly; We have <hi>Hopes</hi> in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ on <hi>Board</hi> of our <hi>Bark.</hi> A Little Vessel could not be sunk, by all the Blast of Hell, while our Lord was with His <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> in it. Why, our <hi>L</hi>ord has very few Disciples in this whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Haemisphere of the World, but what are in this Little Vessel. Shall we then <hi>perish?</hi> No, That we shall not; if we now do, by our Prayers <hi>Awaken</hi> our Lord unto the Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us.</p>
               <p>But after all; when the worst comes to the worst: Yet, <hi>Surely I know it shall be well with them that fear God, that Fear before</hi> H<hi>im.</hi> Let us have much of that <hi>Fear</hi> within us, and let that Swallow

up every other <hi>Fear. Qui Deum timet, cum omnia timent.</hi> The <hi>Fear</hi> of God will give us a Room among His <hi>Alamoth,</hi> or His Hidden Ones; and then we may without <hi>Fear</hi> Sing the <hi>Forty</hi> S<hi>ixth Psalm,</hi> which L<hi>uther</hi> used, when Things Look'd with a bad face abroad; Sing, <hi>We will not Fear, tho' the Earth be removed, and tho' the Mountain be carried into the midst of the</hi> S<hi>ea.</hi> Our God, is now, I believe, upon the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of His <hi>Witnesses:</hi> altho' former Attempts about that <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> have been Abortive, yet now, <hi>with His Dead Body they shall arise</hi> It is therefore likely to be a Day of more than ordinary <hi>Indignation</hi> upon an Impious World; but if we are now fitted and acted by the <hi>Fear</hi> of God, and if that <hi>Fear</hi> carry us forth to to all due <hi>Testimonies</hi> for His Truths and Ways, He will say unto us, <hi>Come, My</hi> P<hi>eople; Enter thou into thy Chambers, and Shut thy</hi> D<hi>oors about thee.</hi>
