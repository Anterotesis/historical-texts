            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By his Precepts he tells us, what we ought to do, and the way we ſhould walk in to Salvation, by Recorded Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples what Saints did that were in this way of Salvation, which we are to Enquire after for our Imitation. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Stand ye in the wayes, and ſee and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye ſhall find reſt for your Souls.</hi> This Example before us is thought to be <hi>Davids,</hi> who probably was the Pen man of the Pſalm.

            <p>This is both a proof of his Intereſt in God, and direction to the Cure of a Profeſſing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Apoſtaſy from God, where it is total or partial; and of uſe therefore to Saints and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to further their true Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.

               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is this Thoughtfulneſs of our wayes or actions that is ſuch a ſpecial means for the cure of Apoſtaſy in a Profeſſing People of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In general take this deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>It is the Exerciſe of all the powers of the Rational Soul by mans Self Reflection for the knowledge of his ways or actions, and for his right Judgment of them with reference to Gods final approving Judgment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the Exerciſe of all the Powers of the Rational Soul, the Underſtanding, Will and Affections.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In way of Self-Reflection for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his actions, which is peculiar to a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000858_0008_0FABF14CB30923C8"/>
Rational Creature, and mainly intends his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions, as under the direction of a moral Rule for his Obedience, and Happineſs, in Enjoyment of God, according to his promiſe, to his obedience. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is for his Right Judgment of them. Man hath a Judicature in himſelf, God hath Authorized in him, and is the ſupream and higheſt on Earth; ſubordinate only to God about his own actions in reference to God, and his inward duty to him. Rom. 14.4. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own maſter he ſtandeth or falleth.</hi> None are to judge others in things that are indifferent in matters of Religion, or doubtful to true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but themſelves, about the ſincerity in them or not. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>Let us not therefore judge one another any more, but conſider our own wayes.</hi> The Judge is Conſcience. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. That is a Witneſs as well as a Judge, having the beſt knowledge of what is in man, next to God. 1 Cor. 2.11. <hi>For what man knoweth the things of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n man, ſave the Spirit of man which is in him?</hi> And hath Authority in the man to ſtir up all the powers in it, for its right judgment, therefore the Pſalmiſt here ſaith, <hi>I thought,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on work by Conſcience that is ſeated in the heart or practical judgment, that influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth the whole. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>If the heart condemns,</hi> (that is Conſcience) God is greater,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000858_0009_0FABF14DE8C16920"/>
and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>till much more condemn; but if it does not there may be Appeals to God to Juſtify, and confidence in it through Chriſt. Pſal. 130.4. <hi>But there is forgiveneſs with thee that thou mayſt be feared.</hi> Its Knowledge and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſtir up the activity of the Rational Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is in order to this Judgment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is with reference to Gods final approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgment of them. This is the chief end of the power of Conſcience in man. It is to be approved of God; all our Actions may in his final judgment. 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.11. It was ſo in mans Innocency, to prevent ſin, to juſtify in way of perfect Obedience; and ſince the Fall under the Goſpel its main uſe is to further eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping Gods Condemnation of them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. by judging themſelves, and appealing to Gods Gracious Throne for approbation and pardon through Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. More particularly, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew what are thoſe Exerciſes of the powers of the Soul when Conſcience is awakened to its duty, in order to true turning to God, are ſtirred up by it, and in what order.</p>
               <p>Firſt. The underſtanding power of the Soul, it ſets that a work, which is the firſt Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Soul in order to Returning to God; a ſeeing and knowing of our wayes or actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> None can rightly judge of what he doth not know, and right knowledge of them
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000858_0009_0FABF14DE8C16920"/>
muſt go before any ſerious thoughts about <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ending them, or returning to a right way; we muſt ſee we are wrong. For clearing this, take theſe Remarks about it.</p>
               <p>Firſt. That in mans firſt Creation. God gave man an Excellent Underſtanding; not only into the natures of all other Inferiour Creatures, to give them ſuitable names there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but alſo to know his own duty to God as the way to his Happineſs; not only by the written Law of God in his heart, but his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law in the Sanctions of the Covenant with him: He Reveals what is good, and his way to his Happineſs. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9, 17. and what is evil, that which God forbids. And he had a freedom and power to will and chooſe the one, and refuſe the other, but Created and Mutable; and ſo by the abuſe of that power hath loſt it, and his knowledge with it of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good and evil, wholly as ſaving, and any right judgment of it in order to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly. In Fallen man there are ſome Remains, as ſome call them, of the light of nature in their Conſciences; or as others ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would call them, common gifts to fallen man; God gives to all men as benefits in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon from Chriſts Death to all mankind, that are beneficial to Humane Society, though not
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000858_0010_0FABF14DEC24EB28"/>
ſaving to the perſon. Thus we read, Rom. 1.18. <hi>Who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> (that is, ſin againſt the light of Conſcience) The Heathens had a natural light about good and evil, as beneficial or deſtructive to Humane Society. <hi>Verſe</hi> 29. <hi>who know that they that do ſuch things are worthy of death.</hi> And ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of duty to God by the help of the works of Creation. <hi>verſe</hi> 19, 20. <hi>Becauſe that which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them, For the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God head, ſo that they are without excuſe,</hi> which though not ſaving, yet l<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t them without excuſe; and Sins againſt it, deprived them of much of Gods common Goodneſs, and brought them under much of preſent diſpleaſure, and the effects of it, which might have been avoided. Rom. 2.14, 15. <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the Law:</hi> (That is in that Law written, the Scriptures) <hi>theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the law, are a law unto themſelves. Which ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or excuſing one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly. But God hath provided further
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000858_0010_0FABF14DEC24EB28"/>
help for the knowledge of our ways, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Saving Returning out of that Apoſtaſy, and after-ſtrays from his Rule. And that is the Diſpenſation of his Word. Rom. 2.4. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God leadeth thee to repentance?</hi> Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob: his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and his judgments unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with every nation.</hi> Which hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Spirit in the right diſpenſation of it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.20, 21. <hi>Their eyes ſhall ſee their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and ſhall hear a voice behind, ſaying this is the way walk in it.</hi> and the ſucceſs of it depends thereon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a further outward light and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Sin, in the ſinful and penal evil of it; the written Law of God makes diſcovery of the evil nature of it in that original pravity of our natures ſince the Fall, and of all our evil practices. Rom. 3.20. <hi>By the Law is the knowledge of Sin,</hi> and by the Goſpel of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. <hi>verſe</hi> 23, 24. <hi>all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Law ſtrips you naked, and lets you ſee ſin and miſery. And the Goſpel diſcovers the way out of it. Rev. 3.17, 18. <hi>and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked. Buy of me gold tried in the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000858_0011_0FABF14EB27C2DD8"/>
fire, that thou mayeſt be rich, and white raiment, that thou mayeſt be clothed, and that the ſhame of thy nakedneſs do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eye-ſalve, that thou mayeſt ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are common giftſ of the Spirit, which much heightens the light of nature in thus ſeeing Sin and the Remedy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times powerful Convictions and Awakenings of Conſcience thereby. Acts 2.37. <hi>They were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> up Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after the Remedy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are ſaving illuminations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Diſpenſation of the Word, whereby man Fallen is Reſtored to a true, though not a perfect knowledge of God and himſelf, ſo of the evil of Sin, and good of Obedience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. which is neceſſary to a right judgment of our ways, to a ſaving-turning to him. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. called, <hi>a turning from darkneſs to light, and the power of Sin and Satan to God</hi>; a ſanctifying all the powers of the Soul, and begins with this, in giving a ſpiritual eye, fit to diſcern a ſpiritual object. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. <hi>The ſpiritual man diſcerneth all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This is the knowledge to be ſought and waited for in the Reading the Word, &amp; Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.32, 33. for Chriſts open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as to the blind men he did. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to be exerciſed in the knowledge of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000858_0011_0FABF14EB27C2DD8"/>
your ways or actions. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Wait at Wiſdoms gates,</hi> both inward and outward, by ſeeing them in the glaſs of the word. <hi>Jam</hi> 1.25. <hi>Whoſo look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, will be a doer of it, and bleſsed therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Making a through ſearch into your hearts, and trial of your ways thereby, eſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Afflictive Diſpenſations for ſin, an alluſion to Judicial Proceedings, that is in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Search and try your ways, and turn to the Lord.</hi> Find out the ſin, and all the aggravations of it, by ſearching and trying your ways, or Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And there is need of Calling in Gods ſearch. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.23, 24. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts. And ſee if there be any wicked way in me: and lead me in the way everlasting.</hi> To avoid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of our ſinful and deceitful hearts. Jer. 17.7, 10. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord ſearch the heart, I try the reins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond operation of the Rational Soul to be exerciſed, is the Memory, whereby things known are kept and recalled when actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forgotten, and is of ſpecial uſe in turning to God; and in fixing the thought upon our ways. This is helped in the firſt operation of it, retaining things to be thought on.</p>
               <p>Firſt. By the right, clear and practical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them. A good memory depends on
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000858_0012_0FABF14F6DD0D220"/>
the good Underſtanding. Thoſe that have the cleareſt underſtandings have the happieſt memories, eſpecially where it is practical about ſin and duty, when under the powerful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions by the Word and Spirit, to a deep ſenſe of ſin, in its ſinfulneſs and penal evil of it, to ſtir up to a Concernedneſs for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As they were at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon that were pricked at the heart.

                     </gap>es meminerunt.</hi> What old men love, they will remember in old age, when memory fails them in other things. Anſwerable to that Counſel of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Prov. 22 6. <hi>Train up a Child in the way he ſhould go, and he will not depart from it when he is old.</hi> The Experience of Chriſtians teſtifie to it, thoſe that moſt complain of their weak memories, yet words they have underſtood, and had impreſſion of on their hearts, they never forget. <hi>David</hi> had ſuch a Remembrance

               <p n="2">2. Conſcience Records all a mans actions in the memory, good and bad together, with Gods Diſpenſations to him by his Word and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences. It is the Recorder, and Memory is the Book where they are written in order to Gods judgment of them finally, and for our judgment to prevent his Condemning judgment. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.1. <hi>It is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a Diamond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence 2. The ſecond act of memory is needful and uſeful to the cure of Apoſtaſy, which is recalling to mind that which, is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally forgotten concerning Gods Law, his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Providences, and our own ſins.</p>

Truth is the food of the Underſtanding, which it commends to, and ſtores in the Memory; and meditation concocts for uſe and nouriſhment to the whole man, the will and affections of the Soul to live and walk in the ſtrength of it, and is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally here intended and expreſſed by; I thought or conſidered my ways, and turned.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000858_0014_0FABF155487223D0"/>
The thoughts are the perfecting acts and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Soul, whereby the Idaea and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of things are framed in it, which it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands and remembers, and hath the moſt immediate influence on the will and affections, as they have on the actions.</p>
               <p>As things we outwardly ſee are repreſented by the phanſie and common ſenſe to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; ſo when they are practically known and remembred it is conceived in the will and affections, as a Child in the womb, and are therefore called the firſt born of the underſtanding. And though a man doth not always outwardly practiſe and bring forth to outward view all ſuch thoughts to mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, yet they as in the thoughts are in Gods view<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he judgeth his ſtate thereby as good or bad; ſo he ſaith of fallen man as in his natural eſtate.

that God stirs up Conſcience to excite in them that do turn into the right way. I ſhall not further enlarge upon what, thoughts are, being limited by my Text, to the Activity of them in our own ways, as the ſpecial ſubject or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of them, to further turning into Gods ways. And more ſpecially that it is on the ſinful ways of heart and life in us, thoſe that muſt be turned, from which God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calls his people to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Firſt. Think or meditate on the ſinfulneſs of your ways, as you ſhould know the evil of them by the Word, and remember the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions by it, with all the aggravations of them. So think on it, and keep your hearts to it. <hi>Pſal</hi> 51.3. let ſin be always before you to humble you, and further ſeeking pardon and mortification of it, by ſeeing your ſelves in the glaſs of the Word. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.25.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Meditate on the penal evil of it, what your ſin deſerves? What Afflictions and Effects of Gods Diſpleaſure for your ſins? So meditate on Gods preſent Providences, as the puniſhments of your evil ways, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.8, 9,

               <p>The grounds of this meditation or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, or helps in it are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A conſideration of Gods Mercy, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Patience; think on this, Rom. 2.4. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the Riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long ſuffering, &amp;c.</hi> You that live under Goſpel means have more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage than others have by the light of nature, having alſo the Goſpel Revelation of the Remedy againſt ſin, and a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in his world, notwithſtanding provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by often abuſing his mercies, all of them in Rebellion againſt him, uſing of them againſt him, not only his common mercies, but deſpiſing that which is the richeſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; Diſcovery of the way to your being the Subjects of his Reconciled Favour, that ſhould lead you to the way of it. This highly aggravated ſin in thoſe under the means of Salvation.

Thus the Prophet did awaken a <hi>David</hi> to this duty, to think of what God had done for him. <hi>verſe</hi> 13. And would do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in renewing his pardon to him. This appears in the diſcovery of his nature. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>And the Lord paſſed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth.</hi> In his making his glory paſs before <hi>Moſes,</hi> he hath diſcovered his gracious nature, the free and full pardoning mercy that is in him.

Is he a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill: therefore my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are troubled for him; I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Oh! that you may ſo think on your ways, that you may turn your feet unto Gods Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; that ſo you may have Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and manifeſtation of his Fatherly Love to you.</p>
