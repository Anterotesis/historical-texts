            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE Author of the following ſheets is well aware of the objections which may be made to the performance; but is in hopes the candour of the publick will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thoſe defects, which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the undertaking rendered it almoſt impoſſible to avoid. The pointed ſatire of ridicule, which would perhaps have given a zeſt to thoſe ſcenes in which the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of theſe pages was engaged, was not, in the opinion of the writer, at all proper for thoſe readers for whom it was ſolely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. To exhibit their ſuperiours
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:021187_0004_0FB26EEE90FA1D78"/>
in a ridiculous view, is not the proper method to engage the youthful mind to reſpect. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent their equals as the objects of contemptuous mirth, is by no means favourable to the intereſt of good nature. And to treat the characters of their inferiours with levity, the Author thought was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the ſacred rights of humanity. Circumſcribed therefore to the narrow bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſimple narrative, it has been the deſign of the following pages, carefully to avoid exciting any wrong impreſſion, and, by ſometimes blending <hi>inſtruction</hi> with <hi>amuſement,</hi> to make it the more eaſily retained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:021187_0005_0FB26EF14343B950"/>To multiply incidents in theſe circumſtances, was a very difficult taſk, eſpecially, as it was wiſhed to make them ariſe naturally from the ſubject; and not obtrude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily without any ſeeming cauſe to produce them. The avidity with which children pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe books of entertainment, is a proof how much publications pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for their attention are requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Though the ſentiments ſhould be ſuited to their ſimplic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, they ought to be expreſſed with propriety; ſince a taſte for elegance may be inſenſibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and we ſhould always <hi>endeavour</hi> to preſent them with proper models of imitation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the difficulty of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:021187_0006_0FB26EF7C0F77F60"/>
the Author of theſe adventures would gladly have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the taſk, in the expectation of ſuch a work's engaging the attention of thoſe, who have genius equal to its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. With the hope, therefore, of inſpiring others to excel the example, it is now ſubmitted to the world "with all its imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on its head," truſting for a candid reception to the motive which firſt ſuggeſted the idea: <hi>That of preſenting the juvenile reader with a few pages which ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of corrupting, if they did not amuſe.</hi>

                  <div n="1" type="part">
                     <p>IT happened one very fine afternoon in the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> that Mrs. <hi>Airy</hi> had been collecting together a great number of different pieces of ſilk, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> order to make a workbag; which ſhe intended as a preſent to one of her nieces. Miſs <hi>Martha Airy,</hi> her eldeſt daughter, was about ten years old, and had been for ſome time indolently lolling with both her elbows on the table, to look at her Mamma while ſhe was chuſing the prettieſt pattern for the purpoſe I juſt mentioned. Her chin reſted on her two hands, which were croſſed over each other, and ſhe was ſeated on the back of her brother's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>air, which he had turned down in that manner for the purpoſe of ſerving him as a horſe. At laſt, however, her weight prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too great for the ſeat ſhe had choſen, as ſhe did not keep ſtill, the upper part of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021187_0008_0FB26EFA99B6FA30"/>
chair back came to the ground, while the other end mounted up like a piece of board for a ſeeſaw; and ſhe tumbled down backwards, and in her fall proved the occaſion of a great deal of miſchief, by overſetting a curious ſet of tea china, which her ſiſter <hi>Charlotte</hi> was playing with; and which ſhe had received as a preſent the day before from her grand papa. <hi>Charlotte</hi> was ſo enraged at the loſs of her play-things, that without offering to help her ſiſter, ſhe gave her a ſlap on the face, and told her, ſhe was very naughty to ſpoil things in ſuch a manner by her careleſſneſs and that ſhe would break her plates whenever they came in her way. She was proceeding in this manner, when Mrs. <hi>Airy</hi> thought it time to interfere, and was extremely angry with <hi>Charlotte</hi> for her warmth. "<hi>Martha</hi> was not to blame," add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, "as ſhe had no intention of doing the leaſt miſchief to your cups and ſaucers. I think as I told her once before, ſhe was not ſitting in a graceful attitude, and had ſhe moved at the time I ſpoke to her, it would have prevented her fall; but that is no juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of your behaviour to your ſiſter. She has not deſerved your reproaches, and I did not think you could have behaved ſo improp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly, as well as unkindly, as to ſtrike any one, eſpecially your elder ſiſter. Indeed I am much
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021187_0009_0FB26EFF9C099CC0"/>
diſpleaſed with you, and the threat you made of breaking her plates in return, is ſo very naughty and wicked, that I think you deſerve to be puniſhed; and I deſire you will aſk <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha's</hi> pardon for the blow you have given her." <hi>Charlotte</hi> coloured with indignation and anger, at the thoughts of ſubmitting in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to humble herſelf. She had heard ſome ſilly girls declare, they would never confeſs to be wrong, and was withheld from acting in the nobleſt manner, by the falſe ſhame of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing an errour. At length, however, upon her Mamma's coming towards her with an <figure/> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021187_0010_0FB26ADCF56F65C8"/>
intention of inflicting ſome farther puniſhment, ſhe mumbled out, in a low voice, which was very difficult to be underſtood, That ſhe was very ſorry ſhe had ſtruck her. <hi>Martha,</hi> who was extremely generous, and uncommonly good natured, very affectionately kiſſed her ſiſter; and told her, ſhe was much concerned at the miſchief ſhe had occaſioned; though ſhe could not have helped it, as ſhe fell down before ſhe was aware of it, and did not ſee that her tea things were near her. <hi>Charlotte</hi> grew reconciled by degrees; but it was a long time before ſhe regained her uſual cheerfulneſs. After ſome time, however, the ſiſters ſeated themſelves in a window by the table, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited their Mamma for a bit of ſilk to make a <hi>Pincuſhion.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Airy</hi> gave them ſeveral pieces to chuſe which they liked beſt; and after they had taken them up a dozen times, or perhaps as many more, had they been reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Martha</hi> made choice of a ſquare piece of pink ſattin, which ſhe neatly ſewed and ſtuffed with bran, and which, gentle reader, when it was finiſhed, was the identical <hi>Pincuſhion</hi> whoſe adventures form the ſubject of this little volume. Aſſuming, therefore, the title of an Hiſtorian, or Biographer, which is generally underſtood to mean a perſon who is writing an account of his own, or another's actions, I
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021187_0011_0FB26ADFD3E15B00"/>
ſhall take the liberty to ſpeak for myſelf, and tell you what I ſaw and heard in the character of a <hi>Pincuſhion.</hi> Perhaps you never thought that ſuch things as are inanimate, could be ſenſible of any thing which happens, as they can neither hear, ſee, or underſtand; and as I would not willingly miſlead your judgment. I would, previous to your reading this work, inform you, that it is to be underſtood as an imaginary tale, in the ſame manner as when you are at play, you ſometimes call yourſelves gentlemen, and ladies, though you know you are only little boys, or girls. So, when you read of birds and beaſts ſpeaking and thinking, you know it is not ſo in reality, any more than your amuſements, which you frequently call <hi>making believe.</hi> To uſe your own ſtile, and adopt your own manner of ſpeaking, therefore, you muſt imagine that a <hi>Pincuſhion</hi> is now <hi>making believe</hi> to addreſs you, and to recite a number of little events, ſome of which really have happened, and others might do ſo with great probability; and if any of the characters here repreſented ſhould appear to be diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the Author hopes you will endeavour to avoid their failings, and to practiſe thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or accompliſhments, which render the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary examples more worthy of imitation. And now, if you pleaſe, we will return to the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021187_0012_0FB26AE440DA6628"/>
account of what farther befel me in the family of Mrs. <hi>Airy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the young ladies had amuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a great while with the pieces of ſilk <figure/> I have ſo often had occaſion to mention, and Miſs <hi>Martha</hi> had completed me to her entire ſatisfaction; ſhe took all the pins out of an old green one, which was originally in the ſhape of an heart, but had, by looſing a great part of its inſide, through various little holes, quite loſt its form; and which, that ſhe might find thoſe pins which had gone through the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021187_0013_0FB26AE530ECFE70"/>
ſilk, ſhe cut open the old pincuſhion, and then ſtuck all ſhe could find upon my ſides in the ſhape of letters, which ſhe afterwards changed to flowers, and a third time altered to ſtars and circles; which afforded her full amuſement until bedtime. Miſs <hi>Charlotte,</hi> though her Mamma had given her as much ſilk as her ſiſter, had only cut it to waſte; while <figure/>
                        <hi>Martha,</hi> after ſhe had finiſhed me, had ſaved the reſt towards making a houſe wife for her doll. I could not help reflecting when I ſaw all <hi>Charlotte's</hi> little ſhreads and ſlips littering the room; what a ſimple method may little
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021187_0014_0FB26AE82735A0D0"/>
girls are apt to get into, of waſting every thing which their friends are ſo kind as to give them, and which, properly employed, might make them many uſeful ornaments for their dolls; and ſometimes pretty trifles for themſelves. <hi>Charlotte Airy,</hi> as ſuch children uſually are, was deſirous of having every thing ſhe ſaw, ſo that her drawers were always filled with bits of ribbon, pieces of ſilk, cuttings of gauze, catgut, and muſlin; that if ſhe wanted to find her gloves, tippet, tuckers, or any part of her dreſs, ſhe was obliged to ſearch for them in twenty different places, and frequently to go without what ſhe was looking for. <hi>Martha,</hi> on the contrary, by taking care of what might be of uſe, and laying it by in a proper place, always knew where to find what ſhe had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for directly. So that it frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that ſhe went out with her Mamma, when her ſiſter was forced to ſtay at home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had loſt ſomething which had delayed her ſo long to look for, that ſhe could not get ready in time. This very circumſtance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the day after I became acquainted with her, to her no ſmall mortification. Mrs. <hi>Airy</hi> was going to ſee the exhibition of pictures, at the Royal <hi>Academy,</hi> and told her daughters if they behaved well, they ſhould accompany her; as Mrs. <hi>Gardner</hi> and her niece Miſs <hi>Lounge,</hi>
                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:021187_0015_0FB26AF22F04C228"/>
would call at one o'clock. After breakfaſt, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> who had found the mould of an old button in one of her papa's waiſtcoat pockets which ſhe had been rummaging, and had cut to pieces an axletree of a little cart, which belonged to her brother, to make a ſpindle, in order to convert it into a teatotum; with which ſhe was ſo much entertained, that ſhe was very unwilling to leave it to go to work, though her mamma repeatedly told her, ſhe would not be ready againſt Mr. <hi>Gardner's</hi> coach came. "Yes I ſhall, Ma'am!" ſaid ſhe, and played on. "Do pray go to work, <hi>Charlotte!"</hi> 
                        <figure/>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:021187_0016_0FB26AF6422B8AC0"/>"Preſently, Ma'am." But ſtill ſhe thought ſhe would give it another twirl. "You ſhall not go if you have not finiſhed your morning buſineſs!" "In a minute I will!" And ſo ſhe ſimply idled away her time, without heeding her mamma's admonition, until near an hour beyond her uſual time of beginning. This put her into ſuch a hurry to finiſh, when ſhe found it was ſo late, that ſhe ſtitched ſome wriſtbands ſhe was about, and which were intended for her grandpapa, ſo very bad, they were obliged to be undone; and that made her ſo croſs, that in pulling out the work, ſhe broke the threads of the cloth, which entirely ſpoiled it. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte</hi> was a very fair complexioned pretty girl; but you cannot imagine how ugly her ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour made her appear; nor how much more agreeable her ſiſter looked, who was much browner, was pitted with the ſmall pox, and a much plainer child. I ſurveyed them both as I lay on the table, where my Miſtreſs had placed me to ſtick her pins in as ſhe took them out of a ſhirt collar which ſhe was putting on, <hi>Martha</hi> looked ſo placid and cheerful, and ſeemed to ſpeak ſo kindly when ſhe aſked a queſtion, that it made her really charming; while <hi>Charlotte,</hi> who had a very pretty mouth, and very regular features, ſtuck out her lips in a manner ſo unbecoming, and toſſed about
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021187_0017_0FB26AF719CA6AC0"/>
her head with ſuch very illiberal jerks, that ſhe loſt all her natural advantages in her wilful ill humour. A perſon happening to call on Mrs. <hi>Airy,</hi> to ſpeak about ſome particular bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, ſhe left the children to attend him; and <hi>Martha,</hi> who pitied her ſiſter's diſtreſs, and ſaw the impoſſibility of her finiſhing the taſk ſhe was ordered to do, very kindly offered to aſſiſt her, without which, ſhe never could have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed it. But their Mamma at her return, immediately ſuſpected the caſe to be as I have told you, and enquired what help <hi>Charlotte</hi> had had in her abſence? They were both girls of too much honour to deny the truth, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of her frankly owning her ſiſter's kindneſs, Mrs. <hi>Airy</hi> permitted her to retire, in order to prepare for the intended expedition. But, alas! poor <hi>Charlotte,</hi> who indeed was not always ſo good as ſhe ought to have been, was not to go that morning, although her Mamma had conſented to it. <hi>Betty,</hi> who came to put on her ſrock, was not very fond of her, for ſhe was ſometimes apt, when her Mamma was not in the way, to ſpeak very haughtily, and in a manner quite unbecoming a young lady. Unfortunately ſhe forgot herſelf on the preſent occaſion, and very rudely ſaid, "You muſt come and dreſs me, and you muſt make haſte, or I ſhall not be ready." <hi>Muſt I?</hi> replied <hi>Betty,</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="unknown:021187_0018_0FB26AF8C1BEA7C0"/>
                        <figure/> That is, if <hi>I pleaſe,</hi> Miſs <hi>Charlotte,</hi> though you forgot to put that in, and unleſs you ſpeak in a prettier way, I will not help you at all. "Then you may let it alone, for I won't aſk you any otherwiſe," and away ſhe went, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door after her, to call her ſiſter, who was ready and waiting for the coach in her Mamma's room. <hi>Martha</hi> ran directly, and began to pin her ſrock as ſhe deſired. But a new diſtreſs aroſe, for as ſhe was too careleſs ever to retain any of my fellow ſervants (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called a <hi>Pinchuſhion</hi>) in her ſervice, ſo ſhe had not one pin to proceed with after three;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021187_0019_0FB26AFEDFD17E18"/>
which had ſtuck at one end of me, had been employed. Neither of them choſe to apply to <hi>Betty,</hi> becauſe they were ſure from <hi>Charlotte</hi>'s ill behaviour to be denied; and ſhe would not permit her ſiſter to aſk her Mamma, for fear of an enquiry which might not turn out to her credit. So, in ſhort, they both traverſed the room backwards and forwards, and were quite overjoyed when they found two (one of which proved to be crooked) between the joining of the floor. Then they each returned and took me up repeatedly, and examined me over and over, though they were convinced I had been empty long ago. At laſt, a loud rap at the door announced Mrs. <hi>Gardner</hi>'s arrival. The ladies were called, and <hi>Martha</hi> obeyed, though with reluctance to leave her ſiſter; and <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte,</hi> with conſcious ſhame, and remorſe for her paſt conduct, and heart heaving ſobs of diſappointment, ſaw them drive away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her. I was left upon the table in the hurry of my miſtreſs's departure, and <hi>Charlotte</hi> took me up, and earneſtly wiſhed ſhe had had a pincuſhion of her own: and ſo I ſhould think would any one, who had experienced the want of ſuch a uſeful companion; though unleſs it is well furniſhed with pins, it is in itſelf but of little aſſiſtance, as ſhe had but too fatally found. The ſlatternly appearance, and real inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021187_0020_0FB26B02EFBA4300"/>
                        <figure/> which many ladies ſuffer from a neglect to provide themſelves with, and to retain a few ſuch neceſſary implements of female eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy about them, is really inconceivable by any perſon who is accuſtomed to a proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of attention. <hi>Trifles</hi> are frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the giddy and thoughtleſs as of no moment, when <hi>eſſentials</hi> are taken care of; but it is the repetition of <hi>trifles</hi> which conſtitutes the chief buſineſs of our exiſtence. In other words, people form their opinion of a young lady from her perſonal appearance; and if, becauſe ſhe is at work, and in want of pins,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021187_0021_0FB26B059E367F40"/>
and deſtitute of a <hi>Pincuſhion,</hi> ſhe has quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed herſelf, and her clothes are dropping off, ſhe will be thought a negligent ſlattern; which, I ſuppoſe, is what no one would chuſe to be eſteemed. So, when children accuſtom themſelves to loll their elbows, ſtoop their heads, ſtand upon one foot, bite their nails, or any other ungraceful actions, it makes them diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, and the objects of diſlike to all their friends, and every one who is acquainted with them. And it is very fooliſh to imagine, that becauſe they are not in company with <hi>ſtrangers</hi> it does not ſignify; for ill habits, when once they are acquired, are very difficult to leave off; and by being uſed to do an unpolite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, frequently they will do it without recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the impropriety, when if they thought, perhaps, they would have on no account been guilty of it. Miſs <hi>Lounge,</hi> the young lady who accompanied Mrs. <hi>Airy</hi> to the exhibition, was a ſtriking example of what I mentioned above. She was about ſixteen, and very tall of her age; ſo that ſhe appeared quite womanly in perſon, though her manners were to the higheſt degree u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>genteel. Her method of walking was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably unpleaſing. She had a ſtrange way of toſſing her legs round at every ſtep, as if ſhe was making circles. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> her arms were croſſed over each other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> awkward a manner, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021187_0022_0FB26B0791ED2C20"/>
ſo unfaſhionably low, that it made her ſtill more ungraceful in her appearance; beſides this, ſhe had acquired a drawling tone in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which made her completely an object of diſguſt; as it was entirely the conſequence of her own neglect, and therefore, was by no means deſerving of that pity which is due to every natural defect, or accidental deformity. She returned with her aunt to dinner; and Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> was quite aſhamed of entering the drawing room, though ſhe was now dreſſed, and had promiſed Mrs. <hi>Betty</hi> ſhe would behave with more civility for the future. But the fear of her Mamma's expoſing her folly to Mrs. <hi>Gardner,</hi> had made her diſlike to ſhew herſelf in company; and the conſciouſneſs of having deſerved reproof, made her juſtly apprehenſive of receiving it. She did not venture down ſtairs, therefore, until dinner was on the table; and then, with her neck and face as red as bluſhes could make them, ſhe paid her compliments to the company, without daring to look at her Mamma. So cowardly and uncomfortable does the thought of a wrong action make thoſe who have committed it, even when they are not certain it will be publickly known. And this reminds me of a few ſtanzas I found in Miſs <hi>Martha's</hi> work bag one day, when ſhe put me into it with her ſciſſars (by miſtake I ſuppoſe)
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021187_0023_0FB26B0922BE4980"/>

But as they are ſo very <hi>apropos</hi> to my preſent ſubject, I will preſent my readers with them; and as the author is quite unknown, if they ſhould not be thought deſerving of a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reception, they will not at leaſt ſubject the writer to any mortification.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021187_0027_0FB26B1460A6BBF0"/>
amendment for the future, after a gentle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand, when ſhe came down the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nothing further paſſed upon the ſubject. <hi>Charlotte</hi> was ſo conſcious of her late miſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, that ſhe had ſcarce courage to enquire what entertainment they had received from a ſight of the pictures at the exhibition; and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> who was extremely delicate and attentive, very cautiouſly avoided the ſubject, for fear of appearing to inſult her ſiſter, or to remind her Mamma of the reaſon which had occaſioned her abſence from the party. Mrs. <hi>Airy</hi> enquired if <hi>Martha</hi> had not particularly taken notice of a large picture, which repreſented the death of <figure/>
                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:021187_0028_0FB26B15D868B7E0"/>
Earl <hi>Goodwin.</hi> She replied, that Mrs. <hi>Gardner</hi> had pointed it out to her obſervation; but that ſhe had not remarked any particulars, except the figure of a King, and a large company at dinner. I will tell you the ſtory then, my dear, to which that picture refers.</p>
                     <p>In the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the confeſſor, in the year 1042, Earl <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who had been acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the murder of Prince <hi>Alfred,</hi> was at dinner with the King at <hi>Windſor</hi>; and taking a piece of bread, called God to witneſs his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and wiſhed if he uttered any thing but the truth, that the next mouthful he eat might choke him. Which accordingly happened, and the bread ſtuck in his throat and he died immediately at the table. Don't you think, my dear, added Mrs. <hi>Airy,</hi> it was a juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his untruth; and an awful judgment for calling God to witneſs to a falſehood? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Ma'am, I think it was quite dreadful; but are you ſure that this account is true? for though it is certainly very wicked to tell a lye on any occaſion, yet, as ſometimes many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are thus guilty, I wonder that ſuch events do not more frequently happen! You know that Miſs <hi>Ryeby</hi> ſaid ſhe had not been writing laſt week, although you ſaw that her fingers were inked; and <hi>Charlotte</hi> had ſeen her doing it; why then, did not the ſame accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:021187_0029_0FB26B240B3EC0F0"/>
to her? "Becauſe, my love, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch crimes do not always immediately follow the commiſſion of them; but you may be ſure that the remorſe of conſcience, and the ſecret uneaſineſs of mind which the guilty ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, is a very great unhappineſs, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and the fear of a future account after death, beſides the idea of preſent detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ſuch a degree of miſery as no other puniſhment can equal. As to your queſtion, whether I believe this account to be true? I certainly do! It was an extraordinary event which was recorded at the time it happened, and which every hiſtorian has mentioned ſince, and faithfully tranſmitted to us. This is the beſt authority we can have for any fact which happened before our own time, and therefore entitled to our belief. But why ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are ſo rare, is not to be wondered at; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know that wicked people will be puniſhed hereafter; and though ſuch inſtances ſometimes happen to teach others to be good, and to make them afraid of doing what will make them liable to ſuch terrible vengeance, yet, in general, a crime of this kind does not meet with immediate chaſtiſement; becauſe, after death, as I have before told you, thoſe who have been wicked, will ſuffer ſuch miſery as their ſins deſerved. Beſides which, the liar
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021187_0030_0FB26B256A1E1EA8"/>
is at preſent deteſted by every one, and loſes all the advantage of confidence, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of being believed: Even when he does ſpeak truth, he is liable to be ſuſpected, and his word is doubted on all occaſions." The converſation was here interrupted by the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of two young ladies with their Mamma, who came to pay a morning viſit to Mrs. <hi>Airy</hi>; but as they did not ſay any thing worth the attention of my readers, I ſhall not trouble myſelf to repeat more of what paſſed than may be imagined, from the comments of my miſtreſs and her ſiſter, with which I ſhall preſent them.</p>

I wiſh, added ſhe, I could ſpeak as faſt as ſhe does. To talk ſo faſt, my love, ſaid her Mamma, is by no means any accompliſhment; and I am far from your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in ſo highly admiring the merits of Miſs <hi>Lucy.</hi> She chatters ſo quick, as frequently not to be underſtood; and has a very ſilly trick of beginning every ſentence with a laugh, than which nothing can be more illbred. The perſon who is ſpeaking, ſhould never laugh, if ſhe can help it, at her own wit, if ſhe deſigns to excite mirth, or to meet with approbation

                        <figure/> from others. But without any ſuch intention, <hi>Lucy</hi> aſſumes an affected giggle whenever ſhe attempts to ſpeak. She has likewiſe a very unbecoming pertneſs in her manner, and by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent interruptions when her elders are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe engaged, renders herſelf extremely diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. I would have you, my good girls, poſſeſs that deſirable degree of proper courage, as never to feel aſhamed of ſpeaking when it is neceſſary; but I think it is an unpleaſing ſight to perceive a young woman, or child I ſhould ſay, for <hi>Lucy</hi> is young enough for that epithet, affecting to underſtand every thing, and giving
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021187_0032_0FB26B2D8B0C1830"/>
her opinion unaſked, upon ſubjects, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expoſe her ignorance and preſumption. This is aiming at a character to which ſhe has no pretenſions; and by wiſhing to riſe into a woman before ſhe has reached the age of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſhe is deſpiſed for her vanity, and loſes that eſteem ſhe might have attained by a proper degree of humility, and a better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her ſtation. This obſervation, my dear <hi>Martha,</hi> I would particularly addreſs to you; as you are generally thought uncommonly tall, and are uſually imagined to be much older than you are. This I know you fancy to be a compliment, which always appears to give you pleaſure; but remember, that, if you aſſume airs of womanhood, and affect to be thought farther advanced in age, you will have the leſs allowance made for any errours you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and conſequently meet with contempt where you might otherwiſe have eſcaped cenſure. Youth, and inexperience, are juſtly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to excuſe any ſlight inadvertence in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or want of grace in appearance; but if you chuſe to be thought of more conſequence, you muſt likewiſe expect, that the notice you may attract will not always be favourable to your vanity. I aſſure you, I think Miſs <hi>Jenny Chantillon</hi> is much more agreeable than her ſiſter, as ſhe has courage ſufficient to reply to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021187_0033_0FB26B30EC33E330"/>
any queſtion, and to ſpeak diſtinctly when ſhe is particularly addreſſed, without enquiring in <hi>Lucy</hi>'s manner, into the reaſon of every word which is uttered, and deciding every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument according to her own fancy: and, I dare ſay, if you will be careful to obſerve, you will find that <hi>Jenny</hi> always meets with attention from the company, while <hi>Lucy</hi> is frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, by being enjoined to ſilence, and by her hearers turning from her with diſdain. In ſhort, my dear, it requires a great deal of thought and propriety, to behave in an agreeable manner, at your age. It is beſt not to be anxious to be taken notice of, ſince that eagerneſs always defeats its aim. Girls have not had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of experience to teach them wiſdom; and when once they are engaged in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and find themſelves attended to, their volatile ſpirits hurry them on, with the deſire of obtaining applauſe for their wit, to ſay things which are ſometimes neither delicate or prudent; and which they may, when they have time to reflect, long have reaſon to repent having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently uttered. Any reſtraint at ſuch a time, is, I know, always eſteemed an ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured interruption, and is apt to damp their harmony, and lower their ſpirits. I would therefore warn you of the danger before hand, that your own prudence may be a check to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021187_0034_0FB26B39307238C0"/>
that unlimited indulgence, which at ſuch a period is liable to exceſs: and, I dare ſay, that your good ſenſe will teach you, that my admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions are always intended for your advantage. To impreſs this deeper upon your mind, I will repeat to you a few lines which were wrote to me, when I was young, by my aunt, and which, as they frequently occurred to my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, I found to be ſingularly uſeful.<figure/>

                     <p>The ladies now all retired to dinner, but I am ignorant of what paſſed there, as I was left upon a piece of embroidery, which my miſtreſs was covering with ſome white paper to keep it clean; and ſhe did not fetch me until after tea; when ſhe carried me in her hand down ſtairs with her work, to ſhew ſome ladies who were aſſembled in the drawing room. I then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021187_0036_0FB26B3C38FFB0A8"/>
her into what was uſually called the green parlour, as the furniture was all of that colour; where ſhe went to play with her young viſitors, whoſe names were <hi>Eliza Meekly</hi> and <hi>Julia Norris.</hi> They amuſed themſelves with playing on the harpſichord, while Miſs <hi>Martha</hi> perſonated the muſick-maſter, and <hi>Charlotte</hi> choſe to teach them dancing. Some <figure/> part of the evening they played at going to the exhibition; and juſt as they determined to viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the pictures, the footman came to acquaint the young ladies, that their coach was ready. Miſs <hi>Meekly</hi>'s bib was unpinned, and <hi>Martha</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:021187_0037_0FB26B4447138218"/>
gave me into her hand in a hurry, while ſhe was looking for her cloak. So without recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting that I was another's property, <hi>Eliza,</hi> put me into her pocket, made a very elegant courteſy, and ſtept into the carriage. I felt really very ſorry to part from a family with which I had been ſome time connected; and to one of whom I owed my being a <hi>Pincuſhion.</hi> But my new miſtreſs was ſo very engaging, that I was in hopes ſhe would take care of me, and not leave me about to the mercy of a little kitten, who jumped into her lap the moment ſhe got home; and who afterwards friſked away with a little taſſel which dropped off from one corner of a work bag which lay on the table. But before I proceed with my hiſtory, it will be neceſſary to introduce my readers to Miſs <hi>Meekly</hi> and her companions, and to make them better acquainted with this new family, who are all of them deſerving their notice.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Stanley,</hi> to whom the houſe belonged, was the widow of a clergyman, who had at his death left her in rather indigent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and ſhe had been adviſed (to ſupport herſelf and two younger ſiſters who lived with her) to take a ſmall number of young ladies to board. Her number was confined to ſix; of whom two were thoſe I have above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The others were three ſiſters, whoſe
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:021187_0038_0FB26B4DAB274590"/>
names were <hi>Saxby,</hi> and a Miſs <hi>Una</hi>; who, for her ſweetneſs of temper, and excellence in every accompliſhment, was eſteemed ſuperiour to all the reſt of her companions. <hi>Harriet Una,</hi> was couſin to Miſs <hi>Meekly,</hi> and they uſually ſlept together. She was juſt turned of thirteen, was tall and large; had light brown hair, blue eyes, and a fine complexion: But her good-nature, and willingneſs to oblige every one, made her the general favourite, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her to univerſal eſteem.</p>
                     <p>When the young ladies retired to bed, <hi>Eliza</hi> found me in her pocket, and told <hi>Harriet,</hi> ſhe was afraid Miſs <hi>Airy</hi> would want her <hi>Pincuſhion</hi>; and ſhe was more concerned, as the family were to go into the country very early the next morning, and ſhe ſhould have no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to return it. However, continued ſhe, I will make a new one to preſent Miſs <hi>Airy</hi> with, when I ſee her; and I will keep this, as I have not one at preſent, my kitten having pulled mine to pieces this morning; but I will take care this ſhall not come to the ſame miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance. I was glad to hear that was her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as I ſhould by no means have liked the thoughts of ſharing the fate of my predeceſſor.

At this time Mrs. <hi>Stanley</hi> entered the room to wiſh them a good night, and to ſee if they were properly taken care of. I am very unhappy to night, ſaid <hi>Eliza,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe was gone; and I feel aſhamed of receiving Mrs. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s kiſſes, becauſe I behaved in a manner I am ſure ſhe would not approve. What have you done, my dear couſin, replied <hi>Harriet,</hi> to make your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo uneaſy? I will tell you, anſwered Miſs <hi>Meekly,</hi> though I do not like to confeſs my weakneſs. Juſt before dinner, Miſs <hi>Charlotte Airy</hi> aſked me to eat ſome preſerved plums, which ſhe ſaid had been made a preſent of to
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021187_0040_0FB26B521A9C87D0"/>
her Mamma, and which came from <hi>Portugal.</hi> They were very ſweet and luſcious, and as I am not allowed to have any thing of that kind, I refuſed her offer. But when we had dined, ſhe preſſed me again, and laughed at me ſo much for being ſo fooliſh, as to imagine any thing ſo innocent could hurt me; but that ſhe ſuppoſed, as I went to <hi>ſchool,</hi> my <hi>miſtreſs,</hi> for ſo ſhe ſneeringly called Mrs. <hi>Stanley,</hi> would <hi>whip</hi> me if I did. That at laſt, overcome with her perſecutions, and vexed to be treated ſo much like a baby, and as if I was afraid of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, I took the plum, and have not been eaſy ſince. And now, my dear <hi>Harriet,</hi> what ſhall I do? Suppoſe Mrs. <hi>Stanley</hi> ſhould aſk me whether I have eat any thing lately which I ought not; and if ſhe does not put that queſtion, I feel ſo undeſerving of her careſſes, that ſhe will ſee by my looks I have behaved improperly. I am very ſorry, replied Miſs <hi>Una</hi>; but as you are ſo ſenſible it was wrong, I may ſpare my recriminations. However, I think the nobleſt reparation you can now make, would be honeſtly to inform Mrs. <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> of the crime, and the ſincerity of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret for having been guilty of it; ſhould it be diſcovered by any other means, you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit her eſteem, and loſe that confidence, with which you are at preſent favoured: And by
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021187_0041_0FB26B535E61F058"/>
ſuch an unſolicited confeſſion, you will reſtore ſatisfaction to your own conſcience, and be certain of her approbation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliza</hi> was convinced of the propriety and juſtice of her friend's advice, and promiſed to comply with it the next morning. But her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive timidity prevented her making uſe of ſeveral opportunities which preſented, though the ſubject occupied all her attention, and ſhe could ſcarce think of any thing elſe. She again applied therefore to <hi>Harriet,</hi> and told her it was impoſſible for her to ſummon up courage to do as ſhe had deſired; and begged ſhe would, from her, acquaint Mrs. <hi>Stanley</hi> with what had happened. Miſs <hi>Una,</hi> in the mildeſt terms, complied with her requeſt; and at the ſame time very generouſly commending her honour on every occaſion, and urging her preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs to engage Mrs. <hi>Stanley's</hi> compaſſion. Miſs <hi>Meekly,</hi> when ſhe was acquainted with her couſin's having revealed this ſecret, which had oppreſſed her mind, was very unwilling to attend her to the lady abovementioned. But ſhe received her with the greateſt affection and tenderneſs; and after expreſſing, in the warmeſt terms, her approbation of ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous confeſſion, added "You need never my dear girl, be afraid either of anger, or puniſhment, when with ſuch a degree of frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021187_0042_0FB26B55A1FDEF50"/>
you acknowledge any fault you have committed. Be aſſured, your friends will be always willing to pardon thoſe errours which you promiſe to amend; but let the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance warn you, my <hi>Eliza,</hi> never to be led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to actions which you know are improper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the company you are with may ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule your refuſal. Miſs <hi>Charlotte Airy,</hi> is, in my opinion, a very naughty girl, to endeavour to perſuade you to do any thing which you have been forbidden. And I hope from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe you have ſuffered, you will reflect on the folly of complying with any propoſals, which your conſcience ſuggeſts to you is wrong. Do not be afraid of being laughed at for being good. Every perſon of real ſenſe will eſteem you for your reſolution: and becauſe a ſilly girl may <hi>ſneer</hi> at your apprehenſion of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will be much more ridiculous, and wicked at the ſame time, to be guilty of what you are conſcious is a crime, for which you will <hi>deſerve,</hi> and perhaps <hi>receive</hi> correction. Beſides, <hi>one</hi> bad action, is but too often the cauſe of the commiſſion of others; and when once we have deviated from what is right in a ſmall inſtance, it is frequently the occaſion of accumulated guilt. I will tell you an inſtance of this kind that may illuſtrate my meaning, and which, as I was acquainted with the perſon
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021187_0043_0FB26B5CB2FF5410"/>
who is the ſubject of it, will perhaps make a deeper impreſſion on your mind.</p>
                     <p>A young lady whoſe real name I ſhall (for the ſake of charity) conceal under that of <hi>Lloyd,</hi> and who was, my dear <hi>Eliza,</hi> nearly of the ſame age with yourſelf, was educated with the utmoſt attention; and as ſhe was an only child, was the darling of her parents, and the centre of all their future expectations. <hi>Betſey,</hi> which was her uſual appellation, went one day to viſit a companion, with whom ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely intimate; but who, unfortunately for her, was not poſſeſſed of that ſtrict honour which <figure/>

ſhould ever be the baſis and foundation of friendſhip. When they had been for ſome time at play in the garden, ſhe propoſed to go to a little ſhop in the neighbourhood to make a purchaſe of ſome gingerbread; and though Miſs <hi>Lloyd</hi> for a time objected to the propoſal without leave, againſt her mamma's repeated command; yet, her companion's laughing at her ſqueamiſhneſs (as ſhe wickedly called an adherence to her duty) prevailed over her better reſolutions, and ſhe accompanied her to the place I mentioned. As it was the only ſhop of the kind which the village afforded, the boys of an adjacent ſchool very frequently went there for the ſame purpoſe, as the two young ladies who now entered; and two of the moſt unlucky of their number, happened at that time to be bargaining for ſome ball<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They ſtaid very ſoberly until Miſs <hi>Lloyd</hi> had taken out her purſe to pay for the cakes ſhe had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed; but as the lock of her pocket book was entangled in it, it came out of her pocket at the ſame time, when one of the boys ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it from her hand, and rudely declared he would ſee its contents, and know all the girl's ſecrets. This vexed her extremely, and ſhe thoughtleſsly purſued him, as he ran away with the prize, until ſhe was a good way from home. He was joined by ſeveral of his ſchool-fellows,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:021187_0045_0FB26B5F53FDF738"/>
who took part with him, and behaved in ſo wild a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>er as to terrify her greatly. At length, however, ſhe got away from them, and ran back with all the ſpeed in her power; but as it was later than her uſual time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, her parents were uneaſy, and queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with great tenderneſs and anxiety, as to the reaſon of her ſtay. She told them, ſhe had been out with Miſs <hi>Hannah</hi> (the compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ſhe had really viſited) and her maid, and that a horſe had been near running over her, which had frightened her ſo much, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her return.</p>
                     <p>This ſtory was believed by Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Lloyd</hi> for ſome time, and <hi>Betſey</hi> who had at firſt been very unhappy at the thoughts of ſuch a wicked deceit, at length grew reconciled as ſhe found herſelf undetected. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ventured upon a ſecond tranſgreſſion, from the encouragement which ſhe fooliſhly imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the ſecreſy her firſt fault had given her; and with her intimate Miſs <hi>Hannah</hi> took another walk, without any perſon to have the care of them. But during their abſence from home, an unexpected accident puniſhed the imprudent Miſs <hi>Lloyd</hi> for her diſobedience and untruth, in a manner which will give her cauſe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentence to the lateſt period of her life; for as ſhe was croſſing a road in her return, a horſe
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:021187_0046_0FB26B635EF2A350"/>
which had been tied to the rails of a houſe at a little diſtance, broke the bridle which confined him, and gallopped away full ſpeed, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by any oppoſition, until in his paſſage the unfortunate Miſs <hi>Lloyd,</hi> who did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his approach, was thrown down, and <figure/> broke her leg in ſuch a terrible manner, as to occaſion her being a cripple ever after. She has ſince confeſſed, the conſciouſneſs of her falſhood was ſuch a conviction to her mind of the wickedneſs of her conduct, (when ſhe was made ſenſible that the accident was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of her diſobedience to her parents) that
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:021187_0047_0FB26B65D90D48C8"/>
it was more difficult to ſupport, than any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily uneaſineſs ſhe had ſuffered; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections that they would never be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in her for the future, was the occaſion of ſo much ſelf reproach as to deprive her of every enjoyment. This inſtance may ſerve to convince you, that a ſlight errour is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently without any previous intention, and when leaſt expected; ſuch crimes ſeldom occur in the cooler moments of thought (that is, when you have time to reflect on the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the action you will never be capable of committing it) and as no perſon can be ſure they would be able to reſiſt temptation, it is beſt never to do any thing which you know to be wrong, though it may appear to be in the ſmalleſt inſtance, ſince the deſire of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>trifling</hi> fault, may lead you to hide it by a falſhood, which is one of the <hi>greateſt</hi> you can be guilty of.</p>
                     <p>Miſs <hi>Meekly</hi> was convinced of the truth and propriety of this argument, and promiſed to be more attentive for her future conduct. She then joined her companions with that cheerful good humour, which diſtinguiſhed her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and attended them into the great parlour, where they uſually ſpent the morning. When they had concluded their work, writing, &amp;c. Mrs. <hi>Stanley</hi> always made them read to her,

and encouraged them to aſk any queſtion which occurred to them; to make their own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon thoſe paſſages in hiſtory which ſtruck their imaginations; or to propoſe to her any objection, which aroſe in their minds, ſhe deſired them to aſk the meaning and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of thoſe cuſtoms they did not comprehend; and by ſo doing, had frequent opportunities of improving their underſtandings. Inſtances of this kind very frequently occurred, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them with ſubjects of converſation.

divided into ſhires and counties. Mrs. <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> applied to the young ladies to know if any of them could reſolve the queſtion, but as they were all ſilent, "You ſhould endeavour, my dears, ſaid ſhe, to remember what you read, or it will be of very little advantage. I believe, <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet,</hi> you read an account of this diviſion a few months ago, when you was going through the reigns of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarchs. Don't you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the great King <hi>Alfred,</hi> in the year 886 repaired the city of <hi>London,</hi> which had been burnt by the <hi>Danes</hi> in 839, and that he afterwards divided the kingdom into ſhires, hundreds, and tithings?"

Your memory is very ſhort I am afraid, replied Mrs. <hi>Stanley</hi>; but if you was to write down ſuch particulars, you would find it of great aſſiſtance; as it appears very illiberal to be unacquainted with thoſe facts, which have occurred in the hiſtory of your native country.

For this purpoſe I think your preſent work is ſingularly uſeful, as it will ſo ſtrongly impreſs the geography of your country upon your mind, that I hope, my dear <hi>Harriet,</hi> you will never forget it. As nothing material hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to my miſtreſs, and very little variation occurred in her manner of living, I ſhall paſs over the uſual events of every day, which my readers can eaſily imagine; ſuch as her taking me out of her pocket during the time of dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reſtoring me to that place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement when ſhe had concluded, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to relate an accident in which I was very nearly concerned.</p>
                     <p>The kitten I have before mentioned, who was a great favourite with Miſs <hi>Meekly,</hi> was never allowed to enter her bed chamber; but one day, the weather being extremely warm, and the door left open, it walked in, and laid itſelf down at a little diſtance from the window, in a ſpot where the ſun ſhone; the ſhutters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half cloſed to exclude the heat. <hi>Eliza</hi> was employed in putting a pair of ruffles into
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:021187_0051_0FB26B744A06D560"/>
her jacket, and I lay in her lap ſecurely as I <figure/> imagined, until a carriage ſtopping at the gate, ſhe precipitately jumped up to look out at the viſitors, and in her haſte let me fall upon the floor. Her motion was ſo ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that I could not ſave myſelf, or check the velocity with which I was impelled. So that I unfortunately rolled on, until I touched the edge of a bookcaſe, and diſcovered myſelf to Mrs. <hi>Puſs,</hi> who hooked me with her claws, and twirled me round ſeveral times, with as much dexterity as if I had been ſpinning; or, to uſe a more proper ſimile, as if I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021187_0052_0FB26B751637AEE0"/>
a mouſe. I afforded her great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for ſome time, until at laſt I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſecond time under one of the feet of the bookcaſe, and ſo faſt wedged in, that it was beyond the art of even a kitten's invention, to extricate me from my ſituation. And Mrs. <hi>Stanley</hi> coming up ſtairs. Miſs <hi>Meekly</hi> turned out my antagoniſt, and with unavailing care ſearched for me in every drawer, on every ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and upon the bed.</p>
                     <p>Long have I remained in this dull ſtate of obſcurity and confinement, unable to make known my diſtreſs, as I want the power of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulation: at leaſt my language can be only underſtood to things inanimate as myſelf.

                     <head>THE ADVENTURES OF A PINCUSHION.</head>
                     <head type="sub">PART II.</head>
                     <p>I HAD lain ſo long in my diſmal confinement, that I began to deſpair of ever preſenting the world with any ſecond part of my adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And yet, thought I, it is very hard that a <hi>Pincuſhion</hi> ſo new, ſo clean, and ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, that might have a thouſand opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſeeing the different manners of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſhould be thus ſecluded from company, and condemned by the playful freaks of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant kitten thus to paſs away its beſt days in obſcurity. And here let me take this opportunity to ſuggeſt a uſeful hint to my young readers, which, as my inactive ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion allowed me ſufficient time for reflection, I had frequently reaſon to feel the force of;
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:021187_0055_0FB26B7D54FE0DD0"/>
                        <figure/> namely, That although I fretted and fumed every day at my unfortunate condition, I never found it was at all improved by it, or that my ill humour in the leaſt degree made me happier, or aſſiſted my eſcape.</p>
                     <p>When I determined to ſubmit quietly, I was as happy as any <hi>Pincuſhion</hi> in ſuch a ſtate of retirement could be. But when in a croſs fit I tried to roll myſelf from under the bookcaſe, I found the attempt was impoſſible to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, and I hurt my ſides againſt the foot of it. The ſpace was ſo ſmall between the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my priſon and the floor; that, I had no
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:021187_0056_0FB26B7FD82F0A40"/>
hopes of eſcape, as it was impoſſible for any broom to find its way under; or otherwiſe the cleanlineſs of Mrs. <hi>Stanley's</hi> maid would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have effected my deliverance. But, alas! of this I had no proſpect; and though my endeavours were fruitleſs, it taught me ſuch a leſſon of contentment, as I wiſh every little reader of my memoirs, may remember, and copy in their own conduct. For if they are tired of working, reading, muſick, drawing, or any other employment at home; or what is frequently the caſe, are impatient of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement and diſagreeable circumſtances of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſchool, I would have them take my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and try to amuſe themſelves when they have opportunity, and wait with patience until they are of a proper age, either to leave the place they diſlike, or have overcome the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of learning thoſe accompliſhments which are necceſſary to be acquired. For they may depend upon it, that fretfulneſs and ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour will make every condition unhappy; while a reſolution to be pleaſed, and make the beſt of every thing, is the only method to be agreeable to others, or comfortable themſelves. The foot of the bookcaſe will preſs the cloſer, when we petulantly try to eſcape; and though <hi>children</hi> are not <hi>Pincuſhions,</hi> yet they will find, that whenever they are fretful and diſſatisfied,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021187_0057_0FB26B81D1673340"/>
they will be unhappy, and never ſucceed in any thing they undertake. I hope I ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for this digreſſion, but as the event of my eſcape was ſo ſtrong in my mind, I could not paſs it by without a pauſe of obſervation. Let me now, however, proceed to inform my readers, that one fine day, when I had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to make myſelf contented, and when from the quietneſs in which I had been for ſome days, I had reaſon to believe the family were abſent, and had therefore little hope for releaſe, on a ſudden I felt the bookcaſe move, and heard the ſound of men's voices, who, after much puſhing and hoiſting, took away what had ſo long covered me from the eye of every beholder. In ſhort, I found that Mrs. <hi>Stanley</hi> had taken another houſe, as her leaſe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; and in conſequence of the removal of her furniture, I again regained my liberty. One of the porters took me up, and blew off the flew which ſo long a confinement had covered me with, and taking me down ſtairs, preſented me to a chair woman, who was hired to clean the houſe. There, mother <hi>Truſty,</hi> ſaid he, is a preſent for you, which, if you pleaſe, you may give to little <hi>Jenny:</hi> it will make her as fine as a lady. Thank you returned ſhe, I will keep it ſafe for my girl, and if you have got a bit of paper, I will wrap it up, for my hands
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:021187_0058_0FB26B88C80A7CA8"/>
art wet and dirty, and when I take any thing out of my pocket I may ſpoil it, you know. But as to making her fine, <hi>Jacob,</hi> indeed I do not deſire it; and was your preſent any thing <figure/> to wear, ſhe ſhould not have it; for I think finery is not ſuitable for us. She is a <hi>good child, Jacob,</hi> and that is better than being a lady. Well, Mother <hi>Truſty,</hi> do as you pleaſe, replied <hi>Jacob</hi>; I don't know who the <hi>Pincuſhion</hi> belonged to, ſo if you like <hi>Jane</hi> ſhould have it, why I am glad I found it. So ſaying, he complained that the weather was very hot, and after wiping his face with a coarſe apron, which
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021187_0059_0FB26B8A1F200C50"/>
was tied round him, he drank Mrs. <hi>Truſty's</hi> health; and took a good draught of porter, which ſtood on the table. He then ſat down to eat ſome bread and cheeſe, and calling a great dog which lay in one corner of the kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, made him ſet upon his hind legs to beg for ſome victuals, and afterwards bring him his knot, which he very dexterouſly did, by taking the buckle of it in his mouth, and dragging it after him to his maſter. Another trick which this animal had been taught, was to ſhut the door at the word of command; and his laſt performance to the entertainment <figure/>
                        <pb n="62" facs="unknown:021187_0060_0FB26B8B9461A2D8"/>
of my new Miſtreſs and Mr. <hi>Jacob,</hi> was to pick up his maſter's wig, and bring it upon his head, which made indeed a very droll figure to the ſpectators. At the concluſion of his meal, <hi>Jacob</hi> bid adieu to mother <hi>Truſty,</hi> and they each ſeparated to purſue their different employments. I was in the mean time laid on one of the ſhelves, curiouſly wrapped up in a bit of paper, which had fallen from the back of that very bookcaſe under which I had ſo long reſided; it was torn in two by <hi>Jacob,</hi> who took one half to put up ſome bits of cheeſe rinds for his dog; and I found it was a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of poetry, which I ſuppoſe had been ſent to Miſs <hi>Saxby,</hi> as her name was <hi>Martha.</hi> I amuſed myſelf with the peruſal of the lines, which were as follow:</p>

                     <p>The buſineſs of the day being concluded, the good mother <hi>Truſty</hi> ſhut up the houſe; and taking me down from the ſhelf, put me carefully in her pocket. We were not long before we arrived at her habitation, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021187_0062_0FB26B8F4288E918"/>
of two neat little rooms, in a ſmall houſe, about the middle of a very pleaſant lane. A clean looking boy and girl were ſitting at the door, with a coloured apron full of peas, which they were very buſily ſhelling. They expreſſed great pleaſure at the ſight of Mrs. <hi>Truſty,</hi> who I found to be their grandmother, <figure/> and with much good humour, told her they had each earned a half penny; for that Mrs. <hi>Traffick</hi> at the chandler's ſhop, had given them one penny, and promiſed them a farthing's worth of gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerbread, or a ſtale roll, for getting her peas ready for ſupper. Well, and I have brought
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:021187_0063_0FB26B9066D2E760"/>
you home ſomething, replied Mrs. <hi>Truſty</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding me to the child, who eagerly getting up to recive her preſent, had nearly overſet the apron and its contents; but her brother luckily caught it ſo as to prevent the peas from falling into the dirt. But pray, <hi>Jenny,</hi> ſtay until you have done, and have waſhed your hands, ſaid her grandmother; for it would be a pity to ſpoil this nice ſattin <hi>Pincuſhion</hi>: And what have you brought for me? cried ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy <hi>Dick?</hi> as he emptied a handful of peas into the baſon. Why nothing at all; my good boy, replied Mrs. <hi>Truſty,</hi> but a piece of bread and cheeſe; but I hope you are not jealous that your ſiſter ſhould have any thing, when you cannot partake of it? <hi>Jealous!</hi> ſaid he: No, I would go without any thing in the world for the ſake of my <hi>Jenny</hi>; and I will give her my halfpenny with all my heart, though I have ſtaid away from a nice game at cricket on the green to earn it. When I am a man you ſhall ſee how hard I will work, and take care of all the money I get, and give it to you, mother, to buy us victuals, and drink, and clothes; and you ſhall ſtay at home and knit; but never, while I have my health, ſhall you go out to ſuch hard labour as you now do. Bleſſings on my generous boy, exclaimed the tender hearted mother

                        <hi>Truſty,</hi> while the tears of affection rolled down her aged cheeks. Juſt ſuch a man was thy father, <hi>Dick.</hi> While he was alive, we never wanted for any thing. He was a good man, indeed he was; and I hope that you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him. But go, my boy! carry home your work, and bring the ſtale roll which you was promiſed; it will be much better for you than gingerbread.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jenny</hi> kiſſed her brother, and thanked him for his kind intention; but we will give the penny to our grandmother, ſaid ſhe; you know ſhe has got five pence three farthings which we have had given us already; and when there is enough we will aſk her to buy you a pair of new ſhoes; becauſe thoſe are too bad to walk with. Away ran <hi>Richard</hi> with the peas, and returned in triumph with the roll; when the little party ſat down to ſupper, with that ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good humor and cheerful contentment, which is not always an attendant on the meals of the rich and the great. But when I ſaw how very little was ſufficient (or was obliged to be ſo) for a woman who had been hard at labour all

                        <figure/> day, and two little hungry children, I could not help reflecting, how wicked it is in thoſe who are bleſſed with plenty, to be diſſatisfied with their food, and idly waſte when they are not diſpoſed to eat it, that which would keep the poor from ſtarving, and which many an unhappy child would be highly thankful to receive. When they had concluded the meal which their grandmother had brought them, <hi>Dick</hi> ran to a neighbouring pump, to repleniſh a broken red pitcher which had loſt its handle and a piece out of the top; and after they

had each of them drank with thirſty eagerneſs, he kiſſed his grandmother and ſiſter, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a good night went quietly to bed. Little <hi>Jenny</hi> followed her brother's example, as ſoon as ſhe had lain me in a drawer with great care, where all her treaſures were depoſited.

                     <p>Perhaps it may be thought an uncommon ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for little <hi>Dick</hi> to turn poet at ſo early an age, and with ſo few advantages from
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:021187_0069_0FB26BB1A5896BB8"/>
education. But there is no anſwering for the powers of natural genius, and many a one may regard an attempt as <hi>impoſſible,</hi> merely becauſe they are too indolent to exert their faculties. <hi>Richard</hi> had been taught to read and write at the charity ſchool of the pariſh where he lived; and as no application had been wanting on his part, the progreſs he made did equal credit to his own abilities, and the attention of his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with whom his merit had made him a great favourite.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jenny</hi> was likewiſe put to a ſmall ſchool at a little diſtance, by the benevolence of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar's wife, (with whom ſuch inſtances were very frequent) and by her aſſiduity recommended herſelf to her miſtreſs, who would often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her example as a pattern to the reſt of her ſcholars.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, when mother <hi>Truſty</hi> got up to her daily labour, ſhe kiſſed her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children, and told them to go to ſchool early, and not ſtay and play afterwards; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back again, for ſhe would probably come home to dinner. This they promiſed to do; and after they had learnt their leſſons, they affectionately hugged each other, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſet forward with their books in their hands. But <hi>Jenny</hi> in a few minutes returned to fetch me, in order to exhibit her new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:021187_0070_0FB26BB521B8B4A8"/>
                        <figure/>
to her ſchool fellows. We ſoon arrived at a cottage, whoſe apartments were neither large or numerous; but the exquiſite clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it was truly admirable. The miſtreſs, whoſe name was <hi>Markall,</hi> was dreſſed in a blue and white ſtriped gown, which was rather of the coarſeſt materials; but was put on with the neatneſs of a Quaker, as was a plain bordered mob, with a white cloth binder, and a coloured ſilk handkerchief; which, with the addition of a checked apron, and a black petticoat, will give a pretty good idea of her appearance.
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:021187_0071_0FB26BBB51ECE1E8"/>
She commended <hi>Jenny</hi> for coming early, and having enquired after her grandmother and brother, heard her read, and repeat the leſſon ſhe had the day before given her to learn. Soon after which, <hi>Betſey Field, Nanny Hay,</hi> and the reſt of the ſcholars arrived; among which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were likewiſe ſeveral boys. As the room door (which indeed was the door of the houſe too) was left open for the benefit of the air, and as one of the forms where the girls were at work, was placed on that ſide, they were many of them better diſpoſed to watch the paſſing of a cart, or a wheelbarrow; or to attend the flight of birds, and butterflies, than to mind their works: and Mrs. <hi>Markall</hi> puniſhed ſeveral of them, with a few ſtrokes of a little cane, which lay on her table for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>After ſhe had heard them read, they ſtood round her in a circle to ſpell; and thoſe who were ſo negligent as to miſtake, loſt their place in the ſet, and exchanged with their more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive companions. A precedency in the ring was coveted with great ardour, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged a ſpirit of emulation among them, as to ſtand firſt (which was my miſtreſs's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction) was regarded as an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuperior excellence. When they had finiſhed their buſineſs, and the wiſhed for
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:021187_0072_0FB26BBC5D287658"/>
hour of twelve ſtruck, from the church clock, which was very near Mrs. <hi>Markall</hi>'s houſe, they all made their ruſtick courteſies and bows to the Dame, and poured, like a ſwarm of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer flies, into the lane. The whole body of them ſtood for a few moments to interchange their mutual ſalutations; when ſome divided to the right hand, and the other party to the left, which led to the church porch; where they ſeated themſelves to be ſheltered from the intenſe heat of the ſun; and <hi>Jenny,</hi> with a ſmile of conſcious ſatisfaction, produced me to her companions. Though ſhe was anxious to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play <figure/>
                        <pb n="75" facs="unknown:021187_0073_0FB26BBDD8E788B8"/>
what ſhe was ſo well pleaſed with herſelf, yet ſhe began to be apprehenſive for my ſafety, when the girls, with unpoliſhed rudeneſs, all ſcrambled for a ſight of her preſent at the ſame time. At laſt the two whoſe names were above mentioned, purſued <hi>Polly Chant,</hi> who was in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of me, and after ſcuffling on the graſs, until <hi>Nanny Hay</hi> knocked her head with great violence againſt one of the tomb ſtones, and <hi>Betſey</hi> ſprained her wriſt in trying to wrench me from <hi>Polly,</hi> ſhe ran home with the prize with ſo much ſwiftneſs, as to outſtrip all her competitors. What became of poor <hi>Jenny</hi> I cannot tell, nor how ſhe bore the loſs of me; but I could not help reflecting how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it would have been, had theſe girls been ſufficiently polite, to have each ſatisfied their own curioſity, and then have reſigned me to the inſpection of others. Whereas, by all eagerly ſnatching me at once, they dirted my outſide, and pulled me quite out of ſhape; together with making them all very angry, and fooliſhly commencing a quarrel, of which the firſt conſequences were the wounds I have mentioned. <hi>Polly Chant,</hi> whoſe property I ſo unjuſtly became, was the daughter of the pariſh clerk. He was by trade a ſhoemaker, and had three children, two girls and a boy. His wife was a notable little woman, who
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:021187_0074_0FB26BBF6A4D25B8"/>
took care of ſome poultry, pigs, and aſſes, which were allowed to feed upon a green be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the houſe.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as my new miſtreſs arrived at home, her mother ordered her to prepare what was wanted for dinner; at the ſame time telling her, ſhe was much diſpleaſed that ſhe did not return from ſchool ſooner. <hi>Polly</hi> anſwered in a manner which convinced me, ſhe was more pert than prudent; and ran into a little back waſh houſe to her ſiſter, who was taking a piece of bacon out of the ſaucepan, and who likewiſe chid her delay; adding, that dinner was ready, and ſhe had been wanted to lay the table cloth. In reply to this, ſhe told the hiſtory I have juſt related, and produced me to her ſiſter, who wiping her hands on a bit of rag which hung on a nail in the window, took me up to examine: When, lo! <hi>Polly,</hi> who was at all times too haſty to attend to reaſon, not chuſing that <hi>Sukey</hi> ſhould touch me for fear of ſpoiling my beauty, haſtily ſnatched me from her, and dropped me, not into the ſauce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, which I eſcaped, but into a baſon of ſoap and water which ſtood near it, and in which Mrs. <hi>Chant</hi> had juſt been waſhing her hands. Upon this aroſe a quarrel between the ſiſters,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:021187_0075_0FB26BC5EA0DAFA0"/>
                        <figure/> which was terminated by the entrance of their father, who inſiſted upon their bringing his dinner immediately; and <hi>Polly,</hi> after having carefully wiped, laid me on a clean handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to dry. I ſtaid with this family ſome days, and was witneſs to many diſagreements between the different parties which compoſed it; but as I do not think the recital of illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral abuſe could afford any entertainment to my readers, I ſhall not trouble myſelf to repeat it. But the folly of ſuch behaviour muſt be evident to every reflecting mind,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:021187_0076_0FB26BCE5989EB08"/>
when it is conſidered, that although the ſcenes I have mentioned paſſed in the low life of poverty, yet the ſame ill humour, would occaſion equal animoſity, in the moſt affluent circumſtances. And though no ſituation can juſtify fretful petulence, yet, it is certainly more excuſable in girls, who were untaught by education, and unpoliſhed by politeneſs, than in thoſe, with whom the utmoſt care has been exerted, and who have had all the advantages of reading and inſtruction to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their improvement. That it is poſſible for good humour, and a determined endeavour to pleaſe, in a great meaſure to ſupply the deficiency of acquired graces, may be ſeen in the characters of <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Jenny,</hi> whoſe affection to each other muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt every one in their favour: And the ſame ſweetneſs of temper, will likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to my reader's eſteem, the agreeable <hi>Hannah Mindful,</hi> to whom I was given one <hi>Sunday</hi> afternoon, by <hi>Polly Chant,</hi> in a walk which they took together after church. And ſincerely glad was I to exchange miſtreſſes, as my laſt had been ſo ill tempered and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and had taken me, in ſo unjuſtifiable a manner, from the good natured little <hi>Jenny. Hannah</hi> was near fourteen years old, and the eldeſt of ſix children. Her mother was a
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:021187_0077_0FB26BCFA1076220"/>
very worthy woman, but was afflicted with ſuch bad health, that ſhe was ſeldom able to leave her bed. Her father had a ſmall farm, and was very induſtrious in his buſineſs, and very careful of his family; and I was quite aſtoniſhed to think, of how much ſervice <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's</hi> attention proved to her brothers and ſiſters; and what a comfort it was to her ſick mother, to have ſuch a good girl, in whom ſhe could confide, and to whoſe care ſhe could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt them.</p>
                     <p>After ſhe had parted from my late owner ſhe was met in her way home by the vicar, whoſe <figure/>
                        <pb n="80" facs="unknown:021187_0078_0FB26BD09C7199D8"/>
lady was mentioned as the benefactreſs of my favourite <hi>Jenny,</hi> and who with her huſband was returning to his houſe. He ſtopt at the gate, aud deſired <hi>Hannah</hi> to wait there, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe herſelf in the garden, while he went to fetch a medicine which he had promiſed to ſend to her mother; and at his return pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her with a couple of fine peaches, which he told her to eat, as ſhe was a good girl. She thanked him very civilly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wiſhing him good night, ran home as faſt as poſſible, for fear her mother ſhould want her; to whom ſhe immediately preſented her preſent, without offering to taſte either of them herſelf. A niece of Mr. <hi>Mindful's</hi> lived at this time at his houſe, whoſe name was <hi>Sally Flaunt</hi>; and who had been a half boarder, at a great ſchool near <hi>London,</hi> where ſhe was put by a relation, whoſe death had left her no friend but her uncle. She was entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided for; yet was ſo inconſiderately proud, as to make herſelf a burden to the family, inſtead of trying to be of any ſervice, which ſhe might have had ſufficient opportunity of being, as ſhe was near fifteen, and very tall of her age. When <hi>Hannah</hi> roſe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſiſt in getting breakfaſt, dreſſing her ſiſters, and making the beds, <hi>Sally</hi> would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully turn round to ſleep, becauſe it was
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:021187_0079_0FB26BD2153E6678"/>
in her ſilly opinion, unlike a lady to get up early. Without any fortune, or the ſlighteſt recommendation but her induſtry, ſhe was ever fooliſhly aiming at a rank in life, to which ſhe had no pretenſions; and without ſenſe to diſtinguiſh, that it is gracefulneſs of manners, and ſuperiour learning, that forms the eſſential difference between high life and poverty; and that merit is as much entitled to reſpect in the loweſt circumſtances of indigence, as in the moſt exalted ſtation, ſhe was ſo weak as to imagine, that by imitating ſome of thoſe foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſhe had ſeen in girls who had more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune than underſtanding, ſhe would be thought to reſemble them, and meet with that regard which is not beſtowed on riches, but on the ſuppoſed worth of thoſe who poſſeſs them. While <hi>Hannah</hi> went up ſtairs to carry ſome water gruel to her mother, ſhe diſpatched one of her little ſiſters to tell <hi>Sally</hi> that breakfaſt was ready; but as ſhe had ſlept ſo long, it was ſome time before ſhe could make her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and Mr. <hi>Mindful,</hi> who was juſtly diſpleaſed with her indolence, told one of his children to carry her milk away; for that thoſe who were too lazy to provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to be ready at the proper time, might go without food. When <hi>Sally</hi> therefore came down, ſhe was much diſappointed to
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:021187_0080_0FB26BD522710C10"/>
hear, that a faſt was for the preſent enjoined as her portion; and looking very much out of humour, ſhe walked into the garden. He followed her out; and as ſhe was turning round a little yew hedge which fronted a field, he took hold of her hand, and pulling her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kitchen, told her, he was diſpleaſed <figure/> at her behaviour. "You are very fooliſh, <hi>Sally,</hi> ſaid he, becauſe you have been to ſchool, to imagine that you have nothing farther to do, than ſet with your hands before you, and play the <hi>fine lady.</hi> You have no money to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for yourſelf, and there is no perſon will take care of you, if you do not work hard to get
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:021187_0081_0FB26BD78597EA50"/>
your bread. Behave as you ſhould, and I will treat you as my own child: but if you have too much pride to know your duty, and will not mind my advice, I will turn you out, to try where you can live better than with me." <hi>Sally</hi> knew ſhe dare not reply to this poſitive ſpeech; and fearing her uncle ſhould become more angry, ſhe promiſed to behave better, and walked up ſtairs to <hi>Hannah,</hi> who was duſting the furniture in her own room. To her ſhe related the above particulars, with the tears running down her cheeks, and with the moſt diſmal ſobs of diſtreſs and paſſion. My good natured miſtreſs compaſſionately kiſſed her, and wept to ſee her diſturbance; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, my dear <hi>Sally,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I wiſh you would try to exert yourſelf, and as you <hi>cannot</hi> be a lady, you had better endeavour to pleaſe my father. You ſee, we all live very happily, and I am ſure I would do all in my power to make you do ſo too: ſo cheer up your ſpirits, and don't weep ſo ſadly. "I can't, replied <hi>Sally,</hi> very croſsly! indeed you may, who have never ſeen any higher life; but where I was at ſchool, do you think any of the ladies ſcoured the rooms, or milked the cow, or went to ſuch work as waſhing and ironing? O! <hi>Hannah,</hi> had you ſeen the caps, and feathers, and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and gauze frocks, which they uſed to wear
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:021187_0082_0FB26BDF662F0A28"/>
on a dancing day, and how ſmart they looked in their ſilk ſhoes, or elſe red morocco ones, you would not wonder that I do not like theſe great black leather things (and ſhe ſcornfully toſſed out her foot as ſhe ſpoke.) Indeed, <hi>Hannah,</hi> I could cry, whenever I ſee you and your ſiſters clothed in ſuch coarſe gowns, with your black worſted ſtockings, and with that check handkerchief on your neck, and your round cloth caps, with that piece of linen for a ribbon. I cannot bear it! and I wiſh I was any thing but what I am." O, fie, <hi>Sally!</hi> ſaid <hi>Hannah,</hi> that is quite ungrateful for the good things which you are bleſſed with, to talk in ſuch a manner as that. "What good things? retorted the haughty girl, raiſing her voice, and growing more angry. Do you call this dowlas ſhift, this coarſe apron, this linſey wolſey gown, <hi>good things?</hi> Or do you call the brown bread we eat, or the hard dumplings you was making juſt now, <hi>good things?</hi> And, pray, this old worm eaten bed without any curtains to it, and this little window which is too ſmall to admit one's head out, and what a little hole there is, quite crammed full of honeyſuckles; or this propped up cheſt of drawers, or that good for nothing chair with a great hole in the bottom, which you know, <hi>Bet,</hi> nearly felt through yeſterday, when ſhe got upon it to reach
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:021187_0083_0FB26BE11638E760"/>
the box which holds her <hi>Sunday</hi> ſtraw hat; do you call theſe <hi>good things?</hi> becauſe if you do, I am ſorry you know no better." I ſhould be ſorry indeed, rejoined <hi>Hannah,</hi> with rather more diſpleaſure than was uſual to her, if I knew ſo much of high life, as to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with what my father and mother can afford. I think our bread is as good as any body need wiſh for? and I am ſure the dump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings you ſo ſcornfully mention, will be very well taſted and wholeſome. As to the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if it is old, I will anſwer for its being clean, <hi>Sally</hi>; and my father ſays he can nail a piece of board over that chair, which will laſt as many years as the back does. And as to our clothes, I am ſure they are whole and tight; for I would work my fingers to the bone, before I would ſee them otherwiſe. They are coarſe to be ſure; but they are as good as our neighbours, and many a one would be thankful to have ſuch to put on; and though you ſpeak ſo proudly of the houſe and every thing in it, I have ſeen the ladies at <hi>Oakly Hall,</hi> who are worth as much money as would buy all the villages for twenty miles round, come as kindly and ſit down in my mother's room, and take hold of my hand, and my ſiſter's, and ſpeak as prettily as if I had been a <hi>lady</hi> too; without looking at the chairs, or finding fault
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:021187_0084_0FB26BE2A8037FF0"/>
                        <figure/> with the bed. And Miſs <hi>Goodall,</hi> although ſhe is dreſſed ſo handſomely, never ſeems to think about it; and the laſt time ſhe ſtopt here took the loaf out of my father's hand, and ſaid, let me cut Mrs. <hi>Mindful</hi> a piece of bread and butter! I can do it very well, and it ſhall be thin, ſuch as I know ſhe can eat. And ſhe brought with her a caniſter of ſago, and went herſelf to the fire, and poured the water to mix it, and put ſome wine into it, which ſhe brought with her; and ſhewed me the way to do it, with ſo much good nature, that I don't think you need be ſo very proud, <hi>Sally,</hi> and look ſo unhappy about your ſituation. And
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:021187_0085_0FB26BE834464F18"/>
I aſſure you, ſhe has ſometimes eat our bread, and always ſaid it was very good. <hi>Hannah</hi> was here interrupted by one of her ſiſters, who came to call her to aſſiſt her mother who was going to get up. She attended her immediately, and taking me out of her pocket, into which ſhe haſtily put me at the concluſion of the above converſation, ſhe placed me on the table, while ſhe aſſiſted Mrs. <hi>Mindful</hi> in putting on a clean cap and bed gown; and after ſhe had helped her to an old elbow chair, ſhe made the bed; which, as ſoon as ſhe had finiſhed, ſhe went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the garden, and returning with a nice noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay of flowers, placed them in a little white ſtone mug upon the table, in order by their ſweetneſs, to refreſh and pleaſe her mother, as ſhe was very fond of them. She then kiſſed her with great tenderneſs, and begged her to take an egg beat up with ſome milk, which ſhe immediately got ready. Theſe little ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were all performed with ſo much alacrity and good nature, and ſuch viſible pleaſure in her countenance, as doubled the merit of all her actions. It was impoſſible inded to ſee her, without thinking how very agreeable it is in the power of good nature and induſtry, to make thoſe who have no other advantages to recommend them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="unknown:021187_0086_0FB26BEA2257CF20"/>
                        <hi>Hannah Mindful</hi> was a healthy looking country girl, her complexion was burnt by the ſun, and her hands hardened by laborious toil; ſhe was not ornamented by dreſs, though her perſon was at all times made agreeable by neatneſs: She had never been taught thoſe graces, which ſo forcibly recommend the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor to general obſervation; but a conſtant cheerfulneſs, and a deſire of obliging, which was never interrupted by petulance, made her beloved by every one who knew her. To be as good natured as <hi>Hannah Mindful,</hi> was the higheſt praiſe of every girl in the village; and every mother was ready to propoſe her conduct, as an example to her own children. If there was a piece of bread, which her ſiſters liked better than the reſt of the loaf, ſhe would ſave it for them by turns, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe had opportunity. If any of them went out to play, and forgot the buſineſs which fell to their ſhare, or which their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ordered them to do, ſhe would either fetch them home again, or, (if in her power) do it for them herſelf. By this ſhe often ſaved them from puniſhment. One day when her father had brought two ribbands from a fair, for her ſiſter <hi>Molly</hi> and herſelf, he gave <hi>Hannah</hi> the liberty of chuſing firſt. She directly took a pink, which was her favourite colour; and
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:021187_0087_0FB26BEB98C0EA00"/>
left a dark green, which was what ſhe moſt diſliked: but afterwards finding her ſiſter wiſhed for the one ſhe had choſen, ſhe gave it her immediately, with as much readineſs, as if ſhe had approved of the exchange from the preference to the colour ſhe diſliked. <hi>Sally</hi> told her ſhe thought it was fooliſh to give up <figure/> what ſhe had got in her poſſeſſion; but <hi>Hannah,</hi> with a generoſity which did great credit to the goodneſs of her diſpoſition, replied, that ſhe ſhould never have worn with comfort, what ſhe evidently ſaw her ſiſter was deſirous to obtain: and I declare, added ſhe, I feel a much higher gratification in the idea of giving
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:021187_0088_0FB26BEDE802BCA0"/>
pleaſure to my dear <hi>Molly,</hi> than I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from any difference of colour, or from a preſent of much greater value. <hi>Sally</hi> was not of that opinion; for the indulgence of pride, is the occaſion of ſelfiſhneſs, and the cauſe of the moſt deſpicable meanneſs. By wiſhing for greater riches, and deſpiſing that way of life to which ſhe was deſtined, her heart was conſtantly agitated, by anxious vexation. Whereas, <hi>Hannah</hi> was always cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, good humoured, and contented: And the ſame incidents, which to the one were the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſſatisfaction and complaint, the other ſubmitted to without repining, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced with gratitude at the felicity of her lot. And thus, my young readers, will it be with perſons of higher rank, than thoſe of whom I am now writing. If you make yourſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, becauſe ſome of your companions have more elegant clothes, or a greater variety than yourſelf; or becauſe it may ſuit the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of their parents, to make more ſplendid entertainments, than the choice or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of your's will admit; if they ride in their father's carriage, while you walk on foot and unattended, remember, that is no rational cauſe of uneaſineſs. It is not the <hi>ſtation,</hi> but the propriety with which it is ſuſtained, that is the real matter of concern. A <hi>beggar</hi> may be
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:021187_0089_0FB26BF21C3F5A90"/>
more reſpectable than a <hi>Prince,</hi> if he is ſunk to indigence by misfortune; and exerts his utmoſt powers, to act with induſtry, and maintain the proper conduct which his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires. Let me adviſe you then, not to wiſh for that finery which would be unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your circumſtances; but to ſubmit to the diſcretion of your parents, becauſe they muſt know beſt what is proper for you. <hi>Sally Flaunt</hi> had not the power to make her uncle's brown bread the leaſt degree whiter, although ſhe was too fretful to eat it with ſatisfaction. She could not enlarge the rooms, or repair the furniture, by her diſcontent; but ſhe might have been as happy as her couſin, had ſhe been diſpoſed to be good humoured. When any buſineſs is neceſſary to be performed, if it is done with ſullenneſs and ill will, it becomes the moſt laborious toil, and moſt irkſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; but if it is executed with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is much ſooner diſpatched, and the fatigue is conſiderably abated. It is time, However, to return to my own adventures, without treſpaſſing longer on your patience by my advice.</p>
                     <p>I had continued ſome time with my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, when Mr. <hi>Goodall</hi> (whoſe daughter I believe I have beforementioned) gave an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to his tenants, on account of her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:021187_0090_0FB26BF6D1382078"/>
her eighteenth year. Mr. <hi>Mindful</hi> out of kindneſs to his family, determined to ſtay at home himſelf, and take care of his wife, while he diſpatched all the young ones who were of a proper age, to enjoy an amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which would afford them ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Hannah</hi> dreſſed herſelf and two ſiſters, as neat as ruſtick ſimplicity could adorn them. They had each of them light brown ſtuff gowns, white aprons and handkerchiefs, with ſtraw hats; her own with green, and her ſiſters with pink ribbons. They had all a noſegay of flowers in their boſoms, and with the freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of innocence and health glowing in their <figure/>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:021187_0091_0FB26BF9A14067C8"/>
cheeks, prepared to ſet out for <hi>Oakley Hall. Hannah</hi> did not forget to get ready every thing ſhe thought her mother might want in her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and with a kiſs of filial affection, bade her adieu.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jack Mindful,</hi> her brother, was a lad of about thirteen, very active and ſprightly, and ſometimes apt to be extremely miſchievous. I have had no opportunity before this to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce him to the notice of my readers; but the part he took in dreſſing his couſin for the intended ſport, will make it neceſſary to exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it him on the preſent occaſion. <hi>Sally,</hi> whoſe attention was wholly engroſſed by the pride of excelling her companions in the finery of her clothes, had been for ſome days buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in mending an old ſilk coat, which had been given her during her ſtay at ſchool. It had originally been ornamented with gauze cuffs, which were grown dirty and yellow with keeping: the reſt of the trimming was ſufficiently decayed, to make it a rather deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable garb; and Mrs. <hi>Mindful,</hi> who juſtly thought ſuch ſhabby finery very improper for her niece's ſituation, inſiſted upon her going in a new garnet coloured ſtuff, which ſhe had lately bought her. This <hi>Sally</hi> was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed at, and communicated her intention to her couſin <hi>Jack,</hi> who promiſed to aſſiſt her in
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:021187_0092_0FB26BFAA8D46C50"/>
her deſign; which was, after ſhe had taken leave of Mrs. <hi>Mindful,</hi> to carry her clothes to a barn at ſome diſtance, and there put on the <hi>ſilk coat,</hi> which ſhe imagined would make her ſo much better reſpected by the family at <hi>Oakly Hall.</hi> To this place then ſhe repaired, her heart beating with expectation, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the imagination of outſhining all her companions. She had made up a new cap for the occaſion; and as ſhe was very tall and womanly in her appearance, thought if ſhe could make any ſubſtitute for a cuſhion it would much improve her faſhionable appearance. On this great occaſion, ſhe borrowed me of <hi>Hannah,</hi> who went before her couſin; as ſhe did not chuſe to have any wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but <hi>Jack,</hi> who was the only perſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with this important ſecret. At the barn then we ſoon arrived, and her ſtuff gown was thrown off with diſdain, while ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, with the aſſiſtance of an old triangular bit of a broken looking glaſs, to equip for the deſirable expedition. After placing the cuſhion,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:021187_0093_0FB26C01119148B0"/>
                        <figure/> which ſhe had taken great pains to complete, and pinning her hair over it with a piece of black ribbon, ſhe put on her cap; which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the moſt tawdry collection of old gauze, bits of ribbon, and ſlatternly taſſels, that can well be imagined. At laſt came the trial of the coat, which as it had been made very long behind, was in that reſpect tolerable; but its appearance in front was ſo ſhort, as to be really ridiculous. During the time ſhe was looking at her head in the glaſs, <hi>Jack</hi> in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round haſtily threw it down a hole which he had purpoſely contrived, and where it was impoſſible to regain it, as it was ſo inſtantly
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:021187_0094_0FB26C022241E5C0"/>
out of ſight, that <hi>Sally</hi> had not an idea where it had vaniſhed, her ſearch was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally in vain, and ſhe could only finiſh her dreſs by <hi>Jack</hi>'s direction. He pretended to admire her appearance extremely, and to make it the more complete, he had before tied a coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of ſheep's feet to a piece of ribbon, which he now pinned to her ſhoulders, faſtening them cloſe to her back with another ſtring which he likewiſe pinned down; and by way of addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſtreamers in her cap, he ſuſpended a number of bits of ſtraw, which he had tied together with a piece of pack thread. With theſe burleſque ornaments ſhe hurried with <figure/>
                        <pb n="97" facs="unknown:021187_0095_0FB26C0395D4DE00"/>
him to the <hi>Hall</hi>; and as ſhe was entering the door which led to the houſe, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of faſtening a piece of the trimming which he ſaid he could improve, he undid the lower pins, and let the ſheep's feet dance about on her back, to the unſpeakable entertainment of every beholder. The laugh which her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance occaſioned covered her with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and her pride was mortified in the higheſt degree, to find her finery treated with ſuch a degree of contemptuous mirth, inſtead of that admiration with which ſhe had flattered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The boys were eager to diſſect her head-dreſs, and <hi>Polly Chant,</hi> who was of the party, very maliciouſly pinned one of her cuffs to the table cloth, as ſhe was lolling her head on her hand to hide thoſe tears of vexation which ſhe could not forbear. Unfortunately ſhe roſe in ſome haſte, upon the appearance of Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> who entered the room to welcome his gueſts, and dragged down the ſalt ſeller, and ſeveral plates, knives, forks, and ſpoons; which had they been brittle materials, would have been certainly demoliſhed; but as the whole ſervice was of pewter, they eſcaped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt. The buſtle which this accident occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, ſtill more diſconcerted the unfortunate <hi>Sally Flaunt,</hi> who burſting into tears very haſtily left the room. In the angry jirk with
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:021187_0096_0FB26C07620025B8"/>
which ſhe walked away from the company, her two ſhoulders were ſaluted with the ſheep's feet, in ſuch a manner as to make her imagine ſhe had received a blow, which ſhe turned round very quickly in order to reſent; but the agility of her motions, only ſerved to repeat the imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined offence, the author of which, however, ſhe found it impoſſible to diſcern. But as ſhe was going through an apartment which led to the garden, ſhe diſcovered her own figure in a large pier glaſs; the ſight of which, ſo fully completed her vexation, that ſhe determined to hurry home immediately, and ſnatching her handkerchief from her pocket to wipe her eyes, ſhe whirled me out with it to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance, and without perceiving her loſs, left me to enjoy my own reflections. The thought of <hi>Sally</hi>'s ridiculous vanity entirely took up my attention. How happily might ſhe have paſſed the day had ſhe been content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do ſo in her proper character; but by aſſuming a ſuperiority to her companions, ſhe excited the contempt of <hi>Jack Mindful,</hi> who was determined to mortify her pride, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her an object of ridicule; and though his miſchievous intention was certainly extremely blameable, yet it was her own folly which put the execution of it into his power. Had ſhe not determined ſo meanly to deceive, and
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:021187_0097_0FB26C099ADFE9D0"/>
diſobey her aunt, by pretending to comply with her advice, at the very moment ſhe was preparing to act in oppoſition to it, ſhe would have eſcaped that mortification, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might excite pity, was undoubtedly deſerved.</p>
                     <p>I lay unperceived by the door of a little cloſet until the next morning; when Mrs. <hi>Betty,</hi> who came to ſweep the room, picked me up, <figure/> and laid me for ſome time on a marble ſlab, and after ſhe had finiſhed her buſineſs, I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied her to breakfaſt. My new miſtreſs was a pleaſing young woman, who was a houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid in Mr. <hi>Goodall</hi>'s family. She ſat down
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:021187_0098_0FB26C105EA1B490"/>with the laundry maid, whoſe name was <hi>Joice,</hi> and who complained very much of the heat of the weather. I have been ſo ill for ſome days paſt, ſaid ſhe, that I can with difficulty ſtand to waſh; and the heat of the fire when I am ironing, makes me much worſe than I ſhould otherwiſe be; and then Miſs <hi>Sophy</hi> is ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſhe never conſiders what will dirt her clothes, nor how much work ſhe occaſions. I am ſure her ſiſter at her age was always neat and nice with half the number of frocks and petticoats which ſhe requires. I wonder that a young lady ſhould not have more compaſſion for a poor ſervant. "That is becauſe they do not know the trouble it is, replied <hi>Betty</hi>; but indeed <hi>Joice,</hi> Miſs <hi>Sophy</hi> is the ſame
in every thing. If ſhe is cutting a piece of gauze or paper ſhe is ſure to make a litter all over the room; and I have often ſeen her cut a card into a thouſand bits on the carpet, without making any uſe of it at all; and if ſhe is undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her work, or picking her doll's clothes to pieces, ſhe will ſtrew the threads on the floor, without thinking how much trouble it gives me to take them up again. But if ſhe would but put her bits of rubbiſh into a piece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it might be taken away without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty." She will never be beloved like her ſiſter, ſaid <hi>Joice.</hi> And then ſhe does not look
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:021187_0099_0FB26C11EF968A78"/>
ſo much like a young lady; for <hi>Jerry</hi> ſays, that when he is waiting at dinner, he cannot help looking at her, to ſee how ſhe leans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the table (which is one way ſhe makes her frock ſo dirty) and takes ſuch great mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, and eats ſo exceedingly faſt, as if ſhe was ſtarving, and thought ſhe ſhould loſe her din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and ſometimes ſhe drinks without wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her mouth, and very frequently when it is not empty. "O! I have ſeen her myſelf, interrupted <hi>Betty</hi>; I have ſeen her when I have waited at breakfaſt, graſp the ſpoon in her hand quite down to the bowl of it, and my miſtreſs has told her it looked very ugly; and <figure/>
                        <pb n="102" facs="unknown:021187_0100_0FB26C136C32BA50"/>
then ſhe has altered it for a minute, but has ſoon held it as awkwardly as ever. But what I am moſt angry with her for, is ſlopping her milk, or tea, on the tables, juſt after I have rubbed them until they are as bright as looking-glaſſes; and then ſhe ſmears her hand acroſs, and all my labour goes for nothing. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how ſhe would like this hot day to have ſuch violent exerciſe. But ladies have often little conſideration for their ſervants feelings." To be ſure, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Joice,</hi> my maſter and miſtreſs, and Miſs <hi>Goodall,</hi> are very good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, <hi>Betty</hi>; and Miſs <hi>Sophy</hi> will I hope, think more of the conſequence of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when ſhe is older. I would do any thing in the world for my miſtreſs ſhe ſpeaks ſo kindly, and when I am ill, ſhe ſays, "Take your time, <hi>Joice,</hi> and don't fatigue yourſelf today, I hope you will be better tomorrow." I don't care how I ſlave when people are conſiderate, and ſeem to think I do my duty. During the latter part of this converſation, Mrs. <hi>Betty</hi> had laid me on the table, and was pinning her gown cloſe, which had before hung looſe, only faſtened with one pin at the top, and the two ſides turned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and at the concluſion of it, Mrs. <hi>Joice,</hi> who had been clearing away the breakfaſt things, folded me up in the table cloth, and
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:021187_0101_0FB26C16F2313288"/>
carrying me under her arm to the poultry yard, ſhook me out with the crumbs. She turned round at the ſame time, to ſpeak to a gardener, who was emptying ſome weeds out of his blue apron upon the dunghill, and did not ſee my <figure/> fall. After her departure, I was peck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> at alternately by almoſt all the ſowls, until at laſt I was toſſed by a bantam hen, under a little water tub, where I have lain ever ſince. My laſt unfortunate adventure has ſo dirtied my outſide, that I ſhould not now be known. But if the recital of what has hitherto befallen me has at all engaged the reader's regard, I hope I ſhall not loſe their approbation from a change of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation or appearance.</p>
