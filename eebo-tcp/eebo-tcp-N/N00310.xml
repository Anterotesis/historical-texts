            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>. In the Winter season it is cold and freezing Weather, and sometimes Snow, but commonly very clear and Sun-shine, which soon dissolves it.</p>
            <p>The Country is well Watered, the River of <hi>Delaware</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing navigable for Ships of great burthen to <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Bay of <hi>Sandy-hoock</hi> on <hi>East-Jersy</hi> is a safe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Harbour for any Fleet of Ships, which can lie there in all Weathers, and go in and out to Sea in Winter, as well as Summer, and Ships of great Burthen can lie close to the Town of <hi>New-Perth;</hi> which renders it a good Scituation for Navigation, from whence in six Hours time at most, Ships can go out into the Sea; and close by the Town of <hi>Perth</hi> runs up <hi>Rariton</hi> River. From the Falls of <hi>Delaware</hi> River the <hi>Indians</hi> go in Cannows up the said River, to an <hi>Indian</hi> Town called <hi>Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in setting up against the Stream; but they can come down
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000386_0004_0FA556D139EB7808"/>
with ease and speed; the River from the Falls runs from the North and North-West about twenty Miles, as I my self observed in my Travel so far by the River, but by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> Information, it cometh about more Easterly farther up. I have been informed, that about <hi>Minisincks,</hi> by the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, both in <hi>New-Jersey</hi> and <hi>Pennsylvania</hi> is great quantities of exceeding rich open Land, which is occasioned by wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the Leaves and Soil in great Rains from the Mountains, which Land is exceeding good, for the raising of <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax, Wheat,</hi> or any other sorts of Corn, Fruits, Roots &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Where in time may be conveniently settled a Manufacture for the making of <hi>Linnen-Cloth, Cordage, Twine, Sacking, Fishing-Nets,</hi> and all other commodities commonly made of Hemp or Flax: And after great Rains, we may bring down great quantities of Goods in flat-bottom-Boats, built for that purpose, which will then come down, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Land-floods with speed.</p>
            <p>And into this River, betwixt the Capes and the Falls, run many navigable Rivers and Cricks, some of them fifteen or twenty Miles, and others less, which Rivers and Cricks are made by the plenty of Springs and Brooks, that run out of the Country, many of which Brooks are so considerable, as to be fit to drive Mills. And above the falls, in travelling of twenty Miles by the Rivers side, I went over twenty run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Water, five or six of them being fit to build Mills on.</p>
            <p>The Country for the most part is pretty leavel, until we come about ten Miles above the Falls, where it is Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious for many Miles, but interlaced with fertile Valleys. The Bay and River of <hi>Delaware,</hi> and the Rivers and Cricks that runs into it, are plentifully stored with various sorts of good <hi>Fish</hi> and <hi>Water-Fowl,</hi> as <hi>Swans, Geese, Ducks, Wigeons,</hi> &amp;c. And a considerable <hi>Whale</hi>-Fishery may be carried on in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000386_0005_0FA556D21D8D0870"/>
the Bay of <hi>Delaware,</hi> and on the Sea-Coasts of <hi>New Jersey,</hi> there being <hi>Whale</hi>-Fisheries already begun, plenty of <hi>Whales</hi> being by experience found there, and the Winter-time being the time for the catching them, they will not thereby be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of raising there Summer-Crops; and the Oyl and Bone being good Commodities to be sent for <hi>England,</hi> there also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Bay of <hi>Delaware</hi> and <hi>Sandy-hoock, Drums, Sheeps-heads Bass,</hi> and other sorts of large Fish, which may be fit to salt up in Casks to keep for use, and Transportation also. There are great plenty of <hi>Oysters,</hi> which may be pickled and put up in small Casks for use. Likewise, on <hi>Delaware</hi> River are great plenty of <hi>Sturgion,</hi> which doubtless might be a good Trade, if mannaged by such Persons as are skilful in the boyling and pickling of them, so as to preserve them good to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and other adjacent Islands. There are also in the Springs great quantities of a sort of Fish like <hi>Herrings:</hi> with plenty of the Fish called <hi>Shads,</hi> but not like the <hi>Shads</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but of another kind, being a much better sort of Fish; the Inhabitants usually catch quantities, which they salt up, and pack them in Barrels for Winter's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>The Lands from the Capes, to about six Miles above <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Castle</hi> (which is by estimation ninety Miles) is for the most part very rich, there being very many navigable Cricks on both sides of the River, and on the River and Cricks are great quantities of rich fat Marsh Land, which causeth those parts, to some fresh People, to be some what unhealthful in the latter part of the Summer, at which time some of them have <hi>Agues:</hi> Also in and near these Marshes, are small <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000386_0006_0FA556D2C7E7FCA0"/>
would be healthful, and very little troubled with <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Also these Marshes are fit for <hi>Rape,</hi> and were <hi>Rape</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mills built, and the design mannaged, so as it would be if it were in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> a great Trade might be carried on, and many hundred Tuns of <hi>Rape-</hi>Oyl might be made Yearly, and sent to <hi>England,</hi> to the Planters inrichment; and not only so, but would be for Merchants advantage, they thereby having Goods to freight their Ships, which would tend to the benefit of the Inhabitants in general.</p>
            <p>And if those Trades and Designs are carried on to effect, as are mentioned in this Treatise, there would naturally follow Trade and Imployment for <hi>Ship-wrights, Boat-wrights, Coopers, Carpenters, Smiths, Ropers, Mariners, Weavers, Butchers, Bakers, Brewers;</hi> and many other sorts of Trades would have full Impoyment.</p>
            <p>From six Miles above <hi>New-Castle</hi> to the Falls of <hi>Delaware</hi> (which is about sixty Miles) and so to the Head of the said River, the <hi>Water</hi> is clear, fresh, and fit for Brewing, or any other use.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Air</hi> clear and good, it being supposed to be as health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as any part of <hi>England</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Land</hi> is in Veins, some good, and some bad, but the greatest part will bear good Corn, as <hi>Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats, Indian Corn, Buck-Wheat, Pease</hi> and <hi>Indian Beans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>I Answer;</hi> That although it be so, yet these Woods are made valuable by the twenty Families that are seated near them, the first ten families having been settled ten years, the last four years; for some are willing to have their Children live near them; and and they having but one hundred Acres in all, it will not be well to divide that, therefore they will give a good price for one hundred Acres, to settle a Child upon, to live by them, as experience sheweth; for in <hi>Rhode-Island,</hi> which is not far from us, Land rough in the Woods, not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ours, will sell at 40<hi>s.</hi> an Acre, which is 3<hi>s.</hi> 4<hi>d per Acre per annum.</hi> Therefore, Reader, I hope now thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there is a probability that what I here inform thee of, will prove true, casualties of Fire, &amp;c. excepted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> are but few in Number, and have been very serviceable to us by selling us Venison, <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, Peace and Beans, Fish and Fowl, <hi>Buck</hi> Skins, <hi>Beaver, Otter,</hi> and other Skins and Furs; the Men hunt, Fish and Fowl and the Women plant the Corn, and carry Burthens; they are many of them of a good Understanding, considering their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in their publick Meetings of Business, they have excellent Order, one speaking after another, and while one is speaking all the rest keep silent, and do not so much as whisper one to the other: We had several Meetings with them, one was in order to put down the sale of <hi>Rum, Brandy,</hi> and other strong Liquors to them, they being a People that have not Government of themselves, so as to drink it in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

            <p>THe <hi>Indians</hi> told us, they were advised to make War on us, and cut us off whilst we were but few, and said, They were told, that we sold them the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> with the Mach Coat they had bought of us, which caused our People to be in Fears and Jealousies concerning them; therefore we sent for the <hi>Indian</hi> Kings, to Speak with them, who with many more <hi>Indians,</hi> came to <hi>Burlington,</hi> where we had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with them about the matter, therefore told them, That we came amongst them by their own consent, and had bought the Land of them, for which we had honestly paid them for, and for What Commodities We had bought at any time of them, We had paid them for, and had been just to them, and had been from the time of our first coming very kind and respectful to them, therefore We knew no Reason that they had to make War on us; to Which one of them, in the behalf of the rest, made this following Speech <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

You are our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and we are willing to live like Brothers with you: We are willing to have a <hi>broad Path</hi> for you and us to walk in, and if an <hi>Indian</hi> is asleep in this <hi>Path,</hi> the <hi>English</hi>-man shall pass him by, and do him no harm; and if an <hi>English</hi>-man is asleep in this <hi>path,</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> shall pass him by, and say, <hi>He is an English-man, he is asleep, let him alone, he loves to Sleep.</hi> It shall be a <hi>plain Path,</hi> there must not be in this <hi>path a stump</hi> to hurt our <hi>feet.</hi> And as to the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> it was once in my <hi>Grandfathers</hi> time, and it could not be the <hi>English</hi> that could Send it us then, there being no <hi>English</hi> in the Country and it was once in my <hi>Fathers</hi> time, they could not send it us then neither; and now it is in my time, I do not believe that they have sent it us now: I do believe it is the Man above that hath sent it us.</q>

               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:000386_0034_0FA55720B499F140"/>Some are apt to ask, How we can propose safely to live amongst such a Heathen People as the Indians, whose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices leads them to War and Bloodshed, and our Principles and Practices leading us to love Enemies, and if reviled, not to revile again; and if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mitten on the one cheek to turn the other, and we being a peaceable People, whose Principles and Practices are against Wars and Fightings?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answer:</hi> That we settled by the Indians consent and good liking, and bought the Land of them, that we settle on, which they conveyed to us by Deed under their Hands and Seals, and also submitted to several Articles of agreement with us, <abbr>viz.</abbr> not to do us any Injury; but if it should so happen, that any of their People at any time should injure or do harm to any of us, then they to make us satisfaction for the Injury done; therefore if they break these Covenants and Agreements, then they may be proceeded against as other Offendors, <hi>6<abbr>viz.</abbr>
               </hi> to be kept in subjection to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Power, in whose hand the Sword of Justice is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be used by him, for the punishment of Evil-doers, and praise of them that do well; therefore I do believe it to be both lawful and expedient to bring Offendors to justice by the power of the Magistrates Sword, which is not to be used in vain, but may be used against such as raise Rebellions and Insurrections against the Government of the Country, be they <hi>Indians</hi> or others, otherwise it is in vain for us to pretend to Magistracy or Government, it being that which we own to be lawful both in Principle and Practice.</p>
            <p>Q. Whether there be not Bears, Wolves, and other Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Beasts in the Country?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answer:</hi> Yes. But I have travell'd alone in the Country some hundreds of Miles, and by missing of my way have lain in the Woods all night, and yet I never saw any of those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor have I heard that ever man, woman or child were
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000386_0035_0FA557217AA6D4E0"/>
hurt by them, they being afraid of Mankind; also, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is given to both <hi>Indians</hi> and others to kill Wolves, they being paid for every Wolfs head that they bring to the Magistrate, the value of ten Shillings; and the Bears the <hi>Indians</hi> bill for the profit of their Skins, and sake of their Flesh, which they eat, and esteem better than Deers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Q. Whether there be not Snakes, more especially the Rattle-Snake?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans</hi> Yes, but not many Rattle-Snakes, and they are easily discovered; for they commonly lie in the Paths for the benefit of the sun, &amp; if any Person draws nigh them, they shake their Tail, on which the Rattles grow, which make a noise like a childs Rattle; I never heard of but one Person bitten in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvania</hi> or <hi>New-Jersey</hi> with the Rattle-Snake, and he was help of it lay live Chickens slit assunder and apply'd to the place, which drew out the Poyson; and as to the other Snake, the most plentiful is a black Snake, its bite, 'tis said, does no more harm than the prick of a Pin.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned before, that there are a sort of troublesom Files call'd <hi>

                  </gap>
               </hi> (much like the Gnats in <hi>England</hi>) in the lower parts of the country, where the great Marshes are, but in the upper parts of the Country seldom one is seen.</p>
            <p>There are Cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s and Back-birds, which may be accounted amongst the inconveniences, they being destructive to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Corn,</hi> the Crows by picking up the Corn just as its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the blade above ground, and the Black-birds by eating it in the Year, before it be full hard, if not prevented by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after; but other sorts of Corn they seldom hurt.</p>
            <p>It is rational to believe, that all considerate Persons will sit down and count the cost before they begin to build; for they must expect to pass through a Winter before a Summer, but not so troublesom a Winter as many have imagined; for those that come there to settle now, may purchase Corn, Cattel,

and other things at the prices mentioned, and may have Houses in some of the Towns of <hi>Pennsilvania</hi> and <hi>New-Jesey</hi> on Rent, until they build for themselves, and Water-Mills to grind their Corn, which are such conveniences that we that went first partly missed of.</p>

            <p>The Lord having thus far answered our Souls desire, as to bring us to our desired Port in safety, and to remain with us, to be a Counsellor of good things unto us, let us now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this Kindness unto us by a <hi>righteous Conversation,</hi> and a <hi>pure, holy</hi> and <hi>innocent Life,</hi> that others beholding the same, may be convinced thereby, and may glorifie our heavenly Father.</p>
            <p>The Eyes of many are on us, some for Good, and some for Evil; therefore my earnest Prayers are to the Lord, That he would preserve us, and give us <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that we may be governed aright before him, and that he would give a good Understanding to those that are in Authority amongst us, that his Law may go forth of <hi>Sion,</hi> and his Word from <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> Be not backward in discharging that great Trust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to you in your respective Offices and Places, that you may be help-meets in the Restroration.</p>
            <p>And be careful to suppress, and keep down all Vice, and disorderly Spirits, and incourage Virtue, not only in the general, but every one in his perticular Family; there is an incumbant Duty lieth on all Masters of Families over their Family, therefore my desire is, that we may call our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies together at convenient times and Seasons, to wait upon the Lord, and to seek to him for <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Counsel,</hi> that his Blessings may attend us and our Families, and our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Dear Friends;</hi> be tender and helpful one towards another, that the Lord may bless and fill you with his divine Love,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000386_0039_0FA5572A0801B2A8"/>
and sweet refreshing Life, which unities our Souls to each other, and makes us as one Family of Love together: Let us not entertain any hard Thoughts one of another, but if difference should happen amongst us, let a speedy and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able end be put unto it; for if Prejudices enter, it will eat out the precious Life, and make us barren and unfruitful to God. We are not without our daily Exercises, Tryals and Temptations, therefore do desire the Lord may put it into your Hearts, to Pray for our Preservation, and our safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to you, that we may meet together again in the same overcoming Love of God, in which we parted from you.</p>
            <p>My Heart is full of Love to you, and do long to see your Faces, and to enjoy your Company, that I may more fully express that pure Love of God that Springs in my Heart unto you, then I can do by Writing.
