            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Hiram;</hi> or Jews and Gentiles uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in building the Church of God.</head>
            <p>AS a chriſtian miniſter invited to addreſs you on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, allow me to aſk your conſideration to ſome important truths, which by the divine aſſiſtance will be ſuggeſted for your moral and religious improvement, from that paſſage of the inſpired writings, recorded,
<q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>1 KINGS, v.12.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>And the Lord gave Solomon wiſdom, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him: and there was peace between <hi>Hiram</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and they two made a league to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE words call our attention to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant period in the ancient hiſtory of the providence of God, towards the church and world. What is humbly propoſed by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, is to offer ſome preliminary obſervations to elucidate the part of ſacred hiſtory, with which the words now read, have a connection,—and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028998_0005_0FDEA3D15D45E198"/>
from the example the happy peace and mutual friendſhip and eſteem, which exiſted between the ancient monarchs Solomon and Hiram, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the nature and recommend the obligations of brotherly love—and to make ſuch application, as may be ſuitable to the ſubject and occaſion.</p>
            <p>That the knowledge of the one true God, the creator of the univerſe, and of his will to mankind as the rule of duty, might not be loſt amidſt the moral darkneſs and polytheiſm which overſpread the nations of the earth; it had pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to ſelect the numerous deſcendants of the patriarch Abraham, to be the depoſitary of this ſacred betruſtment.</p>
            <p>A ſucceſſion of enlightened leaders under the divine direction, had conducted the nation of Iſrael, through perils from ſurrounding enemies, whom God had commanded them to extirpate, as unworthy longer to live, and planted them in peace and happineſs, in the promiſed land.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe heroes and ſervants of the Moſt High, David the father of Solomon, ſhone with diſtinguiſhed luſtre, as a pious patriot, and an accompliſhed ſoldier. His victorious arms had ſubdued the nations all around the borders of Paleſtine. To his ſucceſſor, he left the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poſſeſſion of an extenſive kingdom, bounded by the Euphrates—by Arabia—by the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean—by Egypt, and by Tyre.</p>
            <p>Solomon was worthy in all reſpects, to ſucceed ſo illuſtrious a father, and to aſcend the throne of a powerful kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:028998_0006_0FDEA3D490F10170"/>Tributary nations were to be held in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, factions to be cruſhed, and the people long habituated to bloody wars, and the triumphs of victory, to be formed to peaceable and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious citizens; and the civil polity and eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic government, required an arrangement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the new order of things.</p>
            <p>In ſo critical a ſituation the young monarch needed wiſdom, to preſide with dignity, and be a bleſſing to his people. "And gave him wiſdom as he promiſed him." As the many ſignal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſitions of heaven, in favor of the nation of Iſrael were intended principally with a view to the preſervation of the true religion, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that there ſhould be a common center of union; and Jeruſalem was choſen. And at that early period, when men were leſs accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the labor of rational inveſtigation of divine truths, and moſt ſtruck with the glare of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects, that the place and rites of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious homage, ſhould be magnificent and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did.</p>
            <p>The great Jehovah, ever condeſcendent to the wants and weakneſs of his creatures, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Solomon to build him a houſe, for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his glorious viſible preſence.</p>
            <p>The building aroſe, and the world admired the richneſs and ſplendor of the ſtructure, the earthly palace, and throne of the God of Iſrael. It correſponded to the great idea of Solomon, the pattern of which had been divinely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. With pious joy, he contemplated the dome, and conſecrated it to God. He aſked
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028998_0007_0FDEA3D8DE471170"/>
wiſdom, and God gave him wiſdom. His uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wiſdom appears in the ſalutary maxims and laws, and the orderly and equitable adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his government; attended with a long, peaceable and glorious reign; but principally in his ardent piety to God, and righteouſneſs to men.</p>
            <p>His natural genius was ſet off to great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by early piety. When young and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his parents taught him the leſſons of wiſdom and virtue. His early inſtruction was watered with heavenly grace. His manners were adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt accompliſhed education that a royal court could give, and where the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of piety and virtue, and every manly virtue dwelt. God was pleaſed to give him a wiſdom more than human in government, and in the arts and ſciences, and in ſubjects of philoſophy and theology, and queſtions agitated in his day; and which the wiſeſt of his cotemporaries could not explain.</p>
            <p>Egypt had long been celebrated as the ſchool of ſcience; but Solomon excelled her wiſeſt philoſophers, Heman and Ethan, Calcol and Darda. Monarchs heard the ſame of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and came to be inſtructed, or honored his court by ſplendid embaſſies. Among theſe is particularly mentioned the illuſtrious queen of Sheba, now the ancient kingdom of Abyſinia, in the interior parts of Africa. The people there ſtill obſerve many jewiſh rites in their religious worſhip; and their monarchs boaſt their deſcent from that celebrated queen. The city and kingdom of Tyre bordered upon Iſrael; and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028998_0008_0FDEA3DA60F9AE50"/>
a wiſe and religious monarch, ſat upon the throne. He had been the friend and ally of the father of Solomon, and upon the acceſſion of the ſon, he ſent to congratulate him. Hiram, tho' king over an idolatrous people, yet acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and worſhips the true God. Probably he was one of the numerous Gentile proſelytes who received the knowledge of God from the Jews. And from the ſame ſource are derived, thoſe right notions of God and duty, which are found in the writings of the philoſophers of Greece and Rome; and which are much extoled by modern infidels, while they affect to deſpiſe the divine fountain, from which they were derived. The ſouls of theſe two monarchs were formed for mutual friendſhip and eſteem. Hiram was the lover of David, and the friend and lover of his ſon. And there was peace between them. He in whoſe hands are the hearts of kings, brought this about, to accompliſh the purpoſes of his mercy to the church and world. The friendſhip and aſſiſtance of Hiram was neceſſary to Solomon, to accompliſh the vaſt work aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Neighbouring kings are uſually hoſtile, becauſe they ſtand in the way of each other's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of worldly grandeur. But thoſe two royal brothers poſſeſſed ſouls too great and good to embrace the little and unjuſt projects of kings.</p>
            <p>Solomon was the friend of Hiram through life, and found him worthy of his regard. And probably had him in view, when he penned that excellent proverb, worthy of perpetual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, "Thine own friend and thy father's friend, forſake not."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:028998_0009_0FDEA3DCA7AD6110"/>Tyre lay upon the Mediterranean ſea, and was the moſt flouriſhing trading city in the world. Navigation and commerce, of which they were the inventors, elevated them to great opulence and power. They were the firſt who carried the art of ſhip building to any degree of perfection, and navigated to foreign climes. Though ignorant of the polar properties of the magnet, and guided only by the ſtars and ſhores, yet were they very adventurous arid enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing. They had eſtabliſhed a regular commerce to the Eaſt Indies by the Red ſea, and to the ſtreights of Gibraltar. They were the mart of nations—the crowning city, whoſe merchants were princes, and the honorable of the earth. By their wealth and induſtry they had arrived at the heighth of excellence, in the various arts which embelliſhed life, and particularly in archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture.</p>
            <p>Solomon requeſted Hiram to ſend him ſome of his architects, and acknowledges their ſkill in building, and all mechanic arts to be greatly ſuperior to his own people. And the Tyrian monarch moſt readily complied with his deſire.</p>
            <p>The magnificent temple of Jehovah was eight years in building. Two hundred thouſand Jews and Tyrians labored in the work. Precious marbles were ſought for among the quarries, and hewed and poliſhed with the niceſt art; and Lebanon furniſhed the choiceſt timber. Jews and Gentiles in perfect harmony, built the houſe of God. Lively emblem of the goſpel church, built up by nations of all languages, where char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is the bond of perfection and peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:028998_0010_0FDEA3E5E4E309F8"/>The temple was erected three thouſand years from the creation, and a thouſand before the incarnation.</p>
            <p>To teach us that perfection is not the lot of mortality, the fall of the wiſe and good Solomon is recorded. He aroſe glorious, as the ſun after a night of ſtorms, and long continued his joyful courſe: but a dark cloud obſcured his beams, from which however, through the divine mercy he emerged, and bitterly laments his folly in the purſuits of happineſs, in the gaiety and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs of life, and pleaſures of ſenſe; pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing vanity and vexation upon them. His mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the daughter of Pharaoh, then the moſt powerful monarch of the Eaſt, and with other wives taken from the royal courts of neighbouring princes, though ſteps of policy to ſecure the peace and glory of his reign, yet were the unhappy occaſion of plunging him into idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry and miſery. For this, and the ſin of poliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, once ſuffered for the hardneſs of men's hearts, though a violation of the original inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Solomon and the nation were ſeverely puniſhed, by the rebellion of his children, and the inſurrection of his ſubjects, and the diviſion of the kingdom. God the ſupreme governor of nations, proſpers a people who obey his immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table laws, but frowns upon and caſts off thoſe who deſpiſe his authority.</p>
            <p>While on this part of ſacred hiſtory, ſuffer me to add, what is moſt worthy of our ſolemn conſideration, as individuals, and as members of the great community; That <hi>prevailing wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028998_0011_0FDEA3E893C3C0E0"/>
the effect of great worldly proſperty and of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man depravity, are the alone cauſe of the deſolation and ruin of a people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where is now Jeruſalem, the holy city and the holy temples, the admiration of ages? Where is Tyre the opulent, the mart of nations? Lo, the boſom of deſtruction hath paſſed over them! Behold, the beloved city trodden down by the Gentiles! Barbarous Turks and Saracens poſſeſs the once fertile land, the glorious holy mount, and theatre of God's wonderous works in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages,—the birth place of the divine Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;—that witneſſed his miracles—that heard his ſublime and heavenly diſcourſes—that ſaw him expire without the gates, upon the croſs, to make atonement and reconciliation—that beheld his glorious reſurrection, and triumphant tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the celeſtial regions, and from whence the glad tidings of ſalvation have gone forth into all lands. But now alas, it ſuffers the curſe of barrenneſs and barbarians, for the wickedneſs of them who once dwelt therein. And in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſolation it will remain, until the times of the Gentiles is fulfilled.

            <p>For ſome wonderful deſigns of providence, the people of the Hebrews are continued as a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exception from all other people, ſeparated and unmixed, tho' mixed and ſcattered, over the earth, and aliens among the nations. Times

and ſeaſons are in the hands of God, whoſe wonder working providence will accompliſh the purpoſes of his righteouſneſs, in due time. Some great events relative to the church and the world, we are ready to conjecture, art about to take place, from the preſent unprecedented convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, amazement and revolutions, among the nations of the earth.
<q>Haſten, O Lord, thy works of grace in this diſordered world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the midſt of the years make known thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! We will wait for thy ſalvation, O Lord.</q>

            <p>Sin has alſo overthrown the once famous city Tyre. Extreme opulence, the fruit of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive commerce, abuſed to promote the vices of luxury, pride, effeminacy and oppreſſion, brought upon them perpetual deſolation.</p>
            <p>Tyre was an iſland adjoining the continent.
<q>They ſhall, ſays the prophet Ezekiel, deſtroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; I will alſo ſcrape her duſt from her, and make her like the top of a rock. It ſhall be a place for the ſpreading of nets, in the midſt of the ſea, and it ſhall become a ſpoil to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>
The preſent ſtate of Tyre remarkably verifies this ancient prediction. As you ſail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the deſolate coaſt, you ſee a few ſcattering huts, and poor fiſhermen ſpreading their nets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſun burnt rocks and ruins, or hauling them to the ſhores. Let us, ſirs, guard againſt thoſe private and public ſins and vices, which have drawn down judgments upon a ſinful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and let us love and practice that univerſal righteouſneſs and virtue, which exalteth a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

From the example of that happy peace, and mutual friendſhip and eſteem, which exiſted between King Solomon and Hiram, I ſhall take occaſion to <hi>explain the nature, and recommend the obligations of brotherly love.</hi> There was peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and they two made a league to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>How good and pleaſant is it for brethren to dwell in unity together! Where mutual brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love reigns in a ſociety, there peace, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and every moral and ſocial virtue dwell. Where hatred reigns, the bands of ſociety are burſt aſunder, the fire brands and arrows of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention are ſcattered around, and death with ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmiles ſits upon the ruins. But love cements mankind together, as brethren, and ſociety is as a ſtrong and beautiful edifice.</p>
            <p>Mankind are made for ſociety. It is not good for man to be alone. And virtuous friendſhip is the foundation on which ſociety reſts.</p>

            <p>The obligations of brotherly love, charity and kindneſs, are derived from the mutual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of mankind, for the preſervation of life and the acquiſition of the means of a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exiſtence. Man is weak and wretched in ſolitude, but powerful and happy in ſociety.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:028998_0014_0FDEA3EFF6780FB0"/>This mutual love in our ſocial ſtate, the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian's maſter and Lord, hath taught us to put into practice, from higher conſiderations than meer humane principles, even from love to God, and to the Redeemer of men; that we ſhould love our fellow men, as the creatures of God and children of our univerſal father.</p>
            <p>The divine law which commands us to love our neighbour as ourſelves, and to do to others as we would that others ſhould do to us, is a moſt ſafe, diſintereſted and benevolent rule; intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to every capacity, and calculated for our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe.</p>
            <p>Chriſtianity teaches us that with the ſame ſincerity and zeal, with which we purſue our own intereſt and happineſs, we ſhould purſue alſo that of our fellow men. Our own ſelf-love is made the rule and ſquare of our love to others.</p>
            <p>Do we enter zealouſly into the defence of our reputation from the tongue of ſlander, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh our innocency, through love to ourſelves? With the ſame zeal, are we to vindicate the reputation of others. Do we overlook and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our own infirmities through love to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? So ſhould we overlook and pardon the infirmities and failings of our fellow men, through love to them. Do we labour to enjoy peace and comfort in this life, and to ſecure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal happineſs beyond the grave? With the ſame ſincerity and zeal ſhould we labor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the temporal and eternal happineſs of our fellow men.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:028998_0015_0FDEA3F562FA6C08"/>In theſe things eſſentially conſiſts genuine brotherly love, upon evangelic principles. O, ſirs, what happineſs would enſue were this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law in univerſal practice! Of this law, the divine philanthropiſt, who came down from heaven to unite himſelf to us, as our elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, has given us the illuſtrious example. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if God hath thus loved us, we ought to love me another.</hi>

            <p>"Bleſſed Redeemer, inſpire our ſouls with a portion of that celeſtial charity which thou haſt ſhewn for us!" Then would univerſal gladneſs abound, and peace and happineſs reign. All ſelfiſhneſs, fraud and violence ceaſe; and juſtice, charity and kindneſs prevail. Then would be realized the golden age, which ancient prophets have foretold, and poets often ſung.</p>
            <p>The wiſe author of our exiſtence has here pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us in ſuch a condition, that our many and various connections and dependencies, may give us abundant opportunities and occaſions, for the exerciſe of the moral and ſocial virtues; that our life may be filled up with uſefulneſs, and our character as men and chriſtians, ſupported with reputation. And by divine grace aſſiſting, we may be preparing for a more perfect ſociety in the regions of immortality, where the univerſal principle is, mutual love.</p>
            <p>Let it be our daily care to cultivate this moſt worthy principle, ſince it lives and reigns in that pure celeſtial ſociety, to which the wiſe and good only are united, and where no malevolent, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or unmerciful diſpoſition, will be admitted.

A preſent reward attends the exerciſe of charity. It relieves and comforts the mind. A generous mind feels more pleaſure in doing a kindneſs, than receiving one. It is, ſays our Lord, more bleſſed to give than to receive. He who gives you an opportunity to do good is your benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And he who beſtows a needed charity is more obliged, than he who receives. To do good then, ſirs, and to communicate forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>What ſacred pleaſure does the generous breaſt feel, who by ſympathy and kindneſs, dries up the tears of anguiſh, and drives before him mourning and woe, and lights up joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the heart oppreſſed with grief? It is as the ſerene light of the morning, ariſing upon the weary and loſt traveller, or the ſhipwrecked mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iner, after a night of ſtorms and darkneſs. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the merciful, for they ſhall find mercy.</p>

            <p n="1">1. My brethren, let grateful ſentiments ariſe to God, by whoſe diſpoſing providence, we are placed in that favorable condition, in which we may enjoy all the profits and pleaſures, of the ſocial and friendly connections, which conſiſt with this ſtate of our mortality. We live in a land of quietneſs and plenty, and heaven ſhowers down upon us, innumerable mercies, temporal and ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>Let us improve them to glorify our father in heaven, in the ways of piety and benevolence, and to do good to mankind by the uſefulneſs of

our lives. And may we eſcape thoſe evils which an ungrateful abuſe of the divine mercies bring upon men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our ſubject preſents to every ſocial inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as well as to individuals, the ſacred obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of brotherly love.</p>
            <p>The ſociety now to be formed, profeſſes this, as the ground of their inſtitution. And to take as their pattern in peace and ſocial affection, the two royal brothers and maſter builders, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram and Solomon. Between them there was peace, <hi>and they two made a league together.</hi> A treaty of national friendſhip and alliance and of a free trade and commerce, was probably formed and ratified, for the mutual benefit of Judea and Tyre; and a perſonal friendſhip and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence alſo eſtabliſhed, between the two mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs.</p>
            <p>An inſtitution founded for the promotion of mutual edification and brotherly love is uſeful and laudable. It appears from the hiſtory of operative maſonry, that regular ſocieties or lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, were formed in Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. And the circumſtances which led to this originated from one of the moſt wonderful events which the world had ever witneſſed.</p>
            <p>After a long night of ignorance and moral darkneſs, had overſpread the nations, two or three millions of people in different cruſades, led on by kings, princes and prieſts, and armed with enthuſiaſtic ardor, marched from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028998_0018_0FDEA400B57C5260"/>
of Europe into Aſia, to recover the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly city Jeruſalem from the hands of infidel Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acens. They performed prodigies of valor and violence, and with the loſs of thouſands of lives, got poſſeſſion of Jeruſalem. In their progreſs they marched thro' Conſtantinople, then the capital of the Grecian or eaſtern Roman empire, where the arts and ſciences were ſtill cultivated. The Europeans were barbarians compared with the people of the Eaſt. They were aſtoniſhed at the magnificence which they ſaw every where; and eſpecially at the noble and magnificent build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, contraſted with the thatched and ſmoaky huts, in which they lived in Europe. They were inſpired with a new taſte for architecture. Skilful maſons and builders were invited from Aſia, and ſplendid palaces, churches and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aroſe, as it were by magic. The builders found the ſecrets of their art profitable. They became opulent and powerful. Kings and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons were deſirous to be initiated into the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the geometrical proportions of maſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and architecture, and were admitted. Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſiſter-mechanic arts at the ſame time aroſe, and held within themſelves the ſecrets or myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their reſpective trades. And ſomething of this cuſtom remains to the preſent day. We hence ſee a deſerved reſpect paid to a uſeful, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical, ancient and honorable profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren and friends of this ancient and honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able order:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accept a word addreſſed to you, the dictate of benevolence, and an earneſt deſire for your uſefulneſs and reputation in life, and happineſs beyond the grave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:028998_0019_0FDEA403044F7460"/>For good and ſufficient reaſons, a ſociety may retain within themſelves, the knowledge of ſome things, which would be an advantage neither to the world, or themſelves, to reveal. Man is naturally inquiſitive. He wiſhes to know every thing. It may be uſeful policy to keep alive this curioſity. I preſume not to explain the myſteries, ſo called, of maſonry. And I ſuppoſe I ſhould not, if I knew them.</p>
            <p>To diffuſe uſeful knowledge, and increaſe in wiſdom—to extend charity and relief to thoſe whom misfortunes have reduced—to cultivate the endearments of friendſhip and brotherly love —and to enjoy the innocent pleaſures of ſociety as a relaxation from the fatigues of buſineſs; I would charitably hope, are ſome of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſecrets of your ſociety. Theſe are things pleaſing and profitable. The public laws of your fraternity are good. They exclude the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral and vicious. They demand that your members be examplary in their lives and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy citizens. They require more than this; even the acknowledgement and worſhip of God, a belief in divine revelation and reverence for the inſtitutions of our holy religion.</p>
            <p>If you act up to your principles, the influence of your ſocial combinations will never be uſed to ſerve the intereſts of a party; neither to ſow the ſeeds of faction in the community, or to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to places of public truſt, the unqualified. But while you pay the deſerved reſpect to the worthy of your own community, you will not exclude others, equally deſerving your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In your individual and ſocial character<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:028998_0020_0FDEA404889115B0"/>
ever act with integrity and impartiality; and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue ſuch a line of conduct as ſhall ſilence the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of thoſe, who may expreſs their fears, that your ſociety may have an undue influence, in any reſpect. Act worthily as men and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed maſons, and let me add as chriſtians. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low peace with all men. And may a happy ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſimplicity of innocent and virtuous manners be ever characteriſtic of the members of the VILLAGE LODGE.</p>
            <p>Though your laws do not admit into your fraternity, the fair and lovely daughters of Eve, becauſe the labors of the trowel were not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them, and the <hi>lillies toil not</hi>; yet every true maſon is by profeſſion, the protector and friend of the virtuous fair. The emblematic badges of your orders, ſtrike the mind of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>initiated brother as very ſignificant and happily deſigned.</p>
            <p>Imitate, brethren the SUN, in the diffuſion of goodneſs and uſeful knowledge all around you. He ſhines upon the evil and the good, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters joy and gladneſs wherever his light and heat come.</p>
            <p>Obſerve the ſhining STARS, their regular and harmonious revolutions. Like them be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in all uſeful labor. Take the COMPASS of propriety of behaviour; the SQUARE of rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude, in all your converſation. The PLUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINE, and LEVEL of unſhaken juſtice. The SWORD of fortitude in duty, and the TROWEL of diligence in buſineſs, cementing all labor with brotherly love; and daub not with untempered

mortar, but be ambitious to excel in every no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uſeful work. Let your life be uniform, like a finiſhed and well proportioned EDIFICE, ſupported by the comely PILLARS of virtue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, truth and friendſhip. Let wiſdom and integrity be the baſe, and charity the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and ſtrength and beauty will adorn the ſtructure.</p>
            <p>Bear the HOD of patience in the neceſſary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and ſufferings of life, and aſcend the LAD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER of honorable promotion, and be worthy of a ſeat in SOLOMON's chair. And let the white and fair APRON, be truly ſignificant of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and purity of character, and fidelity in all buſineſs. Take the HIVE of induſtrious bees, may you gather knowledge and virtue from the wide fields of nature and revelation, and your labors benefit others as well as yourſelves. And in all your profeſſions and actions, may the naked HEART, be deſcriptive of your ſincerity and brotherly love. And ſee the naked SWORD of juſtice, pointed to puniſh all falſehood and wickedneſs there. Ever live under the ſolemn, impreſſive ſenſe of the OMNISCIENT EYE of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, which ſees your ſecret thoughts, your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private ways. O may you approve your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, who is greater than your heart and knoweth all things.</p>
            <p>As the glorious STAR guided the ſages of the Eaſt, to the infant Jeſus, ſo my the bleſſed goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſins, lead you to the divine Redeemer, our ARK of ſafety. And may you ſecure the AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHOR of a good hope, and be ſupported on the boiſterous ſea of life, and in the ſtorm of death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:028998_0022_0FDEA40F6A6F9DF0"/>Theſe moral and emblematic figures, reſpected friends, calling you to virtue and to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive additional force from the ſolemn ſhroud and COFFIN, which terminate all earthly ſcenes and remind you of the ſhortneſs of your abode on earth.</p>
            <p>May your remembrance live as the ſprig of EVER-GREEN, when the graſs growing over your graves ſhall wave to the whiſpering winds! May you live and flouriſh in the bright climes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality!</p>
            <p>It is God who forms us for ſocial joys, and gives us the bleſſings of friendſhip. Let our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent recreations, and convivial comforts, be conſecrated to him.</p>
            <p>May the love and fear of God, now and ever reign in all our hearts, that we offend not that high and holy being, who is the conſtant witneſs of all our ſecret purpoſes, and public ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and will be our righteous Judge.
