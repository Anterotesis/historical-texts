            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHILE I ask your protection for these Essays, I cannot deny having myself some esteem for them. Yet permit me to say, that did I not trust to your candor and sensibility, and hope they will plead for the errors your judgment must discover, I should never have availed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the liberty I have obtainedâ€”that of dedicating these simple effusions to the greatest modern Master of that charming talent, in which I can never be more than a distant copyist.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE <hi>FIRST</hi> AND <hi>SECOND</hi> EDITIONS.</head>
            <p>THE little Poems, which are here called Sonnets, have, I believe, no very just claim to that title: But they consist of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen lines, and appear to me no improper vehicle for a single Sentiment. I am told, and I read it as the opinion of very good judges, that the legitimate Sonnet is illy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for our language. The specimen Mr. Hayley has given, though they form a strong exception, prove no more, than that the difficulties of the attempt vanish before uncommon powers.</p>
            <p>Some very melancholy moments have been beguiled, by expreÅ¿sing in verse the sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:029523_0005_0FE1BB1BFB3637E8"/>those moments brought. Some of my friends, with partial indiscretion, have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied the copies they procured of several of these attempts, till they found their way into the prints of the day in a mutilated state; which, concurring with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, determined me to put them into their present form. I can hope for readers only among the few, who to sensibility of heart, join simplicity of taste.</p>

            <p>THE reception given by the public, as well as my particular friends, to the two first Editions of these Poems, has induced me to add to the present such other Sonnets as I have written since, or have recovered from my acquaintance, to whom I had given them without thinking well enough of them at the time to preserve any copies myself. A few of those last written, I have attempted on the Italian model; with what succeÅ¿s I know not, but I am persuaded that to the generality of readers those which are leÅ¿s regular will be more pleasing.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE <hi>SIXTH</hi> EDITION.</head>
            <p>WHEN a sixth Edition of these lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Poems was lately called for, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to me, to add such Sonnets or other pieces, as I might have written since the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the fifth.â€”Of these, however, I had only a few; and on shewing them to a friend of whose judgment I had a high opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, he remarked, that some of them, partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly `The Sleeping Woodman,' and `The Return of the Nightingale,' resembled in their subjects, and still more in the plaintive tone in which they are written, the greater part of those in the former Editionsâ€”and that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, some of a more lively cast, might be
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:029523_0009_0FE1BB202F361710"/>better liked by the Public.â€”`Toujours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drix,' said my friend, `Toujours perdrix,' you know, `ne vaut rien.'â€”I am far from supposing that <hi>your</hi> compositions can be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or disapproved on whatever subject; but perhaps `toujours RoÅ¿signols, toujours des chansons tristes,' may not be so well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as if you attempted, what you would certainly execute as succeÅ¿sfully, a more cheerful style of composition.â€”`Alas!' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied I, `Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?'â€”Or, Can the <hi>effect</hi> cease, while the <hi>cause</hi> remains? <hi>You know</hi> that when in the Beech Woods of Hampshire, I first struck the chords of the melancholy lyre, its notes were never intended for the public ear! It was unaffected sorrows drew them forth: I wrote mournfully because I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy: And I have unfortunately no reason
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:029523_0010_0FE1D22E6D228CD8"/>yet, though nine years have since elapsed, to <hi>change my tone.</hi> The time is indeed arrived, when I have been promised by `<hi>the Honorable Men</hi>' who <hi>nine years ago,</hi> undertook to see that my family obtained the provision their grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father designed for them, that `all should be wellâ€”all should be settled.' But still I am condemned to feel the `<hi>hope delayed that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart sick.</hi>' Still to receiveâ€”not a rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etition of promises indeedâ€”<hi>but of scorn and insult</hi>; when I apply to those gentlemen, they will neither tell me <hi>when</hi> they will proceed to divide the estate; or, <hi>whether they will ever do so at all.</hi> You know the circumstances under which I have now so long been laboring; and you have done me the honor to say, that few women could so long have contended with them. With these, however, as they are some of them of a domestic and painful nature, I will
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:029523_0011_0FE1D1F945FFFED8"/>not trouble the public <hi>now</hi>; but while they exist in all their force, that indulgent public must accept all I am able to atchieveâ€”`Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jours des chansons tristes!'</p>
            <p>Thus ended the short dialogue between my friend and me, and I repeat it as an apology for that apparent despondence, which when it is observed for a long series of years, may look like affectation. <hi>I shall be sorry,</hi> if on some future occasion, I should feel myself compelled to detail its causes more at length; for notwithstanding I am thus frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing as an authoreÅ¿s, and have derived from thence many of the greatest advantages of my life, (since it has procured me friends whose attachment is most invaluable) I am well aware that for a womanâ€”`The post of honor is a private station.'</p>

            <p>THE Editor of this (Worcester) Edition, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have published it nearly four years since, at which time he had the plates engraved in his Office in this town. His being employed in printing larger and heavier volumes has prevented these Sonnets appearing from his PreÅ¿s till now.â€”As the Letter PreÅ¿s has been delayed, he could have wished the Engravings had been also; as in the infancy of engraving in this country, four years' additional experience to the artist would doubtleÅ¿s have produced more delicate work than what is now presented. The lovers of this Art will, however, be enabled, in some measure, to mark the progreÅ¿s of Engraving by a comparison of the Plates <hi>now</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted with these, and the Editor doubts not but a proper allowance will be made for work engraved by an artist who obtained his knowledge in this country, by whom these plates were executed, and that done by European engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who have settled in the United States.</p>
            <p>The making of the particular kind of paper on which these Sonnets are printed, is a new busineÅ¿s in America; and but lately introduced into Greatbritain; it is the first manufactured by the Editor.</p>
            <p>On the whole, the Editor hopes for the candor of those who wish well to the productions of the Columbian PreÅ¿sâ€” their favorable acceptance of this, and other volumes print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this country, will doubtleÅ¿s raise an emulation to produce others, better executed, on superior paper, and with more delicate engravings.</p>

Middleton is a village on the margin of the sea in SuÅ¿sex, containing only two or three houses. There were formerly several acres of ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its small church and the sea; which now,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029523_0124_0FE1D2F39F1B2280"/>by its continual encroachments, approaches within a few feet of this half ruined and humble edifice. The wall, which once surrounded the churchyard, is entirely swept away, many of the graves broken up, and the remains of bodies interred washed into the sea: Whence human bones are found among the sand and shingles on the shore.</p>

               <p>This elegy is written on the supposition that an indigent young woman had been addreÅ¿sed by the son of a wealthy yeoman, who resenting his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had driven him from home, and compelled him to have recourse for subsistence to the occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a pilot, in which, attempting to save a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel in distreÅ¿s, he perished.</p>

               <head>THE ORIGIN OF FLATTERY.</head>
               <p>This little poem was written almost extempore on occasion of a conversation where many pleasant things were said on the subject of flattery; and some French gentlemen who were of the party, inquired for a synonime in English to the French word fleurette. The poem was inserted in the two first editions, and having been asked for by
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029523_0128_0FE1D2F76AEC8A68"/>very respectable subscribers to the present, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed. The sonnets have been thought too gloomy, and the author has been advised to insert some of a more cheerful cast. This poem may by others be thought too gay, and is indeed so little in unison with the present sentiments and feelings of its author, that it had been wholly omitted but for the respectable approbation of those to whose judgment she owed implicit deference.</p>
