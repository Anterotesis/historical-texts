            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>AS</hi> the Subject of the following Diſcourſe, is the military Character of the greateſt General in ſacred Hiſtory, I imagined there would be a peculiar Propriety in the Inſcription of it to Your Excellency.</p>
            <p>The Sphere in which divine Providence, and the Wiſdom of the Nation, have placed You, is very honourable and important; of this the unbounded Expence of the preſent Operations, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your Management; the large Army under your Command, and the vigorous Efforts of theſe Colonies to ſtrengthen Your Hands, are the moſt inconteſtible Demonſtrations. The Eyes of anxious Multitudes are fixed upon your Excellency; as under God, the Guardian of their Lives, Privileges and Eſtates. By Your Wiſdom, Valour and military Skill, together with the Aſſiſtance of the brave Troops under your Command, they hope to ſee the Encroachments of the Enemy entirely removed, and the Peace, Liberty and Happineſs of theſe Colonies, eſtabliſh'd on a glorious and permanent Foundation.</p>
            <p>The Welfare of the Church of Chriſt, which he has redeemed by his Blood, and the Welfare of a populous, fertile and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Country, very much depend on the Succeſs of thoſe Meaſures, of which your Excellency is the <hi>CHIEF PROJECTOR</hi> and <hi>PRIME MOVER:</hi> Nay, let me add, the Glory of the Britiſh Name, the Felicity of Nations yet unborn, and all that is valuable in Life, to an Engliſh American, are deeply concerned in the Proſperity of <hi>GENERAL AMHERST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ever Wiſdom, Magnanimity, and great Abilities (and what ever elſe is good and valuable in human Nature) were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:008383_0003_102F43DF7B49C3D0"/>
in any Office, it muſt doubtleſs be ſuch an one, as that which Your Excellency ſuſtains.</p>
            <p>You will not then (I truſt) be offended with me, for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to Your Excellency, an Imitation of that celebrated Monarch, whoſe Character I have briefly hinted at, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Pages; and eſpecially with Regard to his undertaking and executing all his Schemes in a humble Dependance on the Bleſſing of God, and his earneſt Application to the Throne of Grace, for Courage, Direction and Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>It is recorded of Alexander the Great,
<q>that he held the Iliads of Homer in great Admiration; laid them under his Pillow when he ſlept, and read in them on all leiſure Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities; and that, finding Achilles to be the great Hero of that Poem, he endeavoured to emulate his Actions, and follow his Steps, as the beſt Way to Glory and to Fame:</q>
But I dare venture to affirm, that your Excellency would act a much wiſer Part than Alexander, ſhould you give that Preference to the Bible, which he gave to the Iliad, and inſtead of taking an Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, propoſe the Jewiſh Monarch for the Model of your Conduct.</p>
            <p>The Example of David, as a religious General, has this to recommend itſelf above all others, that he was a Perſon under the immediate and unerring Direction of Heaven; he was a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious King, an eminent Prophet, of ſingular Endowments and exalted Piety; he is diſtinguiſh'd in the Scriptures of eternal Truth, by that moſt honourable of all Titles, the Man after God's own Heart: Your Excellency therefore cannot copy after a more finiſh'd Pattern.</p>
            <p>In peruſing the Hiſtory and Writings of King David, Your Excellency will find, that tho' few Heroes have been more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful and accompliſh'd than this illuſtrious Monarch, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly acted with the utmoſt Diffidence of himſelf, and the moſt cordial Reliance upon Heaven.</p>
            <p>All Events are under the Controul of the ſupreme Ruler of the Univerſe; he can turn the beſt concerted Schemes into Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and baffle the Attempts of the ſtrongeſt earthly or ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Power; 'tis therefore exceeding juſt and proper, that in all
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:008383_0004_102F43E10D72A468"/>
our Enterprizes (eſpecially thoſe in which Thouſands are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd we ſhould with David, ſtrive to ſecure the Favour and Aſſiſtance of this All-wiſe, this Omnipotent, this tremenduous Being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>YOUR EXCELLENCY</hi> very juſtly receives the univerſal Applauſe of a grateful People, for the ſignal Service you have done your Country: Yet we hope this will not divert you, from ſeeking the Bleſſing of that Providence, to the Smiles of which the Succeſs of all Events, are primarily to be aſcrib'd.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the Britiſh Colonies, (I doubt not) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Appointment of a Gentleman of your Excellency's Merit and Abilities, to the Chief Command of His Majeſty's Forces in America. They reflect on the ſucceſsful Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>CAPE-BRETON,</hi> in which your Excellency had the Chief Command, with Sentiments of Gratitude too big to be utter'd: And they ardently wiſh, that all Your future Operations may be thus attended with Victory and Joy, with Honour and Safety to yourſelf, and Glory to his Majeſty's Arms.</p>
            <p>May the <hi>LORD OF HOSTS,</hi> inſpire your Excellency, with Valour, Prudence and Intrepidity, and animate your Breaſt with the Love of your Country, and a diſintereſted Zeal to promote her Happineſs! May he give you Health of Body, and Vigour of Mind; be your Guide and Support under all the weighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Concerns of your Station; proſper all your Meaſures for the public Welfare; protect your Perſon in the Day of Battle; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect your Counſels, and deliver the Enemy into your Hands; may your Name be glorious in the Britiſh Annals, and your Memory precious to the lateſt Generations: Theſe, may it pleaſe your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, are the unfeigned Deſires,</p>

Whilſt the King was retreating from his capital, many who entertained an unſhaken regard for him, pitied his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and followed after him; amongſt theſe was a very celebrated counſellor, and cordial friend to King <hi>David,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Huſhai:</hi> His interview with his royal maſter, was very tender and affectionate; for when he

overtook him on the way, and beheld the mournful and diſtreſs'd condition, to which he was reduced, by the unnatural rebellion of his ſon, he could not contain his inward grief, but rent his cloaths, and put earth on his head; profeſſing at the ſame time, his deſign to continue with him in his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and ſpend the laſt drop of blood in his cauſe.—<hi>David</hi> thank'd him for his loyalty, but withal told him, that the beſt ſervice he could do for him, in his preſent circumſtances, was to go over to his ſon <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and pretend a deſire to join with him in the conſpiracy, that ſo the prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him into his council, as a man of prime parts, he i. e. <hi>Huſhai</hi> might defeat the ſchemes of the famous <hi>Ahitophel;</hi> whoſe wiſdom <hi>David</hi> ſeem'd to dread more, than the united power of all the other rebels. — Accordingly <hi>Huſhai,</hi> willing to do his utmoſt for his royal maſter, went over to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> with a determination to counteract the advice of the ſage <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> and to inform <hi>David</hi> privately of all the meaſures taken by the enemy. When he was come into the preſence of <hi>Abſalom</hi> and had profeſs'd his deſires of ſerving him, he was readily receiv'd by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting prince, and becauſe of his ſuperior knowledge in ſtate affairs, preſently admitted to be one of his privy council. Now it muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that <hi>David</hi> had no ſooner fled from his <hi>Metropolis,</hi> than <hi>Abſalom</hi> and his men, immediately took poſſeſſion of it, and the prince having ſo far obtain'd his end, without delay, ſummon'd his council, to know what ſhould be done next: The opinion of <hi>Ahitophel</hi> was firſt requir'd, which he gave in the following manner. <hi>Let me now chooſe out</hi> 12,000 <hi>men, and I will ariſe, and purſue after</hi> David <hi>this night, and I will come upon him, while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: And all the people that are with him ſhall flee, and I will ſmite the King only.</hi> This advice of a ſudden attack, and purſuit after <hi>David</hi> and his men, whilſt they were yet in confuſion, weary and weak handed, ſeem'd, as it really was, exceeding reaſonable, and therefore was approv'd of without heſitation, by <hi>Abſalom</hi> and his party; yet before he would put it into practice, according to <hi>David</hi>'s conjecture, he demanded the opinion of <hi>Huſhai:</hi> This faithful miniſter, well knowing how much the life of his ſovereign, would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd by the execution of <hi>Ahitophel's</hi> project, endeavour'd to diſcourage it as much as poſſible, and with this view he told <hi>Abſalom, That the counſel which</hi> Ahitophel <hi>had given, was not good at that time,</hi> and as an argument to overturn it, he urg'd the extroardinary ſkill of <hi>David</hi> in military affairs, and his undaunted courage and bravery.—This was the purport of his addreſs; <hi>Ahitophel</hi> has advis'd an immediate attack upon your father's forces and a direct purſuit after him; but conſider how deſperate the king and his men will fight, at this critical juncture, even <hi>like a bear rob'd of her whelps;</hi> which may occaſion a total defeat of your army. Beſides it will be in vain to attempt to find him now, for he is ſo well vers'd in the ſtratagems of war, that he will elude your ſtricteſt ſearch; this you muſt know from what you have heard of his repeatedly eſcaping the hand of <hi>Saul.</hi> He is ſo well acquainted with caves and hiding places, that he will conceal himſelf in ſome retirement, where he cannot be found, and he will not expoſe his perſon to the firſt onſet; but when his brave, truſty and experienc'd

veterans, whoſe martial proweſs is ſo univerſally celebrated, ſhall make a breach upon your advanc'd guards, as ſurely they will do, from their advantageous ſituation, and uncommon vigilance; then they will make a warlike ſhout and ſay, <hi>There is a ſlaughter amongſt the people that follow</hi> Abſalom: <hi>And when</hi> this report is heard by our men, <hi>he who is valiant among us, whoſe heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear;</hi> the braveſt ſoldier in our army will be ſtruck with a panic, and all our troops, <hi>even all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>will be affrighted</hi> at the remembrance of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted valour, and that of his brave ſoldiers, <hi>and flee before them: For all</hi> Iſrael <hi>knoweth that thy father is valiant;</hi> they have had the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted proofs of it, and they know that, <hi>thoſe which are with him are valiant men.</hi> Since then this is the caſe, and we ſhould run a dreadful riſque, to attack ſuch a brave body of deſperate and warlike men, with an army only of 12,000, and in the night, <hi>I therefore counſel that all</hi> Iſrael <hi>be generally gathered together, from</hi> Dan <hi>even to</hi> Beerſheba, <hi>as the ſand that is by the ſea, for multitude, and that thou go to battle in thine own perſon;</hi> and by having ſuch numbers on our ſide, we ſhall make ſure of victory.—This counſel pleas'd <hi>Abſalom</hi> and his men, and was prefer'd to that of <hi>Ahitophel.</hi> The argument which moved them to it, was the extraordinary valour of <hi>David</hi> and his ſoldiers, ſet forth in the moſt ſtriking colours; they were particularly intimidated by the repreſentation, which <hi>Huſhai</hi> made of the warlike and intrepid diſpoſition of <hi>David,</hi> and his ſkill and experience in military affairs.—This point <hi>Huſhai</hi> particularly preſs'd upon <hi>Abſalom,</hi> when he told him in the words of my text, <hi>Thy father is a man of war;</hi> that is, a brave, watchful, experienc'd, good and hardy ſoldier, and therefore it will be no eaſy matter to ſubdue him, or take him by ſurpriſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe words naturally lead me,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. To enquire into the military character of King <hi>David,</hi> and then to urge the ſoldiers to the imitation of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Then I am to enquire into the military character of King <hi>David.</hi> This will be equivalent to ſhewing what is neceſſary to conſtitute a good ſoldier.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then, David <hi>was endued with natural courage and valour.</hi> His heart was as the heart of a lion, bold, intrepid and dauntleſs; he was an enterpriſing and fearleſs man from his youth; this is evident from many particulars recorded by the ſacred hiſtorian; before he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to <hi>Saul,</hi> whilſt he was yet a youth, he bore the character of a mighty valiant man, and a man of war. When he tended his father's ſheep, a lion ruſh'd among the flock and ſeiz'd a lamb; whereupon he boldly aſſaulted the furious beaſt, ſlew him, and deliver'd the lamb out of his mouth; he ſlew a bear alſo upon a ſimilar occaſion, 1 Sam. 17. When <hi>Goliath</hi> of <hi>Gath,</hi> the Philiſtine champion, a perſon of a gigantic ſtature, and formidable appearance, had defied the whole army of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and none of them dared contend with him in ſingle combat, but fled from before his face; <hi>David,</hi> tho' a youth, was concern'd at the reproach of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſaid; <hi>who is this uncircumciſed Philiſtine, that he ſhould defy the armies of the living God?</hi> He thus addreſs'd King <hi>Saul,</hi> when he beheld
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008383_0008_102F43EB04022F20"/>
him dejected at the cowardice of his troops, <hi>Let no man's heart fail, becauſe of him, thy ſervant, will go and fight with this Philiſtine.</hi> After this he went out, ſlew <hi>Goliath,</hi> beſtrode his dead body, and cut of his head with the giant's own ſword. This was a ſignal proof of a brave and undaunted ſpirit, thus to face and contend with a man, the terror of whoſe voice and aſpect had made all <hi>Iſrael</hi> afraid: After <hi>David</hi> had thus ſlain and beheaded the champion of the Philiſtines, he was promoted by King <hi>Saul,</hi> to be general of his forces, or (as the ſcriptures expreſs it) <hi>he was ſet over the men of war.</hi> In that ſtation he behaved very gallantly, and grew ſo faſt into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that he was eſteem'd and extol'd above his royal maſter; he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd himſelf by repeated victories over the Philiſtines, and perform'd ſuch glorious exploits, that the women publickly ſang his praiſes, ſaying, Saul <hi>hath ſlain his thouſands, but</hi> David <hi>his ten thouſands.</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came envious of <hi>David</hi>'s increaſing popularity, and ſought to kill him; he devis'd this expedient to execute his purpoſe.—He propos'd to give his daughter in marriage to <hi>David,</hi> upon this condition, that he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him the foreſkins of an hundred Philiſtines; hoping he would fall by their hands: <hi>David</hi> was well pleas'd with and readily aſſented to the propoſal: He went out, and inſtead of an hundred, he obtain'd the foreſkins of two hundred Philiſtines. When the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> with a conſiderable army, had burnt <hi>Ziklag,</hi> and carried away the women and children captives, he with a band conſiſting only of 400 men, purſu'd after them, gave them a total defeat, and recover'd the priſoners and the ſpoil out of their hands. From all theſe, and ſundry other paſſages of ſacred writ, it appears, that <hi>David</hi> was naturally a man of undaunted courage; he was not afraid of plunging into the thickeſt fight; he was not intimidated by the moſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like appearance, or the haughtieſt ſpeeches, but chearfully and eagerly aſſaulted the braveſt adverſary: He never diſcover'd a timorous diſpoſition, but remain'd unruffled and unaw'd, amidſt the moſt dreadful ſcenes of ſlaughter. Now every good ſoldier ought to reſemble <hi>David</hi> in this, for 'tis a ſhame for a ſoldier to be a coward. Thoſe who are diſtitute of courage, do great injury in the day of battle, to the army, to which they belong, diſheartning others by their ſcandalous example.—They dare not fight themſelves; but by their <hi>timorous conduct,</hi> they terrify others; ſuch perſons had better be removed from an army, than continued in it; For many battles have been loſt by means of the panic and confuſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd by a number of fearful men; which, the braver part of the army would have gain'd, had the cowards been abſent. A ſoldier's breaſt ſhould glow with martial fire; his ſoul ſhould be daring and fearleſs. <hi>David</hi>'s heart (as before obſerv'd) was like the heart of a lion; and when he ruſh'd to attack the foe, it was fill'd with inexpreſſible ardor. This ardor of the heart can only be well underſtood by men of courage, who know it by experience. There is a certain enthuſiaſm which animates brave minds, when they are in battle, which 'tis impoſſible by words minutely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe; without ſomething of this in his diſpoſition, I think a man ſhould not devote himſelf to a military life; yet if he has, he ſhould endeavour to acquire it by prayer to God, and meditation on the bold and glorious exploits of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:008383_0009_102F43EC91B51C90"/>Secondly, David <hi>was entirely acquainted with every branch of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that related to his duty as a ſoldier.</hi> Saul informed the Ziphites, <hi>It had been told him, that David dealt very ſubtilly.</hi> David was the moſt celebrated general of his age, for his ſkill in military affairs; he knew full well how to exerciſe the bow and the ſhield, and to handle the ſword and the ſpear; he knew when to advance, attack and purſue, and when to avoid a battle or make a retreat; he knew how to maintain his ground, and poſt his troops to the beſt advantage. The Scriptures relate, that when David went out, whitherſoever Saul ſent him, he behaved ſo wiſely, that the King, on the account of his ſkill, <hi>ſet him over the men of war, and he was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſight of all the people, and alſo in the ſight of Saul's ſervants,</hi> 1 Sam. xviii. 5. The ſacred hiſtorian informs us, that he was prudent in matters, <hi>i. e.</hi> a ſkilful officer; he was advanced for the Sake of his Dexterity in the art of war, to be captain over a thouſand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xviii. 13. And when he was a general, he diſcovered his ſkill in military affairs and characters, by chuſing the beſt men to ſerve under him, who obſerved the ſtricteſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and <hi>were moſt expert in war.</hi> We read concerning the men that came to <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war; they were armed with bows, and could uſe both the right hand, and the left, in hurling ſtones, and ſhooting arrows out of a bow,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11th and 12th Chapters.</p>
            <p>DAVID was well verſed in the ſtratagems of war; knew how to thwart and diſconcert the ſchemes of the enemy, and kept his ſpies to inſpect their conduct, and give him intelligence of their proceedings. Thus he ſent <hi>Huſhai</hi> to watch the motions of the rebels, and battle the meaſures urged by <hi>Ahitophel;</hi> which he accordingly did, and privately ſent meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to acquaint his royal maſter of it. <hi>David</hi> ſecretly came on the back of the Philiſtines, and by the ſuddenneſs of his attack, gave them a total defeat, purſued after them, and took all their baggage and ſpoil, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> v. 25. He was wary, and upon his guard, againſt the contrivances of his foes, and always eluded, or fruſtrated their deſigns, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xvii. 9. &amp;c. He was well acquainted with caves, lurking places, and inacceſſible retreats, where he frequently concealed himſelf, and from which he often attack'd the enemy to great advantage, and ſurprized them on a ſudden, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxvi. He was acquainted with the art of fortification; <hi>for he took the city of</hi> Jebus, <hi>repaired the fortreſs</hi> Millo, <hi>and built round about, from</hi> Millo <hi>and inward:</hi> He underſtood the method of defending a Place, ſcalling a high wall, or taking a ſtrong hold by aſſault, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> v. 7, 8. Thus, then, <hi>David</hi> was not only a brave, but a ſkillful hero; he was well acquainted with military affairs; and ſo ſhould every good ſoldier be. I don't pretend to delineate preciſely, the particulars of knowledge in the art of war; which ought to be ſtudied and attained, by one who would make a figure in that profeſſion; this is out of my province: I only aſſert, that theſe particulars, be they what they will, ſhould be familiar to a good officer or ſoldier; for without the knowledge of them, their characters would be very incompleat. This is very evident from the Difference betwixt a veteran, or regular, and a raw provincial; he who would become an accompliſh'd ſoldier,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008383_0010_102F43EE270F92A0"/>
ſhould learn to be dexterous and active, in the uſe of the ſword and firelock; be acquainted with every branch of his duty, ſerve under an experienced general, and learn the art of war from him: He ſhould read ſuch books as treat on the ſubject of his occupation, the deſcriptions of ſieges and fortification, the hiſtories of all preceeding battles, ſtratagems, victories; and the ways whereby they were obtained, or loſt, ſhould be carefully pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed by him; none ſhould be preferred in an army, who are ignorant of military affairs: The placing of raw and unexperienced men, in any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant poſt, has often proved fatal to a warlike enterprize. <hi>David</hi> choſe ſkillful men for his commanders; he ſtudied the art of war himſelf, and <hi>had his officers teach the children of Judah the uſe of the bow,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> i. 18. Modern officers ſhould be emulous to imitate the royal monarch in this; inſtructing the men committed to their care, and their men ſhould readily ſubmit to their inſtructions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>David was a regular and obedient ſoldier;</hi> he obey'd command, and follow'd the direction of his ſuperiors, without the leaſt heſitation; and to the great peril of his life, the ſacred hiſtorian informs us, That <hi>David went out whitherſoever Saul ſent him;</hi> and when the King ſignified his deſire to have him go on a ſcouting party, and procure him an hundred foreſkins of an hundred Philiſtines: The thing pleaſed <hi>David,</hi> he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went out, and inſtead of an hundred foreſkins, he obtained double that number. Thus every ſoldier ſhould, with the utmoſt readineſs, obey the will and direction of his ſuperiors. If ſoldiers deſert their poſt, fly from their colours, or refuſe to obey command, defeat and loſs of victory muſt needs enſue: 'Tis their indiſpenſible duty to ſubmit to their leaders, without murmuring or mutiny: Stubbornneſs in ſoldiers, wears a dark and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aſpect, with regard to the ſucceſs of any warlike enterprize. I wou'd therefore ſtrongly urge it upon them, to propoſe the obedience of the jewiſh king for a model of their conduct.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. <hi>David's breaſt was animated with a fervent love to his country;</hi> he was deeply concerned for its honour; and more eſpecially as the true church of God, as pure and undefil'd religion, exiſted in it. When <hi>Goliath</hi> of <hi>Gath,</hi> had challenged his countrymen, and they were afraid to engage with him; <hi>David</hi> was concern'd at the reproach of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> indignation was enkindled in his boſom, againſt his cowardly brethren; his heart burnt to fight the Philiſtine, and roll away the reproach from <hi>Iſrael.</hi> When he beheld the giant, ſtriding with haughty ſteps, before the jewiſh armies, and heard him defying the braveſt of them, and challenging them to ſingle combat, his ſoul was all on fire to meet him. He cried out with the utmoſt ardour, <hi>Who is this uncircumciſed Philiſtine, that he ſhould defy the armies of the living God?</hi> And he ran to meet the Philiſtine, and quickly put an end to his proud and confident boaſting. When the Iſraelites were routed by the Philiſtines, and <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> were ſlain on mount Gilboa, <hi>David</hi> lamented over them, ſaying, <hi>The beauty of Iſrael is ſlain upon the high places; how are the mighty fallen! tell it not in Gath, publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Aſkalon, leaſt the daughters of the Philiſtines rejoice, leaſt the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the uncircumciſed triumph.</hi> This admirable elegy diſcovers what a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008383_0011_102F43F2D950E948"/>
tender ſenſe he had of the honour of his country, and how ardently he wiſhed its welfare and proſperity: That he loved his countrymen, is alſo evident from the following pathetic ſpeech, which created him a ſtrong intereſt in their hearts, <hi>Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my fleſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xix. 12. When he lived amongſt the Philiſtines he could not forget his dear Country, but fought valiantly againſt her enemies. <hi>Iſrael</hi> always lay near his heart, and he was ready to plunge himſelf in the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for her defence: Tho' his Country ſometimes treated him with baſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, yet they could not deſtroy his natural affection, or abate the ardour of his publick ſpirit: He was a diſtinguiſh'd patriot, and preferred the welfare of his nation, to his own life; of this you may behold a moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demonſtration, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxi. Chap. 17th Verſe, when the deſtroying angel brandiſh'd the ſword of divine vengeance over Jeruſalem, and ſlew multitudes of her inhabitants; <hi>David</hi> fell on his face before God, and ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned, and done evil in thy ſight; but as for theſe ſheep, what have they done? Let thine hand, I pray thee, O lord my God, be on me and my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe; but not on thy people that they ſhould be plagued.</hi> David loved the church, as well as the ſtate; he pray'd earneſtly, and fought bravely in her behalf. The conſideration that true religion might ſuffer, if the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites were defeated, made him exert himſelf with redoubled vigour, againſt the enemies of both. Now, you, my brethren, to whom this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is directed, ſhould ſtrive to have your hearts influenced by the ſame generous motives, which ſo intenſely warmed the breaſt of this Hebrew champion: You ſhould conſider that in the preſent war with France, the true proteſtant religion, the lives and properties of your countrymen, and all that is near and dear to them, lies at ſtake: If the enemy ſhould prevail, then farewell to liberty of conſcience, the free enjoyment of our civil and ſacred Privileges, and every thing elſe that is valuable in human life: If the enemy ſhould prevail, then your friends, brethren and fellow ſubjects, muſt die, or ſuffer the greateſt extremities; therefore, if you have any regard for theſe endearing objects, the proteſtant intereſt, and a bleeding country; let theſe tender conſiderations excite you to exert yourſelves with the utmoſt vigour in the day of battle; like David, reflect upon the reproach brought upon the britiſh arms, by the cowardice, neglect, or treachery of ſome of its unworthy ſons; and let your hearts be ſenſibly touch'd by the reflection: Endeavour to wipe away the ſhame and diſgrace which they have ſo plentifully heaped on the nation, and let your boſoms beat in your country's cauſe. A Heathen could ſay, <hi>Dulce et decorum eſt pro patria mori; it is pleaſant and honourable to die for our country;</hi> but how much greater reaſon has a chriſtian to ſay ſo:
<q>Our children are dear to us, our wives are dear to us, ſo are our Parents, our kinſmen, our friends and Acquaintance:</q>
But eſpecially the church of Chriſt, and the privileges of our moſt holy religion; but our country contains within it all theſe objects of endearment, therefore every good ſoldier, every real chriſtian, ſhould be ready to lay down his life for his COUNTRY.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. DAVID <hi>was a loyal ſoldier, and true to his king.</hi> Tho' <hi>Saul</hi> treated him with the blackeſt ingratitude, defrauded him of his promiſed reward,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008383_0012_102F43F5DBAC4250"/>
and ſeveral times made attempts upon his life; yet he could not be induced by this ungenerous treatment, to rebel againſt his king: Nay, whilſt <hi>Saul</hi> was purſuing after him, and thirſting for his blood, and an opportunity offered of ſlaying him, in the Cave of <hi>Engeddi,</hi> he could not be prevailed upon to do any thing more than barely to cut off the ſkirt of his garment. In the wilderneſs of <hi>Ziph,</hi> where <hi>Saul</hi> had deſigns upon his life, he came to his tent whilſt he was aſleep, and took away his ſpear only, when he might as eaſily have taken away his life. This, as well as his expreſſions to <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> and his other officers, ſhew'd how much he reverenced the Lord's anointed. When <hi>Abiſhai</hi> ſaid unto him, in the wilderneſs of <hi>Ziph, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand: Now, therefore, let me ſmite him, I pray thee, with the ſpear:</hi> He replied, <hi>Deſtroy him not, for who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lord's anointed, and be guiltleſs?</hi> Immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when Saul awoke out of his Sleep, he called him, his Lord and his King, and acknowledged himſelf his ſubject and ſervant, ſaying, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth my Lord thus purſue after his ſervant? for what have I done, or what evil is in me?</hi> In the Cave of Engeddi, when David's men advis'd him to ſlay Saul, he ſaid unto them, the Lord forbid that I ſhould do this thing unto my maſter, the Lord's anointed; peruſe alſo his addreſs to Saul, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. from 8 to the 15th Verſe. After Saul was ſlain on mount <hi>Gilboa,</hi> David diſcovered his loyalty to him, by commanding the meſſenger to be executed, who declared he had put him to death; and by compoſing that pathetic elegy, wherein he bewails the fall of his royal maſter, in the moſt plaintiff and melancholly ſtrains. Now a good ſoldier like David, ſhould be loyal to his King, and ready to ſpend the laſt drop of blood in his cauſe. If the jewiſh Hero was ſo ſtrongly attached to a cruel and oppreſſive monarch, who thirſted for his blood, and treated him with the baſeſt ingratitude; ſurely you, my brethren, who have the honour of ſerving <hi>the beſt of Kings,</hi> are under ſuperior obligations, to promote the glory of his arms, with all your abilities, and fight for his dominions, which have been moſt unjuſtly invaded: So gracious a ſovereign as his <hi>preſent Majeſty,</hi> has the ſtrongeſt claim to the love and affections of every true Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton: And all who enjoy the benefits of his <hi>royal favour,</hi> ſhould be ready to ſupport his meaſures with their lives and eſtates. KING GEORGE THE SECOND, is the FATHER of his people; the preſent grand and expenſive praparations to protect his American ſubjects, from the bloody Deſigns of cruel and perfidious enemies, and remove their unjuſt encroachments, and all the former bleſſing of his majeſty's benign government, are the moſt convincing evidences of his paternal regard; he therefore would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name of a briton, who would not fight and die, for ſuch a GRACIOUS KING.</p>
            <p>But, Sixthly. <hi>David, tho' a brave ſoldier, was not of a violent diſpoſition;</hi> he was not inclined to take away the property of his countrymen by force of arms, without aſking their conſent, and contrary to reaſon and law: Of this his conduct in ſending his young men, civilly to aſk proviſion of the ſurly <hi>Nabal,</hi> is a plain proof; the hiſtory of the affair is to this purpoſe: David and his troops abode for ſome Time in the neighbourhood of <hi>Mount

Carmel,</hi> in which <hi>Nabal</hi> lived; during this time they defended the flocks and ſervants of <hi>Nabal,</hi> both by night and day: They uſed the latter with the utmoſt civility, and took not a ſingle lamb from the former; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one of <hi>Nabal</hi>'s young men gave this character of <hi>David</hi>'s, to <hi>Abigail; the Men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither miſſed we any thing as long as we were converſant with them.</hi> Thus did <hi>David</hi> train up his men to the greateſt order, and he ſet them a very good example himſelf; as I hinted at before; for when his army was in great want of Proviſion, inſtead of detaching an armed body to ſeize <hi>Nabal's</hi> flocks, he ſent him the kindeſt Meſſage, deſiring a little refreſhment for himſelf and his ſmall band: <hi>David ſent out ten men</hi> (ſays the ſacred hiſtorian) <hi>and he ſaid unto the young men, get ye up to Carmel and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name, and thus ſhall ye ſay to him that liveth in proſperity, peace be both to thee and thine houſe, and peace unto all that thou haſt, and now I have heard that thou haſt ſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; now thy ſhepherds that were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught miſſing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel: Aſk thy young men, and they will ſhew thee; wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes; give I pray thee, whatſoever cometh to thy hand, unto thy ſervant and thy ſon David.</hi> Thus gently did <hi>David</hi> and his men deal with the people amongſt whom they reſided; and every good ſoldier ſhould imitate their example. To ſeize violently upon the property of others, without leave or conſent; to inſult, ſtrike and abuſe the innocent; to ruſh into an houſe, with an armed mob, and take away the ſubſtance of the poor and helpleſs; to trample upon the laws and liberties of the Nation, and defraud the honeſt man of his due: All this is contrary, extreamly contrary, to the genius of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the dictates of reaſon and humanity, and is the very reverſe of that prudent conduct of the jewiſh monarch, which I have juſt now deſcribed.</p>
            <p>Seventhly. <hi>David was an hardy, watchful and active ſoldier.</hi> The ſchemes which he had concerted, he immediately put into execution; witneſs his purſuit of the <hi>Amalikites,</hi> who had taken, burnt and plundered <hi>Ziklag,</hi> and carried away its inhabitants priſoners; amongſt whom were <hi>David</hi>'s wives: He came upon them by forced marches, overtook them before they were aware of it, put them totally to the rout, and recovered his wives, the reſt of the captives, and the ſpoil, out of their hands. The activity of <hi>David,</hi> his expedition, and diſpatch in the execution of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, ſhould excite gentlemen of the military character, to vigorous mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; the advantages that will redound from them, will be unſpeakably great. Vigour and diſpatch in the execution, are ſometimes eſſentially neceſſary to render a project ſucceſsful. The conduct of that ILLUSTRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS HERO, of the preſent age, the KING OF PRUSSIA, and his uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſucceſſes, are the plaineſt proofs of the truth of theſe remarks: <hi>David</hi> (I obſerv'd was an hardy ſoldier) he frequently underwent the greateſt toils and fatigues, he very often ſlept in caves, rocks and dens of the earth; as any one may ſee who will peruſe his hiſtory; he ſuffered hunger and thirſt, and the greateſt extremities in the high places of the field. At a certain time when he was in the cave of <hi>Aduilam,</hi> and was ready to faint for water,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008383_0014_102F43FBD7954EC8"/>
three of his worthies, at the peril of their lives, broke thro' the hoſt of the Philiſtines and fetcht him water; but notwithſtanding <hi>David</hi>'s extremity, he would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord, and ſaid, <hi>My God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it me, that I ſhould do this thing: Shall I drink the blood of theſe men, that have put their lives in jeopardy? For with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.</hi> What a ſtanding reproach is this conduct of the <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> to thoſe Perſons who ſacrifice the INTERESTS OF A NATION to their luxury, effeminacy and eaſe: He that devotes himſelf to a military life, ſhould learn to endure hardneſs, to mortify his appetites, and deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when the intereſts of his country call him, to it; otherwiſe he will prove but a very indifferent ſoldier. A handful of hardy Macedonians, under the command of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> could ſubdue a united king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of effeminate Perſians: And this will always be the caſe; tender, delicate and pamper'd conſtitutions, unuſed to labour and fatigue, can never ſtand before the hardy and robuſt. <hi>David</hi> was alſo <hi>watchful,</hi> he obſerv'd all the motions of the enemy, he maintain'd a conſtant guard, and thought it a crime worthy of death, for a ſoldier to ſleep when he was ſet to keep watch. Thus, when <hi>Abner</hi> and all the guards of king <hi>Saul</hi> ſlept about him, <hi>David</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Abner, wherefore haſt thou not kept thy Lord the king; ye are worthy to die, becauſe ye have not kept your maſter, the Lord's anointed.</hi> He manifeſted an extraordinary ſpirit of vigilance, in repeatedly eſcaping the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> and avoiding the deſigns of his ſon <hi>Abſolom;</hi> compare 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxii.xxiii. and xxiv. chapters. Now every good ſoldier muſt tread in <hi>David</hi>'s ſteps; be watchful, and always upon his guard againſt the enemy; he ſhould be exceeding cautious not to be ſurprized and taken unawares.</p>
            <p>Eighthly. <hi>David was a compaſſionate and humane ſoldier;</hi> he was averſe to cruelty and revenge; as ſuch, he treated his enemies with a great deal of generoſity and a forgiving temper: This we have partly ſeen from his conduct to <hi>Saul;</hi> he forgave Shimel, tho' he curſed him moſt bitterly, and caſt ſtones and dirt at him, in the day of his trouble; he kindly received and entertained <hi>Abner,</hi> his rival's general; and after <hi>Joab</hi> had baſely murdered him, he with tears, lamented his death, and attended upon his Funeral. <hi>David</hi>'s conduct to the rebels, who had joined with his ſon <hi>Abſolom</hi> againſt him, manifeſted a gracious and merciful diſpoſition: And herein, ſo far as he acted conſiſtent with <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> I would propoſe him, my brethren, as a pattern for your imitation. I would not have you be of a cruel and revengful diſpoſition; but if you have an opportunity, I hope you will treat your enemies with tenderneſs and compaſſion. I have obſerved in reading hiſtory, that the braveſt men have generally been remarkable for their humanity, and generous diſpoſition towards their enemies; and you are in particular bound to exerciſe ſuch a temper, as you are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and enjoy the glorious light of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> which is a <hi>ſyſtem</hi> of the moſt ſublime, diſintereſted and extenſive <hi>benevolence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly. And to finiſh the military character of king <hi>David; he was a virtuous and religious ſoldier;</hi> he loved and feared God, and chearfully obey'd his commandments; he was eminent for the purity of his heart, the warmth
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008383_0015_102F4400A754E0D0"/>
of his devotion, and the holineſs of his life; he undertook and executed all his warlike operations, in a humble dependance on the divine power and Aſſiſtance; he put no truſt in an arm of fleſh, abſtract from his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's bleſſing. When GOLIATH beheld <hi>David,</hi> he diſdained and curſed him, and ſaid, <hi>come to me, and I will give thy fleſh unto the fowls of the air, and the beaſts of the field. David</hi> was not at all intimidated by theſe haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty words, but boldly anſwered the Giant, <hi>Thou comeſt to me with a ſword, and with a ſpear, and with a ſhield; but I come to thee in the name of the</hi> LORD OF HOSTS, <hi>the God of the armies of Iſrael, whom thou haſt defy'd: This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand, and I will ſmite thee, and take thine head from thee, and I will give the carcaſſes of the hoſt of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beaſts of the earth; that all the earth may know there is a God in Iſrael; and all this aſſembly ſhall know, that the Lord ſaveth not with ſword and ſpear; for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands: Some truſted in chariots, and ſome in horſes, but</hi> David <hi>remembered the name of the Lord his God,</hi> Pſalm xx. 7. He aſcribed all his courage, ſucceſs and ſkill, in military affairs, to God: <hi>By thee</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I have run thro' a troop, and by my God, have I leaped over a wall; it is God that girdeth me with ſtrength, and maketh my way perfect, he maketh my feet like Hinds feet, and ſetteth me upon my high places, he teaches my hands to war, ſo that a bow of ſteel is broken by my arm,</hi> Pſa. xviii. He diſclaims all dependance on human power, in the xxxiii. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 16 and 17 Verſes; <hi>there is no king ſaved by the multitude of an hoſt, an horſe is a vain thing for ſafety; neither ſhall he deliver any by his great ſtrength.</hi> Senſible of his dependance upon God, he always prayed for the divine bleſſing before he engaged: This was his ſupplication, <hi>Thou art my king, O God! command deliverance for</hi> Jacob. <hi>Through thee will we puſh down our enemies, through thy name will we tread them under, that riſe up againſt us. For I will not truſt in my bow, neither ſhall my ſword ſave me; give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man. Thro' God we ſhall do valiantly; for he it is that ſhall tread down our enemies,</hi> Pſalm xlvi. and lx. When <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> that eminent ſtateſman, had gone over to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> he cried out, <hi>O Lord, I pray thee, turn the counſel of</hi> Ahitophel <hi>into fooliſhneſs.</hi> When he was ready to be deſtroyed by the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> he prayed unto the Lord for deliverance, compare lvii. and lix. <hi>Pſalms.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> had obtained a victory, he acknowledged the agency of God in it, and gave thanks to his great and glorious name; as may be ſeen in the xviii. and xxi. Pſalms: Where he expreſſes himſelf in the following manner, <hi>I have purſued mine enemies and overtaken them; neither did I turn again 'till they were conſumed. I have wounded them that they were not able to riſe: For thou haſt girded me with ſtrength unto battle; thou haſt ſubdued under me, thoſe that roſe up againſt me, thou haſt alſo given me the necks of mine enemies.</hi> David was very conſtant in prayer to God; <hi>morning, evening, and at noon, he made his ſupplication to the moſt high;</hi> he loved the <hi>houſe of God, and the place where his honour dwelt:</hi> He affirms, he <hi>would rather be a door-keeper in the houſe of the Lord, than dwell in the tents of wickedneſs;</hi> and cries out, <hi>how amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hoſts! One thing have I deſired of the

Lord, and that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord, all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and enquire in his temple. David</hi> took a ſacred delight in the contemplation of the law of God, and the reading of his word: <hi>His delight was in the law of the Lord, and in his law did he meditate both day and night.</hi> The practiſe of piety was ſo far from being his burthen, that it was his greateſt pleaſure; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſings in the xix. Pſalm, <hi>The ſtatutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: More are they to be deſired than gold; yea, than much fine gold: Sweeter alſo than honey, or the honey comb.</hi> He heartily approved of the duties of religion, and habitually hated all kinds of ſin; <hi>he eſteemed God's precepts, concerning all things, to be right, and he hated every falſe way.</hi> His piety was not only external; but his heart delighted in it. <hi>O! how I love thy law,</hi> (is his language) <hi>'tis my meditation all the day long:</hi> He ardently deſired to make progreſs in holineſs, and be more conformable to the divine image, he aſpired after perfection, and panted after immortality. <hi>As the hart pants</hi> (ſays he) <hi>after the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul, after thee, O God! My ſoul thirſteth for God, the living God; when ſhall I come and appear before God.</hi> His breaſt was enflamed with the moſt lively and cordial gratitude to his heavenly father; of this his numerous affectionate thankſgivings, in the pſalms, are an ample teſtimony. <hi>David</hi> was anxious about the renovation and ſanctification of his nature, and endeavoured to cultivate inward purity and holineſs; he truly repented of all his Sins, and offered to God the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of a broken ſpirit, a broken and contrite heart: He truſted in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and merits of a future Meſſiah, for pardon and juſtification: He confeſſed his original and actual ſins, with the loweſt humility, and ſought ſalvation in a way of free and unmerited grace, accounting that man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py whoſe tranſgreſſion was forgiven, and to whom the Lord imputed not iniquity; he renounced all dependance upon his own goodneſs, in the ſight of God, ſaying, <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name, be the honour and glory: He hated the congregation of evil doers,</hi> and abſtained from the company of the wicked. <hi>He walked not in the counſel of the ungodly; nor ſtood in the way of ſinners, nor ſat in the ſeat of the ſcornful: He kept his tongue as with a bridle, whilſt the wicked were before him.</hi> He rejoiced, and delighted in God, and entertained a ſolemn and affecting ſenſe of his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence, power, glory, majeſty, wiſdom, holineſs, goodneſs, mercy and truth; he was a perſon of the greateſt integrity, abhorred falſehood, and maintained a ſacred regard for the truth; he thus addreſſed the heart ſearching God, <hi>O Lord! if there be iniquity in my hands, if I have rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded evil unto him that was at peace with me; yea, have delivered him who without cauſe is mine enemy; let the enemy perſecute my ſoul and take it.</hi> He preſents us with the following deſcription of the good man, whilſt he gave an example of it in his own life and converſation. <hi>Lord, who ſhall dwell in thy tabernacle? Who ſhall abide in thy holy hill? He that walketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly and worketh righteouſneſs, and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach againſt his neighbour, in whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemptible: But he honoureth them that fear the Lord; he that hath clean hands and a pure

Heart, who hath not lift up his ſoul to vanity, nor ſworn deceitfully. David</hi> was convinced of the neceſſity of this character, in order to obtain future happineſs: He knew that <hi>the wicked would be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget</hi> God; he knew that Jehovah <hi>hated all the workers of iniquity, and would finally rain upon them ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt:</hi> Therefore he walked in the ways of holineſs, and kept the commandments of his God; knowing it was the only way to ſecure his bleſſing here, and eternal felicity hereafter: He endeavoured to live in a ſtate of reconciliation with God, that in caſe he was ſlain in battle, he might be tranſlated to thoſe HAPPY ABODES, where there is <hi>fullneſs, an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fullneſs of joy.</hi> A ſenſe of his integrity, and the favour of God, made him bold and intrepid in the day of battle; he could look beyond the ſcenes of ſlaughter, and behold the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> as his infallible reward; he knew how infinitely dangerous it would be, to riſk his life in the high places of the field, if God was his enemy, and he remained in a unpardoned and unſatisfied condition; he knew that in ſuch a caſe, the mortal blow that depriv'd him of his life, would diſpatch him to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of never-ending miſery and diſpair; he therefore lived in the practiſe of univerſal virtue, and in a conſtant preparation for his great and laſt change: He choſe God for the portion of his ſoul, and maintained a life of communion with him in providence and ordinances; in ſhort <hi>he denied all ungodlineſs and every worldly luſt, and lived ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent evil world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, my brethren, I have deſcribed THE MILITARY CHARACTER OF KING DAVID; I now proceed to urge you to an imitation of it.</p>
            <p>And, in the firſt place, I beg leave to addreſs THE GENTLEMEN OFFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CERS, under a view of the preceeding particulars.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>Let me exhort you to copy after that GREAT and EMINENT ſcripture HERO, whoſe piety, martial exploits, and endowments, I have juſt now briefly ſet before you; let the ſame zeal to vindicate the rights and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your fellow ſubjects; let the ſame loyalty to your KING, and love to your COUNTRY, warm your breaſts, which animated his; exerciſe the ſame benevolence and regard to the men placed under your command; be watchful over their morals and behaviour, and remember you are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God for all thoſe miſs-ſteps in their conduct, which by your influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, authority and example you, may prevent; ſuffer them not to curſe, ſwear, get drunk, pillage, beat one another, and inſult the innocent with impunity; yet remember, that in their puniſhment, you treat them as fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures, who partake of the ſame common nature with yourſelves, and are entitled to your pity and tenderneſs. Diſcipline, conſidering the univerſal corruption of mankind, is neceſſary in an army; yet it ſhould be conducted with humanity, and according to the genius and ſpirit of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN, You have obſerv'd in the preceeding diſcourſe, that king <hi>David</hi> always went to battle in a humble dependance on the bleſſing of God, and with earneſt prayers of ſucceſs from his almighty arm. I hope
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008383_0018_102F4408F52D3478"/>
therefore, you will not be aſhamed to imitate the JEWISH MONARCH, in this important part of his conduct; and to implore the aſſiſtance of the Lord of Hoſts, in every branch of your duty. Think not GENTLEMEN, that the great God is inattentive to the concerns of this lower world; for he rules the UNIVERSE by his PROVIDENCE, and makes the ſcale of victory incline to whatever ſide he pleaſes. We have poſitive aſſurances, in the ſacred ſcripture, that he interpoſed in favour of particular armies, who ſought his aſſiſtance by prayer, and deſtroyed others who deſpiſed it; and is he not the ſame God now, that he was then? Is he not as much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the management of events in the preſent conjuncture of affairs, as he was in former ages? Has not the preſent war furniſhed us with the moſt ſtriking proofs of his SUPERINTENDENCY, and doth it not ſeem, GENTLEMEN, that conſidering the ſuperior number of britiſh troops at MONONGAHELA and TICONDEROGA; their defeat was owing to the frowns of that PROVIDENCE, which we did not ſufficiently acknowledge.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, don't ſuffer the ſucceſſes with which his majeſty's arms have been lately crown'd, to beget in you, a high opinion of yourſelves, or a diſregard to that GOD, to the ſmiles of whoſe favour we are principally indebted, for all the eminent advantages which our troops have obtained.</p>
            <p>GOD himſelf has declared in his word, thoſe that honour me, will I honour; but he that deſpiſeth me ſhall be lightly eſteemed. Oh! there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look unto him for VICTORY, and expect it from no other quarter.</p>
            <p>GOD is a being of infinite power and wiſdom; he created and ſuſtains the UNIVERSE, and whenever he pleaſes, he makes a WRECK OF MATTER? AND A CRUSH OF WORLDS: Be then perſuaded to ſeek the aſſiſtance of his OMNIPOTENT ARM; leaſt, if you deſpiſe it, it fall upon you, and grind you to powder; leaſt it ſcatter his majeſty's troops, and ſtrike terror thro' the ſtouteſt britiſh heart.</p>
            <p>Finally, GENTLEMEN, we take this public opportunity, gratefully to acknowledge the ſignal ſervices done, in part by yourſelves and the brave troops under your command, in the reduction of the important fortreſs of LOUISBOURG, and the iſlands of CAPE-BRETON and ST. JOHN'S: We confeſs ourſelves much obliged to you, for the dangers and fatigues to which you have expoſed yourſelves, for the britiſh nation in general, and this part of his majeſty's dominions in particular. Gentlemen, we ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh and pray, that your former ſucceſs may be the happy prelude of more IMPORTANT VICTORIES; and may GOD improve you as inſtruments in his hand, to chaſtiſe our cruel and perfidious enemies, and reſtore an honourable peace to your country. May the Lord of hoſts proſper your arms, protect your perſons, and make you great and diſtinguiſh'd bleſſings: Theſe are the ſincere wiſhes of my heart, and I am perſuaded not only of mine, but every perſon in this aſſembly.</p>
            <p>I now paſs on to make an application of my diſcourſe to the SOLDIERS who are here preſent. Brethren, I have propoſed, for your imitation, the example of a very religious and accompliſh'd ſoldier, a man of diſtinguiſh'd piety, and under the infallible direction of God's holy ſpirit: Therefore let there be an emulation amongſt you, who ſhall reſemble it moſt; let

               </gap> MILITARY CHARACTER OF KING DAVID. <hi>Be of good courage, and play the men for your people, and the cities of your God; and the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good.</hi> Let the WELFARE of ſo many of your fellow ſubjects, the welfare of the PROTESTANT INTEREST, the welfare of the CHURCH OF CHRIST, animate your hearts, and inſpire you with martial ardour and intrepidity. Let the blood of innocent babes and helpleſs women, which has been ſhed by barbarous hands; let the captivity and death of ſo many brave ſoldiers, the loſs of important garriſons, the groans of diſtreſſed multitudes, the eminent danger which threatens the lives and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your countrymen, and their invaluable liberties, both civil and ſacred; let theſe united and affecting conſiderations, ſtir you up to great and glorious deeds. Behold the bones of ſlaughtered britons, bleaching on the banks of MONONGAHELA; review TICONDEROGA'S BLOODY FIELD, covered with the bodies of your poor brethren: There the daſtard <hi>French</hi> ſhrunk into the ground from BRITISH VALOUR; and hardly ſecure in their deep, inacceſſible intrenchments, with trembling hearts, ſlew the heroes whom they durſt not face. Oh BRITAIN! O my COUNTRY! how did thy VALIANT SONS fall in battle; how were thy MIGHTY ſlain by hoſtile hands: There HOWE, the HERO, and the PATRIOT fell, there fell a liſt of WORTHIES, expoſed to an unequal chance, and cut off by an untimely ſtroke. O! let theſe tender reflections, my brethren, arouſe up all the <hi>man</hi> and the <hi>briton,</hi> and exert you to attack the enemy with redoubled ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and fury. Let a ſenſe of BRITTANNIA'S WRONGS, and the diſhonour which her arms have ſuffered; let the glorious victories of your renowned anceſtors, and all that is great and noble, warm you breaſts, and make you dauntleſs like lions. Endeavour, by the moſt gallant exploits, to wipe of the diſgrace which has been caſt on the britiſh arms, and retrieve the glory of the Engliſh name. Conſider how <hi>David</hi> was concerned to take away the reproach from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and what indignation glow'd in his breaſt againſt the Philiſtine; and let the ſame paſſion be in you, let your arms, <hi>let your ſwords, be like the bow of</hi> Jonathan, <hi>which turned not back; and the ſword of</hi> Saul, <hi>which turned not empty from the blood of the ſlain, from the fat of the mighty: Deſert not</hi> your poſt, fly not from your duty in the day of battle, but bravely face the adverſary, and ruſh on to the bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack; fight manfully, plunge into the midſt of the enemy, and <hi>turn not again 'till they are fallen under your feet, 'till you have beat them ſmall as the duſt before the wind.</hi> But here let me caution you, not to venture in your own ſtrength, not to truſt in an arm of fleſh; but, like <hi>David,</hi> go forth in the name of the Lord; exert yourſelves in a humble dependance on his bleſſing and aſſiſtance; pray earneſtly to him for direction, courage, and ſucceſs; apply to God to ſtrengthen your hands, and cover you heads, in the day of battle. Without the divine aſſiſtance you can do nothing; thus we read, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxvi. 5. <hi>That when king</hi> Uzziah <hi>ſought the Lord, God made him to proſper;</hi> but the contrary happened when he neglected it: And <hi>when the children of Judah,</hi> in Abijah's reign, <hi>relied upon the Lord God of their fathers, they prevailed againſt the children of</hi> Iſrael.

truſt in the LORD, and make the MOST HIGH your habitation: And reſt perſuaded, that numbers, courage and military ſkill, will avail you nothing, if God ſhould frown upon you; this we all know by melancholly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the battle is not to the ſtrong, nor the race to the ſwift; <hi>For God deſtroys the proud</hi> and mighty, <hi>in the imagination of their hearts; and exalts the humble</hi> and the weak: <hi>He doth according to his ſovereign will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in the armies of heaven above, and amongſt the inhabitants of the earth below; and there is none that can controul him, ſtay his hand, or dare ſay unto him, what doeſt thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, my brethren, let me tell you, if you deſire ſucceſs to attend your arms; 'tis neceſſary, abſolutely neceſſary, that you, as well as we, ſhould abſtain from ſinful practices; for GOD <hi>hates, and is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> and will baffle the deſigns of thoſe that deſpiſe his authority, and trample his laws under foot; he will frown upon their meaſures, and cauſe them to fall by the hands of their enemies. We are told, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxii. 9. <hi>That when the hoſt goeth againſt the enemy, then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould keep themſelves from every wicked thing.</hi> We are alſo informed in the 7th of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not prevail againſt the children of <hi>Ai,</hi> 'till they had <hi>put away the evil and accurſed thing, from among them.</hi> Now let me aſk you, brethren, do you make any attempts to eradicate vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits, and lay aſide the practice of iniquity? Are there not on the contrary, many amongſt you who commit the groſſeſt abominations? who delight in drunkenneſs, fornication, violence, riotous living, prophane ſwearing, and other deteſtable vices? Now, how can you reaſonably expect the <hi>bleſſing of God,</hi> as long as you are guilty of ſuch baſe actions? <hi>Bleſſing of God;</hi> no, his wrath will come upon ſuch tranſgreſſors to the uttermoſt. Let me tell you, if you fall in battle, you will, without doubt, be caſt into HELL, where the ſmoak of your torments will aſcend for ever and ever. Let me therefore urge you to forſake your ſins, and turn to God with all your hearts; be chaſte and temperate; wrong no man; do violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſely, and be content with your wages; obey your officers; behave in a ſober, regular and diſcreet manner: In ſhort, imitate the character of KING DAVID, and thus you will obtain the love of your fellow creatures, and there will be a much greater probability of your ſucceſs in the day of battle.</p>
            <p>Let me adviſe all the ſoldiers indiſcriminately, to ſearch into their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate: See to it, my brethren, whether you are prepar'd to meet death, the king of terrors; examine yourſelves, whether ye be in the faith, prove your own ſelves; do you live as probationers for eternity? And are you qualified for the kingdom of Chriſt and of God? Have you, with holy <hi>David,</hi> heartily renounced, and ſincerely repented of all your Sins? do you live a life of faith in a ſaviour's merits, and of obedience to his divine commandments? Do you, with the royal Pſalmiſt, delight in prayer, in praiſe, in going to the houſe of god, and reading, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon his word? Do you, with him, avoid the company of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hate ſin with perfect hatred, and delight in the law of the Lord, after the inner man? Are the corruptions of your heart and the follies of your

life, your greateſt burthen? and do you, with the <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for the pardon of your ſins, and the ſanctification of your natures? Are you anxious to cultivate inward purity, maintain communion with God, and make advances in the divine life? Have you been convinced of your loſt and ruin'd condition by nature, and your expoſedneſs, whilſt in that condition, to divine wrath and juſtice? And have you, in conſequence of this conviction, by faith, fled to Jeſus, the only city of refuge? If you have not, you are in a very unſafe and diſmal ſituation; for God out of Chriſt is a <hi>conſuming fire;</hi> and ſinners out of Chriſt, are expoſed, not only to temporal, but ETERNAL DEATH: Let me therefore exhort you, before you go to the field of battle, to make God your truſt, your buckler, your ſhield and your high tower; lean not upon yourſelves, your own valour, your own ſtrength, or your own righteouſneſs; truſt not in horſes or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, but truſt in the name of the <hi>Lord of hoſts, the God of the armies of Iſrael;</hi> flee to Chriſt immediately, without any delay, ſecure an intereſt in his favour, and then neither death nor life, neither France nor hell, can ſeparate you from his love. But like good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> if ſlain in battle, you will be carried by angels from blood and carnage, from tumult and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the regions of everlaſting and undiſturb'd repoſe. I exhort you all to attend to theſe ſerious conſiderations; I warn you all as a friend, who is anxious for your preſent and future welfare, to avoid thoſe ſins and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, which are, alas! too common in an army: Avoid every kind of profaneneſs and immorality; ſhun, as much as poſſible, the company of the wicked, and in the time of leiſure, meditate on religious ſubjects, and let it be a matter of the higheſt concern to your ſouls, to prepare for death, judgment and eternity. Now is the only accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation; therefore in God's name, for Chriſt's ſake, and as you would not be forever miſerable; let me beſeech and intreat you, with the utmoſt importunity, to conſider theſe things which belong to your peace, before they are everlaſtingly hid from your eyes.</p>
            <p>Believe me, my brethren, when I reflect that there are ſo many poor ſouls among you, going very ſoon to the field of battle, ftom whence 'tis probable that ſome of you will never return; and when I conſider that they are not yet reconciled to god, thro' the blood of his ſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt periſh forever, if ſlain by the enemy.—I ſay, when I conſider theſe things, my heart bleeds for you: Unhappy creatures, whom the ſword of the adverſary may ſend to the ſhades of hell: Repent of all your ſins betimes; in the day of action you will have no opportunity for this important purpoſe, therefore now embrace the GOLDEN MOMENTS, and ſeek the pardon of your ſins, and an intereſt in the MERITS of CHRIST, before you go hence to be here no more.</p>
            <p>Brethren, you have reſided for ſome time amongſt us, and I hope and believe you have been, in the main, well treated by the inhabitants of this town; we have always wiſhed you well, and therefore are unwilling you ſhould part from us, without expreſſing that our hearts are toward you. We wiſh you a bleſſing from the houſe of the Lord. GOD ALMIGHTY bleſs you, protect and proſper you! <hi>Teach your hands to war and your fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008383_0022_102F4417D6BA1D80"/>
to fight;</hi> give you courage and conduct, make you the terror of your enemies, and the defence of your country! <hi>God be your refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in time of trouble: The</hi> LORD OF HOSTS be with you; <hi>the God of Jacob be your refuge!</hi> may he render you ſucceſsful, make bare his EVERLASTING ARM in your behalf, give you the necks of your enemies, render your expedition ſafe, honourable and victorious; make you good and faithful ſoldiers of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and at laſt confer upon you, a CROWN of unfading glory, a CROWN of EVER BLOOMING AND TRIUMPHANT LAURELS: That this may be the happy portion of every ſoul in this aſſembly, may God of his infinite mercy grant, for the ſake of our dear redeemer, to whom, with the father and the holy ſpirit, be, rendered and aſcrib'd, the kingdom, power and glory, for ever and ever. AMEN.</p>
