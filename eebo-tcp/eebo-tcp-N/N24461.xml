            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTORY LETTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is ſome months ſince I read your Book entitled "The Age of Reaſon, part ſecond, being an inveſtigation of true and fabulous Theology:" and do not ſcruple to pronounce it one of the moſt violent and ſyſtimatic attacks on the word of God, that ever was made; not on 'ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the novelty of the objections contained therein, for in truth there is no novelty in them, but from the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and abuſe; the illiberal ſatire, pretended ridicule, and impertinent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, ſo liberally ſcattered throughout the performance; and which, coming from the pen of a man that has acted ſo diſtinguiſhed a part on the theatre of the political world; and whoſe writings have been read with avidity in almoſt all parts of Europe, may perhaps, be of fatal
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032376_0003_0FF1FFA254574680"/>conſequence to the faith of many: I, therefore, was determined to endeavour to apply an antidote to the venom of your poiſon of infidelity; (as far as my poor abilities would allow) but being then engaged in tranſlating the Prayers of our nation, from Hebrew into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and arranging the copy for the ſecond volume of my Diſſertations on the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, I was obliged to poſtpone it till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: at the ſame time hoping that ſome one, far more capable, would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the laudable taſk, and thus have rendered my interference unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But, although ſeveral anſwers have been written, by men of great abilities, yet, I humbly preſume to think, that there is ſtill much to be ſaid on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: eſpecially as you ſeem to treat Chriſtian prieſts and preachers with ſuch contempt, that it is to be ſuppoſed you pay but little attention to their arguments, as you think<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 2 <abbr>d.</abbr> p. 2.</note> "that they only waſte their time, and heat themſelves in frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032376_0004_0FF1FFA42ACA1618"/>diſputes about doctrinal points drawn from the Bible." You are alſo pleaſed, in a ſelf conceited important tone, to tell them that their anſwers to the firſt part of your Age of Reaſon, is as "cobwebs bruſhed away by accident." It therefore is to be hoped that theſe letters, written by one that is neither a Chriſtian prieſt, nor a preacher; and who conſequently has no intereſt in preaching up tithes, as he is but a poor, ſimple <hi>Levite,</hi> without any living in the Jewiſh Church, may find grace in your ſight, and not be conſidered as "cobwebs bruſhed away by accident;" and thus obtain a favourable reception, not in the vain hope of making you a proſelyte to revelation, but only to ſhew you, that you are not poſſeſſed of a thorough knowledge of the ſubject of which you treat: it therefore, is no wonder, that you have blindly followed Morgan, Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, Bolingbroke, Hume, Voltaire, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noza, &amp;c. all of whom, have long ſince ſtarted one or other of the objections, that you have been collecting as it were
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032376_0005_0FF1FFAEA59D49A8"/>to a focus, in order to dazzle the eyes of the ignorant and unwary: the fallacy of ſome of them, I have already expoſed;<note n="*" place="bottom">See Lingua Sacra, Radix <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> where I have clearly ſhewn the falſity of the charge brought by Voltaire, Tindal and Morgan, againſt the law of God: viz. that the Jews were therein commanded to ſacrifice human creatures. See alſo my Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the prophecies, Vol. II. p. 314. concerning Jews being <hi>cannibals</hi> and <hi>man-eaters.</hi>
               </note> and with God's bleſſing, hope to ſhew the futility of all the others.</p>
            <p>I know not your motive for thus attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of God: nor will I be ſo uncharitable as to aſcribe it to malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: I will not queſtion your ſincerity, though I cannot approve of your mode of attack; it is not the manner of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere enquirer after truth; but of one, who affects to be free from vulgar preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and of being thought wiſer than the reſt of mankind: it is this, that has led many into inſidelity. But, whether it is the love of truth, fame, ambition, or malevolence, that has induced you to take this ſtep, I will candidly conſider your arguments, and reaſon freely with you
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032376_0006_0FF1FFB05A3D8398"/>on the ſubject, without the leaſt aſperity; and although I cannot flatter myſelf with the hopes of convincing you of the truth of Revelation; yet, if I ſhould be ſo happy, as to ſave but one ſoul from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing the poiſon of your pernicious tenets, I ſhall think my labour well rewarded.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not my intention in theſe Letters to follow you ſtep by ſtep through all your turnings and windings, as that would anſwer no other end but to bewilder the Reader, as ſeems to have been your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it will be ſufficient for our purpoſe, if we can prove the abſurdity and falſity of your poſition, in the plaineſt manner poſſible: I ſhall, therefore, conſider your objections againſt the Old Teſtament, in the following order: Firſt, as to Moſes being the Author of the books aſcribed to him. Second, as to the doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in thoſe books. After which I ſhall proceed to conſider your objections to the prophets, the phrophetical books, as alſo the others contained in the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>You obſerve, (p. 5.) "My intention is to ſhew that thoſe books (the five books of Moſes) are ſpurious, and that Moſes is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032376_0008_0FF1FFB605677BE0"/>not the author of them: and ſtill further, that they were not written in the time of Moſes, nor till ſeveral hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards," &amp;c. The proofs you adduce, are, firſt, that<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 6.</note> "the whole of theſe books is in the third perſon; it is always the <hi>Lord ſaid unto Moſes, or Moſes ſaid unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and this," you obſerve, "is the ſtyle and manner that hiſtorians uſe, in ſpeaking of the perſons whoſe lives and actions they are writing." Thus you argue, to prove that Moſes did not write the Pentateuch: though, as if ſenſible of the weakneſs of your argument, you ſeem to abandon it immediately after, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that, according to grammatical right, a man may ſpeak of himſelf in that manner<note n="†" place="bottom">This we know without your conceſſion: for <hi>Caeſar, Xenophen,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> writing of themſelves, wrote in the third perſon.</note>. But, if you had the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the language in which Moſes wrote, its genius, idiom and phraſeology, ſo different from all others, you would certainly not have trifled thus with your readers: for allowing your objection all
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032376_0009_0FF1FFB9CEAF3378"/>its force, it does not prove that Moſes was not the author of the Pentateuch; nay, it in ſome meaſure proves that he was the author: this will clearly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, when we conſider the different parts of the Pentateuch; and arrange them under their proper heads, viz. <hi>Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical</hi> and <hi>Preceptical.</hi> Now, as ſome parts are purely hiſtorical, it was proper that he ſhould write in the ſtyle that hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians generally write in. For in the name of goodneſs, let me aſk, in what other ſtyle ought Moſes to have written when he wrote the hiſtorical part of the Pentateuch? The whole book of Geneſis is hiſtorical, and the facts related therein, are prior to the birth of Moſes: he muſt therefore have received an account of them; and this account, he received from God; he therefore, very properly, wrote as one that is dictated to by another. And this, he expreſsly informs us of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Numb. xxxiii. 2. <hi>"And Moſes wrote their goings out according to their journies, according to the word</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. Mouth.</note> 
               <hi>of the Lord."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:032376_0010_0FF1FFC10F63A2E0"/>
Hence the propriety of Moſes writing in the third perſon, as an hiſtorian, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; and which, if duly conſidered, will preſently ſhew the futility of your reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſubject; for as Moſes wrote what God dictated to him, your objection to the hiſtorical and chronological evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, inſtantly falls to the ground: for as God is Omniſcient; with him there can be no futurity; he could therefore, as eaſily inſtruct Moſes to write what was to happen in five or ſix hundred years, as he was able to acquaint him with what happened at the creation, or on the very day that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes wrote. Hence alſo, it is manifeſt that, your objection againſt the expreſſion of Moſes, (Gen. chap. xiv. ver. 14.) of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's purſuing the enemy to Dan, "that there was no ſuch place as Dan till many years after the death of Moſes; and conſequently that Moſes could not be the writer of the book of Geneſis, where this account of purſuing them unto <hi>Dan</hi> is given."<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 10—11.</note> is of no force to invalidate the hiſtorical and chronological evidence of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032376_0011_0FF1FFC6B504EBF8"/>the books aſcribed to Moſes, as the author of them; becauſe, he did not pretend to write thoſe things of his own knowledge, but only as they were dictated to him by the Almighty, to whom all events are known.</p>
            <p>As the ſame argument equally applies to what you advance concerning the kings of Edom that reigned before any king reigned in Iſrael: of the manua which the children of Iſrael eat till they came to the borders Canaan; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bed of Og, &amp;c. it would be only waſting of time to ſhew the fallacy of them; as it muſt be viſible to the meaneſt capacity. I ſhall however, take notice of what you advance concerning the ſlimſy pretence of prophecy, as you are pleaſed to call it.</p>
            <p>You ſay,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 16.</note> "the two inſtances I have given would be ſufficient, without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional evidence, to invalidate the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of any book that pretended to be four or five hundred years more ancient than the matters it ſpeaks of, or refers to,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032376_0012_0FF1FFC89825EE38"/>as facts; for in the caſe <hi>of purſuing them unto Dan,</hi> and of the <hi>kings that reigned over the children of Iſrael,</hi> not even the flimſy pretence of prophecy can be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The expreſſions are in the preter tenſe, and it would be downright idotiſm to ſay that a man could proheſy in the preter tenſe." Here ſir, we have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of your profound criticiſm, and the great knowledge you have of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic writing: What! attempt to criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe on the Bible, and not know that prophecies are ſometimes delivered in the preter tenſe! Do you not know, (and if you do not, it is civility to inform you) that the delivery of prophecy in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter tenſe is often made uſe of, and which is to ſhew the truth of it; as if it were already come to paſs? This is well known to all thoſe that are in the leaſt acquainted with the prophetic writings; numerous inſtances of which might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, if it was neceſſary.</p>
            <p>It muſt alſo be conſidered that Moſes was not propheſying then; but writing of hiſtory, under the guidance of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032376_0013_0FF1FFCCE2B767C8"/>ſupreme being? he therefore related things as if they were actually come to paſs, being directed by God ſo to do: and which accounts for all your objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the hiſtorical and chronological evidence of the books aſcribed to Moſes.</p>
            <p>That Moſes wrote thoſe books by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration, is manifeſt from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act accompliſhment of every event fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by him. Of this, I ſhall produce ſuch clear and unequivocal proofs, as to ſtrike the Deiſt and infidel dumb.</p>
            <p>That which I ſhall principally inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the dreadful denunciations of Moſes relating to our diſperſion, wherein he tells us, (Levit. xxvi. 33. and Deut. xxviii. 64.) that we ſhall be ſcattered over the face of the whole earth, among all nations: but what is moſt wonderful, he tells us, that we ſhall nevertheleſs remain a SEPARATE people, capable of being gathered together in the latter days. This he aſſures us of in the following words. <hi>"And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not coſt them away, neither will I abhor them, to deſtroy them utterly, and to break
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032376_0014_0FF1FFD0658ED288"/>my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their God</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Levit. xxxvi. 44.</note>. This ſir, is corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated by the other prophets, (whom you have alſo been pleaſed to treat with ſuch contempt) for Jeremiah obſerves (chap. xxx. 11.) "For I am with thee, ſaith the Lord, to ſave thee: though I make a full end of all the nations whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have diſperſed thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee, but I will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect<note n="†" place="bottom">See alſo chap. xlvi. 28.</note> thee in meaſure; and will not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether conſume thee." And Amos (chap. ix. 8.) ſays, "Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the ſinful kingdom; and I will deſtroy it from off the face of the earth; yet will I not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroy the houſe of Jacob, ſaith the Lord. For, lo, I will command, and I will ſift the houſe of Iſrael among all nations; as (one that) ſifteth (corn) with a ſieve: and a grain ſhall not fall upon the ground." That is, the collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive body of the nation ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; as I ſhall ſhew at large in the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032376_0015_0FF1FFD6C7F8A258"/>explanation of that prophecy, in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertations on the prophecies of the Old Teſtament: the ſecond volume of which, is juſt publiſhed.</p>
            <p>Hence it is manifeſt, that although Moſes and the other prophets, aſſure us that, the nation ſhould be ſcattered among all nations, and ſorely afflicted; yet ſhould they not be utterly deſtroyed, as was the caſe of other nations, as we ſee it fully verified at this day. And now, ſir, give me leave to aſk you, how it was poſſible for Moſes, without being divinely inſpired, to foreſee that, the dreadful puniſhments which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them, ſhould be ſo fully accompliſhed, as they are allowed on all hands to be; becauſe, a number of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents might have ariſen, to prevent their completion, which no human fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight could have foreſeen? As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the greateſt part of our ſufferings have ariſen from the perſecutions which we have ſuffered from Chriſtians, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the difference of religion, and the charge brought againſt us, of cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lord of life, and Saviour of the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032376_0016_0FF1FFDA6BE2A650"/>world. Now, if this had not taken place, it is moſt probable, that we ſhould not have ſuffered ſuch cruel and dreadful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, &amp;c. as we have experienced for ſo many hundred years.</p>
            <p>Again, how could he foreſee, but that the nation, after its being driven out of its own country, ſcattered in all parts, and ſuffering ſuch miſery, might not thereby be induced entirely to abandon Judaiſm; and ſo fall in with the religion of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries, where they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed: and thus become incorporated with them, and entirely ſwallowed up among them; as has been the caſe of the greateſt monarchies. Indeed, nothing could, or would be more probable: for as to what ſome Deiſts (who when driven from one entrenchment, retire into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from that into a third; and all along behave like an adverſary who fights, not with the hopes of ſucceſs, but for the vain glory of not yielding till he can hold out no longer) pretend, that the law he gave them, which contained the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of meats, intermarriages with other
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032376_0017_0FF1FFDF22891080"/>nations, &amp;c. is the ſole cauſe of it, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erile, and carries its own confutation with it. Becauſe, as I have obſerved, how was he ſure, that as well as they fell into ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and other enormous crimes, they would not violate thoſe prohibitory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, whoſe tranſgreſſion was ſo much leſs heinous; and thus be mingled among the nations: for ſurely, nothing elſe could in all human probability be expected; conſidering what they have ſuffered dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this long and dreadful captivity; for I am free to aſſert, no nation ever ſuffered the like, during a ſpace of almoſt eighteen hundred years. But Moſes, contrary to all human foreſight, informs us, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſevere, and almoſt unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled chaſtiſements that they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, yet, ſhould they ſtill be preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a diſtinct nation.

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032376_0018_0FF1FFE4E5110380"/>Deiſt, Whether it was poſſible that Moſes, or any other perſon could foreſee ſuch a wonderful event, by any human means whatever; or how you, or they, can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, on any other ſcheme, than that of divine preſcience?</p>
            <p>If we enter into particulars, we ſhall find, that all the puniſhments which he denounced againſt them, have been ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fulfilled in every particular, that it is no wonder, if infidels were to have recourſe to the old hackneyed objections, that the facts were prior to the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that the prophecies were written after the hiſtories. If, therefore, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the preceding prophecy, which may properly be called, a ſtanding miracle, even to this very day, the like of which hath never been ſeen or heard of in the world, ſhould not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you or other unbelievers, how can we expect that any other argument ſhould, how ſtrong ſoever? But, as I would not by any means, omit adducing any argument that may ſerve to illuſtrate the ſubject, or tend to carry conviction home to the doubting and wavering mind,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032376_0019_0FF1FFE6BB60F550"/>I ſhall juſt take a brief view of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of ſome of the moſt remarkable of theſe denunciations.</p>
            <p>He tells them, that numbers of them ſhall be deſtroyed. "And ye ſhall be left few<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxviii. 62.</note> in number," &amp;c. This, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the other ſlaughters and maſſacres which they have ſuffered, was fully veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the laſt ſiege of Jeruſalem, when inveſted by Titus; when, as Joſephus ſays,<note n="†" place="bottom">Bell. Juda. Lib. VI. Cap. 3. Sect. 3.</note> an infinite multitude periſhed by famine: for he computes that, during the whole ſiege, the number of thoſe that were deſtroyed by that and the ſword, amounted to eleven hundred thouſand, as the people were aſſembled from all parts to celebrate the paſſover; and Baſnage gives us an account of one million, three hundred and thirty nine thouſand, ſix hundred and ninety perſons, that were deſtroyed in Jeruſalem, and other pants of Judea, excluſive of ninety nine the ſand two hundred, taken priſoners, as he has collected from the accounts of Joſephus<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the Jews, Book I. Chap. viii. Sect. 19. p. 8. Note.</note>.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032376_0020_0FF1FFE877B99448"/>Indeed, there is not a nation upon earth, that hath ſuffered ſuch a number of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres and perſecutions: their hiſtory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with little elſe; and if God had not promiſed them his particular protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the whole race, would long ere this have been extirpated; for as Baſnage ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. Chap. I. page 2.</note> "Here is alſo another circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that heightens this prodigy. This forlorn and perſecuted nation can ſcarce find one place in the univerſe to reſt their heads, or to ſet their ſeet in. They have waded through floods of their own blood, and are as yet preſerved. That infinite number of <hi>Jews,</hi> which we ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after murdered through a cruel and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous zeal, weakened, but did not deſtroy that nation. For notwithſtanding the joint perſecutions of Chriſtians and Idolators, who deſigned their ruin, they are ſtill in being."</p>
            <p>He alſo told them, "And ye ſhall be plucked from off the land whither thou goeſt to poſſeſs it."<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xxviii. 63.</note> This is moſt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032376_0021_0FF1D5BBC9D614E8"/>ſingular, and really worthy of obſervation, that even before they had entered the land to take poſſeſſion of it, he aſſures them, that if they diſobeyed the Lord's commandments, they ſhould be plucked off from it. Now, I defy you, or any one elſe, to produce any inſtance of a legiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ever ſtaking his reputation thus; and the exact manner it hath been fulfilled, is clear from their hiſtory; for they were indeed plucked off from their own land, when the ten tribes were carried away captive by the king of Aſſyria; and of whom we know nothing certain to this hour; and when the other two tribes were carried captive to Babylon: but more eſpecially, when their city and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were deſtroyed, and the nation carried captive by the Romans.</p>
            <p>From that time to this, their country hath been in the poſſeſſion of foreign lords and maſters, few Jews living in it; and thoſe of a low and poor condition. A celebrated Jew of the twelfth century,<note n="*" place="bottom">Benjamin of Tudela in Spain.</note> who travelled into all parts to viſit his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032376_0022_0FF1FFF3A12371B8"/>and inform himſelf of the exact ſtate of their affairs, acquaints us that Jeruſalem was almoſt entirely abandoned by the Jews; for he did not find there, above two hundred perſons,<note n="*" place="bottom">Benjamin Itiner, p. 41.</note> who were moſtly dyers of wool; the monoply of which trade they purchaſed every year. They all lived together under David's tower, and made very little figure. In other parts, he found one or two in a city, in another twenty, in others more; and in many none at all. An accurate and faithful Engliſh traveller,<note n="†" place="bottom">Sandy's travels, Book III. page 114.</note> who had been in the holy land ſays, that, "It is for the moſt part, now inherited by Moors and Arabians; thoſe poſſeſſing the valleys, and theſe the mountains. Turks there be few: but many Greeks with other chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of all ſects and nations, ſuch as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to the place an adherent holineſs. Here be alſo ſome Jews, yet inherit they no part of the land, but in their own country do live as aliens."</p>
            <p>He alſo informs them, that they ſhould be ſcattered among all nations; "And
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032376_0023_0FF1FFF71941DDB8"/>thou ſhalt be removed into all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the earth<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxviii. 25.</note>." Again, "And the Lord ſhall ſcatter thee among all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. Peoples.</note> from one end of the earth even unto the other."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. 64.</note> This indeed, hath ben moſt amply fulfilled ſince the great diſperſion of the Jews by the Romans. For what people have been ſcattered ſo far and wide as they? and where is the nation that is a ſtranger to them, or to which they are ſtrangers? They ſwarm in many parts of the eaſt, are ſpread through moſt of the countries of Europe and Africa, are pretty numerous in the Weſt Indies, and there are ſeveral families of them in America. They circulate, as a Chriſtian author ſays, (Biſhop Newton) through all parts were trade and money circulate; and are, as I may ſay, the brokers of the whole world.</p>
            <p>But though they were to be thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed; yet he aſſured them that, they ſhould not be to tally deſtroyed, (as already mentioned) "And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies," &amp;c<note n="§" place="bottom">Levit. xxvi. 44.</note>. On this, an author of great
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032376_0024_0FF1FFF8E01E2718"/>note,<note n="*" place="bottom">Baſnage.</note> obſerves, and what a marvellous thing is it, that after ſo many wars, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and ſieges; after ſo many fires, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines and peſtilences; after ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, maſſacres and perſecutions; after ſo many years of captivity, ſlavery and miſery, they are not <hi>deſtroyed utterly,</hi> and though ſcattered among all people, yet ſubſiſt as a diſtinct people by themſelves: where is there any thing comparable to this to be found in all the hiſtories, and in all the nations under the ſun?"</p>
            <p>But though they ſhould not be utterly deſtroyed, yet ſhould they ſuffer much, and not have reſt long in any place. "And among theſe nations ſhalt thou find no eaſe, neither ſhall the ſole of thy foot have reſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xxviii. 65.</note>," This hath indeed been fully verified; for they have been ſo far from finding reſt, that they have been baniſhed from place to place, from country to country. In many places, they have been baniſhed, and recalled, and baniſhed again. I ſhall juſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſome of their great baniſhments in
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032376_0025_0FF1FFFC9FCD1148"/>modern times, from countries well known. About the latter end of the thirteenth<note n="*" place="bottom">Baſnage, Book VII. Chap. xix. Sect. 20, &amp;c.</note> century, they were baniſhed from England by Edward I.<note n="†" place="bottom">Some ſay it was Henry III.</note> and were not permitted to return and ſettle there again, till Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's time, or rather under Charles the ſecond. In the latter end of the fifteenth century, as Mariana obſerves,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Baſnage, B. VII. Chap. xxi.</note> they were baniſhed from Spain, by Ferdinand and Iſabella: and according to his account, there were ſeventy thouſand families, or eight hundred thouſand perſons, that left Spain upon the execution of this edict. Some<note n="§" place="bottom">Abarbanal. Cordoſo las Excellen. &amp;c.</note> reckon an hundred and twenty thouſand families. They were indeed received in Portugal by John II. but he made them pay a dear price for a refuge; and a few years after they were baniſhed by his ſucceſſor Emanuel; who violated his faith with them, "By depriving them of their liberty to carry away their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren under fourteen years of age, which reduced them to that deſpair, that ſome of them killed themſelves, and others ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032376_0026_0FF2000081F8CE78"/>nature to their religion, turned executioners to their own bowels."<note n="*" place="bottom">Baſn. Book VII. Chap. xxi. Sect. 25.</note> This leads us to what Moſes ſays, concerning their children, "Thy ſons and thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>ſhall be</hi> given unto another people, and thine eyes ſhall look, and fail <hi>with longing</hi> for them all the day along: and <hi>there ſhall be</hi> no might in thine hand."<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xxviii. 32.</note> How exactly hath all this been fulfilled in ſeveral countries; but eſpecially in Spain and Portugal, where they formerly were ſo numerous; and where their children were taken from them by order of the government, to be educated in the Popiſh religion; as mentioned in the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Moſes, in my Diſſertations on the prophecies, Vol. I. page 32. And Baſnage<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt. of the Jews, B. VII. Chap. xiii. Sec. 14.</note> obſerves, that the fourth coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Toledo, ordered that all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be forced from them, for fear they ſhould partake of their errors; and that they ſhould be ſhut up in monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to be inſtructed in the Chriſtian truths. He adds, "We ſhall ſee in the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032376_0027_0FF200023544A090"/>ſequel the lamentable effects of theſe rapes." And it has been ſhewn, under the preceding head, that when they were baniſhed from Portugal, all their children under fourteen years of age, were taken from them, and baptized. A practice not at all juſtifiable adds the hiſtorian.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mariana, Book XXVI. Chap. vi.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo tells them, that they ſhall be oppreſſed and ſpoiled continually. "And thou ſhalt be only oppreſſed, and ſpoiled evermore, and no man ſhall ſave <hi>thee,</hi>"<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xxviii. 29.</note> &amp;c. Now it is well known what frequent ſeizures have been made of their effects, in almoſt all countries, either to ſupply the neceſſities of the ſtate, or the luxury of the prince: How often have they been fined and fleeced by almoſt all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? How often have they been forced to redeem their lives by ſums extorted from them? The inſtances are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I ſhall juſt mention what an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh hiſtorian<note n="‡" place="bottom">Kennet. Vol. I. page 179.</note> ſays, that Henry III. "Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways polled the Jews at every low ebb of his fortunes. One Abraham, who was found delinquent, was forced to pay ſeven
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032376_0028_0FF20003F1DE7AC0"/>hundred marks for his redemption. Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, another Jew, proteſted that the king had taken from him at times, thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand marks of ſilver, beſides two hundred marks of gold, which he had preſented to the queen."</p>
            <p>And in the year 1240, when the king attempted to fleece them to the utmoſt, a moſt reſpectable author obſerves,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Anglia Judaica. p. 70.</note> that he "commanded <hi>all</hi> the Jews of both ſexes throughout <hi>England,</hi> to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, till they would make a diſcovery of their wealth: which he appointed officers to receive in every county, and return to his <hi>exchequer.</hi> Many of them, no doubt, pleaded poverty, or pretended to have given up all: but as the <hi>tyrant</hi> was in earneſt to have their laſt farthing, he extorted it by the moſt cruel torments."</p>
            <p>Stow ſays, that the generality of them had one eye put out. And Matthew Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris<note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. Paris and Stow, anno 1210.</note> tells us, that from one particular <hi>Jew</hi> at Briſtol, the king demanded no leſs than ten thouſand marks of ſilver, (a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032376_0029_0FF20009E59A1D28"/>ſum in thoſe days!) which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely denied him, he commanded one of his great teeth to be pulled out daily, till he conſented. The poor man had the courage to hold out ſeven operations, but then, ſinking under the pain, ranſomed the remainder of his teeth, at the price demanded. And when they were baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the reign of Edward I. their eſtates, &amp;c. were confiſcated, which brought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſums to the crown. Thus have they been ſerved, almoſt every where; a plain demonſtration of the full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this prediction.</p>
            <p>In verſe 34 he ſays, "Thou ſhalt be mad, for the ſight of thine eyes which thou ſhalt ſee." And have we not ſeen into what madneſs and deſperation they have been driven by the oppreſſions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions, and cruel uſage they have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced? Have they not in mere fury and deſperation deſtroyed themſelves, their wives and children? Joſephus<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſeph. De Bell. Jud. Lib. VII. Cap. viii. et ix.</note> mentions, that after the deſtruction of Jeruſalem by Titus, ſome of the Jews took refuge in the caſtle of Naſada, where being cloſely
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032376_0030_0FF20011795CE020"/>beſieged by the Romans, they, by the perſuaſion of their leader, Eleazer, firſt murdered their wives and children; after which, they choſe ten men by lot to ſlay the reſt; when this was done, they choſe one of the ten to kill the other nine in like manner; which having performed, he ſet fire to the place, and then ſtabbed himſelf. There were nine hundred and ſixty, who periſhed in this miſerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Inſtances of the like behaviour hath often occurred ſince; I ſhall only take notice of one mentioned in Engliſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When in the reign of Richard I. the people roſe in arms to make a general maſſacre of them, fifteen hundred of them retired into York caſtle,<note n="*" place="bottom">Baſnage, Book VII. Chap. x. Sect. 20. page 638: who for his authority quotes Matth. Paris, p. 111, and Polyd. Virgil. L. 14. p. 248. See alſo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glia Judaica, p. 25.</note> where being cloſely beſieged, they offered to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and to ranſom their lives with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The offer being refuſed, one of them cried in deſpair, That it was better <hi>to die courageouſly for the Law, than to fall into the hands of the Chriſtians.</hi> Every
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032376_0031_0FF2001333934710"/>one immediately took his knife, and ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his wife and children. The men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards retired into the king's palace, and ſet it on fire, in which they conſumed themſelves with the palace and furniture.</p>
            <p>He tells them, that in this dreadful captivity, they ſhall ſerve other gods.—"And thou ſhalt ſerve other gods, wood and ſtone."<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxviii. 36.</note> Again, "And there thou ſhalt ſerve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 64.</note> &amp;c. This hath been exactly fulfilled during this woful captivity, when the Jews in Spain, and other countries were obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the idolatrous worſhip of the church of Rome, &amp;c. and to bow down to ſtocks and ſtones, rather than to have their effects ſeized and confiſcated, or their peſons murdered by the inquiſition, &amp;c. which has cauſed fuch a number to apoſtatize<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Levi's Diſſertations on the prophecies, Vol. I ſt. p. 18, Note 2d.</note>, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In verſe 37, he tells them, "And thou ſhalt become an aſtoniſhment, a proverb, and a by-word among all nations whither
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032376_0032_0FF20016C348DDB8"/>the Lord ſhall lead thee." Hath not this been fulfilled, and as we may ſay, is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling every day? Is not the pretended avarice, uſury, and hard heartedneſs of a Jew become proverbial? Is it not ſaid, that their very countenances commonly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from the reſt of mankind? And has not a great maſter of nature, drawn the portrait of a Jew, in a moſt deteſtable character, in his Jew of Venice? Do not Heathens, Chriſtians and Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, however they may differ in other points, yet agree in abuſing, vilifying and perſecuting the Jews? And has not a Chriſtian writer † of our time, vilified them in a moſt unwarrantable manner; although it is well known, that there is not a people on earth, more friendly and favorable to good order and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or more obedient to their rulers, than they are? Yet, are they treated in all reſpects, as if they were of another ſpecies.</p>
            <p>He alſo tells them, that, "The Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy ſeed, even great plagues,<note n="*" place="bottom">The right honorable Edmund Burke.</note>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:032376_0033_0FF2001ADBDFAA78"/>and of long continuance<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxviii. 59.</note>," &amp;c. And have not their calamities been of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Have they not continued upwards of ſeventeen hundred years? Their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer captivities were very ſhort in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of this: beſides the time of their redemption was well known and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: and during the Babyloniſh capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, they had prophets<note n="†" place="bottom">Ezekiel and Daniel.</note> among them, who exhorted and comforted them; but during this long and dreadful captivity, there is not one true prophet among them, to inform them of the end of their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; as the pſalmiſt ſays, "We ſee not our ſigns, (there is) no more any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, neither (is there) among us any that knoweth how long<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm lxx. v. 9.</note>." In their former captivities, they had the conſolation of being together in one place: in Egypt, they dwelt together in the land of Goſhen; and they were all carried together to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon; but at preſent they are ſcattered all over the face of the earth. What na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath ever ſuffered ſo much, and yet continued ſo long? What nation hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032376_0034_0FF2001ECB7380D8"/>as a diſtinct people even in their own country, ſo long as theſe have done, tho' diſperſed in all countries, without having any place they can call their own? And what a ſtanding miracle is this, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the view and obſervation of the whole world?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he tells them that they ſhall be carried into Egypt again, and expoſed to ſale as ſlaves, but there would be none to purchaſe them. "And the LORD ſhall bring thee into Egypt again<note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 68.</note>, in ſhips, by the way whereof I ſpake unto thee, thou ſhalt ſee it no more again: and there ye ſhall be ſold unto your enemies for bond-men and bond-women, and no man ſhall buy you." This, is a ſtriking contraſt to what happened to them when Moſes brought them out from Egypt; for then, they came out in a triumphant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as mentioned Exod. xiv. 8. "And the children of Iſrael went out with an high hand." But now, he ſays, they ſhall return thither as ſlaves. This was fully accompliſhed; for it appears from Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,<note n="†" place="bottom">Joſ. Ant. Lib. XII. Cap. 1. et 2.</note> that in the reign of the two firſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032376_0035_0FF20022E024B6C8"/>Prolemies, a number of Jews were ſlaves in Egypt. And when Jeruſalem was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Titus,<note n="*" place="bottom">Bell. Jud. Lib. VI. Cap. viii. Sect. 2. p. 1288.</note> he ſent many of them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who were above ſeventeen years of age, bound to the works in Egypt: thoſe under ſeventeen, were ſold; but ſo little care was taken of theſe captives, that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand of them periſhed for want. The markets were ſo overſtocked with them, that as Joſephus ſays elſewhere, they were ſold with their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at the loweſt price. And after their laſt overthrow by Adrian, many thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands of them were ſold; and thoſe that could not be ſold were tranſported into Egypt; and periſhed by ſhipwreck or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, or were maſſacred by the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. All which is a maniſeſt proof of the accompliſhment of this remarkable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, in every particular.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſir, are manifeſt proofs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies: of prophecies delivered above three thouſand years ago: and which we nevertheleſs plainly ſee fulfilling in the world at this very time: and what ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proof can we have, or deſire, of the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032376_0036_0FF200249F02D7C0"/>divine legation of Moſes? For what le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator durſt ever attempt to ſtake his credit thus, by denouncing ſuch ſevere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minciations againſt a nation for diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of religious ceremonies only: for as to what deiſts aſſert, that any wife and intelligent lawgiver might eaſily foreſee that, the obſervance of the judicious laws inſtituted by him, would tend to make a nation flouriſh, and that the rejection of them would lead to their ruin, is futile: becauſe ſuch foreſight could at any rate only comprehend political inſtitutions; and therefore, the non obſervance of ſuch might end in the loſs of their liberty, or the ſubverſion of their government: and which might eaſily be foreſeen. But even this, was not always the conſequence: for although we find, that the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians did not make ſo great a figure, after they had fallen from the obſervation of the rudes which Lycurgus (whoſe ſole aim was to train them to war) had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined them; becauſe they could not then make war againſt, conquer, and command all thoſe round them; yet we find, that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032376_0037_0FF2002A0E19AA38"/>the Romans, on the contrary, advanced their ſtate to the higheſt pitch of glory. after they had changed the conſtitution from what it was in Numa's days; whoſe only concern was, that Rome ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in peace and amity. Whence it is manifeſt, that Moſes, could never have foreſeen by any human ſagacity, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which have befallen them, as the conſequence of the tranſgreſſion of laws purely religious: as it is impoſſible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws of nature, that a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a collective body, and ſtate of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſhould be happy or miſerable, merely for the ſake of religious inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whoſe object was not peace or war: and yet, we ſee with what exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs theſe <hi>particular</hi> predictions have been fulfilled: Can we then in reaſon any longer doubt the divine miſſion of Moſes? I really know not, how theſe inſtances may affect you, or any other unbelievers, but for my own part, I muſt freely acknowledge, that they not only convince, but aſtoniſh and amaze me, beyond utterance. They are indeed, what Moſes predicted they ſhould be,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032376_0038_0FF20031817569C0"/>a ſign a wonder for ever, as he ſays, in chap. xxviii. 45-46, "Moreover all theſe curſes ſhall come upon thee, and ſhall porſue thee and overtake thee, till thou be deſtroyed; becauſe thou heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enedſt not unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments, and his ſtatues which he commanded thee. And they ſhall be upon thee for a ſign and for a wonder, and upon thy feed for ever." For they are a ſign of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God, and a wonder of their preſervation, amidſt all thoſe dreadful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which they have ſuffered for ſo many hundred years.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to take notice of the character of Moſes, as ſtated in the Bible, to ſee if it is as you ſay,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 6.</note> 
               <hi>"the moſt harrid that can be imagined,"</hi> I am confident, it will appear to be the very reverſe of what you have aſſerted it to be. The evidence that I ſhall produce will be ſuch as you can have no objection to, as it is the ſame that you make uſe of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 5.</note> I mean <hi>the books themſelves.</hi> So far we are agreed. Now for the proof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:032376_0039_0FF2003335DFB3C8"/>
According to the account we have in theſe books of the firſt calling of Moſes to his miſſion, it does not appear that he was <hi>a vain and arrogant coxcomb;</hi> but on the contrary, it ſhews him to be a meek and humble perſon; one that was fully ſenſible of the importance of the buſineſs he was to engage in; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he ſays to God<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. iii. 11.</note>, "Who (am) I, that I ſhould go unto Pharaoh, and that I ſhould bring forth the children of Iſrael from Egypt? In this humble ſtate of mind he continued, till the Lord was angry<note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. iv. 14.</note> with him, and commanded him to go. When he came to Pharaoh, he did not behave like an arrogant coxcomb<note n="‡" place="bottom">Exod. v. 1. 3c.</note>, but with a becoming dignity, unappalled at the preſence of the Egyptian king, in all his pomp and pride, he acted like the meſſenger of the greateſt king, who he was confident was able to protect him; and of whoſe omnipotent power, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly endeavoured to make them ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for which reaſon, he always warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of the day that the plague was to commence, and alſo granted their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032376_0040_0FF20036AE3CF9A0"/>to remove it; and that, at their own appointed time: as he himſelf ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. viii. 6. &amp;c.</note>, "According to thy word: that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt know that (there is) none like unto the LORD our God." Thus did he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make Pharaoh ſenſible with whom he was contending; and that he ought, therefore, to ſubmit ſo him, and to ſave himſelf and his people from the deſtruction that would certainly attend his diſobedience. This, Sir, is not the behaviour of <hi>an arrogant coxcomb,</hi> nor yet that of <hi>a deteſtable</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 15.</note> 
               <hi>villain;</hi> but on the contrary, that of a pious, virtuous perſon, who tried every means in his power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the dreadful judgment that hung over Pharaoh and his people for their wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>When he brought the nation forth from Egypt, with what gentleneſs did he lead them! even "as a nurſing father, beareth the ſucking<note n="‡" place="bottom">Numb. xi. 12.</note> child." With what patience did he bear their frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and murmurings. But when they were in danger of being deſtroyed,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032376_0041_0FF2003A834FFDF0"/>what public ſpirit, what love did he ſhew for his people<note n="*" place="bottom">See Exod xxxii. 32.</note>! How often did he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſupplicate the ſupreme being in their behalf, to ſave them from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment they had ſo juſtly merited for their ſins. And when he was fully aſſured of his death,<note n="†" place="bottom">Numb. xxvii. 13. &amp;c.</note> his only concern was for them; earneſtly requeſting God to appoint <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to govern them, "that the congregation of the LORD, might not be as ſheep that have no ſhephered." And now, give me leave to aſk you, whether this action ſhews him to be an impoſtor? for had he aſpired to the regal power, no man ever had a better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of accompliſhing it. But he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of it: all his actions ſhew that he acted under the immediate autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God. He, therefore, ſaw, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring, his brother and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's children raiſed to the ſacerdotal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And what adds to the luſtre of the action, he himſelf puts them in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this dignity, whilſt he leaves his own children mixed in the crowd of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032376_0042_0FF2003EADA86678"/>Levites, without hopes of ever riſing to any higher preferment: for by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the prieſthood, they were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from ever having any ſhare in the honour, power, or wealth of the prieſts, and rendered totally incapable of ever enjoying the authority and dignity of the high prieſt's office. Theſe, Sir, are ſome of the actions of Moſes; and they are ſuch as ſhew him to have been a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of eminent virtue and piety. And, as he was virtuous and pious himſelf, ſo he endeavoured to form a virtuous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who, by a faithful ſervice paid to the one true God, ſhould give an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all the nations of the earth, of a pure and reaſonable worſhip. This Sir, was the ſole end of the legiſlation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo much ſuperior to all other forms of government; for as the illuſtrious author of the Spirit of Laws, ſays, "Beſides the common object which all governments have of ſupporting themſelves, each of them has beſides a peculiar one." Thus Sparta formed ſoldiers, Rome conquerors, and Carthage merchants and navigators; but this object of Moſes, I am bold to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032376_0043_0FF200406B608DA0"/>was much more noble, and more worthy of a wiſe legiſlator, than any of thoſe.</p>
            <p>I muſt farther obſerve, that the moſt famous legiſlators made it a rule not to change any thing in the ancient ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but to leave the people at full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to proſtitute their adoration to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior gods, to the ſtars, the elements, plants, reptiles, &amp;c. While Moſes conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it as a moſt important obligation, to inſtruct his nation in its duty towards the great Creator and governor of the world. To make them ſenſible of his power, goodneſs, juſtice and providence; and to teach them how to deſerve an happy exiſtence under his almighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, by an exact obſervance of his laws. Do you not think, Sir, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct like this, deſerves encomiums even in a philoſophical light?</p>
            <p>Moreover, what legiſlator ever ſpoke of the ſupreme being to his people, as Moſes did to the Hebrews? he gives them the moſt ſublime ideas of him, and ſhews them the moſt manifeſt proofs of his particular providence, &amp;c. And
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032376_0044_0FF200463888D6E0"/>which leads me to take notice of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that I have made elſwhere<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſſertations on the prophecies of the Old Teſtament. Introd. to Vol. Iſt. p. 44.</note>, in ſupport of the truth of the divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Moſes—It is as follows.—The modern philoſophers, ſuch as Voltaire, &amp;c. take a pride in repreſenting the Jews as an ignorant, ſtupid, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nation, compared with the more poliſhed nations of antiquity. Let us now for a moment grant the truth of their aſſertion, it of courſe will follow that, from a people ſo ignorant, ſtupid, and unpoliſhed, as they are repreſented to be, we naturally ſhould not expect to find ſentiments and doctrines, far ſuperior to any thing of the kind that we find among the moſt improved nations.</p>
            <p>Now, it is well known that the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nations the Egyptians, the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, the Aſſyrians, the Tyrians, &amp;c. were the neighbours of the Jews, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſurrounded them. Theſe, were all ſunk into the moſt groſs and ſtupid idolatry: for they worſhiped not only the ſun, moon, and ſtars: which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032376_0045_0FF2004A1ED72C10"/>to be animated, and on whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence they imagined their good and bad fortunes depended; but death men, heroes, &amp;c. Jupiter, Venus, Adonis, &amp;c. as alſo animals, inſects, and even onions. It therefore is requiſite to enquire, how the Jews thus ſurrounded by theſe nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, became poſſeſſed of ſuch juſt and ſublime conceptions, with reſpect to the Deity; and the moſt exalated ideas of his pure UNITY, as inculcated in the writings of Moſes; and where could they have learned ſuch rational worſhip? A worſhip confined to one inviſible, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Omniſcient, and Omnipreſent, being; the maker and governor of all things, viſible and inviſible, from whom the ſun; moon, ſtars, and every thing elſe derived their exiſtence, and in whoſe power it is to diſpoſe of them as he pleaſes. It is clear they could not have learned it from theſe nations, nor any other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their religion was ſo eſſentially different from that of any other nation in the ancient world: for they all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, practiſed the moſt impure, as well as the moſt cruel rites in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032376_0046_0FF2004DAAB99F40"/>of their Gods; and their public feſtivals in general, were ſcenes of riot and debauchery.</p>
            <p>Many of their ceremonies were moſt horribly barbarous. Their prieſts cut and mangled themſelves, in a moſt horrid manner, and practiſed the moſt dreadful mortifications in the courſe of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Innocent children were not ſpared by their parents, who madly devoted them to the moſt cruel death; that of burning them alive, either to appeaſe the wrath, or ſecure the favour of their gods. A remarkable inſtance of which, we have in the life of Themiſtocles, the renowned Admiral of the Athenians, as related by Plutarch. "When Themiſtocles was about to ſacrifice upon the Admiral galley, there were three very beautiful captives brought to him, well dreſſed and gloriouſly adorned with rich veſts of gold, ſaid to be the children of <hi>Autarctus</hi> and <hi>Sandauce,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Xerxes.</hi> As ſoon as the prophet <hi>Euphrantides</hi> ſaw them, and obſerved that at the ſame time the fire blazed out from the offerings, and caſt forth a more than ordinary bright flame, and that one ſneezed
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032376_0047_0FF2004F62A1D840"/>to the right, which portended a fortunate event, he took <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> by the hand, and ordered that the three children ſhould be conſecrated and purified for ſacrifice, and offered up as a vow for victory to <hi>Bacchus Omaſtes,</hi> or <hi>the Devourer;</hi> for hereby the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſhould not only ſave themſelves, but alſo obtain victory.— Themiſtocles was ſtariled at a prophecy that carried ſo much cruelty and inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in it; but the populace, according to their manner in all preſſing difficulties, truſting more to any abſurd and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant methods of appeaſing the Deity, than to ſuch as are reaſonable, with one voice invoked <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and bringing the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to his altar compelled him to perform the ſacrifice, as the prophet had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded."</p>
            <p>They alſo practiſed many ſhocking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, not proper to be recited; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in other reſpects chaſte, were taught that proſtitution (in which the choice of a partner was not thought of, as being totally excluded) was a neceſſary made of recemmending themſelves to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032376_0048_0FF2005124C884E8"/>the caſe, of which, we have the moſt unexceptionable evidence of both Greeks and Romans: and as every <hi>effect</hi> muſt have an adequate <hi>cauſe,</hi> I wiſh that you, or any other of the modern philoſophers, would be pleaſed to inform me, how you, or they, can account for the phenomena of a little <hi>Jewiſh horde,</hi> as Voltaire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to call them, being thus poſſeſſed of the true knowledge of the one living and eternal God, his providence, &amp;c. while the learned, poliſhed, and civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized nations, were ſunk in the moſt groſs, barbarous, and ſtupid Idolatry, unleſs they had received the knowledge thereof by divine revelation. I ſhall farther ſhew from the whole tenor of the Moſaical diſpenſation, in particular from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the land &amp;c. that theſe inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could be none other than divine.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032376_0051_0FF20063153D8000"/>notice of the cauſe of this war; and which we ſhall find to be not a "plundering and murdering excurſion," but undertaken at the expreſs command of God, to avenge the children of Iſrael of the Midianites, for what they had ſuffered through their ſeduction; and alſo for God's vengeance againſt them, for the crime of idolatry which they had cauſed Iſrael to commit againſt him: for both theſe are mentioned in ver. 2 and 3. "Avenge the children of Iſrael of the Midianites, &amp;c.—And avenge the Lord of Midian." For by the diabolical ſcheme of the Midianites proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting their women, the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, were ſeduced to commit idolatry: for which crime, twenty four thouſand of them were cut off. They therefore were commanded to make war upon them: and the aſtoniſhing ſucceſs of the expedition, plainly ſhewed, that it was undertaken and conducted under the immediate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God: for though the Jewiſh army conſiſted of but twelve thouſand men, yet did they not loſe one ſingle man, in fighting againſt the hoſt of Midian; and which made ſo great an impreſſion on the

            <p>When this army returned thus victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Moſes and the princes of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation went to out to meet it; and Moſes obſerving the women captives was wroth with the officers; and in a tone of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, aſked, "Have ye ſaved all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alive?" For the officers of the army were fully convinced that, according to the rules of war, none were to be put to death, but thoſe that oppoſed them; and therefore, women and children were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; as we find Moſes himſelf had laid it down as rule for the nation, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king war againſt any other nations, than the Canaanites: Deut. xx. 10. "When thou comeſt nigh unto a city to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, &amp;c.—And if it will make no peace with thee, &amp;c.—Thou ſhalt ſmite every male thereof with the edge of the ſword. But the women, and the little ones, and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032376_0053_0FF200669EC64BC0"/>the cattle, &amp;c. ſhalt thou take for a ſpoil to thyſelf." The officers therefore, flew all the males in Midian, and took the women, and the little ones captive. But Moſes tells them, that here the caſe was far different; for, "Behold, <hi>theſe</hi> cauſed the children of Iſrael, through the counſel of Balaam, to commit treſpaſs againſt the Lord in the matter of Peor," <hi>Theſe women</hi> were the principal actors in this abominable and attrocious crime; for by their proſtituting themſelves, they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Iſrael, and drew them to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure worſhip of their idol god Baal-peor; "and thus there was a plague among the congregation." It therefore, is but juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that they ſhould be puniſhed in an exemplary manner; as alſo to prevent their ever again alluring the nation to the love of licentious pleaſures, and the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of idolatry. The young males were ordered to be put to death, (as Abarbanal obſerves) to prevent the miſchief that might enſue from their being ſpared; by becoming as "pricks in their eyes; and thorns in their ſides," either by attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to avenge what they would eſteem
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032376_0054_0FF2006C69DD1A20"/>their country's wrongs, or by leading the nation into idolatry. But the young mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens who had done no injury to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and being as yet unpolluted with the abominable and atrocious crimes of their mothers, were not likely to injure thein, were permitted to live, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in domeſtic uſes in their families, or given as wives to their men ſervants, as will be ſhewn hereafter. This is the real ſtate of the matter. But, you, ſir, without any regard to truth or decency, aſſert,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 15.</note> that "it appears from the 35th verſe of this chapter, that the number of women-children conſigned to debauchery by the order of Moſes, was thirty-two thouſand." But whence, ſir, does this appear? is it to be found in the words of Moſes? Certainly not. Prove it then, ſir, it is incumbent on you to prove it. Prove this, I ſay, and I will never more defend Moſes; but will acknowledge him to be that deteſtable villain and horrid monſter that you pronounce him to be. Prove this, and I will then acknowledge the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032376_0055_0FF2006E2F08FC30"/>Old teſtament to be what you have called it, "a work of lies, blaſphemy, and wickedneſs; a bad book; the worſt of books;" any thing, whatever you pleaſe. Once more, I ſay, prove this, or I muſt tell you plainly (excuſe my freedom) that you are not only a <hi>baſe calumniator,</hi> but the <hi>baſeſt of calumniators,</hi> thus to miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent God's proceedings in ſuch a bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced manner; and which even your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, Voltaire, and the other infidel critics, were not hardy enough to do: for they only objected to the great number of girls that could be found in a country of the extent that Midian was of. But not a word, did they preſume to ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the order of Moſes for debauching the women children: No ſir, they knew better; they knew that they could be eaſily detected in making ſuch an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for they knew that Moſes was ſo far from ordering any ſuch thing, that his laws did not even permit it: this is clear from Deut. xxi. 10—14. where it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that a man ſhall not even <hi>marry a captive,</hi> without ſeveral previous formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and if he afterwards did not like
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032376_0056_0FF2006FEE857068"/>her, he was obliged to let her go free; and durſt not by any means diſpoſe of her, "becauſe he had humbled her."<note n="*" place="bottom">This is to be underſtood of the abaſement which ſhe had experienced, by being confined to ſevere trials, in the houſe of a ſtranger during a month; and then ſeeing herſelf caſt off by him, at the very time ſhe expected to become his wife. For it is the opinion of the Talmudiſts of Jeruſalem, of Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, and of Philo, that the law did not allow the firſt familiarities of the ſoldier with his captive. He was obliged to marry her. See alſo Abarbanal on Deut. xxi. 10, &amp;c. This is a manifeſt proof of the tenderneſs with which the laws of Moſes treated priſoners of war: and I am confident that no one can produce any ancient nation, whoſe government ever treated them with the like tenderneſs and reſpect.</note> All which, ſhews the falſity of what you have advanced ſo injurious to the character of Moſes; and which muſt now recoil on your own head.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall now proceed to take notice of your objections to the Books of Moſes themſelves; and ſhall ſhew, by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal evidence, that they are juſtly enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to the appellation of being the word of God.</p>
            <p>To begin with the book of Geneſis. You obſerve,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 14.</note> "Take away from Geneſis the belief that Moſes was the author, on which only the ſtrange belief that it is the word of God has ſtood, and there remains nothing of Geneſis, but an anonymous book of ſtories, fables, and traditionary or invented abſurdities, or of downright lies." This, ſir, is the polite language which you make uſe of, in ſpeaking of the book of Geneſis; a book that teaches us the origin of the world, the genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of our firſt parents, the ſettlements
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032376_0058_0FF20080096FF078"/>of ancient nations, and the riſe of arts. Concerning theſe things, I am free to aſſert, that antiquity cannot ſupply us with more veritable and precious monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than is contained in this, and the other books of Moſes. For as the authors of the ancient univerſal hiſtory obſerve,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. Iſt. Anci. Univ. Hiſt. preface, p. 13.</note> Moſes is the only authentic writer of what happened before, and for ſeveral ages after the flood. He is by univerſal conſent allowed to be the moſt ancient hiſtorian now extant: as it is certain, that his hiſtory was compoſed, not only before all the hiſtories, but even before the fables of the Greeks. For there is nothing contained in them relating to the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deluge, that has any appearance of truth:<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid page 27.</note> of this, every diſcerning mind will be fully convinced, on comparing the fabulous hiſtories of Sanchoniatho, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netho, Beroſus,<note n="‡" place="bottom">See his fabulous account of the deluge, Univ. Hiſt. page 50, &amp;c. As I have mentioned the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, I deem it neceſſary, for the information of thoſe who wiſh to ſee the hiſtory of Moſes ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the teſtimony of thoſe that are called pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane writers, to obſerve that the deluge, or univerſal deſtruction by water, is confirmed by the concurrent teſtimony of the moſt ancient writers; as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Univerſal Hiſtory obſerve, (Vol. 1. p. 55.) "That there was ſuch an univerſal deſtruction by water, is confirmed by the concurrent teſtimonies of ſeveral of the moſt ancient writers and nations in in the world. What account the Chaldean records (meaning the hiſtory of Beroſus) give of it, we have already ſeen. The Indian and Perſian tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may mention hereafter. That the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were no ſtrangers to this event, appears not only from thoſe circumſtances of Oſiris and Typhon mentioned above; but alſo from the teſtimony of Plato: who ſays, that a certain Egyptian prieſt recounted to Solon, out of their ſacred books, the hiſtory of the univerſal flood, which happend long before the particular inundations known to the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. The inhabitants of Heliopolis, in Syria, ſhewed a chaſm or cleft in the earth in the temple of Juno, which ſwallowed up the waters of the flood. Nay, the very Americans are ſaid to acknowledge and ſpeak of it in their continent: and we are told, that there is a tradition among the Chineſe, that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oncu, with his family eſcaped the general deluge," &amp;c. Thus we ſee that moſt nations have ſome idea of a delage, though none have ſo clear an account of it, as that given by Moſes.</note> Herodotus, and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus, with that of Moſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:032376_0059_0FF20081C097E6B8"/>
His philoſophy alſo, is not that barren and fruitleſs one, whoſe ſubtility evaporates
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032376_0060_0FF20083798192A8"/>in empty reaſonings, and whoſe powers ſpend themſelves in diſcoveries of no uſe to the happineſs of men: it is not that diſaſtrous philoſophy, which, with an axe in its hand, and a veil over its eyes, throws down, overturns, and deſtroys every thing, and builds up nothing: which in its impious phrenzy, makes mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its God; and which diſtinguiſhes man from beaſt only by his ſhape. No Sir, it is the wiſe philoſophy of a good man, who wiſhes to render his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures happy: for Moſes begins his hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with informing us, that there is a God, and that he created the world, and all that is therein. This was the grand fundamental principle, to bring men to the knowledge and worſhip of him that made them: for it is manifeſt to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that if man does but give himſelf time to reflect, that God made him, and gave him hands to feel, legs to walk, &amp;c. and endowed him with powers and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning faculties, far beyond that of the brute creation; he will naturally love and reverence that great and awful being, that
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032376_0061_0FF20087C3D8BDC0"/>can mould him as he pleaſes. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this ſublime truth, effectually deſtroys all thoſe falſe notions entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by certain philoſophers, of the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of matter, and a fortuitous concourſe of Atoms. It lays the axe to the root, and at once annihilates that fooliſh, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and impious tenet: and which is a demonſtration that the philoſophy of Moſes, was moſt beneficially conducive to to the happineſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>He is alſo to be admired as an hiſtorian; for, as a learned chriſtian<note n="*" place="bottom">Lowth's letter to Warburton.</note> obſerves, "Whatever defects may be noted in his hiſtory upon the whole, when compared with the more regular and more laboured productions of the poliſhed hiſtorians of Greece and Rome; yet in many parts of it he has given evident marks of ſuperior-abilities as an hiſtorian. The hiſtory of Joſeph, for inſtance, is an example of ſimple, noble, elegant, intereſting, pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic narration: of a juſtneſs, neatneſs, and perſpicuity of hiſtoric compoſition; to which nothing equal, or in any degree
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032376_0062_0FF2008E486D0738"/>comparable, can be produced from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus or Xenophon, Salluſt or Livy."</p>
            <p>As an orator, his exhortations in the book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> carry with them a force, a ſpirit, and an elegance, equal at leaſt, (conſidering the ſubject) to anything ever penned.</p>
            <p>As a poet, his beatiful ode, recorded in <hi>Exodus,</hi> is ſuperior to any thing of the kind: but his prophetic poem in <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy,</hi> is not to be equalled. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſix parts, as I have ſhewn in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="*" place="bottom">Introduction to Lingua Sacra, p. 4.</note> place. The firſt part conſiſts of the firſt five verſes, and is a prefactory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the poem: The ſecond part contains nine verſes; the ſubject of which is the kindneſs and beneficence of the Supreme Being towards <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The third part conſiſts of the next four verſes, in which he deſcribes the ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the nation: The fourth part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of the next ſeven verſes, in which he recounts the afflictions with which GOD would puniſh them for their diſobedience: The fifth part contains the next eight
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032376_0063_0FF2008FFB13AC28"/>verſes, wherein he deſcribes the final do ſtruction, which the Supreme Being might have been induced to have brought upon them for their enormous crimes, had it not been for one particular reaſon, and which he inimitably deſcribes: The ſixth and laſt part contains the laſt ten verſes of the poem, in which he rehearſes the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which GOD will take on their enemies.</p>
            <p>And I cannot forbear obſerving in proof of the prophetic inſpiration of this poem, that the firſt five parts of it, have been fully accompliſhed, viz. The kindneſs and beneficence of the Supreme Being towards Iſrael, in giving them poſſeſſion of the holy land, and their proſperity under David and Solomon: their ſins of idolatry, &amp;c. their captivity, and the ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that followed, and their preſervation as a diſtinct nation to this very day, notwithſtanding all their ſufferings, and which undoubtedly, is one of the moſt wonderful things in the world, as (ſhewn at large in my Diſſertations on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies vol. Iſt. p. 17, &amp;c.) whence, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032376_0064_0FF2009372EC7FC0"/>to think, that the completion of the firſt five parts, may be conſidered as a pledge and earneſt of the accompliſhment of the ſixth, which mentions the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nation, &amp;c. And it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that the prophet Jeremiah hath clearly evinced the truth of this poſition, in the following words,<note n="*" place="bottom">Jerm. xxxii. 42.</note> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces as an argument, in ſupport of what he had delivered as a prophecy, foretell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the future reſtoration of the nation: "For thus ſaith the Lord, like as I have brought all this great evil upon this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo will I bring upon them all the good that I have promiſed them." A ſtronger proof than what is contained in theſe words of the prophet, in ſupport of the ſpirit of prophecy, cannot be required; for the accompliſhment of the evils pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, is a ſure pledge of the completion of the good promiſed: and therefore, as it is allowed on all hands, that the firſt five parts of this poem, hath been fulfilled in every particular fact, it conſequently
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032376_0065_0FF2009768908D50"/>is manifeſt, that not the leaſt doubt ought to be entertained of the full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the laſt part. And which is a demonſtrable proof of the divine miſſion of Moſes.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I SHALL, now proceed to the other books of Moſes; viz. Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. Theſe, ſir, contain our laws, Religions and Moral; Civil, Political, and Ritual; (though I do not mean to treat of them all thus diſtinctly arranged; but only of a few of them as they occur to illuſtrate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we are treating of) from all which I hope to prove, to the ſatisfaction of every candid and liberal mind, that theſe laws were every way worthy of God, who was pleaſed to beſtow them by the hands of his ſervant Moſes, on this people Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</p>
            <p>There is one God, ſays the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch, and but One. This God alone deſerves to be worſhipped. He is the Supreme Being, the neceſſary origin of all beings; no other is comparable to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032376_0067_0FF2009E84464CA0"/>him. He is a pure ſpirit, immenſe and infinite; he cannot be repreſented by any bodily ſhape. It is he that created the univerſe by his power, and governs it by his wiſdom. He views all our actions; nothing can eſcape his watchful eye; and with an equitable hand he rewards and puniſhes us according to our deſerts.</p>
            <p>All this we learn from thoſe books; for the belief of the exiſtence of God, is founded on the firſt great commandment, <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That he is <hi>One,</hi> we are taught from Deut. vi. 6. <hi>Hear O Iſrael, the Lord</hi> is <hi>our God, the Lord</hi> is own.</p>
            <p>That he alone is to be worſhipped, is contained in the ſecond and third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me. Thou ſhalt not make unto that any graven image, &amp;c. Thou ſhalt not been down thyſelf to them, nor ſerve them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he cannot be repreſented by any bodily ſhape, we are taught from Deut. iv. 15. <hi>For ye ſaw no ſimilitude on the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032376_0068_0FF200A2033DC1F8"/>day that the Lord ſpake unto you in Horeb.</hi> This doctrine was likewiſe ſtrongly incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the prophet Iſaiah<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſal. xi. 18.</note>, who ſays, "To whom therefore will ye liken God? and what is the <hi>form of reſemblance</hi> that ye will compare with him? Again<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 25.</note>, To whom will ye liken me? and to whom ſhall I be equalled? ſaith the <hi>holy one.</hi>"</p>
            <p>That God knoweth all the thoughts and actions of mankind; and is not ſo in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and unconcerned about them, as the unbelievers think; who ſay, "the <hi>Lord</hi> ſeeth us not; the <hi>Lord</hi> hath forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the earth," (Fzek. viii. 12?) But on the contrary, he obſerves, and takes cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of all our actions: this we are taught from Gen. vi. 3. "And God ſave that the wickedneſs of man (was) great in the earth." See alſo Gen. xviii. 20, beſides ſeveral other parts of theſe books.</p>
            <p>That God rewards and puniſhes with an equitable hand, we are taught in Exod. xxxii. 32, 33. "Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their ſin: and if not, blot me, I
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032376_0069_0FF200A691417EE8"/>pray thee, out of thy book which thou haſt written, And the Lord ſaid unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whoſoever have ſinned againſt me, him will I blot out of my book."</p>
            <p>We are alſo taught, that although a temple was commanded to be built; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters appointed for its ſervice, ſacrifices and offerings inſtituted; yet all this is nothing in his eyes, if the ſentiments of the heart do not give it life. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that he requires above all things, and before every thing, is the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our entire dependance on him, and of his ſupreme dominion; thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his benefits; truſt in his mercy, reverence, and love. Thus he ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. v. 6.</note> "And thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength. And now<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. x. 12</note> Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ſerve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul. To keep the commandments of the Lord, and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032376_0070_0FF200AB28116688"/>the ſtatutes which I command thee this day for thy good." See alſo chap. xi. ver. 13, &amp;c. where theſe true and ſublime ideas are alſo ſtrongly inculcated; and which ſo eminently diſtinguiſh the Jewiſh from all ancient legiſlators; and plainly ſhew that the doctrines, which recommend ſuch a pure worſhip, can be none other than divine; as being every way worthy of God.</p>
            <p>Let us now examine the morality taught in theſe books, what beauty and purity do we find in this morality! There is ſcarcely a vice which it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. It is not enough that evil actions are forbidden, even deſires are prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "Thou ſhall not deſire<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. v. 21.</note>. Thou ſhalt not covet<note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. xx. 17.</note> In inculcating this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, Moſes not only requires perfect equity, untainted probity, juſtice, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and the moſt exact honeſty; but he would alſo have us be humane, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, and charitable: ever ready to do unto others as we ſhould wiſh they would do unto us, as he ſays<note n="‡" place="bottom">Levit. xix 19.</note>, "But
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032376_0071_0FF200ACDFEA93F8"/>thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf."</p>
            <p>This love is alſo to be extended to the ſtranger; "And if a ſtranger ſojourn with you in your land, ye ſhall not vex him. But the ſtranger that dwelleth with you, ſhall be unto you as one born amongſt you, and thou ſhalt love him as thyſelf; for ye were ſtrangers in the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Levit. xix, 33-34</note> Love ye therefore the ſtranger: for ye were ſtrangers in the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt."<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. x. 19.</note> Thus you may perceive that this brotherly love and charity was not confined to thoſe that were Jews born; as every other perſon might ſhare in them: for it is, and ever was, a fixed law amongſt us, to admit into our religion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, all thoſe that were willing to ſubmit to our laws and cuſtoms; and who after ſubmitting to the right of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and performing ablution, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated among the nation, and became as one of them: for thus the law ſpeaks of the ſtranger. "Let all his males be circumciſed, and then let him come near and keep it; and he ſhall be as one that
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032376_0072_0FF200AEBB25B940"/>is born in the land; for no uncircumciſed perſon ſhall eat thereof. One law ſhall be to him that is home born, and unto the ſtranger that ſojourneth among you<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xii. 48-49.</note>. Now Sir, is not this law far more humane than that excluſion of ſtrangers, ordained by ſo many other legiſlators<note n="†" place="bottom">Thus among others, we find Lycurgus excluding all ſtrangers from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.

            <p>Let us now conſider the humane and charitable laws, ordained for the relief of the poor, the widow and the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: of the ſervants and ſlaves: and we ſhall preſently perceive how ſuperior they were to all the laws of the ancient poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nations.</p>
            <p>Of the poor.</p>
            <p>"And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then thou ſhalt relieve him: <hi>yea, though he be</hi> a ſtranger or a ſojourner, that he may live with thee.

            <p>Before I proceed, it is neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that the ſervants here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are not Hebrew ſervants, (called purchaſed ſervants) but ſlaves, bought from among the Gentiles, or captives taken in war; as alſo of thoſe ſtrangers that ſojourned among them; agreeable to the following command, "Both thy bond-men and thy bond-maids, which thou ſhalt have, <hi>ſhall be</hi> of the heathen that are round about you; of them ſhall ye buy bond-men and bond maids.

And it is of theſe latter, that the law is thus tender; for the former, were
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032376_0078_0FF200C890D6A370"/>not to go free for the fake of an eye or a or a tooth<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe Gentile ſlaves were not only to go free for the loſs of an eye or a tooth: but likewiſe for the loſs of any of the twenty four principal members. See Talmud. Bab. Keduſhin fol. 25.1, and Maim. in Hilchoth Evadim. chap. v.</note>: but if the maſter ſhall thus injure them, they were entitled to the ſame reparation as the other Hebrews. And, now Sir, if you pleaſe to review all the laws of the ancient nations, I am confident, you will not be able to find any thing in them, that can equal the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and tender care of the law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not only for the poor, the widow and the orphan, but for the ſlave alſo: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the ancient governments aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, without exception, the ſlaves of both ſexes to the luſt and brutality of their maſters.<note n="†" place="bottom">Monteſquieu ſays, "I do not think, that the policy of the Romans was good in this reſpect. They gave a looſe to the incontinence of maſters." (the ſame may be ſaid of almoſt all ancient nations) He adds, "Slavery has for its object utility not volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs. The laws of decency are founded on the laws of nature, and muſt be felt by all nations. And if the law which protects the modeſty of ſlaves is valid even in arbitrary governments, where abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power reigns, how much more in others!" This licentiouſneſs (obſerves the editor of the Jews Letters to Voltaire) was the bane of morals among ancient nations. What could unfortunate ſlaves do againſt voluptuous imperious maſters, who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by no laws?</note> If you are acquainted
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032376_0079_0FF200CA4DE57AD8"/>with hiſtory, you cannot be ignorant to what exceſſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Exceſſes of incontinence, ſays the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, which are atteſted by all the ancient writers. Read only Anacreon and Horace, and ſee to what exceſſes the Greeks and Romans went in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Even Cato, the wiſe Cato, carried on a ſcandalous trade with his beautiful ſlaves, whom he proſtituted. There were alſo exceſſes of cruelty without bounds. It makes one tremble to read over the Roman laws reſpecting ſlaves. They compare them to beaſts of burthen, and give them up to the moſt cruel tortures. Did the maſter of a family happen to be aſſaſſinated, all thoſe that were under the ſame roof, or even within the ſound of the voice, were condemned to die without diſtinction. Theſe laws are the work of ferocity, and the ſcandal of reaſon, and can any one prefer ſuch government to that of the Hebrews?</note> this permiſſion gave birth, even amongſt nations that are propoſed to us as models of civiliſed and wiſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>At Lacedemon, let ſlaves be treated in
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032376_0080_0FF200CF9A08BFC8"/>the cruelleſt manner whatſoever, they yet could claim no protection from the laws. If any one looked above his condition, by an elegant figure, he was condemned to die and his maſter was fined,<note n="*" place="bottom">See vol. 22d. of the Memoirs of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy of Belles Letters, written by Mr. Capperonier.</note> in order that he might by ſeverity prevent his other ſlaves from offending hereafter the eyes of the citizens by their outward accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments.</p>
            <p>The Spartans, being authorized by ſuch laws, uſed to fall upon the Helots, whilſt they were at work in the fields, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy would deſtroy the ableſt men amongſt them; and this for mere exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and leſt theſe ſlaves ſhould increaſe too much. This was the ambuſcade, mentioned by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as one of the inſtitutions of Lycurgus<note n="†" place="bottom">"<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his ſecond and ſeventh Books of Politics, <hi>Plato</hi> in his firſt Book <hi>de Legibus,</hi> and <hi>Polybious</hi> in the ſixth of his Hiſtory," ſays M. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier in his notes on the life of Lycurgus in Plutarch, "have reproached <hi>Lycurgus</hi> for that his laws were more adapted to make men valiant than to make them juſt.</note>." "The thing"
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032376_0081_0FF200D313E206E0"/>as Plutarch ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">In the life of Lycurgus.</note>, "was this; Thoſe who had the care of the young men, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched from time to time ſome of the ableſt of them into the country at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, armed only with their daggers, and taking a little neceſſary proviſion with them: theſe in the day-time hid themſelves in the thickets and clefts, and there lay cloſe, but in the night they iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out into the high-ways and killed all the <hi>Ilotes</hi> they could light upon; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſet upon them by day, as they were at work in the fields, and murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ableſt and ſtouteſt of them in cold blood, as <hi>Thucydides</hi> alſo, in his hiſtory of the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> war, relates, where he tells us, that ſuch of them as the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians</hi> had ſingled out for their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, were crowned by proclamation, as perſons enfranchiſed (for their good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;) and went about to all the temples in token of freedom; but that ſoon after they all diſappeared on a ſudden, being about the number of two thouſand; and no man neither then nor ſince could give
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032376_0082_0FF200D6EF9E8958"/>an account how they came by their deaths. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> particularly ſays, that the <hi>Ephori,</hi> ſo ſoon as they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into their office, uſed to declare war againſt them, that they might be maſſacred with a pretence of <hi>Law.</hi>"</p>
            <p>And Rome ſtill more barbarous, calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viewed her great men ſlaughter their ſlaves, without the leaſt cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, in order to throw their bodies into their fiſh ponds to make their lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preys more delicious, by ſuch nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Even under the eyes of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, thouſands of theſe unhappy creatures expired in the amphitheatre, for the amuſement of a fierce and cruel people, and ſome feſtival days cauſed more human blood to flow in the empire, than many days of battle.</p>
            <p>But the laws of Moſes did not give ſuch tyrannical power to maſters: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they tenderly watched over the lives and modeſty of the ſlaves, as is plain from the foregoing extract from theſe laws; and which no doubt, was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that our anceſtors were almoſt the only

And in this unfortunate war the melancholy proofs of the dreadful effects of ſuch rebellion, is ſtill before our eyes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>From the extracts of our laws above mentioned, you may alſo perceive the moderation we were enjoined to uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our debtors<note n="‡" place="bottom">The moderation towards debtors, will be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treated of, when we come to ſpeak of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical year, &amp;c.</note>; and which I would recommend you to compare with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid law of the twelve tables, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the creditors to load the debtors with chains; and after ſome market days, to out them in pieces, and to ſhare amongſt them their bloody limbs, or to ſell them to ſtrangers!</p>
            <p>This humanity, Sir, was alſo extended
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:032376_0084_0FF200DA673A1188"/>even to the delinquent, as is plain from the following text. "And it ſhall be, if the wicked <hi>man be</hi> worthy to be beaten, that the judge ſhall cauſe him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his fault, by a certain number.

By this wiſe and humane law, ſo different from that of all other nations, the puniſhment of the culprit, was not left to the arbitrary will of the judge, who might order his <hi>hundreds</hi> or <hi>thouſands</hi> of laſhes; No Sir, the number was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to <hi>forty ſtripes:</hi> and that they might not exceed the number thus limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the<note n="†" place="bottom">Our code is ſhort, and clear; kings can read it and nations underſtand it; whilſt the code of laws of ſome of the moſt refined civilized nations, after many hundred years labour, are ſcarcely any thing more than undigeſted compilations, confuſed heaps of foreign oppreſſive laws, and barbarous cuſtoms; they are dark labyrinths, in which the moſt learned counſellors loſe their way, and through which the greateſt lawyers can ſcarcely ſhew a path: for what is law to day, is not allowed to be law to morrow It muſt farther be obſerved, that all the tribes in the whole nation, were governed by the ſame laws and flatutes. Judah had the ſame as Reuben; and Benjamin had none others than Simeon. But is many nations and governments, "every town, every hamlet has its own laws. What is juſt in one village, is unjuſt two miles farther, and they change laws as often as they change poſt horſes." Our laws were uniform and unvariable. But "there is no ſtability in theirs.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I ſhall now take notice of ſome of the precepts of the land, which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly termed a part of the Political laws of Moſes. With theſe, ſeveral Feſtivals, (which are a part of the Ritual law) are cloſely connected: and therefore, it is proper to conſider them conjointly. And for the better underſtanding of which, it is néceſſary that we go back to the call of Abraham; when we ſhall plainly ſee the propriety of the nation's being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God's <hi>choſen people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear manifeſt from the purpoſe for which they were choſen: which was to hand down the unity, and worſhip of the <hi>one</hi> only God, the creator of heaven and earth. This purpoſe, by the infinite wiſdom of God, hath been fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed through their means, as will be perceived in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the ſevere and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032376_0088_0FF200EAA68319B0"/>puniſhment, with which God pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed the ſins of the old world; and the means which we are naturally to ſuppoſe that Noah took to provide for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new in the true worſhip of God: we nevertheleſs find, that in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort time, mankind degenerated again, and advanced apace towards the ſame ſtate of depravity, that they were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood: eſpecially in regard to falſe worſhip, God therefore, called Abraham, who wherever he went<note n="*" place="bottom">Chaldees, Canaan, and Egypt, were then the moſt renowned and conſpicuous countries: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of which, were all deeply verſed in the idolatry of the ancient Sabians. See Maimonides in Noreh Nevuchim, part 3d. chap. xxxvii.</note>, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed them the vanity of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the creature inſtead of the creator; and boldly aſſerted his ſupremacy, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of all oppoſition<note n="†" place="bottom">Maim. Ibid. chap. xxix</note>. For his faith and righteouſneſs, God made choice of him and his poſterity, to hand down the knowledge of his unity, and preſerve the principles of the true religion uncorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, amidſt the Idolatrous fictition of a
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032376_0089_0FF200F1A5728088"/>falſe theology. It was for this purpoſe that God ſelected the family of Araham from among all nations, and ſealed them with his coyenant*, to be the repoſitory of the ſacred oracles: that they might convey them to poſterity in their original purity. And that this might be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, God promiſed Abraham the land of Canaan for an inheritance for his poſterity: though before that time ſhould arrive, they would be ſorely afflicted in captivity; from which however, he would redeem them; and ſeverely puniſh their oppreſſors; and thus make them fully ſenſible, that he alone was God; and governed the world by his particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. And, as Egypt might juſtly be conſidered as the very ſink of falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; the contaminated fountain, whence flowed idolatry, the arts of magic and divination; and the inſtitutions of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and obſcene rites; God was pleaſed to make it the ſcene of the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="91" facs="unknown:032376_0090_0FF200F5D4C99820"/>was the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the miracles perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Moſes: for the ſole end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of theſe miracles was, to convince all—the Iſraeltes*, the Egyptians, and the reſt of the nations, that the falſe dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties worſhipped by them, were nought but vanity, that could not profit: for that the Lord alone was the true God, and governor of the world; and that there was none elſe beſides.</p>
            <p>Now the moſt rational method that could have been taken to reclaim all thoſe from their errors, and induce them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth, was to make it appear plain and evident to their underſtandings, that things were, in fact, otherwiſe than they apprehended. For the Egyptians falſely imagined that thoſe illuſtrious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies, the ſun, moon and ſtars, as alſo the elements, were the diſtributors of bleſſings and comforts: for as they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the courſe of things to be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regulated, and the bleſſings of life to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032376_0091_0FF200F79ABA4130"/>of theſe bodies, they, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were led to believe them to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gods that governed the world. This being the caſe, let us now conſider how their fatal miſtake was to be removed, and they ſet right in this point:—Was it not by convincing them that theſe bodies had no other powers or qualities than what they derived from their great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whoſe inſtruments they were, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him to carry on the purpoſes of his providence? And what more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional method could God have made uſe of to form this conviction, than that of empowering his meſſenger to alter or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the qualities of theſe bodies, and make them operate by his bare command, in direct oppoſition to their ordinary courſe? This was appealing to their own notions, and making them ſenſible, in their own way, that the Lord alone was the creator and governor of the world, and that all viſible beings were but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſubordinate agents, working by his power, and under his directions: and whoſe powers he can ſuſpend whenever he pleaſes: conſequently, he alone was
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:032376_0092_0FF200F960E03E98"/>entitled to the worſhip and obedience of men, as he only could reward or puniſh them.</p>
            <p>That we may place this matter in a clear light, it will be neceſſary to take a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular view of the progreſs and conduct of the whole proceeding.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then, God, by a meſſage in his own name, required the Egyptian king to releaſe his people<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. v. 1.</note>. "Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, let my people go that they may hold a feaſt unto me in the wilderneſs." By Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's anſwer to this meſſage, it is plain, that he diſclaimed all knowledge of the God of Iſrael, and abſolutely refuſed to yield any obedience to him: thus he ſays<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 2.</note>, "Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his voice to let Iſrael go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Iſrael go. I worſhip my own gods, and none other." This was then the proper time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him, and all the Egyptians of their folly, or to puniſh them for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if they perſiſted therein. But God
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:032376_0093_0FF2010452AA7140"/>foreſeeing by his omniſcience what the conſequence would be, and being, as it were, unwilling to enter on the methods of ſeverity, commanded his ſervants to go again to Pharaoh, and repeat the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his diſmiſſing the Iſraelites. On this ſecond application, when the king required them<note n="*" place="bottom">Although it is not mentioned that Pharaoh did aſk them for a miracle; yet, as God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them how to act, when that Pharaoh ſhould require one of them; (as well'knowing that he would) and as they acted conformable thereto, it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be ſuppoſed, that he actually aſked them for the miracle, before that Aaron threw down his rod. See Arbabanal on Exod. vii. 9. &amp;c.</note> to exhibit ſome miracle, as a proof that they were not magicians, but the meſſengers of God, (as Abarba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obſerves) "Aaron caſt down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his ſervants, and it became a ſerpent." Hereupon the magicians were called to confront him; and they having caſt down every man his rod, they, in like manner, became ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. Thus far, then, both parties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited equal ſigns of power; but the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of God's meſſengers ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; for "Aaron's rod ſwallowed up their rods."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:032376_0094_0FF201060901AA00"/>
But this miracle making no impreſſion on the mind of Pharaoh, God proceeded by other miracles to ſhew his omnipotent power, in oppoſition to their falſe deities; by aſſlicting them with ten plagues; and which were wrought in the four elements; as well as in the heavenly bodies: for as Abarbanal obſerves, ſome were tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in groſſer elements of earth and water; as the turning the waters into blood, and the plague of frogs: both theſe were in the element of water. The next three were produced from the earth: and the remainder were performed in the lighter elements of air and fire; as alſo by the ſuſpenſion of the light and emanation of the heavenly luminaries, the ſun, moon, and ſtars, when he covered the land of Egypt with thick darkneſs for three days. Theſe miracles were admirably calculated to prove the falſity of their ideas concerning their deities; as well as to puniſh them for their ſins, of idolatry &amp;c. for as they highly venerated the waters of the Nile, as being the fruitful ſource of their choiceſt bleſſings; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that in their barbarouſly ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:032376_0095_0FF20107D7679B90"/>devotions to this river, they ſtained its current with human ſacrifices<note n="*" place="bottom">The Egyptians uſed annually, at the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of cutting down the dam of Khalij, or great canal, to ſacrifice a girl, or, as others ſay, a boy and girl, to the Nile, as a tribute to that river for all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits they received from it. See Univer. Hiſt. Vol. Iſt. p. 172.</note>. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the males of the children of Iſrael therein: the turning its water into blood, was a juſt and ſuitable puniſhment for ſuch bloody rites and cruelties: by thus depriving them of its bounty, in render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its water, which was their common drink, unfit to be drank; and deſtroying its fiſh, ſo that they could not eat them.</p>
            <p>In like manner did all the other mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles tend to convince them of his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power over their falſe deities, and his particular providence in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, and the protection of thoſe that ſerve him. This is manifeſt by the diſtinction made between the children of Iſrael in the land of Goſhen, and the the Egyptians, during the whole progreſs of theſe plagues<note n="†" place="bottom">See Exod. viii. 18-19—ix. 4-6-26 &amp; x. 23.</note>. But the laſt of theſe
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:032376_0096_0FF201099B25FB50"/>miracles, viz. the death of the firſt born, was ſuch a manifeſt proof of his power and ſovereignty, and a demonſtration of his taking particular cognizance of human tranſactions, and ſooner or later rewarding every man according to his works, as could not be denied. For, as he at firſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened,<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. iv. 21—22.</note> that if they would not let his firſt born Iſrael go, and ſerve him, he would ſlay their firſt born: the accompliſhment of that threat made ſo great an impreſſion on Pharaoh and all his people, that they not only gave them leave to go, but forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to depart.</p>
            <p>On this deſtruction of the firſt born of the Egyptians, was inſtituted the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the redemption of the firſt born of the Hebrews<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. xiii. 2—16.</note>; as was alſo the paſſover, &amp;c. in order to fix laſting traces on their minds, of the wonders which God had worked for them: to perpetuate from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation the memory of theſe great events; and to evidence the truth of them to the whole earth, even
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032376_0097_0FF20111761DED78"/>down to our own times; for the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the paſſover, and the other feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, as well as the redemption of the firſt born, are all ſtrictly obſerved through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the nation, at this very day; as proofs of the miracles performed for them at their deliverance from Egypt.</p>
            <p>The paſſover, therefore, as well as the redemption of the firſt born, which were inſtituted immediately in commemoration of the redemption from Egypt, are, in themſelves, a clear evidence and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of that event, as related by DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINE REVELATION; more eſpecially, as a great number of the other precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Moſaical laws are founded<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod xxix. 46. Levit. xi. 45. xix. 36. xxii 33. xxiii. 43. xxv. 38.42.55. and xxvi. 13.45. Numb. xv. 41. Deut. vi. 12. xiii. 11. xvi. 3, and xxiv. 17. Beſides a number of other paſſages.</note> on the ſaid redemption: and they are continually reminded<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. &amp;c.</note> of their ſubjection in Egypt, and the degraded ſtate of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, that they were there held in: it, therefore would be highly abſurd to
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:032376_0098_0FF201132D28AF28"/>conceive it poſſible, that three or four millions of people, could ſuffer themſelves to be impoſed on in ſuch a barefaced man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by being continually told of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded ſtate that they had been in; and unanimouſly agreeing to accept of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſaid to be founded on a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deliverance wrought for them, if, in fact, no ſuch deliverance had ever taken place. A poſition like this, Sir, ſurely no deiſt, freethinker, or ſceptic, will be hardy enough to advance. Now this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution actually took place at the very time of their departure from Egypt, and hath continued to this day: ſo that it is impoſſible to doubt the truth of it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the miracles of Moſes bear ſuch evident marks<note n="*" place="bottom">The miracles of Moſes have four marks of anthenticity peculiar to them, which evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate their divine origin: in the firſt place, they were objects of ſenſe: that is perceptible by the ſenſes. Secondly, they were performed in the moſt public manner, in the preſence of ſeveral millions of people, who were all eye witneſſes of them; and ſome miracles continued for a great number of years, as the manna, &amp;c. Thirdly, a great part of the ceremonial law is founded on them. Fourthly, thoſe very precepts took place from the time of their being performed, and have continued the ſame to this very day, without change or innovation.</note> of truth, being perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:032376_0099_0FF201578E792B70"/>in ſo public a manner, and for ſuch wiſe purpoſes; and on the notoriety of which, ſeveral feſtivals and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts were inſtituted, and immediately took place, and continue in full force to this hour; that it really is aſtoniſhing how any rational perſon can doubt their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity. It muſt farther be obſerved, in ſupport of what I have advanced, that God himſelf when he came to give them the law, appealed to the truth of thoſe things of which they were eye witneſſes<note n="*" place="bottom">See R. Judah in Lib. Cozri.</note>, and in which, as I may ſay, parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: he, therefore, does not ſay, I AM THE LORD THY GOD, WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH: for of that, they were not eye witneſſes; conſequently, they could neither affirm, or deny the ſame: But he ſays, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> Of this tranſaction, and the miracles performed both antecedent and ſubſequent to their departure from thence,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:032376_0100_0FF1D5C937D31788"/>they were all <hi>living witneſſes:</hi> it being but fifty days ſince their departure, and forty three ſince the Egyptians were drowned in the ſea, when they went over dry ſhod. It therefore, is not only improbable, but almoſt impoſſible to imagine, that a whole nation could be thus impoſed upon. Hence, it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follows, that as the precepts of the law, are founded on the redemption, and the miracles which accompanied it; and which were performed in the preſence of thoſe to whom theſe precepts were given, I ſay, it neceſſarily follows that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were performed by a divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and that the precepts founded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are divine precepts: conſequently, we have here a demonſtration of <hi>divine revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an other proof of the divine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Moſes, that I can by no means omit mentioning; (though in truth it it needs not father confirmation) I mean, God's ſpeaking to Moſes face to face, in the preſence of <hi>ſix hundred thouſand men,</hi> beſides women and children; as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032376_0101_0FF20116E3A3BBC8"/>Exod. chap. xix. 9. "And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I ſpeak with thee, <hi>and believe thee for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, Sir, was an eſpecial proof of the divine miſſion of Moſes; and indeed, a greater cannot be required, as Moſes himſelf emphatically expreſſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. iv. 32-33.</note> it; "For aſk now of the days that are paſt, which were before thee, ſince the day that God created man upon the earth, and (aſk) from one end of the heaven unto the other, whether there hath been (any ſuch thing) as this great thing (is), or hath been heard like it? Did (ever) peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hear the voice of God ſpeaking out of the midſt of fire, as thou haſt heard?" And it was this, that God meant by the expreſſion. "And this (ſhall be) a ſign unto thee, <hi>that I have ſent thee;</hi> when thou haſt brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye ſhall ſerve God upon this mountain<note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. iii. 12.</note>."</p>
            <p>For this was the eſſential proof of the
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:032376_0102_0FF2011A6CDF0F80"/>divine miſſion of Moſes; becauſe, they not only heard God ſpeak to Moſes, but <hi>to themſelves likewiſe;</hi> and by which they were fully ſatisfied of the <hi>exiſtence of the ſpirit of</hi> prophecy, as we find they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed themſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. v. 24</note>: "And we have heard his voice out of the midſt of the fire: we have ſeen this day that God doth talk <hi>with man,</hi> and he liveth."</p>
            <p>And what is ſtill a greater proof (if a greater can be) of his divine miſſion, and that the nation was fully convinced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is, that they, from thenceforward, agreed to receive, as coming from God, whatever he ſhould deliver to them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they were then fully ſatisfied of his miſſion. Hear their own words. "Now therefore why ſhould we die? for this great fire will conſume us. If we continue to hear the voice of the Lord our God we ſhall die. For who (is there) of all fleſh that hath heard the voice of the living God, ſpeaking out of the midſt of fire, as we (have) and lived? go thou near, and hear all that
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032376_0103_0FF2011E948138C8"/>the Lord our God ſhall ſay, and ſpeak thou unto us <hi>all</hi> that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, <hi>and we will bear</hi> (it), <hi>and do</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut v. 25—26—27. See alſo Exod. xx. 19.</note> (it).</p>
            <p>And as it was by ſuch extraordinary means that they were brought to a firm belief in the divine miſſion of Moſes, ſo hath it <hi>never</hi> been effaced from the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh nation: for notwithſtanding that they fell into idolatry, and other crimes; yet at no time whatever, did the nation <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> the divine miſſion of Moſes, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate his laws. No, Sir: not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of our government, and the conſequent diſperſion of the nation; the perſecutions of Heathens and Chriſtians, and the almoſt univerſal contempt of all nations, have ever been able to root it out of our hearts. In conſequence of this, the laws of Moſes have been han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded down to us, through ſo many ages and revolutions, ever the ſame, and ever reſpectable, whilſt nothing remains of ſo many forms of government of the moſt renowned nations but the names of the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032376_0104_0FF201225B253BE8"/>lawgivers affixed to ſome fragments of their laws. But this is not all; not only the Jews, but two thirds of this habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble globe revere theſe laws and look upon Moſes as divinely inſpired. What hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man government ever had the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>Compare this, now ſir, with the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary method that the great Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus took to render his laws immortal, and to cauſe them to be delivered down unchangeable to poſterity. "To bring this to paſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch's life of Lycurgus</note>, he called an extraordinary aſſembly of all the People, he told them that he now thought every thing reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably well eſtabliſhed, both for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic happineſs, and improving the virtue of each particular; but that there was one thing ſtill behind, and that of the greateſt importance, which he thought not fit to impart until he had conſulted the oracle: In the mean time his deſire was, that they would punctually obſerve his laws without any the leaſt alteration until his <hi>return</hi> from <hi>Delphi,</hi> and then he would
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032376_0105_0FF20125D3059D18"/>do as the God ſhould' direct him. They all conſented readily, and prayed him to haſten his voyage; but before he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he adminiſtered an oath to the two kings, the Senate, and then to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that they would inviolably obſerve his ordinances during his abſence. This done, he ſet fail for <hi>Delphi:</hi> when he came to the oracle, and had ſacrificed to <hi>Apollo,</hi> he aſked him, <hi>whether the law he had eſtabliſhed were ſufficient to make a City virtuous and happy?</hi> The Oracle anſwered, <hi>That this laws were excellent, and that the City ſhould continue in the higheſt renown while it obſerved the polity of</hi> Lycurgus. He took this oracle in writing, and ſent it over to <hi>Sparta:</hi> and then, having ſacrificed the ſecond time to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and taken his leave of his friends, and his ſon, he reſolved that the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> ſhould never be releaſed from the Oath they had taken, but that there he would put a voluntary end to his life. He therefore made an end of himſelf by a total abſtience from meat." But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, in about five centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; it was all forgotten; and it moſt
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:032376_0106_0FF20129536C7D08"/>certainly would not have continued ſo long; but (as M. Dacier obſerves<note n="*" place="bottom">See his notes on Plutarch's life of Lycurgus.</note>;) that the Spartans for a long time, had no wars but in Peloponneſus. But as ſoon as their thirſt of Empire had inſpired them with a deſign of having naval forces, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining foreign Troops; and there was a neceſſity of foreign money to pay them; then their oath availed no more againſt that neceſſity, than if it had been a ſpider's web; they did not ſo much as remember any ſuch had ever been taken. Then were the laws of Lycurgus violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a vengeance, and they were no more thought of than if they had never been.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, give me leave to aſk you on what principles of philoſophy, can you account for this great diſparity between the duration and perpetuity of the laws of Moſes, and thoſe of Lycurgus: for, this <hi>duration,</hi> this <hi>perpetuity</hi> of our laws, with the reſpect and veneration with which they have been treated for ſo many ages, and in ſo many climates, cannot be the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:032376_0107_0FF2012CD3143378"/>effect of chance. And can you account for it by any natural means? No ſir: it is impoſſible! The only ſolution is, that the one was the work of man; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fallible; and liable to be annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But the other, is the work of God, and, therefore, not ſubject to <hi>abolition;</hi> for as the Pſalmiſt ſays, "Various are the imaginations in the heart of man: but it is the counſel of the Lord alone that ſhall ſtand. The counſel of the Lord ſhall ſtand for ever: (and) the purpoſes of his heart to all generations." Yes, Sir, we here clearly perceive the finger of God: his power and his wiſdom ſhine forth too conſpicuouſly to ſuffer the leaſt doubt to remain.</p>
            <p>The feaſt of Pentecoſt, and Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, alſo founded on their redemption: the former, in memory, of the delivery of the law on mount Sinai; which was on the fiftieth day of their departure from Egypt; and the latter, as ſcripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly aſſerts, to commemorate the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Levit. xxiii. 43.</note> of God, in the protection of the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:032376_0108_0FF2012EA0D17D40"/>Iſraelites in the wilderneſs. Theſe three great feſtivals, viz. Paſſover, Pentecoſt, and Tabernacles, bear evident marks of their divine inſtitution: and ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate a divine providence: for they were called feſtivals of appearance; becauſe, thereon all the males were to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in Jeruſalem: as<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xxxiv. 23—24.</note> it is ſaid, "Three times in a year ſhall all your males appear before the Lord God, the God of Iſrael. For I will caſt out the nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither ſhall any man deſire thy land, when thou goeſt up to appear before the Lord thy God, three times in the year. Three times in a year ſhall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which he ſhall chooſe: in the feaſt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread, and in the feaſt of weeks, and in the feaſt of Tabernacles; and they ſhall not appear before the Lord empty. Every man <hi>ſhall</hi> give as he is able, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bleſſing of the Lord thy God which he hath given<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xvi. 16—17.</note> thee."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:032376_0109_0FF201326CEC1F40"/>
On this inſtitution, I muſt obſerve, that in the firſt place, it ſtrongly inculcates (as do moſt of the precepts, thoſe of the land eſpecially) a particular providence; for they were to go up to Jeruſalem, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks to God for their redemption from Egypt, and for the land which God had given to them, and the bleſſing he had beſtowed on the fruits of the earth, &amp;c. For the Paſſover was inſtituted in memory of their going out of Egypt in the month Abib<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xxxiv. 18.</note>; and the feaſt of weeks for the offering of the firſt fruits of wheat har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 22.</note>; and the feaſt of Tabernacles is called the feaſt of ingathering, when they had fully got in their harveſt: they, therefore, as an acknowledgement for theſe great benefits, were commanded to offer freewill offerings, and give to the Levite, the ſtranger, the fatherleſs, and the widow, according to the bleſſing which the Lord their God had given them: thereby juſtly attributing every benefit they enjoyed to the bountiful hand of Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:032376_0110_0FF20137B8C0F610"/>
Secondly, it clearly proves, that this law could be none other than a divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; for on theſe feſtivals <hi>all the males</hi> were commanded to come up from all parts to Jeruſalem (as above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.) Now, this is what no legiſlator, in his ſenſes, ever dared attempt to do: to leave the land three times a year to the defence of <hi>old men, women</hi> and <hi>children;</hi> promiſing them at the ſame time that no one ſhould take or deſire it. Who ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to riſk the ruin of his nation in this manner? more eſpecially when it is conſidered by what kind of neighbours they were ſurrounded; and who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ever hoſtile to them. I ſay, who dared do ſo? Who dared make ſuch a promiſe, without running the riſk of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inevitable ruin on the whole nation, but He in whoſe hand the hearts of kings are as rivers of waters, and who turneth them whitherſoever he pleaſeth<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxi. 1.</note>? He on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, could thus promiſe to protect their country in their abſence, againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of their warlike neighbours; and
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:032376_0111_0FF2013B68454BB0"/>which was actually the caſe during all the time of their obſervance of this precept: ſo that this may be conſidered as a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracle, and a demonſtration of the divine origin of the inſtitution of theſe feſtivals.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now proceed to ſpeak of thoſe precepts, that are more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the land; when the divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the Moſaical laws will be farther demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>All the ancient nations looked upon the diſtribution of lands as a maſterpiece in politice: And give me leave to aſk you ſir, where they were more wiſely diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted than by our lawgiver? The inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the famous Spartan legiſlator, ſo highly extolled by the Greek writers, muſt in this reſpect, yield the palm to the Hebrew legiſlator: for in the diſtribution appointed by him, every one out of the ſix hundred thouſand men fit for war, that entered the land of Canaan, was to have a portion of ground given to him, ſufficient to maintain him and his family in decent affluence.</p>

This inheritance, Moſes informed them, was given to them by God; they held it immediately from him, and were to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as the only Lord of the land. Hence it was, that they were commanded to offer the firſt fruits to Jehovah; when they were to make confeſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxvi. 3, &amp;c.</note> of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, in giving them the promiſed land, and in beſtowing his bountiful bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on it.</p>
            <p>They were alſo commanded to give tithes to the Levites,<note n="†" place="bottom">Numb. xviii. 21, &amp;c. Deut. xxvi. 12, &amp;c.</note> &amp;c. And, although you have been ſo ſevere againſt chriſtian prieſts, for demanding of tithes, yet, I think, you cannot in reaſon, have any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to this inſtitution in the Moſaical law: for, in the firſt place, as the whole tribe of Levi had no inheritance in the land, and were moreover ſet apart for the ſervice of God, it was but juſt that they ſhould have wherewithal to live; God therefore ordered that the other tribes ſhould give them tithes. And, ſecondly,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032376_0113_0FF201410626D058"/>though the Iſraelites were commanded to give tithes; yet was it not lawful for the Prieſt<note n="*" place="bottom">The prieſt had the grea: tithe, which was a ſiſtieth part, and was ſeparated before the tenth part for the Levite.
<p>Note, of the tenth which the Levite received, be was obliged to give a tenth to the prieſt; See Numb. xviii. 26. &amp;c. and which was called the tithe of tithes. Beſides, there was the ſecond tithe which the owner was obliged to eat in Jeruſalem, on ſpend the value of it there, by redeeming it, and adding a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

God had indeed commanded them to give tithes, as an acknowledgement of their holding the land immediately from him; (and which no doubt, every
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:032376_0114_0FF20142D1E325B8"/>good Iſraelite would be very willing on that account to do; more eſpecially as they were promiſed an increaſed bleſſing in return) but he by no means author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed the prieſts or Levites, to force it from them; or in caſe of refuſal, to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs them by law ſuits, &amp;c. Heace, there was no ſuch quarrels and contentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the prieſts and people in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh nation, as exiſts in many others; and which is a demonſtration of the divine wiſdom in the formation of this inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Another thing that was continually to remind them, that they held the land, as the immediate gift of God, was, that the lands thus given to them, were to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unalienable. "The land ſhall not be ſold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye <hi>are</hi> ſtrangers and ſojourners with me." (Levit. xxv. 23.) By this means the eſtates of the Iſraclites were ſo unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably fixed, that no family could ruin itſelf, or grow too rich and powerful: for the law ordained, that all eſtates ſold, ſhould return to its firſt owners, or their
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:032376_0115_0FF2014C4B814830"/>heirs, at the year of the Jubilee. Thus, the lands paſſed from the fathers to the children, and were to remain forever in the ſame tribe<note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. xxxvi. 7—9. And by which law, an heireſs was obliged to marry in her father's tribe; that the inheritance might not be removed from one tribe to another.</note> and family. This law was the effect of deep and wiſe policy. It perpetuated all the advantages of the firſt diſtribution; and by confining the citizen to his original ſpot, endeared it to him; and excited in him a love of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and frugality. It repreſſed ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and reſtrained the ambitious ſchemes of great landholders: It prevented the oppreſſion of the poor, and took away all cauſe of jealouſy, diſcontent, faction, and all thoſe evils which other common wealths vainly endeavoured to remedy by their agrarian laws.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt proof of a divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was inculcated by the law, that ordained the obſervance of the Sabbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal year, and year of Jubilee. On theſe years, there was to be a total ceſſation
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:032376_0116_0FF2014FC89AC628"/>from all manner of agriculture. "But<note n="*" place="bottom">Levit. xxv. 4.</note> in the ſeventh year ſhall be a ſabbath of reſt unto the land, a ſabbath for the LORD: thou ſhalt neither ſow thy field nor prune thy vineyard. That which groweth of its own accord of thy harveſt, thou ſhalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undreſſed:—A Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee ſhall that ſiftieth year be unto you: ye ſhall not ſow, neither reap that which groweth of itſelf in it<note n="†" place="bottom">Levit. xxv. 11.</note>, &amp;c." They were not only forbidden to fow, but were alſo prohibited from gathering the ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous product of the ſields and fruit trees, but all was to be in common; for the <hi>poor</hi> and the beaſts of the field<note n="‡" place="bottom">Exod. xxiii. 11.</note>, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the ſabbatical year, there was alſo to be a <hi>full diſcharge</hi> of all money lent to the poor; "At the end of <hi>every</hi> ſeven years thou ſhalt make a releaſe. And this is the manner of the releaſe; every ereditor that lendeth <hi>ought</hi> unto his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſhall releaſe <hi>it,</hi> he ſhall not exact

            <p>The Jubilee year was diſtinguiſhed from the ſabbatical year, by the ſollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinances. Firſt, it was a year of general releaſe of purchaſed ſervants. Even ſuch as at the end of their ſix years ſervices had voluntarily refuſed to accept of their freedom, and in conſequence had their ears bored<note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. xxi. 6.</note> in token of perpetual ſervitude, were nevertheleſs ſet free at the Jubilee; for in the fiftieth year, they were to "proclaim liberty throughout <hi>all</hi> the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof<note n="‡" place="bottom">Levit. xxv. 10.</note>."</p>
            <p>Secondly, in this year, all the eſtates that had been ſold, were to return to their former proprietors, or to the families to which they originally belonged: ſo that no family could be ſunk and ruined, and doomed to perpetual poverty; as the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:032376_0118_0FF2015351241B78"/>family eſtate could not be alienated for more than fifty years<note n="*" place="bottom">This law of the Jews (ſays Dr. Jennings) was famous among the Heathens, ſome of whom copled after it. Diodorus Siculus ſays, it was not lawful for the Jews to ſell their inheritances. Diod. Sicul. lib. 40. And Ariſtotle in his polities, Lib. 2. cap. 7, &amp; lib. 6. cap. 4. ſays of the Locrians, that they were prohibited by their laws from ſelling their ancient poſſeſſions.</note>. The nearer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Jubilee was, the leſs was the value of the purchaſe of an eſtate.<note n="†" place="bottom">Levit. xxv. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe laws, if viewed in a political light, cannot be ſufficiently admired: for they effectually prevented the too great oppreſſion of the poor, as well as their being liable to perpetual ſlavery. By this means the rich were alſo prevented from accumulating lands upon lands; and a kind of equality was preſerved through all their families. Never was there any people<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Jemmings antiq. B. 3. C. 10. p. 301.</note> ſo effectually ſecured of their liberty and property, as the Iſraelites were; for God not only engaged ſo to protect theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable bleſſings by his providence, that they ſhould not be taken away from
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:032376_0119_0FF1D5C5EB7916E0"/>them by others; but alſo provided in a particular manner, by this law, that they ſhould not be thrown away by their own folly; ſince the property, which every man or family had, in the original diviſion of the land of Canaan, could not be ſold, or any way alienated for above half a century, at the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>It hath already been ſhewn, that exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the humane and beneficent laws, which took place in the Sabbatical and Jubilee years, in favour of the poor, the ſervants, &amp;c. they were not permitted to ſow or reap, &amp;c. The queſtion therefore is, what were they to eat when they were thus deprived of the produce of their eſtates every ſeventh year? The wiſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver was fully ſenſible of this objection, and therefore provided a full anſwer to it, "And if ye ſhall ſay, what ſhall we eat the ſeventh year? behold, we ſhall not ſow, not gather in our increaſe: Then I will command my bleſſing upon you in the ſixth year, and it ſhall bring forth fruit for three<note n="*" place="bottom">Leviticus xxv. 20, 21.</note> years." This promiſe (and
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:032376_0120_0FF201624DBAF420"/>which was faithfully performed, while they on their part fulfilled the conditions on which it was promiſed) is an evident demonſtration of the divine inſtitution of this law; for here could be no counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit; no juggle: ſuch extraordinary fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs every ſixth year, muſt plainly ſhew, that the promiſe could only be made by the Creator of all things, the ſupreme Lord of the whole world. No human le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, ever durſt attempt to make ſuch a promiſe; and that for his own credit, the credit of his laws, and the ſafety of his nation, which might be greatly endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, by having a faminc brought upon the land, in caſe of failure of the promiſe; and which it was not in the power of any mortal to prevent. But in the hiſtory of the Hebrews, we have ſuch a manifeſt proof of the faithful performance of this promiſe, that when the nation did not fulfil the conditions of it on their part, they were not only puniſhed with famine,<note n="*" place="bottom">See 1 King. xviii. 2. 2 King. vi. 25. viii. and xxv. 3.</note>
               <pb n="122" facs="unknown:032376_0121_0FF201640C8C5760"/>but they were alſo carried captive into a ſtrange country, and their land lay waſte for ſeventy years, till it had fulfilled the ſabbatical years which they had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; agreeable to what Moſes, by the command of God, had threatened and foretold ſo many hundred years before it came to paſs:<note n="*" place="bottom">Compare Levit. xxvi. 34—35. with 2 Chron. xxxvi. 21.

And, now ſir, let us conſider your ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous aſſertion, that, "there is no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative evidence that Moſes is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of thoſe books;"<note n="*" place="bottom">page 6.</note> What! no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative evidence, you ſay! In the firſt place, does not Moſes himſelf tell us that he was the author of them? And Moſes wrote this law, and delivered it unto the prieſts the ſons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the elders of Iſrael<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xxxi. 9.</note>. And it came to paſs when Moſes had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finiſhed;<note n="‡" place="bottom">Deut. xxxi. 24</note>" Thus he aſſures us, that he wrote the <hi>whole</hi> law, till it was perfectly complete.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as above ſhewn, the precepts contained in the law, were founded on his bringing the nation out of Egypt; and which have been obſerved by the whole nation to this day; from the time of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to Joſhua: and from him to the time of the judges; to David and to Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and during the exiſtence of the

By this, you may alſo clearly perceive what little force there is in your pitiful objection, that "the books cannot be written by Moſes, becauſe they are written in the third perſon." It is, indeed, ſo weak, that I am ſurpriſed, a perſon of your <hi>ſagacity</hi> ſhould adopt it. But when I conſider, that almoſt all your objections are taken from one infidel wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or another, my wonder is turned into contempt. The <hi>ninth,</hi> is "the belief of the immutability of the law." This, fir, is a part of the confeſſion of faith of the Jews at preſent: and has always been ſo, from Moſes to the preſent hour; and you cannot produce any period from the time of Moſes till now, that it has not been their ſaith: for even the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> (who never received but the five books of Moſes) the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> and the <hi>Karites,</hi> thoſe enemies to tradition, all held the ſame. And which alſo ſhews the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of what you aſſert, that theſe books
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:032376_0126_0FF20176CBE14A50"/>were "written by ſome very ignorant and ſtupid pretenders to authorſhip, ſeveral hundred years after the death of Moſes." For at no time whatever, could a ſpurious hiſtory be impoſed upon them, without ſome one ſtarting up to detect it.

            <p>Beſides, at what time could ſuch an innovation take place? at what time did the nation firſt ſubmit to this impoſition? to be obliged to offer their firſt fruits, to give tithes to the <hi>prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Levites,</hi> the <hi>poor,</hi> the <hi>fatherleſs,</hi> and the <hi>widow;</hi> to be compelled to leave their habitations three times in a year, and come from the moſt diſtant parts to Jeruſalem, (leaving the whole country to the defence of old men, women and children) and bring free gifts with them: to let their lands lay waſte every ſeventh, and every fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year; and thereon to remit <hi>all debts,</hi> let all purchaſed ſervants go free, and all eſtates return to their firſt owners? I ſay, when could all this have been introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? for there was no time from the time of Moſes to this hour, when ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture could have been accompliſhed, without being detected.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEFORE I take leave of the Pentate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uch, I ſhall take notice of another objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you have made to the books of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being the word of God, becauſe, as you ſay, it is therein ſaid, "that they (the Iſraelites) came by ſtealth upon whole nations of people, who as the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory itſelf ſhews, had given them no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; <hi>that they put all thoſe nations to the ſword; that they ſpared neither age nor infancy; that they utterly deſtroyed men, women and children; that they left not a ſoul to breathe.</hi> The bible tells us, that thoſe aſſaſſinations were done by the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command of God.</hi> To believe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bible to be true, we muſt <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> all our belief in the moral juſtice of God; for wherein could crying or ſinil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:032376_0133_0FF20192AE06A378"/>infants offend?" This objection, as are almoſt all thoſe that you have brought againſt the Bible, is not new; it has been urged by Voltaire, Bolingbroke, Morgan, &amp;c. and often refuted by ſeveral writers; ſome in one manner; and ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whether what I ſhall advance on the ſubject will be more ſatisfactory, muſt be left to the opinion of the candid and judicious reader.</p>
            <p>I have already obſerved,<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 96.</note> that God called Abraham, and ſelected him and his family, to be the repoſitory of the ſacred oracles, and to hand down the knowledge of the true worſhip of God, and his unity, &amp;c. God therefore promiſed Abraham to give his poſterity the land of Canaan, with a deſign to make them a ſeparate people, to preſerve them from the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of idolatrous principles, which were then ſo prevalent. Now, it is well known that the Canaanites, as well as the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, were deep ſunk in idolatry; and which had ſo far prevailed among them, that they ſacrificed their children to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch: "for every abomination to the
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:032376_0134_0FF2019478B32EB8"/>Lord, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their ſons and their daughters have they burnt in fire to their gods."<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xii. 31.</note> And, theſe abominable practices, ſeem in a manner, to have been authoriſed not only by cuſtom, but by ſome command. "After the doings of the land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt ſhall ye not do: neither ſhall ye walk in their ordinances."<note n="†" place="bottom">Levit. xviii. 3.</note> This ſhews that their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous rites, were founded on certain laws and ſtatutes; for this is what the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>properly ſignifies. And, indeed, nothing leſs than a pretence to ſome direction of ſacred authority, could induce them to act ſo contrary to all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral principles. But by ſuch pretended laws, they could allow and recommend inceſtuous<note n="‡" place="bottom">The magicians allowed a man to marry, not only his ſiſter or his daughter, but alſo his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and it went ſo far with that ſect in the practice that in the ſacerdotal tribe, he that was born of this laſt and worſt ſort of inceſt, was looked upon as the beſt qualified for the ſacerdotal function: none being eſteemed among them more proper for the higheſt ſtations in it, than thoſe that were born of mothers who conceived them of their own ſons. See Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux. Connect. Part 1ſt. B. 4. p. 262, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors he quotes.</note> marriages and

See Lev. xviii. 6. &amp;c.</note> ſacrificing of <hi>innocent children.</hi> For this exceſs of vice, we find them remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as early as the time when the promiſe of their country was made to Abraham.<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. xv. 16. "For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full."</note> This being the caſe, how can we complain if God, after having beheld their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practices for ſuch a ſpace of time, and perceiving no ſigns of repentance and reformation among them, ſhould at length puniſh them with a moſt awful ſeverity: and thus, not only put an end to their abounding wickedneſs, but alſo make others, and particularly the Iſraelites, who were to poſſeſs their country, ſtand in awe and dread the danger of imitating them in their abominations; as Moſes ſays,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Levit. xviii. 24—25—28.</note> "Defile not ye yourſelves in any of theſe things; for in all theſe the nations are
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:032376_0136_0FF2019BC929B400"/>defiled which I caſt out before you. And the land is defiled: therefore I do viſit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vomiteth our her inhabitants. Ye ſhall therefore keep my ſtatutes and my judgements, and ſhall not commit any of theſe abominations; that the land ſpew not you out alſo, when ye defile it, as it ſpewed out the nations that <hi>were</hi> before you."</p>
            <p>Now, if conſidered in this light, the extirpation of thoſe nations, muſt appear to be no more than a juſt viſitation of the divine diſpleaſure, for their atrocious wickedneſs. The Iſraelites are therefore to be conſidered, in this matter, as no more than the inſtruments of the divine vengeance. And why might not Jehovah, the beſtower, and therefore the ſovereign of life, with equal juſtice cut off theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nations and their poſterity, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of human agents, as deſtroy them by an earthquake, inundation, fire from heaven, famine, peſtilence, or any ſimilar judgment: in which caſe, <hi>ſmiling</hi> and <hi>crying infants</hi> muſt alſo have equally
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:032376_0137_0FF2019F431B93F8"/>ſuffered? Had God then thought proper to have deſtroyed them, thus we ſhould have revered, without daring to blame, ſuch a tremendous diſplay of his juſtice and power: where then, I fain would aſk, is the material difference? In either caſe, his conduct is equally juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>But that which I would principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon, is, that the Iſraclites were not <hi>abſolutely</hi> commanded to extirpate the Cannanites: and for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of which, it is neceſſary to take notice of a part<note n="*" place="bottom">I do not mean to treat here of the whole of the military laws of the Jews, (as having reſerved that for the future publication, already mentioned in theſe letters, but only of ſuch part as ſerves to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the queſtion.</note> of the military laws of the Hebrews: which is as follows. "When thou comeſt nigh unto a city to fight againſt it, then proclaim peace unto it. And it ſhall be, if it make thee anſwer of peace, and open unto thee, then ſhall it be <hi>that</hi> all the people <hi>that is</hi> found therein, ſhall be tributaries unto thee, and they ſhall ſerve thee. And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war againſt
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:032376_0138_0FF201A2B8216668"/>thee, then ſhalt thou beſiege it: And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou ſhalt ſmite every male thereof with the edge of the ſword. But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, <hi>even</hi> all the ſpoil thereof, ſhalt thou take unto thyſelf: and thou ſhalt eat the ſpoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God hath given thee. Thus ſhalt thou do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the cities <hi>which are</hi> very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of theſe nations. But of the cities of theſe people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance: thou ſhalt ſave alive nothing that breatheth: But thou ſhalt utterly deſtroy them, namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, and the Perrizites, the Hivites, and the Jebuſites, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xx. 10—15.</note>." When this paſſage is duly conſidered, we ſhall find, that, firſt, they were obliged to ſend them an offer of peace: for this law was general, as "When thou goeſt forth to battle againſt thine enemies<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 1.</note>, &amp;c. When thou
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:032376_0139_0FF201A6307B4CF8"/>comeſt nigh unto a city to fight againſt." &amp;c. There was no diſtinction in this caſe; it did not matter, whether they were far or near, in regard to the proclamation of peace: for thus is it underſtood by all our <hi>Rabbins,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">When I mention the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> I wiſh to be underſtood, as ſpeaking of the ancient Miſhnical doctors, the Talmudiſts, &amp;c. who flouriſhed after the Babyloniſh captivity, during the time of the ſecond temple, &amp;c.</note> who obſerve, that they were obliged to offer peace to the ſeven nations, as did Moſes to Sihon: (Numb. xxi. 21.) and if they anſwered peace; then were they to become tributary, and be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to remain in the country on condition of their renouncing idolatry, and obſerving the ſeven precepts of the ſons of Noah.<note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe precepts are as follows: Firſt, not to commit idolatry.

Third, to appoint and conſtitute juſt and upright judges; that juſtice may be impartially adminiſtered to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

Seventh, Not to eat a member of any living creature: that is, the fleſh of any beaſt taken from it when it was alive.</note> The real diſtinction therefore between theſe, was this, that if the nations who were far off, refuſed to make peace, they were to kill all the males; that is, all thoſe
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:032376_0140_0FF201A9DCE13810"/>that bore arms, for then every man was a ſoldier; and they were not allowed to kill any but thoſe that oppoſed them, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 52.</note> It therefore muſt be obſerved, that this is a <hi>permiſſion,</hi> not an order given: they were allowed to kill thoſe that oppoſed them, and none<note n="†" place="bottom">This was a proper leſſon of humanity, fitted to thoſe barbarous times, and given to our fathers, to oblige them to abſtain from thoſe ſhocking prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices which all nations then indulged themſelves in: and which, in later times, the moſt poliſhed nations, the Perſians, the Greeks, and the Romans, &amp;c. under kings, and commanders moſt famed for gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and benevolence practiſed; as will be ſhewn at large, in treating of all the precepts of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical law, in the future publication already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</note> elſe: and therefore the women and children were to be preſerved alive. But, if any of the cities of the ſeven nations refuſed to make peace with them, then they were not to ſave alive any thing that breatheth: and the reaſon is immediately given; "that they teach you not to do after all
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:032376_0141_0FF201AB92211918"/>their abominations, which they have done unto their gods, ſo ſhould ye ſin againſt the Lord your God."<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xx. 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But if they were willing to make peace Iſrael was obliged to make peace with either of them: whether thoſe that were far off; or thoſe that were near; all were equal in this particular. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>rabbins</hi> ſay, that upon Joſhua's entering the land of promiſe, he publiſhed three proclamations; firſt, "that thoſe inclined to make peace, ſhould have peace granted to them. Second, thoſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to war, ſhould have war. And third, thoſe that wiſhed to depart, might freely depart." Hence it is manifeſt that they were obliged to offer them peace: and which is plain, from Joſh. xi. 19-20. "There was not a city which made peace with the children of Iſrael, ſave the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, the inhabitants of Gibeon: all <hi>other</hi> they took in battle. For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts that they ſhould come againſt Iſrael in battle, that he might deſtroy them utterly, <hi>and</hi> that
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:032376_0142_0FF201AF5BD2CD80"/>they might have no favor, but that he might deſtroy them, as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Moſes." And which, plainly implies, that if they had not been ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, as to engage in a war with the Iſraelites, and to appear in arms againſt them, but had repented, and ſubmitted their propoſals, they would have been ſaved, inſtead of being put to death; conſiſtent with the divine command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their exciſion. If therefore the Canaanites met with deſtruction from the victorious ſword of the Iſraelites, they had none but themſelves to blame. By complying with the reaſonable terms of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them, it was in their power to prevent it.</p>
            <p>I am, however, aware that the caſe of the Gibeonites may be urged as an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the poſition here laid down: as we find the Iſraelites expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the following terms to them, "Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how ſhall we make a league with<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. ix. 7</note> you?" By which, it would appear at firſt view,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:032376_0143_0FF201B626803F38"/>that they could not make peace with any of thoſe nations: but this objection will inſtantly vaniſh, when the exact meaning of the words made uſe of, by the Gibeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, is clearly underſtood: for they did not ſimply aſk for peace, but ſaid, "now therefore make ye a league with<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. 6.</note> us." That is, as the Iſraclites underſtood it, to treat them as confederates, as allies; to admit them to a league of equal right and privilege, ſuch as one independent ſtate enters into with another. And which the Iſraelites could by no means comply with; becauſe they were ſo often commanded not to make 2 covenant with them, leſt it ſhould be a ſnare to them; (ſee Exod. xxiii. 34. xxxiv. 12—15. &amp; Deut. vii. 2.) they therefore ſaid, how can I make a league with you, ſeeing it is ſo ſtrictly forbidden to make a covenant with any of theſe nations; although we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to let them live, on their aſking for peace, and, ſubmitting to the conditions annexed thereto: viz. the renouncing all idol worſhip and becoming tributary.
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:032376_0144_0FF201BF2EF93138"/>This is manifeſt from the manner in which they behaved to the Gibeonites, when they found that they were of the ſeven nations; for otherwiſe, no oath could have been binding on the Iſraelites, (much leſs one obtained by fraud) to oblige them to violate the command of God, in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe to live that he had doomed to die. This may alſo be farther proved from the lenity ſhewn to the inhabitants of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer;<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſhua xvi.</note> to Rahab,<note n="†" place="bottom">vi, 22.</note> and to the family in Bethel:<note n="‡" place="bottom">Judg. i. 26.</note> from all which, it is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that if the Canaanites had repented, and ſubmitted to renounce all their idol worſhip, and become tributary, they would not have been cut off. But their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and atrocious wickedneſs was the only, and ſole cauſe of their exciſion: and clearly ſhews the futility of your objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p>YOU obſerve (p. 18), "I proceed to the book of Joſhua, and to ſhew that Joſhua is not the author of that book, and that it is anonymous, and without authority." I ſhall not ſpend my time to ſhew how unconnected your concluſion is with your premiſes, as the learned biſhop of Landaff has clearly pointed out the fallacy of your argument, by ſhewing that a book may be <hi>anonymous,</hi> and yet not be without <hi>authority.</hi> I, therefore, do not mean to contend with you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joſhua's writing the book that bears his name, becauſe I am convinced he did not write it: for it is no where ſaid that he wrote it, as is teſtified of Moſes (as above mentioned, page 121—122): but only after Joſhua had delivered his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:032376_0146_0FF201C2A8890F58"/>it ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. xxiv. 2</note>, "And Joſhua wrote theſe words in the book of the law of God, and took a great ſtone," &amp;c. If then, he had written the whole book, it would alſo have been mentioned; I, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, am of opinion, with the learned Abarbanal (See his preface to Joſhua), that the prophet Samuel wrote the books of Joſhua (except the part which Joſhua wrote himſelf), Judges, Ruth, and a part of the book that bears his name; and which was finiſhed by Nathan the prophet, and Gad the ſeer (as mentioned 1 Chron. xxix. 29.); but all this does not deduct from their authenticity, or invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date their authority in the leaſt: as even on this ſcheme they were written by the prophets; and are very properly called the word of God, from the words above quoted; where what Joſhua wrote, is ſaid to be written in the law of God: and alſo becauſe they direct us to the true worſhip of God, by clearly pointing out to us the merciful dealings of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Iſrael; and which is the great end
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:032376_0147_0FF201C7E44A5C08"/>and purpoſe for which they were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the principal end of the book of Joſhua, is to teſtify that all promiſes which God made to our anceſtors Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, as recorded in the law of God, by the hands of Moſes, concerning the conqueſt and poſſeſſion of the land, were all fully accompliſhed; and of which Joſhua himſelf bare witneſs in his public exhortation to Iſrael, in his old age, "And behold, this day I <hi>am</hi> going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts, and in all your ſouls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God ſpake concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you; all are come to paſs unto you, <hi>and</hi> not one thing hath failed thereof."<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. xx<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i 14.</note> And which was a manifeſt proof of the divine miſſion of Moſes; as every thing that he had predicted was fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. And which muſt undoubtedly have made a great impreſſion on their minds, by convincing them of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power of divine providence; and thus induce them ſtrictly to adhere to the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:032376_0148_0FF201C9A4ACE2B0"/>worſhip of the true God; and to which the admonition of Joſhua alſo greatly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by placing before them the dreadful conſequence of diſobedience, "Therefore it ſhall come to paſs, <hi>that</hi> as all the good things are come upon you, which the Lord your God promiſed you; ſo ſhall the Lord bring upon you all the evil things, until he have deſtroyed you from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you."<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. xxiii. 15.</note> And the good effects of all this, may be eaſily perceived; firſt, in the affair of the altar raiſed by the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Reuben and Gad,<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. xxii. 10—34.</note> &amp;c. wherein it is ſhewn how tenacious they were of adhering to God's worſhip; and how fearful of having any thing among them, that appeared like idolatry; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by what is recorded of them in the 31ſt verſe of the laſt chapter of the book of Joſhua, "And Iſrael ſerved the Lord all the days of Joſhua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joſhua and which had known all the works of the Lord, that he had done for Iſrael."</p>
            <p>This leads me to take notice of what
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:032376_0149_0FF201CB6080BD60"/>you are merrily pleaſed to call, the "tale of the ſun ſtanding ſtill upon Mount Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon, and the moon in the valley of Aja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 20.</note> and which you farther ſay, "is one of thoſe fables that detects itſelf. Such a circumſtance could not have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened without being known all over the world. Whereas, there is not a nation that knows any thing about it." But how ſhould they, when it is well known, that there is not a nation in the world whoſe annals reach this aera by ſome hundred years? And yet, my good friend, it will perhaps appear that you are miſtaken as to the fact, for the ſame ſupernatural phaenomenon is recorded in the ancient <hi>Chineſe</hi> annals, to have happened and been obſerved there, in the reign of their 8th monarch <hi>You:</hi> though according to their fabulous manner, they ſay it laſted ten days. (Anc. Univ. Hiſt. Vol. 18. p. 107.) To this may alſo be added what Herodotus ſays, the Egyptian prieſts told him; viz. that the ſun had four times deviated from his courſe, having twice riſen where he
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:032376_0150_0FF201CD46472998"/>uniformly goes down, and twice gone down where he uniformly riſes: by which you may perceive, that the Egyptians had alſo a confuſed tradition concerning the two miracles reſpecting the ſun, as record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſcripture.</p>
            <p>You ſay, "as a poetical figure, the whole is well enough;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 20.</note> but although there are ſome commentators who may view it in this light; and that perhaps for the reaſon alledged by a certain Chriſtian writer, who ſays, "but becauſe there ſeems, to my apprehenſion at leaſt, no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon for ſuch ſupernatural appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this inſtance:"<note n="†" place="bottom">See Wakefield's reply to the ſecond part of the Age of Reaſon, p. 27—28.</note> But if duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it will appear that it was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, at this juncture, as being highly conducive in promoting the grand deſign; I mean, the eſtabliſhment of the true religion, and the extirpation of Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry: and in which light, we muſt alſo view the dividing of the river Jordan, and the caſting of hail ſtones from heaven upon the Canaanites, &amp;c. inaſmuch as they all tended to fill the nations with

To convince them then, that the gods in whom they truſted were entirely ſubject to the will of the God of Iſrael; and at the ſame time to puniſh them for the falſe worſhip they paid to them, "the Lord caſt down great hail ſtones from heaven (or the air) upon them unto Azekah;" and then ſtopped the two great luminaries in their courſe. And therefore it ſays, "in the ſight of
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:032376_0152_0FF201DB6F899DE0"/>all Iſrael," that all Iſrael might receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from it, and be deterred from falling into the like idolatry: and no doubt it was to this in a great meaſure; that they ſhewed their dread and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in the affair of the Reubenites, &amp;c. building the altar; as above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. (page 150) Hence it is manifeſt, that this miracle is to be conſidered, as a link in the great chain of miracles, began by Moſes, to convince and puniſh the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well as to wean the Iſraelites from that idolatry, to which they were ſo prone.</p>
            <p>How that the miracle was performed, it is impoſſible for us to explain; neither do I think it at all neceſſary; it is ſufficient, as we have ſhewn, that the end it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for was worthy of God. And in teſtimony of the reality of the miracle, we find that, when the prophet Habakkuk, in his<note n="*" place="bottom">Habak. iii. 10—13.</note> prayer for the preſervation of the nation, in this long and dreadful captivity, recounted all the miracles and wonders which God performed for Iſrael when he
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:032376_0153_0FF201DEEF017A50"/>brought them out of Egypt: he likewiſe enumerated all thoſe performed in the conqueſt of Canaan: "The mountains ſaw thee <hi>and</hi> they trembled: the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of waters paſſed away: the deep uttered its voice, <hi>and</hi> lifted up its hands on high. The ſun <hi>and</hi> the moon ſtood ſtill in their habitation: by the light of thine arrows they went, <hi>and</hi> by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy glittering ſpear. In <hi>thine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation didſt thou march through the land; in thy wrath didſt thou tread<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. Threſh.</note> the nations. Thou wenteſt forth for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thy people, even for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thine anointed." By the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains trembling, he meant the kings of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, who trembled, and were in pangs: and thus ſays Moſes in his ſong:<note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. xv. 15—16.</note> "All the inhabitants of Canaan ſhall melt away. Fear and dread ſhall fall upon them;" the overflowing of the waters denotes the ſtreams when Jordan was divided: and the deep uttering its voice, denotes the fame of that miracle through all the land of Canaan:<note n="‡" place="bottom">Joſh. v. 1 &amp;c.</note> the lifting up of its hands
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:032376_0154_0FF201E0B5973918"/>on high, denotes that the lower ſtreams of Jordan, whoſe banks were then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed,<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. iii. 15.</note> paſſed away towards the Red Sea, whilſt the upper waves ſtood on an heap. The ſun and moon ſtanding ſtill in <hi>their</hi> habitation, requires no explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the arrows and glittering ſpear, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the inſtruments of deſtruction which God employed; the great hail ſtones; and which may be metaphorically called his arrows and ſpear; and by whoſe light the Iſraelites walked: thus did God, in wrath and indignation, on account of the great and abominable wickedneſs of the Canaanites, march through the land, and cruſhed them, as corn is by the drag; and which was, when he went forth for the ſalvation of his people. Thus we ſee the prophet deſcribing in ſublime figurative language, all the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles performed in the conqueſt of Canaan; amongſt which none is ſo plain and clear as this of the ſun and moon ſtanding ſtill; and which is an evident proof of the truth thereof: eſpecially,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:032376_0155_0FF201E475806D28"/>when it is conſidered, that the ſubject of the prophet's prayer was for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the nation in this captivity, which God informed him of upwards of ſix hundred years before it took place.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another proof of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of this miracle; which is the appeal that the author of the book of Joſhua makes to the book of <hi>Jaſher,</hi> as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the fact which he was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, "Is not this written in the book of Jaſher?" Hence it is manifeſt, that the book commonly called the book of Jaſher, exiſted, and was well known at the time the book of Joſhua was written: and pray, ſir, what book do you think this was? Why, none other than the law of Moſes. I ſee you are ſurpriſed; but hold, ſir, I will preſently explain this to you. The word in the Hebrew (with which, I judge, you are totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted, though ſo highly requiſite in the taſk you have undertaken), is <gap reason="foreign">

Has not this been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in that righteous book? Yes, moſt certainly. But, perhaps you may aſk, where? Be patient, and I will tell you. When Moſes was bleſſing Iſrael before his death, he told them of the happineſs they were to enjoy in the land, and that they ſhould atchieve the conqueſt thereof by the eſpecial miraculous aſſiſtance of the God of Iſrael; he expreſſed himſelf in this manner<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxxiii. 26.</note>, "There is none like unto the God of Jeſhurun, who rideth upon
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:032376_0157_0FF201EBB79E4BE8"/>the heaven in thy help, and his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is on the ſkies. <hi>Which</hi> is the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the eternal God, and underneath <hi>are</hi> the everlaſting arms: and he ſhall thruſt out the enemy before thee, and ſhall ſay deſtroy them." By this ſublime figurative language, the prophet foretold the deſtruction of their enemies in the land of Canaan; and which ſhould be, by the power of him who rideth above the heavens: who guideth all by his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power: the mover of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: who only is able to ſtop the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly luminaries in their courſe, "till the people had avenged themſelves of their enemies.<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. x. 13.</note> Agreeable to what is here written, "And ſhall ſay, deſtroy <hi>them.</hi>" And the conſequence of this will be, that "Iſrael ſhall then dwell in ſafety alone, <hi>according to</hi> the form <hi>of the bleſſing</hi> of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, † on a land of corn and wine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his heaven ſhall drop dew."</p>
            <p>He then concludes, "Happy <hi>art</hi> thou O Iſrael! Who is like unto thee, O peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note n="‡" place="bottom">Alluding to Gen. xxvii. 28.</note>
               <pb n="159" facs="unknown:032376_0158_0FF201EF2DBB8CD0"/>ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy lielp, and who is the ſword of thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency! and thine enemies ſhall be found liars unto thee, and thou ſhalt tread upon their high places." In the conqueſt of Canaan, it may well be ſaid, that the Lord was the ſhield of their help, and the ſword of their excellency. The Gibeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, a part of their enemies, were found liars to them, by pretending that they came from a far country, when they dwelt in the land: and the treading on their high places, denoted the daſtruction of the five kings in this battle, on whoſe necks Joſhua commanded his captains to tread, as is ſaid,<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. x. 24—25.</note> "Joſhua called for all the men of Iſrael, and ſaid unto the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of theſe kings: for thus ſhall the Lord do to all your enemies againſt whom ye fight."

            <p>Thus is the reality of this miracle not only confirmed, but the prediction of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is alſo fully verified; and the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the law of Moſes at that time, clearly preved: as it would have been madneſs in the author, to have appealed in proof of his veracity, to a book that never yet had exiſtence, or that was not well known in the nation, as an authentic book.</p>
            <p>The end of the other three books, viz. Judges, Samuel, and Kings is alſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of the particular providence of God; by ſhewing, that in the days of the Judges, as well as thoſe of the kings, the nation was exceedingly wicked; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the true worſhip of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting idolatry, &amp;c. for which they were delivered into the hands of their enemies; but when they ſincerely repented, and
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:032376_0160_0FF201F6D7A2EB28"/>returned to God, their enemies fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; and they enjoyed the greateſt proſperity and happineſs that poſſibly could be; as in the reigns of David and Solomon: all which, was a manifeſt proof of the ſuperintendance of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and of the truth of what Moſes had told them, concerning the reward and puniſhment, which they were to expect in caſe of obedience or diſobedience: and which was fully accompliſhed in every particular; till that, for the great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the nation, and their kings, they were deſtroyed from off the goodly land, as Joſhua had alſo told them; and as is recorded in thoſe books: and which is a demonſtrable proof of their authority.</p>
            <p>As to the difference between the books of Kings and Chronicles, I muſt tell you, that they have been noticed by ſeveral Hebrew commentators, and clearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for by that great luminary, the learned Abarbanal, as he has ſhewn, that there is nothing contradictory in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent books, but that each writer, had a different purpoſe in view; and which eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:032376_0161_0FF201F88F10AC98"/>accounts for the omiſſions in one book, though related in the other: but as it would ſwell theſe letters, (which already exceed the limits I firſt intended) to the bulk of a large volume, I muſt omit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the explanation at preſent, and reſerve it for my commentary on the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>I ſhould indeed extend theſe letters to a length troubleſome to myſelf, and tireſome to the reader, were I minutely to anſwer every objection you have made, and to rectify the numberleſs errors into which you have fallen: I therefore did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have ſaid any more on the ſubject of theſe four books; but the ridicule you have made uſe of in a note, on the ſtory of the angel appearing to Joſhua, deſerves the ſevereſt reprehenſions; for that being ſo ignorant of ſacred literature, you ſhould thus profanely jeſt, with what you do not in the leaſt underſtand, as I ſhall plainly ſhew.</p>
            <p>That perſon, whoever he be, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to criticiſe on ſcripture, ought not only to have a great knowledge of the Hebrew, but alſo a thorough acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:032376_0162_0FF201FA5BDF4100"/>with the <hi>idiom</hi> and <hi>phraſeology</hi> of the ſacred language, ſo different from all others: or he will certainly fail in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and render himſelf ridiculous in the eyes of every diſcerning perſon, and juſtly merit their contempt. Of the truth of this obſervation, there cannot be a greater, than will appear in the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubject in queſtion. Before I proceed to the explanation, it is neceſſary to enquire why Joſhua, who was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, as well as the ruler of the nation, when he ſaw a man, for the text does not ſay an angel, at a diſtance, ſhould go up to him himſelf, and aſk him, <hi>art</hi> thou for us, or for our adverſaries? as this ought to have been done by ſome of the troops, who ought to have gone and ſeized him and brought him to Joſhua, and not Joſhua have gone to him, as it might perhaps have been his intention, to aſſaſſinate the commander in chief; it therefore is ſomething uncommon, that Joſhua, who was ninety three years old, ſhould thus expoſe himſelf to danger. But the ſolution of this is, that as the text ſays, "And it came to paſs when Joſhua was by
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:032376_0163_0FF202008BB2FAD8"/>Jericho,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. v. 13.</note> that is, he was conſidering, how and by what means he ſhould take Jericho, as it was ſo ſtrongly fortified; "he lift up his eyes, and looked, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold there ſtood a man over againſt him," by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>oppoſite him,</hi> we are to underſtand that the man was <hi>viſible</hi> to Joſhua only<note n="†" place="bottom">Thus Daniel ſays, "And I Daniel alone ſaw the viſion: for the men that were with me ſaw not the viſion." Dan. x. 7. See alſo viii. 15. &amp; x. 16.</note>; and, therefore, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately knew that it was an angel, and not a human perſon, for which reaſon, he went to him in perſon; and ſeeing him with a drawn ſword in his hand, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of deſtruction, he aſked him, "<hi>art</hi> thou for us, or for our adverſaries? Haſt thou thy ſword drawn to aſſiſt us, or to afflict us in favour of the enemy? To which he anſwered, "Nay, but as cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the hoſt of the Lord am I now come." Think not, Joſhua, that you are the captain of the Lord's hoſt (i. e. Iſrael) in this buſineſs, and therefore doſt challenge, me, whether I am for you or
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:032376_0164_0FF20207BB38A8E8"/>your enemies: No; it is not ſo: but I am (appointed) the captain of the hoſt of the Lord; and for that reaſon am I now come. When Joſhua heard this, he "fell on his face to the earth, and did obeiſance" to him as his ſuperior<note n="*" place="bottom">But not as an act of adoration, as you erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly aſſert; owing to your ignorance, of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Language: for the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> denotes <hi>to, how down and make obeiſance,</hi> &amp;c. as well as to worſhip; numerous examples of which occur in ſcripture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manners of the eaſtern nations.</note>, "and ſaid unto him, what ſaith my lord<note n="†" place="bottom">Another eaſtern term of honor, frequently met with in the Bible.</note> unto his ſervant?" For as you are the captain, it is my duty to pay obedience to your commands. The angel then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of the end and purpoſe for which he came; which was to inform him that Jericho was not to be taken by any human means; and therefore he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, "Looſe thy ſhoe from off thy foot, for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy." That is, do not buſy yourſelf in forming ſchemes for the taking of the city, becauſe it can only be taken in a ſupernatural manuer. And thus we find
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:032376_0165_0FF2020B30C54A60"/>it ſaid to Moſes, when he turned aſide to ſee why the buſh was not conſumed, "put off thy ſhoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt," &amp;c. Do not attempt to account for this, on the principles of nature; for it is not a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe, but a ſupernatural one;<note n="*" place="bottom">For the buſh was an emblem of the low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded ſtate of the nation in Egypt; as was its burning of their miſery; but its not being conſumed was to ſhew that their bondage, &amp;c was not a natural or accidental cauſe; but ſolely by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their anceſtor Abraham; and therefore, as they were under the immediate care of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; they could not be deſtroyed, although ſo ſorely oppreſſed. And which has been the caſe with the nation to this day: as ſhewn at large in vol. 1ſt of my Diſſertations on the Prophecies. page 77, &amp;c.</note> and which was denoted by God's calling the place<note n="†" place="bottom">The Hebrew noun <gap reason="foreign">

See Maim. in Morch Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vuchim. part 1ſt. chap. viii.</note> holy. When, therefore, Joſhua heard this of the angel, it ſays, "And Joſhua did ſo." Not that he pulled his ſhoe off, but that he immediately deſiſted from attempting to reduce it by any ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem of war; and, therefore, it ſays,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:032376_0166_0FF2020D0C79FC28"/>"Now Jericho was ſtraitly ſhut up, none went out, and none came in." It was not to be taken by any human power; and, therefore, the word of God came immediately unto Joſhua, to inform him, that though it could not be reduced by any human force, yet, "I have given into thy hand Jericho, and the kings thereof." &amp;c. Hence the cauſe of the appearance of the angel is manifeſt: for as Joſhua, who was juſt going to engage in a war with ſo many nations, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt city that he was going to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack ſo ſtrongly fortified, he was naturally much taken up in thought, to find out the means of reducing it; as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a miſcarriage in the firſt onſet, might lead to the moſt dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, even the entire deſtruction of the whole nation; as he himſelf patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally expreſſes it, on the failure of their attempt againſt Ai<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſhua vii. 7—10.</note>; the angel, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, came to inform him, that he had no occaſion to employ any human force or ſtratagems of war to reduce Jericho,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:032376_0167_0FF2020EEE046928"/>but only to obey the command of God in all things; and to aſcribe the glory of his conqueſts to the author of them, the Lord of hoſts. Thus encouraging him to truſt ſolely in God, in the arduous bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs he was then employed in; and which we find, was actually the caſe in the conqueſt of the land of Canaan. As to your low wit about pulling off the ſhoe it no doubt originated in your ignorance, as you ought to have known that this rite was an indication of reverence for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence, when all human and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts ought to be ſet aſide: for which reaſon, the prieſts always officiated barefooted in the temple.</p>
            <p>The two books of Ezra and Nehemiah you allow to be genuine books, as being written by the authors whoſe name they bear, giving an account of the return of the Jews from the Babyloniſh captivity, about four hundred and fifteen years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chriſtian aera; but then you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 35.</note> "Thoſe accounts are nothing to us, nor to any other perſon, unleſs it be
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:032376_0168_0FF202176418C0D0"/>to the Jews, as a part of the hiſtory of their nation: and there is juſt as much of the word of God in thoſe books, as there is in any of the hiſtories of France, or Rapin's hiſtory of England." Whatever theſe books may be to you, or any other deiſt or infidel, they are of the higheſt importance to us as Jews; and not only to us, but likewiſe to all who believe the Old Teſtament to be the word of God; as far as the full completion of prophecy is a proof of the truth of revelation. The prophet Jeremiah ſaid,<note n="†" place="bottom">Jerem. xxix. 10.</note> "For thus ſaith the Lord, ſurely when ſeventy years have been completed at Babylon, I will viſit you, and I will perform towards you my good promiſe, in bringing you again to to this place." Now, the very firſt verſe of the book of Ezra, which you allow to be a genuine book, proves the full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of this prophecy, ſo contrary to all human foreſight. "Now in the firſt year of Cyrus king of Perſia, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032376_0169_0FF2021921559D78"/>might be fulfilled; the Lord ſtirred up the ſpirit of Cyrus," &amp;c. Surely you cannot ſay this is nothing to us; I mean to <hi>you</hi> and <hi>me:</hi> I as a true believer, you as an unbeliever; becauſe it is perfectly deciſive in the cauſe at iſſue between us; for if the book of Ezra, which you allow to be a genuine book, proves that Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah was a true prophet, there is an end of all diſpute between us; becauſe here is a demonſtration of the truth of divine revelation, admitted by yourſelf, as you allow the genuineneſs of the book that records the completion of the prophecy Nay, theſe books not only confirm the truth of Jeremiah's prophecy, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prove the authenticity of the books of Moſes, Joſhua, Judges, Kings, and Chronicles; all which are referred to by Ezra and Nehemiah, as containing the religion, laws and hiſtory of the Jewiſh nation, from Abraham to that very time.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Ezra, chap. ix. and x. and Nehem, Chap. iii—ix. and x.</note> Of this, it appears to me, you was fully ſenſible; and therefore wiſhed to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the teſtimony of thoſe books, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:032376_0170_0FF2021DA86B1778"/>the authors a ſide blow: obſerving,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 35.</note> "But even in maſters of hiſtorical record, neither of thoſe writers are to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon." As a proof of which you tell us, that the total amount of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who returned from Babylon, does not agree with the ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.

            <p>You ſeem to ſpeak well of the book of Job<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 37—38.</note>, but at the ſame time attempt to prove it a gentile book, by ſaying, "I
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:032376_0171_0FF2022133C8A720"/>have ſeen the opinion of two Hebrew commentators, Aben Ezra and Spinoſa, upon this ſubject; they both ſay that the book carries no internal evidence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Hebrew book; that the genius of the compoſition, and the drama of the piece, are not Hebrew, that it has been tranſlated from another language into Hebrew, and that the author of the book was a gentile; that the character repreſented under the name of ſatan (which is the firſt and only time this is mentioned in the Bible) does not corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond to any Hebrew idea." But where, ſir, did you ſee all this? for in the firſt place, Spinoſa never was admitted an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew commentator; all we know of him is, that he wrote ſeveral tracts, and after different changes, at length became an atheiſt. As to Aben Ezra, he only ſays, on verſe 11 of chapter ſecond. "And our Rabbins of bleſſed memory ſay, that Moſes wrote the book of Job: but I am inclined (to think) that is a tranſlated book; and therefore it is difficult to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, as are all tranſlated books." But not a word does he ſay, of its being a a gentile book; nay, in his preface to
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:032376_0172_0FF202250F0EA510"/>this book, he ſeems to acknowledge that it was written by Moſes, or at leaſt ſome other prophet; for there he ſays, "And of the righteous Job, the prophet teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he was ſingularly righteous in his generation; and that his ſufferings were not for any evil he had committed," &amp;c. What you obſerve concerning ſatan, is borrowed from your maſter Voltaire; who ſays, it is a Chaldean word, and which proves you both to be ignorant of the Hebrew:<note n="*" place="bottom">The Chaldea word for an adverſary is not <gap reason="foreign">

But you ſay, "The aſtronomical names, Pleiades, Orion and Arcturus, are Greek, and not Hebrew names; and as it does not appear from any thing that is to be found in the Bible, that the Jews knew any thing of aſtronomy, or that they ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died it, they had no tranſlation for thoſe names in their own language, but adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the names as they found them in the Poem<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 38.</note>." Now it is manifeſt from the Bible, that the Jews were acquainted
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:032376_0174_0FF2022C48ADA248"/>with aſtronomy, and ſtudied it; See Exod. xii. 2. "This month <hi>ſhall be</hi> unto you the beginning of months: it <hi>ſhall be</hi> the firſt month of the year to you."

The preceding piece of falſe criticiſm, may be attributed to your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; but to what ſhall we attribute what follows: "We know nothing of what the ancient gentile world (as it is called) was before the time of the Jews, whoſe practice has been to calumniate and blacken the character of all other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;"
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:032376_0176_0FF20233A2BB0590"/>&amp;c.—It appears to have been their (the heathen) cuſtom to perſonify both virtue and vice, by ſtatues and images, as is done now-a-days, both by ſtatuary and by painting; but it does not follow from this, that they worſhipped them any more than we do." Is not this curious apology for the heathen's idolatry, made with a view to blacken and calumniate the character of the Jews, and their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred books, becauſe theſe books clearly ſhew that they did worſhip them?

            <p>Of the Pſalms, you ſay<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 40.</note>, "that ſome are moral, others are very revengeful.— It is, however; an error; or an impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to call them the pſalms of David; they are a collection, as ſong-books are now-a-days." But had you been in the leaſt acquainted with the writings of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, whoſe books you have attempted to criticiſe with ſuch aſperity, you would have known that they held that David did not compoſe the whole of Pſalms, as ſome are inſerted therein that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by <hi>Adam, Melchiſedeck, Abraham, Moſes, Heaman, Jeduthun, Aſaph,</hi> and the three ſons of <hi>Korab</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">This is the opinion of all the ancient Rabbins.</note>, but they are called the Pſalms of David, becauſe he compoſed the major part of them; and they are wonderfully inſtructive, as being every where full of the praiſes of God,

            <p>The Proverbs of Solomon, you eſteem a jeſt book, but this is nothing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; for if the Pſalms of David is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you a ſong book, why may not Proverbs be a jeſt book? However, if you had conſulted <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he would have taught you better. He would have taught you, that "this part<note n="*" place="bottom">For he divides the book into four parts; and is here ſpeaking of the firſt part.</note> is admonitory; and acquaints us with the exalted degree of the eternal wiſdom, for by it,<note n="†" place="bottom">As Solomon ſays, chap. iii. 19. "The Lord by wiſdom hath founded the earth:" &amp;c.</note> the world was called
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:032376_0180_0FF20241C5D2DC28"/>into exiſtence from nonentity: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore admoniſhes <hi>us</hi> to adhere to it, and to turn aſide from the abominable woman: he alſo inſtructs <hi>us,</hi> to deſtroy the fooliſh appetites incident to creatures formed of matter; and thus preſerve alive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul." This ſir, is what he would have taught you; and can you perceive any jeſt in all this? But ſtop, hear Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon himſelf, "The fear of Jehovah, is the beginning of knowledge, but fools deſpiſe wiſdom and inſtruction." This, ſir, is no jeſt; but if contrary to all the rules of right reaſon, you ſhould ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in aſſerting it to be a jeſt, I ſhould not ſcruple to pronounce you <hi>in earneſt</hi> to be one of thoſe fools that "deſpiſe wiſdom and inſtruction." Let us proceed, "My ſon, hear the inſtruction of thy father, and forſake not the law of thy mother." That is, next to God, let me adviſe thee, my ſon, to reverence thy parents: and not only to hearken unto thy father when he inſtructs thee in the fear of God, or tells thee thou haſt done amiſs; but alſo to let thy mother's commands be a law to

And happy would it have been for many, had they atended to this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; in which I am ſure you can ſee no jeſt. Again, "My ſon, it ſinners en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thee, conſent thou not." My ſon, walk not thou in the way with them: refrain thy foot from their path. For their feet run to evil and make haſte to ſhed blood," &amp;c. Theſe are a few of the proverbs of Solomon, contained in the firſt chapter of Solomon's "jeſt book." I imagine they are rather too grave to cauſe merriment; but they may be of great, ſervice in making a perſon wiſe and virtuous. Pity you did not read this jeſt book through with becoming attention: if you had, it would have taught you to "Be not wiſe in thine own eyes: <hi>but to</hi> fear the Lord and depart from evil."</p>

And indeed, the whole work is uniform, (though there are many detached ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proverbs interſperſed) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to one ſubject; viz. the vanity of the world, which is exemplified by the experience of Solomon, introduced in the character of a perſon inveſtigating a very difficult queſtion; examining the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on both ſides, and at length diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging himſelf from an anxious and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſputation, by obſerving, "Let us hear the concluſion of the whole matter, Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this <hi>is</hi> the whole <hi>duty</hi> of man."<note n="†" place="bottom">Eccle. xii. 13.</note>

As to Solomon's ſins and debaucheries, with which you wiſh to blacken his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, they are ſo far from derogating from the purity of his doctrine, <hi>that all is vanity, but the fear and love of God,</hi> that on the contrary, they ſtrongly enforce it; by teaching us the following important truths. Firſt, not to ſlight the command of God; for as we find it commanded, that the king "ſhall not multiply wives to himſelf, that his heart turn not away."<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xvii. 17.</note> Solomon, by ſlighting this commandment, actually fell into the crime foretold as the conſequence of the breach of it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that though he was ſo great and wiſe a king, yet was he immediately ſeverely puniſhed for his ſins, by having the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom rent from him, and given to Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am: and which is a manifeſt proof of the divine ſuperintendance of the actions of mankind, however high and exalted their ſtation: and which ought to make us all extremely cautious of offending the moſt high in any degree whatever.</p>
            <p>You ſay Solomon's Songs are amorous
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:032376_0184_0FF20251B1712A60"/>and fooliſh enough, but which wrinkled fanaticiſm has called divine.—I hope you do not account Aben Ezra <hi>a wrinkled fanatic.</hi> Now he is decidedly againſt you, for he ſays, "This poem is an entire ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred allegory. It commences at the time of Abraham, and extends to the time of the Meſſiah: and which deſcribes (if I may uſe the expreſſion) the conjugal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God with the Jewiſh Church: which, as a peculiar people, having been ſelected by him from among all nations; he had (as it were) ratified his choice by a ſolemn covenant. This is the ſolemn compact, ſo frequently celebrated by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the ſacred writers under the ſame image; and who have therefore compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nation's committing idolatry, to a woman being guilty of adultry towards her huſband. He alſo ſays, "<hi>Far be it, far be it</hi> from us, to imagine that the ſong of ſongs, contains any thing amorous, but is entirely figurative." Thus you ſtumble ſtep by ſtep, till at laſt, I fear you will fall, and riſe no more. Excuſe my freedom, but really my patience is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

How muſt the Hebraiſt ſmile, to hear you with an air of importance, violently declaiming againſt the compilers of the Bible, for the placing of Solomon's ſong after Eccleſiaſtes, &amp;c. as any little Jew ſchool-boy, could have told you, that they are not placed thus in the Hebrew Bible. There, the arrangement is as follows, Firſt, the Pentateuch: Second, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prophets, viz. Joſhua, Judges, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, and kings: Third, the latter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hoſea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malichi: Fourth, the Hagiography, which contains, Pſalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of ſongs, Ruth, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, Eccleſiaſtes, Eſther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles. Hence, you may alſo perceive the futility of your objection concerning the term <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>leſſer</hi> prophets<note n="*" place="bottom">Part. 1. p. 15</note>, as termed by Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:032376_0186_0FF20258DF87E258"/>in general, (though I ſuppoſe, they only mean the ſize of the books) but had you ever ſeen an Hebrew Bible, you would have known that there is no ſuch thing in it, as <hi>leſſer</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: as they are all included in the term latter prophets; and are enumerated thus, <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>the twelve:</hi> becauſe they are all included in one book, by the Jews. Are you not aſhamed now of your miſplaced wit? Alas! What a lamentable thing is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance!</p>
            <p>The book of Ruth, you call "an idle, bungling ſtory, fooliſhly told about a ſtrolling country girl creeping ſlily to bed to her couſin Boaz." Is this fair criticiſm? Is it truth? Does it appear ſo from hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? On the contrary, we find that ſhe was no ſtrolling girl; and it is very baſe in you thus to traduce her character. She had been married ten years, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left a widow without children, and fully bent on renouncing the idolatry of her native country, ſhe accompanied her mother in law, back to the land of Iſrael: there, her mother informed her of the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:032376_0187_0FF2025C5E1EDC78"/>right of redemption which ſhe had, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of Iſrael, among whom ſhe was now incorporated. She therefore inſtructed her how to act, in order to break the matter to Boaz, and to claim his protection; for which reaſon, ſhe laid herſelf down at the foot of her aged kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's bed, and roſe up as innocent as ſhe laid down, and with an high encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um on her virtuous<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 10.11.</note> behaviour. She was afterwards married to Boaz, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all her neighbours, nay, by all the city, to be a ſtrictly virtuous woman and it is to be preſumed, that they moſt certainly were better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her character, than you poſſibly can be. As to its being called the word of God, hear what <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> ſays, "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>David</hi> was the root of the kingdom of Iſrael, his genealogy was written in the ſacred books."</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I SHALL now proceed to take notice of what you obſerve concerning Iſaiah, and the other prophets. You ſay<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 43.</note>, "Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will take the trouble of reading the book aſcribed to Iſaiah, will find it one of the moſt wild and diſorderly compoſitions ever put together: it is one continued, incoherent, bombaſtical rant, full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant metaphor, without application, and deſtitute of meaning; a ſchool boy would ſcarcely have been excuſable for writing ſuch ſtuff." I really know not which moſt to admire, your <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>preſumption.</hi> "Whoever will take the trouble," &amp;c. I ſir, have taken that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nay, I have commented on a great part of it; (See my Diſſertations on the prophecies vol. 1ſt. &amp; IId.) and am allowed to have ſome little knowledge in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:032376_0190_0FF20263ACE27A80"/>in which it is written: but have not ſound it to be "ſuch ſtuff," as you aſſert it is. On the contrary, I have found the diction pure: the ſentiments grand and ſublime; and the imagery ſtrong and beautiful. You compare, "the burden of Babylon, the burden of Moab, &amp;c. to the ſtory of the knight of the burning mountain," &amp;c. But if you had read the burden of Babylon with attention, and compared it with its preſent ſtate, as I have done, I doubt not but it would have made as ſtrong an impreſſion on your mind, as it has on mine; eſpecially, if you conſider that this prophecy was delivered near two hundred years before its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion: and that the captivity of the Jews, for which the Babylonians were to be thus puniſhed, did not fully take place till about one hundred and thirty years after the delivery of this prophecy: that the Medes, who are expreſsly mentioned (chap. xiii. 17.) as the principal agents in the overthrow of the Babyloniſh monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, by which the Jews were releaſed from that captivity, were at the time of the delivery of this prophecy, an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:032376_0191_0FF2026B275774F8"/>people; having been in a ſtate of anarchy ever ſince the fall of the great Aſſyrian Empire, of which they formed a part, under Sardanapalus: and did not become a kingdom under Dejoces till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſeventeenth year of Hezekiah. The exact completion of prophecies like theſe, plainly ſhew from whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet received them; from him, to whom all things are known; he therefore, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges the falſe gods to come forth, and give evident demonſtration of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and power, by foretelling fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events. "Let them approach, and tell us the things that ſhall happen; the things that ſhall firſt happen, what they are, let them tell us; and we will conſider them; and we ſhall know the event; or declare to us things to come hereafter. Tell us the things that will come to paſs in latter times: then ſhall we know, that ye are gods."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah xli. 22.</note> In oppoſition to this, the true prophet of the true God, as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof of the truth of what he had predicted, ſays, "The former predictions,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:032376_0192_0FF2026F28EBA988"/>lo! they are come to paſs: and new events I now declare: before they ſpring forth, I make them known unto you." This, Sir, is the teſt of prophecy; it is this that diſtinguiſhes the burden of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, the burden of Moab, &amp;c. from thoſe fooliſh tales that you ridiculouſly wiſh to compare them with. And, in truth, there cannot be a ſtronger or more convincing proof of the truth of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the accompliſhment of future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents ſo foretold, than this poſition: for if the former prophecies were exactly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, it is an earneſt of the completion of the ſuture events ſo predicted. And yet, in defiance of ſuch clear evidence, you aſſert, that the laſt verſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fourth, and the beginning of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fifth chapters of Iſaiah were written at leaſt an hundred and fifty years after Iſaiah was dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 44.</note> a compliment to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who permitted the Jews to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Jeruſalem from the Babylonian captivity, to rebuild Jeruſalem and the temple, as ſtated in Ezra." And as a proof
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:032376_0193_0FF20270E3614BF8"/>of this, you quote theſe two verſes; but herein you have acted very unfairly; for you ought to have began at verſe 24th. of chapter xlivth, as it is there that the prophecy commences, "Thus ſaith the Lord, thy redeemer; even he that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee from the womb: I <hi>am</hi> the Lord who maketh all things; who ſtretched out the heavens alone; who ſpread the <hi>firm</hi> earth by myſelf, <hi>I am He,</hi> who fruſtrateth the prognoſtics of the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and maketh the diviners mad; who reverſeth the devices of the ſages, and infatuateth their knowledge: who eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth the word of his ſervant: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſheth the counſel of his meſſengers: who ſayeth to Jeruſalem, Thou ſhalt be inhabited, and to the cities of Judah, ye ſhall be built; and her deſolate places I will reſtore." Thus he ſhews the return of the nation from the Babylonian capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, according to his prediction; in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to that of the prognoſticaters and diviners; whoſe wiſdom and counſel God fruſtrateth, but eſtabliſheth the word of his ſervant. In the next three verſes, he ſhews the deſtruction of Babylon; the
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:032376_0194_0FF20272A03B4050"/>manner it is to be taken, and by whom. "Who ſayeth to the deep, Be thou waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I will make dry thy rivers:" By this figurative language, the prophet ſhews the taking of Babylon by Cyrus, who drained off the waters of the Euphrates, which ran through the city of Babylon, by means of which, he marched his troops by night along the bed of the river into the heart of the city,<note n="*" place="bottom">Heredot. Lib. 1. Cap. 178. 185. &amp; Seq. &amp; Cyropedia. Lib. 7.</note> and ſurpriſed it. The prophet then ſhews by whom it ſhould be thus conquered; and for what purpoſe: even for the ſake of Iſrael, God's choſen ſervants; that all might know that Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah alone was God, and none elſe.—"Who ſayeth to Cyrus, <hi>who</hi> is my ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd? and he ſhall fulfil all my pleaſure: by ſaying to b<hi rend="sup">J</hi>eruſalem, Thou ſhalt be built; and to the temple, Thy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be laid. Thus ſaith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whom I hold faſt by the right hand: that I may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due nations before him; and ungird the loins of kings: that I may open before
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:032376_0195_0FF2027D5D7C9968"/>him the valves; and the gates ſhall not<note n="*" place="bottom">The gates of Babylon within the city, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſtreets to the river, were providential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left open, when Cyrus's forces entered the city in the night through the channel of the river, in the general diſorder occaſioned by the great feaſt which was then celebrated: otherwiſe, ſays Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus (Lib. 1.191.), the Perſians would have been ſhut up in the river, and taken as in a net, and all deſtroyed. And the gates of the palace were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently opened by the king's orders, to enquire what was the cauſe of the tumult without, when the two parties under Gobryas and Gadatas ruſhed in, got poſſeſſion of the place, and ſlew the king.

And I will give unto thee the treaſures<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sardis and Babylon when taken by Cyrus, were the wealthieſt cities in the world. Croeſus, celebrated beyond all the kings of that age for his riches, gave up his treaſures to Cyrus, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act account in writing of the whole, containing the particulars with which each waggon was loaded, when they were carried away, and which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Cyrus at the palace of Babylon. Xenoph. Cyrop lib. 7. p. 503.515. According to Pliny's account (Nat. Hiſt. 33.15.) of the wealth taken by Cyrus in Aſia, the gold and ſilver, converted into pounds ſterling, would amount to one hundred and twenty ſix millions, two hundred and twenty four thouſand pounds. Brerewood, De Ponderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, cap. 10.</note> of

By this, God ſhewed that it was not by his own power that Cyrus atchieved all his conqueſts, but by the divine aſſiſtance: and which Cyrus himſelf acknowledged; Ezra i. 2. "Thus ſaith Cyrus, king of Perſia, the Lord God of heaven hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me all the kingdoms of the earth;" &amp;c. Not as Sennacherib, who ſaid, "By the ſtrength of my hand have I done it; and by my wiſdom, for I am pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah x. 13.</note>;" &amp;c. For which the prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:032376_0197_0FF2028307CB6838"/>his deſtruction; and which was fully accompliſhed. Nor yet like Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar, who ſaid, "I will aſcend aboye the heights of the clouds; I will be like the moſt high."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah xiv. 14.</note> For which blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous expreſſion, that dreadful ſentence contained in the following verſes was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him and his poſterity: and which was likewiſe accompliſhed in every particular. But Cyrus was fully convinced, that he owed his victories to God, to whom alone he aſcribed all his ſucceſſes; more eſpecially, as he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, that the God of Iſrael, had called him by name, near two hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his birth, that he might know that he was Jehovah, the God of Iſrael; and that he did not make him thus ſucceſsful and victorious for his ſake; but for the ſake of his choſen Iſrael, as in ver. 4. &amp;c. "For the ſake of my ſervant Jacob, and of Iſrael, my choſen; I have even called thee by thy name; I have ſirnamed thee, though thou haſt not known me. I <hi>am</hi> the Lord, and none elſe; beſide me <hi>there
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:032376_0198_0FF20284C0EA4C78"/>is</hi> no God: I have girded thee, though thou haſt not know me. That they may know from the riſing of the ſun, and from the weſt, that <hi>there is</hi> none beſide me: I <hi>am</hi> the Lord, and none elſe; <hi>Who</hi> form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the light, and createth darkneſs; <hi>who</hi> maketh peace, and createth evil: I, Jehovah, am the author of all theſe things." We now have a full view of the prophecy, the truth of which is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its full completion in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; ſo contrary to the pretended ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and predictions delivered by the prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticators, diviners, &amp;c.—The prophet, in figurative language, alſo ſhews the manner in which Babylon was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and that, though God had called Cyrus, and led him on to victory, &amp;c. in ſuch an extraordinary manner, yet it was not for his merit, for he knew not the Lord: but the ſole end and purpoſe for which he was called, and thus exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was for the ſake of the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael's choſen people; and that he might know that the Lord alone formed all things; contrary to the great principle of the Magian religion, which prevailed in
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:032376_0199_0FF202D1EF22D948"/>Perſia in the time of Cyrus, and in which he probably was educated, that there are two ſupreme, co-eternal, and independent cauſes, always acting in oppoſition to each other; one they called Light, who was the author of all good; the other they called Darkneſs, the author of all evil; that when the good being Light had the aſcendancy, then good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs prevailed among men; and when Darkneſs had the ſuperiority, then evil and miſery abounded. In reference, therefore, to this abſurd opinion, held by the perſon (Cyrus) to whom this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is addreſſed, God by his prophet, in the moſt ſignificant terms, aſſerts his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence and ſupremacy: "I am the Lord, and none elſe; <hi>Who</hi> formeth the light and createth darkneſs; <hi>who</hi> maketh peace and createth evil: I Jehovah am the author of all theſe things." Declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thoſe powers, whom the Perſians held to be the original authors of good and evil to mankind, repreſenting them by light and darkneſs, as their proper em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, were no other than creatures of God, the inſtruments which he employs
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:032376_0200_0FF1D5D0C0E2AF40"/>in his government of the world, ordained, or permitted by him, in order to execute his wiſe and juſt decrees; and that there is no power, either good or evil, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the one ſupreme God, infinite in power and in goodneſs. Now, is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive, that a captive Jew, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to compliment Cyrus, the greateſt prince in the world, ſhould be ſo ſtupid, ſo devoid of all reaſon and common ſenſe, as to tell him, that the victories he had atchieved, and the conqueſts he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, were not the effect of his wiſdom, prudence and valor; but were beſtowed on him by the God of Iſrael: a God whom he did not know: and that they were not beſtowed on him for his merit; becauſe he did not worſhip God, as he did not know him; but for the ſake of God's choſen people, that they, through his means, might be releaſed from the captivity they were held in by the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians; ſo that he was nothing more than a more inſtrument in the hands of that God which he knew not; and who alſo told him, that the Gods he worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped were no other than his creatures;
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:032376_0201_0FF202885FB5A530"/>and that his religion was all a lie. This, I muſt confeſs, was a pretty way indeed to compliment a great prince, ſuch as Cyrus; but that it ſhould procure from him the deliverance of the captives, as a thankful acknowledgement that he owed all his power and greatneſs to God's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs and power, is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible: and whoever maintains ſuch an abſurdity, ſhews either a weak head or a bad heart.</p>
            <p>As to what you ſay (p. 45.) of "the ſtudied craft of ſcripture-makers, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every part of this romantic book of ſchool boy's eloquence, bend to the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous idea of a ſon of God begotten by a ghoſt on the body of a virgin," &amp;c. I have nothing to ſay, as it does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me in the defence of Iſaiah: becauſe, I am fully convinced, that the prophet never intended any ſuch thing; as I have ſhewn at large, in my Letters to Dr. Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in anſwer to his, One great argument for the truth of Chriſtianity from a ſingle Prophecy.<note n="*" place="bottom">See my letters to Dr. Pileſtly, Dr. Cooper, &amp;c.</note> But, as you to attempt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>It muſt be obſerved, that before this confederacy of the two kings againſt the houſe of David, they each had warred ſeparately againſt Judah; when Rezin firſt carried away a great multitude of them captive to Damaſcus; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the king of Iſrael alſo ſmote an hundred twenty thouſand of them in one day: and carried away two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them captive; but although they were made captives, yet were they not retained in captivity; for the men of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael being admoniſhed by the Lord's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the principal men, "roſe up; and look the captives, and with the ſpoil cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that were naked, among them, and arrayed them, and ſhod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon aſſes, and brought them to Jericho
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:032376_0203_0FF2028F86AF2A98"/>the city of the palm-trees,<note n="*" place="bottom">By this ſir, you may perceive that there was ſome humanity amongſt thoſe Iſraelites, whom you, and your maſter, Voltaire, every where repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as a horde of barbarous brutes.</note> to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, 2 Chron. xxviii. 15. But now that they formed a league together, not for the purpoſe of making captives, or taking of ſome cities; but with an intent of making an entire conqueſt of the kingdom of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, deſtroy the houſe of David, and place another family on the throne; it ſays, they "went up towards Jeruſalem, to war againſt it." For though when they came up ſeparately againſt Judah, God ſuffered them as the inſtruments of his vengeance, for their manifold ſins, to prevail againſt them: yet, when that un-natural confederacy of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with the <hi>uncircumciſed</hi> was formed; and they plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the total deſtruction of the royal houſe of David, God would by no means ſuffer it: they conſequently could not prevail againſt it. And, becauſe the houſe of David was ſo greatly moved at this formidable confederacy; (but which was not the caſe, when they came up ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:032376_0204_0FF202952568A900"/>and therefore is not mentioned in Chronicles) God commanded Iſaiah to go forth, and encourage Ahaz, by telling him that this ſcheme, "ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſs." And as a proof of this, the prophet gave him the following ſign. "Behold the young woman hath conceived,<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>At his knowing, &amp;c.</hi> The circumſtance of the child's eating butter and honey, was to denote a ſtate of plenty; and which was to ariſe from their deliverance, that was to take place before the child ſhould know to refuſe the evil, and chooſe the good, at which time he was to eat it; and which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the caſe, as I have plainly ſhewn above.</note> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the evil and chuſe the good. For before the child ſhall know to refuſe the evil and chooſe the good, the land ſhall be forſaken, which thou abhorreſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of both its kings." This was fully accompliſhed, when the king of Aſſyria ſlew Rezin<note n="‡" place="bottom">2 King. xvi. 9.</note> and Hoſea the ſon of Elah ſlew Pekah<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. xv. 30.</note> Thus was this prophecy
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:032376_0205_0FF2029900F54CE0"/>fully verified in every particular: for the prophet declared by the command of God that the above mentioned purpoſe of the two kings, "ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſs." I now aſk you, Did it ſtand? Did it come to paſs? Did they dethrone and deſtroy the royal-houſe of David? Was the ſon of Tabeal ever made king of Judah? No. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the two confederate kings were both cut off, before the child that was to be born, knew to refuſe the evil, and chooſe the good, exactly as the prophet had predicted. Hence it is manifeſt, that the kings not only failed in their attempt, but were themſelves cut off; while Ahas continued to reign over Judah, and was peaceably ſucceeded by his ſon Hezekiah. Pray, Sir, who is now the lying prophet and impoſtor? I will not ſay you have told a lie, but you have ſaid the thing that is not true: and, therefore, think the following words of the prophet pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly applicable to you: Wo unto them who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs; who put bitter for ſweet, and
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:032376_0206_0FF2029CD05FFC70"/>ſweet for bitter. Wo unto them who are wiſe in their own eyes, and prudent in their own conceit<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. v. 20—21.</note>."</p>
            <p>You charge Jeremiah with "guarding his<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 47.</note> prognoſtications in ſuch a crafty man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to leave himſelf a door to eſcape by," becauſe he had ſaid, that though God ſhould denounce the deſtruction of a nation for its wickedneſs; yet, if that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould repent, and return from its evil, the Lord would repent of the evil that he thought to do unto them; and vice verſa. This you call "an abſurd ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge,<note n="‡" place="bottom">p. 48.</note>—conſiſtent with nothing but the ſtupidity of the Bible." But in my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, it is highly inſtructive; for under the type of the potter's faſhioning the veſſel as he pleaſes, is ſhewn, God's abſolute authority over all nations and kingdoms, to regulate and alter their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at his own diſcretion; and that he rewards and puniſhes them according to their deſert. It muſt therefore be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a warning to all nations, to be careful not to commit evil in the ſight of
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:032376_0207_0FF202A055DFDA80"/>the Almighty; and likewiſe as an encon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to thoſe who have ſinned, to avail themſelves of God's mercy, to repent and turn from their evil way; as was actually the caſe of the Ninevites: and as is plain from the whole tenor of the hiſtory of the Hebrews.</p>
            <p>You next bring forward an objection, which you have borrowed from Spinoza and others, concerning the diſordered ſtate of the book: but this does not affect the authenticity, nor the genuineneſs of the book of Jeremiah: for although the order of time may not be every where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; yet may it be accounted for, in ſuppoſing that Ezza, or the men of the great ſynagogue, having found all the prophecies of Jeremiah ſeparately, they collected them together into one book, without attending ſtrictly to the order of their proper places: and yet this may not have been the effect of chance, but of ſome cauſe known to the prophet and them, though unknown to us; as the learned Abarbanal has obſerved on the xxxvth chapter, which contains a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy expreſsly ſaid to be delivered in the
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:032376_0208_0FF202A214E2CD40"/>days of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> and yet is placed after ſeveral that were delivered in the days of <hi>Zedekiah:</hi> but the reaſon of this, appears to be as follows. When Jeremiah had written the preceding prophecy, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their not ſuffering the bond-men and bond-women to go free according to the law of Moſes,<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xxi. 2. Levit. xxv. 39. &amp;c.</note> and for which he denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a ſevere ſentence againſt them; he thought proper to place immediately after it, the prophecy concerning the Recha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, who ſtrictly obeyed their father's injunction: and when he made trial of their obedience, and offered them wine to drink, they refuſed it; alledging the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs prohibition of their father. By which, the prophet had an opportunity of placing the diſobedience of the Jews to the divine command, in a much ſtronger point of view; by contraſting it with the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that the Rechabites paid to their father's command; and as is plain from the words of the prophet, ver. 13, 14, 15. "Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, the God of Iſrael; go and ſay unto the men of
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:032376_0209_0FF202A767D18EC8"/>Judah, and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, Will ye not receive inſtruction to hearken to my words? ſaith the Lord. The words of Jonadab the ſon of Rechab, which he gave in charge to his ſons, not to drink wine, have been punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, &amp;c. But ye have not hearkened unto me," &amp;c. Then follows the ſevere ſentence which God had pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for their diſobedience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted with the reward he promiſed to beſtow on the Rechabites for their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In this manner, all the ſeeming diſorder in the arrangement of the book, might probably be accounted for.</p>
            <p>You alſo charge (p. 52.) the prophet, or the book, it is all the ſame, with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, becauſe two different accounts are given of his impriſonment: but if you had attended to the different accounts with a candid eye, in order to come at truth, you would have found, that they recorded two different impriſonments; as nothing can be more obvious than that he was twice impriſoned:<note n="*" place="bottom">The learned Abarbanal is of the opinion that he was impriſoned ſeveral times; the firſt of which was in the days of Jehoiakim; this he has clearly and ſatisfactorily proved from the different texts: and which the learned reader may ſee in his comment on the xxxviith chapter.</note> firſt, in the houſe of
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:032376_0210_0FF202AD1905D688"/>
               <hi>Jonathan</hi> the ſcribe, as mentioned chap. xxxvii. 15. and-from which he was libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> to the court of the priſon, and had by his order a ſtated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of bread, until all the bread in the city was ſpent: and for having pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly predicted the deſtruction of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, he was a ſecond time impriſoned in the dungeon of Malchijah the king's ſon; whence he was freed by the interceſſion of Ebed-melech, as mentioned chap. 38.</p>
            <p>The different names in the twenty-firſt and thirty-eighth chapters, plainly ſhew that they were different events; the one, giving an account of thoſe that were ſent with the meſſage from <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of thoſe that heard him declare to the people the deſtruction of Jeruſalem: and ſo far from the conference breaking off abruptly, at the tenth verſe of the twenty-firſt chapter, that it is continued to the end of the chapter: for from verſe the third to verſe ſeventh, he anſwers the
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:032376_0211_0FF202AEDF2F1BC8"/>king; from verſe the eighth to the tenth, he ſpeaks to the people; and from verſe the eleventh to the end, to the houſe of the king of Judah.</p>
            <p>You obſerve (p. 51) "But the inſtance in the laſt chapter (the lii.) is ſtill more glaring;" becauſe it contains an account of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, which had been already mentioned; but this objection is ſo futile, that I ſhould not have taken notice of it, were it not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe its abſurdity; and to let your admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſee what a profound critic you are in ſacred literature; for it is univerſally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed<note n="*" place="bottom">Sec Abarbanal, &amp;c.</note> to have been added by ſome one after Jeremiah's time, probably by Ezra and the men of the great ſynagogue, who reviſed the ſacred writings, and collected them into one body; as is plain from the text. <hi>Thus far</hi> (are) <hi>the words of Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi> And which was, to diſtinguiſh the preceding prophecies from what follows: which is nearly the ſame word for word, as it is recorded in the ſecond book of Kings, chap. xxiv. 18—20, and ch. xxv.
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032376_0212_0FF202B25D0E6E48"/>together with ſome few additions. And the reaſon of its being placed here, was to ſhew, the complete and exact accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the predictions of Jeremiah concerning the Jewiſh nation: and the truth of the divine word of prophecy.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to take notice of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greater importance; namely, your charge againſt Jeremiah for his duplicity. That we may have a clear view of the force of your objection, it is neceſſary to obſerve that Jeremiah, on account of his having publicly predicted the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, had been caſt by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Judah, who ſought his life, into a miry dungeon, as above ſhewn; and where he certainly would have periſhed, had not Ebed-melech taken compaſſion on him, and ſpoken to the king in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſaying, "My lord, the king, theſe men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cauſed to be thrown into the dungeon: and he is like to die for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the place where he is." On this repreſentation, the king ordered Jeremiah to be taken out of the dungeon; and,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:032376_0213_0FF202B5DEB217E0"/>ſhortly after, ſent for him privately (See verſe 14.), and deſired him to conceal nothing from him; at the ſame time binding himſelf by an oath, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the nature of his prophecy might be, he would not put him to death, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him into the hands of thoſe men (the princes) that ſought his life. Jeremiah then ſhewed him God's purpoſe reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fate of Jeruſalem. When the conference was ended, the king, mindful of his oath to preſerve the life of the prophet, diſmiſſed him, ſaying, "Let no man know of theſe words, and thou ſhalt not die. But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and ſay unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou haſt ſaid unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; alſo what the king ſaid unto thee: then ſhalt thou ſay unto them, I preſented my ſupplication before the king, that he would not cauſe me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Jonathan's houſe to die there. Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and aſked him, and he told them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all theſe words that the king had
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:032376_0214_0FF202B9628163A8"/>commanded." On this, you obſerve (p. 52) "Thus, this man of God, as he is called, could tell a lie, or very ſtrongly prevaricate,—for certainly he did not go to Zedekiah to make his ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither did he make it." But you certainly miſtake, ſir; it is not ſaid that he went to make his ſupplication, but that he preſented it. And as it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the preceding chapter, that, in the conference with the king, he did make ſupplication to him, it is very probable that in this conference he renewed it: eſpecially as we find that he continued in the court of the priſon: but be this as it may, I contend that Jeremiah did not <hi>prevaricate</hi> nor tell a <hi>lie</hi> on this occaſion: he acted as every honeſt, prudent man would have done in his ſituation. He knew theſe men were his enemies, and ſought his life; he, therefore, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no obligation to tell the whole matter to ſuch men; he told them the truth in part, to ſave his life; and that was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Moreover the king had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him what he ſhould ſay, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly charged him to let no man know
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:032376_0215_0FF202BB27BBE3E8"/>what had paſſed between them: he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as an obedient and dutiful ſubject, thought it his bounden duty to do as the king had commanded him: if he had not you would have accuſed him of betraying the king's confidence; eſpecially as you have already affixed a ſuſpicion on him of his being a traitor.</p>
            <p>But your next charge is of a ſtill more ſerious nature, for you accuſe Jeremiah of delivering falſe predictions. "In the xxxivth chapter" you ſay, (p. 53) "is a prophecy of Jeremiah to Zedekiah in theſe words," ver. 2.—'Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, I will give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and will burn it with fire: and thou ſhalt not eſcape out of his hand, but thou ſhalt ſurely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes ſhall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he ſhall ſpeak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou ſhalt go to Babylon. <hi>Yet hear the word of the</hi> Lord, <hi>O Zedekiah, king of Judah, thus ſaith the</hi> Lord, <hi>thou ſhalt not die by the ſword, but thou ſhalt die in peace; and with the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thy fathers, the former kings that
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:032376_0216_0FF202C0A7AE14C0"/>were before thee, ſo ſhall they burn odours for thee, and will lament thee, ſaying, Ah, lord! for I have pronounced the word, ſaith the</hi> Lord.'</p>
            <p>"Now, inſtead of Zedekiah behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes of the king of Babylon, and ſpeaking with him mouth to mouth, and dying in peace, and with the burning of odours, as at the funeral of his fathers (as Jeremiah hath declared the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had pronounced), the reverſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lii. chapter, was the caſe: it is there ſaid, ver. 10. 'That the king of Babylon flew the ſons of Zedekiah before his eyes; then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in priſon till the day of his death."— "What then can we ſay of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but that they are impoſtors and liars?" I can ſay, that there is not a word of truth in all that you have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; for the prophecy was ſulfilled in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular, as will be ſeen, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the words of the prophecy with the hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="unknown:032376_0217_0FF202C461470B00"/>
THE PROPHECY.</p>
            <p>"I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he ſhall burn it with fire. And thou ſhalt not eſcape out of their hands, but ſhalt ſurely be taken and delivered into his hand. And thine eyes ſhall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he ſhall ſpeak with thee mouth to mouth.— And thou ſhalt go to Babylon. Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah, king of Judah: Thus ſaith the Lord of thee, Thou ſhalt not die by the ſword, <hi>but</hi> thou ſhalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo ſhall they burn odours for thee.</p>
            <p>THE HISTORY.</p>
            <p>"Came Nebuza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radan, captain of the guard, into Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and he burnt the houſe of the Lord, and the king's houſe, and all the houſes of Jeruſalem, and all the houſes of the great <hi>men</hi> burnt he with fire. But the army of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans purſued after the king, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and all his army was ſcattered from him. Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah; where he gave judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him. And the king of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon ſlew the ſons of
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:032376_0218_0FF202C8E7A8A620"/>Zedekiah before his eyes: Then he put out: the eyes of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and put him in priſon, ſtill the day of his death." Ch. lii. 8—13.2 King. xxv. 5—9. See alſo 2 Chron. xxxvi. 19.</p>
            <p>Hence it is manifeſt, that Zedekiah did ſee the eyes of the king of Babylon, when he ſlew the ſons of Zedekiah before his eyes; and ſpake judgments<note n="*" place="bottom">This is the literal ſeaſe of the Hebrew.</note> with him: that is, he upbraided him with the perfidy of his revolt againſt him; as he had ſworn by God to him (See 2 Chron. xxxvi. 13.): for which he put out his eyes<note n="†" place="bottom">The prophecy of Ezekiel concerning Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, is very remarkable: (Chap. xii. 13.) "And I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet ſhall he not ſee it, though he ſhall die there." How exactly was this accompliſhed, when the king of Babylon put out his eyes, and then brought him to Babylon! So that though he died there, yet he did not ſee it.</note> and carried him to Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:032376_0219_0FF202CAC8039320"/>where he died in peace, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had predicted. He did not die in battle: neither was he put to a violent or ſhameful death: he died a natural death on his bed, though in a priſon. Thus we ſee how the prophecy and hiſtory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and ſhew the full completion of the prophecy. And now, ſir, what can we ſay of thoſe who call Jeremiah a liar and impoſtor, but that they are baſe calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niators?</p>
            <p>You alſo aſſert<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 53.</note>, that Jeremiah joined himſelf afterwards to Nebuchadnezzar, and went about propheſying for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Egyptians; Thus much for another of theſe lying prophets. But where did you find this? Surely not in the narrative that we have of theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions: for there it is ſaid, "And the captain of the guards took Jeremiah, and ſaid unto him, the Lord thy God hath
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:032376_0220_0FF1D5CACB540640"/>denounced this calamity againſt this place (no ſmall compliment to the truth of the prophet's predictions). If it ſeem good unto thee to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will ſet mine eyes upon thee." But he declined accepting this kind and friendly offer of Nebuzaradan; and with a diſintereſtedneſs, and true patriotiſm, (which perhaps you would have admired in any other man but a prophet) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his diſtreſſed brethren, and when they were determined to go down to Egypt, he endeavoured to prevent them: telling them, according to the word of the Lord, that if they went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſword of which they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid ſhould overtake, them there in the land of Egypt, and they ſhould die there: becauſe they diſſembled when they ſent him to enquire for them of God, "ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Pray for us unto the Lord our God; and according to all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, ſo declare unto us, and we will do. But ye have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord your God,—Now, therefore, ye ſhall know aſſuredly
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:032376_0221_0FF202D3E7E370E8"/>that by the ſword, and by famine, and by peſtilence ſhall ye die in the place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye deſire to go to ſojourn (Jerem. xlii. 20.22.)." But they ſtill perſiſting in going to Egypt, forced Jeremiah along with them. There indeed he propheſied againſt the Egyptians, (as in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the Jews that were in Egypt were included;) and alſo againſt ſeveral other nations, particularly againſt the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, without the leaſt regard or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to or from Nebuchadnezzar; and which is a plain proof of the falſity of your change againſt the prophet; whilſt the exact accompliſhment of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies are an evident demonſtration of the truth of Jeremiah's prophetic ſpirit.</p>
            <p>You ſay (p. 54.) "In the former part of the Age of Reaſon, I have ſaid that the word prophet was the Bible word for poet. I am ſufficiently juſtified in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, not only becauſe the books called the prophecies are written in poetical lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but becauſe there is no word in the Bible except it be the word prophet, that deſcribes what we mean by a poet."—I ſuppoſe then, ſir, that you are perfectly

Alas! how are the mighty fallen!</p>
            <p>Your illiberal abuſe of the prophets and prophecies, (P. 54. 55.) the former of whom you call "poetical-muſical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring-dreaming-ſtrowling-gentry;"
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:032376_0224_0FF202E2464043F8"/>and the latter you compare to "fortune-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, caſting nativities, predicting riches, fortunate or unfortuate marriages, conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for loſt goods," &amp;c. plainly ſhews, that you either have miſtaken their office and character, or what is worſe, wilfully miſrepreſent them: for their office was, to deliver to the nation, the commands of (God, his promiſes and threatenings; and to admoniſh them to return to their duty, as the prophet ſays, "And I have ſent unto you all my ſervants, the prophets, riſing up early and ſending, ſaying, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn I pray you, every one from his evil way, and amend your doings," &amp;c.

In the execution of this duty, they were frequently perſecuted; and which, theſe holy men had foreſeen and expected as the reward of their labours; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we generally ſee them take this pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and weighty office on them very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly, and at laſt accept it merely in obedience to the repeated orders of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But, as ſoon as they had accepted
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:032376_0225_0FF202E655AAD830"/>it, and the burden of the word was laid on them, they boldly iſſued forth before kings and people; upbraiding them for their idolatry and their crimes; and then, neither exile, nor chains, nor dungeons, could ſilence their noble indignation: but they ſuſtained all with the utmoſt forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>You next charge the prophets with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling party men; and obſerve (p. 55.) "This party propheſying ſhewed itſelf immediately on the ſeparation of the firſt two rival kings, Rehoboam and Jeroboam. The prophet that curſed, or propheſied againſt the altar that Jeroboam had built in Bethel, was of the party of Judah, where Rehoboam was king; and he was way laid on his return home by a prophet of the party of Iſrael, who ſaid unto him, (2 King chap. xiii.) <hi>'Art thou the man of God that came from Judah?</hi> and <hi>be ſaid I am."</hi> Then the prophet of the party of Iſrael ſaid to him, <hi>'I am a prophet alſo as thou art,</hi> (ſignifying of Judah) <hi>and an angel ſpake unto me by the word of the</hi> Lord, <hi>ſaying, Bring him back with thee unto thine houſe, that he may eat bread and
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:032376_0226_0FF202E9DC58BE90"/>drink water: but,</hi> ſays the 18th verſe, <hi>he lied unto him.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"The event, however, according to the ſtory, is, that the prophet of Judah ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver got back to Judah; for he was found dead on the road, by the contrivance of the prophet of Iſrael, who no doubt was called a true prophet by his own party; and the prophet of Judah a lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet." This charge is a moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble falſehood, and plainly ſhews your depravity of heart. Was <hi>Shemaiah</hi> who admoniſhed Rehoboam to deſiſt from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to war with Jeroboam, becauſe the thing was from God, a party prophet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if the prophet that came from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah was a party prophet, and not a true prophet of God, how could he ſo exactly foretel what Joſiah was to do on the altar upwards of three hundred and fifty years after? And how came king Jeroboam's had, which he ſtretched out to lay hold of the man of God, to be inſtantly dried up, and the altar rent, according to what he had predicted? Theſe things you have thought proper not to mention, (an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof of your candor.) But you ſay,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:032376_0227_0FF202EB95642A70"/>"the prophet of Judah was killed by the contrivance of the prophet of Iſrael." Do you think then, that the prophet of the party of Iſrael, was a maſter of wild beaſts, and kept lions to deſtroy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the party of Judah? Indeed, he muſt have been an admirable fellow, that could train his lions in ſuch a manner, as that they ſhould <hi>ſlay the man</hi> and not <hi>kill the beaſt,</hi> nor <hi>devour the carcaſs</hi> of the prophet (ver. 28.) To be ſerious, does not the death of the prophet, and the ſubſequent behaviour of the lion, teach us, that the prophet was ſlain by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command of God, as it was foretold? But that which flatly contradicts your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is, the prophet of Iſrael's fair, open, and candid acknowledgment, that the prophet of Judah (as you call him, though without the leaſt ſhadow of truth, as I ſhall ſhew in my comment on ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) was a true prophet of God, not a lying prophet, as you baſely and falſely aſſert. Hear his charge to his ſons, and take ſhame to yourſelf, for having thus vilified the true ſervants of God. "When I am dead, then bury me in the ſepulchre
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:032376_0228_0FF202ED5213CAD8"/>wherein the man of God <hi>is</hi> buried; lay my bones beſide his bones. For the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he cried by the word of the Lord againſt the altar in Bethel, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the houſes of the high places, which <hi>are</hi> in the cities of Samaria, ſhall ſurely come to paſs." Compare this with 2 King. chap. xxiii. 16—19. and you will be convinced, how exactly this prophecy was fulfilled in every particular.</p>
            <p>Jehoſhaphat king of Judah, Jehoram king of Iſrael, and the king of Edom, being engaged in a war againſt the king of Moab, you obſerve (p. 56.), "the ſtory ſays, they were in great diſtreſs for water, upon which Jehoſhaphat ſaid, '<hi>Is there not a prophet of the</hi> Lord, <hi>that we may enquire of the</hi> Lord <hi>by him?</hi>' The ſtory then ſays, that theſe three kings went down to Eliſha (an high honour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for one of your conjurors), and when Eliſha (who as I ſaid, was a Judah-mite prophet) ſaw the king of Iſrael, he ſaid unto him, '<hi>What have I to do with thee, get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. As the</hi> Lord <hi>of hoſts liveth, before whom I ſtand, ſurely, were it not that I regard the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Jehoſhaphat, king of Judah, I would

And here ſir, is all the venom and vulgarity of an ignorant, impertinent, profane ſcoffer. What! Eliſha a Judah-mite prophet! Ha! ha! My good friend, you muſt go to ſchool: Eliſha a Judah-mite!

Was Samaria, where the prophet generally reſided, (2 King. v. iii. xi. 32. &amp;c.) in the kingdom of Judah? Was Eliſha a Judah-mite party prophet, when he diſcovered to the king of Iſrael the ſecret counſels of the king of Syria againſt him? Did he ever prophecy in, or concerning the kingdom of Judah? On the contrary, was he not always looked upon as the prophet of Iſrael? Did he not order one of the ſons of the prophet to anoint Jehu king of Iſrael? And when E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha lay on his death bed, it was not the king of Judah that came to him, but the king of Iſrael that came to ſee him; "And wept over his face, and ſaid, O my father, my father! the chariot of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof." (2 Kings xiii. 14.) This plainly ſhews that the king conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, not only as a true prophet, but as the principal prophet in Iſrael.</p>

"Now for the prophecy;" you ſay, p. 56. <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> Lord, <hi>make this val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley full of ditches;</hi> which was juſt telling them what every countryman might have told them, without either fiddle or farce, that the way to get water was to dig for it."

               <hi>little,</hi> it is alſo uſed in Hebrew to denote <hi>low,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that the proper ſenſe is youths of a low degree: i. e. worthleſs young fellows. This will more plainly appear, when it is conſidered that Bethel was the idolatrous city, where the prieſts of Baal miniſtred to the calves of Jeroboam; and as they had heard of the aſcent of Elijah, and of Eliſha's ſucceeding him; they ſent their diſciples in deriſion of them both, to to mock Eliſha; by ſaying, "Go up, thou bald head," &amp;c. for as Elijah was known by the deſcription of "an hairy man," (2 King. i. 8.) they, to deride him, ſaid, "Go up," &amp;c. that is, thou who art bald, why doſt thou not aſcend to where thy maſter the hairy man is gone? Seeing them thus deride both him and his maſter, he, as the Lord's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, jealous for the honour of God, and his ſervants, curſed them; and has he not acted juſtly, his curſe would not have effected the deſtruction of the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but God, who knew that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved death, miraculouſly ſent the bears to deſtroy them, at the word of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. This is the true ſtate of the caſe: and plainly ſhews how unjuſt is your illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and ſcurrilous abuſe of this prophet,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:032376_0232_0FF2030323C78FA8"/>by calling him a conjuror, a curſer, and a liar.</p>
            <p>The books of Ezekiel and Daniel you allow to be genuine; but in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the authority of theſe books, you have formed a ſtrange and monſtrous hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, for which there is not the leaſt foundation in thoſe books. You ſuppoſe (p. 58.) that the dreams and viſions of Ezekiel and Daniel were not revelations from God, but a pretended, enigmatical correſpondence relative to the recovery of their country from the Babylonian yoke. You alſo ſuppoſe (p. 59.) that for men ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated as Ezekiel and Daniel were, "ſcarcely any thing could be more abſurd than to ſuppoſe that ſuch men ſhould find nothing to do, but that of employing their time and their thoughts about what was to happen to other nations, a thouſand or two thouſand years after they ſhould be dead." Then you ſuppoſe that men might take up the prophetic office when they pleaſed, as they do any other trade or call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and then lay it down again when they pleaſed; but this, every reader of the Old Teſtament knows to be falſe; for thoſe that were called to the prophetic office, had no choice; they were obliged to obey
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:032376_0233_0FF203050D7EC5E0"/>God's command, as above ſhewn. This is a manifeſt proof of your conſummate igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and impudence; and indeed, theſe ſuppoſitions are altogether ſo abſurd, that it is ſcarcely credible, that any man in his ſenſes, who had ever ſo little regard to his reputation, as an impartial inquirer after truth, ſhould adopt ſuch an hypotheſis: or that he ſhould have ſo little reſpect for his readers as to obtrude it on the world. Surely ſir, you muſt have conſidered your readers as no better than <hi>heads</hi> of onions, when you wrote this; no wonder then, if indignation ſhould prompt the diſcerning reader to cry out,
<q>
                  <l>"It is not eaſy I confeſs.</l>

            <p>You ſay, p. 60. "that Ezekiel, ſpeaking of Egypt, chap. xxix. ver. 11. ſays, '<hi>No foot of man ſhall paſs through it, nor foot of beaſt ſhall paſs through it:</hi> neither ſhall it be inhabited <hi>for forty years.</hi>' This is what never came to paſs, and conſequently it is falſe, as all the books I have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed are." But this did come to paſs, according to the figurative language of the prophet; for the expreſſion of the foot of man or beaſt paſſing through, denoted the
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:032376_0234_0FF2030AB175A6D0"/>great deſolation, that was to be brought on it: and that its trade, which was then carried on by caravans as it is at preſent, ſhould be totally deſtroyed for forty years, and which was fully accompliſhed, as the learned Abarbanal has ſhewn; for from the time that Nebuchadnezzar<note n="*" place="bottom">Beroſus and Megaſthenes, two heathen hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who lived about three hundred years before the Chriſtian aera, bear teſtimony to the conqueſt of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt by Nebuchadnezzar; for, they ſay, he conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great part of Africa, and took ſeveral captives from Egyp: and carried them to Babylon: and that he tranſplanted and ſettled others in Pontus, as bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Newton has ſhown from theſe hiſtorians.</note> conquered E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt till the ruin of the Babylonian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, was forty years. And had you taken the pains to have looked a verſe or two beyond where you quoted from, you would have ſeen the ſequel to this prophecy, ver. 14, 15. "And they ſhall be there a low kingdom. It ſhall be the loweſt of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; neither ſhall it exalt itſelf any more above the nations: that they rule not over the nations." This you may perhaps call an enigmatical dream, or a viſion about the recovery of Ezekiel's country: or ſay downright, "it is a lie." But every can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, impartial perſon, will no doubt eſteem it a wonderful prophecy; for though it is
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:032376_0235_0FF2030C74D7EC70"/>upwards of two thouſand years ſince the delivery of it, yet hath it been fulfilling from that time to this; as Egypt has in general been tributary and in ſubjection to ſtrangers; for it was firſt conquered by the Baby lonians under Nebuchadnezzar; and afterwards by the Perſians under Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Cambyſes, &amp;c. After the Perſians, it became ſubject to the Macedonians; and afterwards to the Romans, then to the Saracens, and then to the Mamalucs: and now is a province of the Tunkiſh empire. This is proved from Herodoms, Xenophon, &amp;c. See Newton on the proph. Differ. 12.</p>

It is well known that Aſſyria, of which Nineveh was the capitol, was ordained to deſtroy the kingdom of Iſrael, and to carry the nation captive; it was therefore called the rod of God's anger; "Ho! to the Aſſyrian, the rod of mine anger," (Iſai. x. 5.) This Jonah knew, and therefore determined within himſelf not to go on this miſſion, that the Aſſyrians might not eſcape the puniſhment due to their crimes, through his means, as he would then be acceſſary to the deſtruction of his own nation; this affected him great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and induced him to withdraw from the holy land, and attempt to ſuppreſs his miſſion; chuſing rather to ſuffer death than in any wiſe be inſtrumental to the ruin of his nation, by ſaving the Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and which proceeded from his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic<note n="*" place="bottom">This public ſpirit was conſpicuous in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Moſes, David and Jeremiah.

In this law he ſet before them in plain terms, the reward of their obedience, and the dreadful puniſhment they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in caſe of diſobedience.
