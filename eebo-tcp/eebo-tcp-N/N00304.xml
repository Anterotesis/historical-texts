            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Chapter and the foregoing contain the last and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermon of this Prophet, in the <hi>publick Audience</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or that did concern and was proposed to the <hi>General Body</hi> of that People. in which Discourse the Lord does by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet declare the <hi>Removal</hi> of the Glory and of his Kingdom from <hi>them</hi> to <hi>another</hi> People: and withal mentions their particular sins, and their Obstinacy in them; for which he would thus deal with them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving <hi>from</hi> and rejecting <hi>of</hi> them. But yet notwithstanding to evidence his Love and Faithfulness to this people that had been so near him, and that he had so graciously manifested Himself <hi>to</hi>: the Lord promises to <hi>preserve a Remnant</hi> in this calamity, whom He would follow with signal favours where ever they should be cast, and reserve to better times. In the finishing and making up of his Prophecy the Prophet intermixes many things by way of <hi>Comfort</hi> to the godly, and <hi>Threatning</hi> to the wicked under all the great Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Providence that should happen in the accomplishment of what was here fore-told. And because this people of the <hi>Jews</hi> both good and bad did too much confide in the Temple and the external Rites and Ordinances of God's worship attended among them: while in the mean time they were not suitably spirited nor did suitably carry themselves. The Prophet in the beginning of this Chapter beats them off from that carnal confidence, and shews them the true way of obtaining and <hi>re</hi>-taining Divine Favour, declaring that it would be vain Confidence to rest in any external signs of Gods prescence or
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000381_0003_0FA4FEB36A9F1648"/>
what of Gods order had been, or <hi>was</hi> among them. This was a <hi>Theme</hi> that has been alwaies so distasteful a <hi>subject,</hi> so hard to be taken down by a visibly professing people under spiritual declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and defection, that some Expositors conclude that it was for this very Prophecy, that the people procured the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> to be put to death. And we know that <hi>Stephen</hi>'s reciting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving this passage in the <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> verse, was in great part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cause of that rage the <hi>Jews</hi> expressed against him, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.49, 50, 54. <hi>As saith the prophet, Heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me, saith the Lord? or what is the place of my rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hath not my hand made all these things? — When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.</hi> But the more hard such words are to be born, the more need there is that they should be spoken,; and therefore the Prophet faithfully delivers this message from the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, The Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me, and where is the place of my rest?</hi> To beat down the vain confidence of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as if because Gods Temple was among them, therefore He could not go from them: The Lord here holds forth and asserts to them his incomprehensible greatness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool</hi>: He filled Heaven and earth with his prescence, yea Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens could not contain Him: He is not included <hi>in,</hi> or confined <hi>to</hi> any place: Hence He demands <hi>Where is the house that ye build unto me, and where is the place of my rest?</hi> This Demand imports in general, that there could be no house built that should hold or contain God, wherein He might rest and repose Himself: And in particular, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids them with imagining that the great GOD was confined <hi>to,</hi> or detained <hi>in</hi> the Temple, as an Idol in some Cell or house framed for it; as if He could find no rest any where else but there. Its true, The Temple was a great Help Priviledge and Advantage to them; as it was a means of Gods Worship, and sign of Gods Prescence among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they fondly supposing God to be <hi>bound</hi> to them thereby, made it of a <hi>help</hi> to become a <hi>Hindrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Text we have 1. What God had done, expressed by way of <hi>Concession</hi> or affirmative <hi>Relation</hi>: which as things past, could give no security for future Good: <hi>For all those things hath my hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What God <hi>would</hi> doe, expressed by way of promise, which might
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000381_0004_0FA4FEB4478B9078"/>
be constantly and certainly depended upon: <hi>But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the former part of the words, there a rise two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions:</p>
            <p>QUST. I. <hi>What is the Antecedant to the Relative</hi> those, <hi>those things which its said God had made, and that they had been?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANSW.</hi> Some refer it to the <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> mentioned in the beginning of the first verse. Them, and whatsoever is contained in them, all the works of Creation which we behold, above or below, in the Sky or Heavens, or on the earth. Others refer it to the <hi>House</hi> that had been built unto God, that had been the place of His rest <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> mentioned in the latter part of the first verse. it is not inconsistent or impossible but <hi>both</hi> may be referred to, having been just before both mentioned, and the repeating of the Relative is not unlikely, but doth intimate so much; <hi>All those things hath My hand made,</hi> viz. the works of Creation. <hi>And all those things have been,</hi> viz. that have pertained to my Temple, House, Rest and Abode among you.</p>
            <p>QUEST. II. <hi>What is the scope and drift of these words, to what end are they thus exprest? [For all those things hath mine hand made &amp;c.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANSW.</hi> They may import either</p>
            <p n="1">1. Seeing that God is HE who has given being to all things, one and another, He cannot be supposed to have any need <hi>of,</hi> to receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit <hi>by,</hi> or be engaged <hi>unto</hi> Man for any service he hath done Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And so they respect and may be joyned with the following words af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, <hi>q. d.</hi> Although I who AM the Authour and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things whatsoever, cannot therefore need or be engaged to any creature, yet I will condescend to shew grace to such who are of a truly humble mind, and do <hi>fear</hi> before Me. My Greatness shall not hinder Me dwelling <hi>with,</hi> and regarding the lowly in spirit. Or else</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be as if the Lord should say. Its true My Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My House, My Rest, My Worship, Order and Ordinances have been among you: <hi>All these things have been</hi>: But the bare <hi>Being</hi> of these is no certain Sign of My continuing Presence and Favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There may be many things that may drive Me away, notwithstanding all that may have been of this nature: But here I give you a certain mark by which you may try and be assured of My Favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

poor, contrite in spirit, and tremble at My Word. <hi>But to</hi> this <hi>man will I look, even to him that is poor, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall a little open this latter part of the words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to this man</hi>] scil. To every such man, man or woman; and therefore to any Company or Society of such men as shall be so spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited; To any people that are in such a frame. What agrees to <hi>Individuals,</hi> will also agree to the <hi>whole</hi> that is made up of such Individuals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Will I look</hi>] Verbs of Sense denote also suitable and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affections. It imports therefore To look with favour and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, to respect, regard, take notice and take care of, to accept with good Will, to embrace with Favour and Love. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.25. <hi>God</hi> looked <hi>upon the children of Israel, and God had</hi> respect <hi>to them</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Even to him that is poor</hi>] The word sometimes signifies those which are outwardly poor and afflicted, and such frequently is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those in this world who find most Favour with God. But here it is to be understood of such who are <hi>spiritually</hi> poor, or poor in their own sight and esteem, <hi>poor in spirit,</hi> as they are called <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3. that think modestly, lowly, meanly of themselves. They are meek and humble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that feel their need of divine answers to their cries, and of divine Help. All men indeed are poor in spiritual regards, but it is the man that does duly <hi>sense</hi> his spiritual poverty, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands himself to <hi>be</hi> and bears himself as a poor man, that is here meant. <hi>Qui nihil altum de se sapit.</hi> His heart is not haughty, nor his eye lofty, and he feels and believes that there is no cause they should.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And of a contrite spirit</hi>] The word properly signifies <hi>smitten in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and intends one whose heart smites him for his Sins and sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whose spirit is grieved and wounded under his guilt and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, who is in bitternes by looking on his <hi>Lord whom he has pierced by his sins,</hi> and his heart yeilds and falls under the Lords threatning <hi>of,</hi> and sentence <hi>against</hi> his sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And trembleth at my word</hi>] i. e. That hath a filial fear of God wrought in his heart by the Word, so as to stand in aw of the Word and with Reverence to receive and attend it.

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:000381_0006_0FA4FEB79E186050"/>1. An Aw of the Word of God: that it <hi>commands</hi> &amp; <hi>stills</hi> the heart, that there is a fear of the threatnings, a fear of incurring the penalty of unbelief <hi>of</hi> and disobedience <hi>to</hi> the Word; A fear of neglecting the Commands and losing the Reward proposed in the Word. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6, 8. <hi>Shall a trumpet</hi> (to which the voice of the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet convincing of sin by the word is compared <hi>Isai.</hi> 58.1. Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression.) <hi>be blown in the City and the people not be afraid? The Lion hath roared</hi> (i. e. the Invincible irresistable GOD hath threatned judgment by His word) <hi>who will not fear?</hi> It is expected such Reproofs and Threatnings by the word should work an Aw.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A careful solicitude to attend the Direction and Prescript of the Word of God. To give it due entertainment, to have it flourish and prosper. In this sence the word is used, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Behold thou hast been</hi> careful <hi>for us with all this care.</hi> It is such a trembling, not as makes men fly from God, but as makes them most careful to subject to the will of God revealed in his Word, as makes them busie themselves to perform, and doe what Gods Word requires.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A making hast to attend the commands of Gods Word. Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing speed without delay to obey the word of God as that which we are afraid to put off or neglect at all. So the word sometimes signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to <hi>run in haste</hi> or <hi>to run in fear</hi> or <hi>with trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus God here gives the character of those whom He will in favour and mercy look to or upon. And this is to be understood as exclusive of all others, <hi>scil.</hi> that they are these only that God is engaged thus to look upon. He has something else to say to those of a contrary spirit and frame. <hi>Psal.</hi> 138.6. <hi>Though the Lord be high, yet hath He respect to the lowly, but the proud he knoweth afarr off.</hi> And this the <hi>Seventy</hi> do directly point to in their rendring this latter clause thus, <hi>Ki epi tina epibiepso all' e epi ton <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whence we may observe;</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>That whatever may have been the great Works of God in the World, or his signal Dispensations toward any people, yet the standing Tryal of a person's, and so a peoples Acceptation with God, is their being of a poor and contrite spirit, and trembling at His Word.</hi>

            <p>I shall endeavour to lead you to the plain and clear understanding of this Truth, by these following Conclusions.</p>
            <p>Concl. I. <hi>All the great Things done in the world, they are the work of God.</hi> His hand has made and framed the whole Fabrick of Heaven &amp; Earth. He hath hung out the Globe of this World; hung the Earth upon nothing; drawn over the Canopy of the Heavens; laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the earth in its place; Created that Fountain and Center of Light, Heat, &amp; Influence in this lower World, the <hi>Sun</hi>; together with all the lesser light Bodies, which are for Times, for Signs &amp; for Seasons, the <hi>Moon</hi> &amp; <hi>Stars</hi>; and He hath set &amp; settled the Ordinances for them all. <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.25. <hi>Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth, &amp; the Heavens are the work of thy hands.</hi> Jer. 31.35. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the Ordinances of the moon &amp; of the stars for a light by night; which divideth the Sea, when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of Hosts is his Name.</hi> The Seas, the vast Mountains also, and the Wind so undiscernable in its motions, and other strange Meteors, they are His Work. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.13. <hi>For lo, He that formeth the mountains and createth the wind, and declareth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treads upon the high places of the earth: the Lord, the God of Hosts is His Name.</hi> Job: 37. with 38. Chap. The continued Creation of those Beings that are ever coming <hi>up,</hi> and going <hi>off</hi> the Stage of this world, by a perpetual, orderly Succession and propagation, they are also His Work. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. The whole Administration of Providence in the Upholding and Government of all created Beings, in a way of highest Wisdom and exact Order, it is <hi>all</hi> His work. All great Revolutions, signal and remarkable Dispensations, Things beyond the ordinary Course and power of Nature, or such as do shew forth the highest strains of Wisdom, Power, Grace or Justice, He doeth them all. <hi>Psal.</hi> 74.12, — 17. <hi>For GOD is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. Thou didst divide the sea by Thy strength. Thou

Thou didst cleave the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. The day is thine, and the night also is thine, thou hast prepared the light and the Sun. Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</hi> Those notable changes in the World in the promoting or suppressing, exalting or bringing down of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Nations, Provinces or Persons, they are all wrought by Him. Psal. 75.6, 7, 8. <hi>For promotion cometh neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South. But God is the Judge, He putteth down one, and setteth up another. For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, &amp; the wine is red: It is full of mixture, &amp; He poureth out of the same.</hi> Ezek. 17, 24. <hi>And all the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

He giveth Snow like wool, He scattereth the hoar frost like ashes. He casteth forth his ice like morsels, who can stand before His cold? He sendeth out His Word and melteth them: He causeth His wind to blow and the waters flow.</hi> Psal. 104.29, 30. <hi>Thou hidest thy face they are troubled: Thou takest away their breath, they dye, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and thou renewest the face of the Earth.</hi> These as all other great works whatsoever, they are the Lords. Nothing is done without Him. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.37. <hi>Who is be that saith and it comes to pass, when the LORD commands it not?</hi> Psal. 136.4. <hi>To Him, who alone does great Wonders.</hi> Hence in consideration of this, let the Lord's People say as they, <hi>Jex.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Art thou not He, O LORD our GOD? therefore we will wait upon thee: for</hi> Thou <hi>hast made all these things.</hi>

Thus signally did God dispence to <hi>Seth,</hi> in whose Family and Race the Worship of God and the visible Adoption and Covenant was continued, <hi>Genes.</hi> 4.26. <hi>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son — then began men to call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> Or to be distinguished by calling <hi>upon,</hi> or being called <hi>by</hi> the Name of the Lord: Religious Worship being especially attended in <hi>Seth</hi>'s Family, when lost by others, hence those of his posterity (though they afterward Degenerated) are called the Sons of God, and so distinguished from the Daughters of men, <hi>Genes.</hi> 6.2. <hi>That the sons of God saw the daughters of men.</hi> Thus sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally did God dispense to <hi>Noah,</hi> (who when all the World besides were overthrown with a deluge of waters) found grace in the eyes of the Lord and is saved with his house in the Ark, <hi>Genes.</hi> 6.8. and 7.23. <hi>And every living substance was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the earth, and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the Ark.</hi> To <hi>Abraham</hi> also, whom God separated from his idolatrous kindred, revealed Himself most graciously <hi>to,</hi> made of him a great Nation, appropriated Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and to them that should bless him, and Cursing to them that should curse him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, Get thee out of thy Countrey and from thy kindred, and from thy Father's house, unto a land that I will sh<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And since the Apostles dayes, some Nations, and several coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and Bodies of People have been by Divine Dispensation not only priviledged with the Gospel; but God hath to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places and people wrought wonderfully for the bringing of it to, or settling them under the enjoyment of it, or for the Continuance of it to them. Ecclesiastical history may give us many instances of this nature. And we in <hi>New-England</hi> (who should if God perswade us so, look upon our selves as less than the least of all God's sincere people) have been behind but few in the signalness of God's dispensations to us in these respects as this Place, and these Solemnityes have often born us witness. I mean not only, that the solemnityes themselves have been witnesses, but also that upon them, frequent, plain and full Reports have been made of the Lords wonderful and gracious dealings with this people. <hi>Ps.</hi> 77.14.15.19.20. and 111.6. <hi>He hath shewed his people the power of his works: that He may give them ye heritage of the heathen.</hi>

Men may (and would to God there were none here that did so!) live under the most clear Gospel Light, in the pure, peaceable, free Enjoyment of Gospel Order and Ordinances, be obliged by manifold Kindnesses from God, themselves have great Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Religion, and make high profession with much Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalness therein; and yet live in some sin openly or secretly, be enslaved to some base defiling lust, wherewith they may not only pollute themselves, but others also. Let the Heaven hear and the Earth give ear, let them be astonished at it, be hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly afraid, and be very desolate, for it may be found that they whom God hath nourished and brought up as His child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, do rebel against Him; that the Lord's own people do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake Him the Fountain of living waters, and goe to empty or muddy Cisterns: As the Lord emphatically complains of <hi>them</hi> in <hi>Isai.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.12, 13. Priviledged professors, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors in <hi>New-England</hi> may be discovered to be sinners; some to be proud, haughty, high-minded, supercilious, self-exalting, arrogant; others to be sensual, intemperate, corrupt, fleshly, lascivious; some to be Company-keepers, to sit and spend time with vain persons; others to be covetous, unjust, oppressing, defrauding and over-reaching others; some to be revilers, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, ungoverned in their speeches and expressions; others to be despisers of that which is good, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Moreover, There may be under such Enjoyments, Grievous and horrible Neglects, receiving the Grace of God (in Gospel offers and means of Salvation) in vain; Woful formality and slightiness in holy Duties, men not stiring up themselves to seek GOD, resting in <hi>a name to live</hi>: Carnal confidence in priviledges and former visible enjoyments of Divine Favour, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4.

The Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> also and other Churches (among whom, as golden Candlesticks the Son of man some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gloriously walked) through their degeneracy and sin, have lost all, been overthrown and sunk into Ruine.</p>
            <p>Concl. 4. <hi>There is that which is a certain Evidence and standing tryal of a person and people's Acceptation with God.</hi> God has not left men altogether in the dark, and at uncertainty in this matter: But has told us to whom He will <hi>look</hi> in favour and with mercy. Tho' Priviledges will not, yet there are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000381_0014_0FA4FEBFEDE7FFB8"/>
Qualifications which will infallibly evidence special Favour. We need not be at a loss if we will consult and study the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, what wee may depend upon for His Acceptation and Salvation. The spiritually wise do understand, and the prudent do know these things; what course is to be taken that they may stand before the Lord, have His presence <hi>with,</hi> and grace <hi>towards</hi> them.

There are a number or sort of people whom God does bear a Favour to, to whom good belongs, who shall rejoice with gladness and shall glory. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.4, 5. <hi>Remember me O Lord with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit me with thy Salvation; that I may see the good of thy chosen; that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine Inheritance.

            <p n="2">II. <hi>Whence is it that God</hi> accepts <hi>and</hi> respects <hi>the humble &amp; lowly?</hi> It is indeed wonderful condescention in the Infinite GOD, thus to vouchsafe His Regard to such low worms as the <hi>best</hi> of the children of men are. That the Great <hi>GOD</hi> should look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such nothings, is a great stoop. <hi>Psal.</hi> 138 6. <hi>Tho' the LORD be high, yet He has Respect to the lowly.</hi> These do'nt indeed <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dissentire,</hi> but they do <hi>ratione:</hi> They do'nt in <hi>Reality</hi> disagree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is a truth that God doth respect such, but they do in <hi>Reason</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Because <hi>It is the Lords's Free will and good pleasure.</hi> This is the bottom cause He is pleas'd thus to doe wonderfully. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Because <hi>These do most truly respect the Lord.</hi> Therefore will the Lord so accept and look upon them, above others. The poor have their eyes <hi>unto</hi> and <hi>upon</hi> the Lord, and therefore the Lord will have <hi>His</hi> eyes upon <hi>them.</hi> In them there is the most free and open passage for the Lord to come into their souls with all His Power, Authority, Sovereignty, Glory and Grace. True Contrition, Humiliation and Poverty of spirit opens the heart to God to let Him in, to come and do all for the soul as belongs to a God to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but on the Contrary, Height of Spirit and Unbrokenness of heart with-holds that due respect from God, and so barrs His so full passage <hi>into,</hi> full possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of,</hi> and dominion <hi>over</hi> the soul. And God hath said, that as men are disposed and carry to Him, so he will carry Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to them: And therefore He will regard and save the afflicted and humble people. <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.25, 26, 27. <hi>With the merciful thou wilt shew thy self merciful, with an upright man thou wilt shew thy self upright, with the pure thou wilt show thy self pure, and with the froward thou wilt shew thy self froward For thou wilt save the afflicted people, but wilt bring down the high looks.</hi>

            <p n="3">III. <hi>How God doth look upon and accept the humble and lowly.</hi> It is with special and peculiar Grace: He looks Favourably on them. Such are the greatest Favourites in the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Whosoever therefore shall</hi> humble <hi>himself as this little child, the same is</hi> greatest <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> He takes pleasure in them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 147.11. <hi>The Lord</hi> taketh pleasure <hi>in them that fear Him.</hi> He will instruct them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.9. <hi>The meek will He guide in judgment, &amp; the meek will He</hi> teach <hi>His way.</hi> He will communicate His grace to them <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. — <hi>but gives</hi> Grace <hi>to the humble.</hi> He will dwell with them. <hi>Isai.</hi> 57·15.

Wherefore say my people, we are Lords, we will come no more unto thee?</hi> Had we not been stout against the Lord, we could never have stood out against so many solemn counsels and warnings upon these and other occasions, as we have done.

            <p n="1">I. <hi>What we have</hi> done <hi>for want of this spirit.</hi> The want of this has been the cause of all our errors, of all provoking errors in Doctrine, Worship, in Administration both Civil and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical, and in Conversation. The Pride and Unbrokenness of our hearts hath caused us in many Instances to wander from the path-way of Wisdom and understanding. In general</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hence we have with-held from God His Right.</hi> what was due to Him: viz. The full honour of His Sovereignty, Power, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Command over us.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hence it is that we have no more</hi> duly <hi>sought God.</hi> Hence we have sought Him</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No more fully according to His Order.</hi> There has been much Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Mistake <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>about</hi> the things of God's House and Kingdom. Some Ordinances of Christ laid by, and thrown aside by many; if not despised and reproached. Too much baulking also of known Institutions and Commands: Men have not been willing throughly to subject themselves to God's Ordinances and Institutions, especially when any thing of their own hath come at any time to be thwarted by them. <hi>Inst. gr.</hi> It hath been too much in <hi>New-England,</hi> that the Discipline of Christ in His Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches hath been in great part neglected; or attended according as it suited <hi>with,</hi> or happened to the humours, affections, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests or relations of some men, and so the Ordinance of Christ that ought to be attended and administred without partiality, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to mens lusts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No more sincerely and uprightly</hi>: But with so much Formality Hypocrisie, carelesness and indifferency in the Ordinances that have been attended. And all neglect of seeking God at all, or in due order it arises from pride. <hi>Ps.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God.</hi> Though not alwayes from the pride of a wicked person, but sometimes from unmortified pride in a righteous man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence we have been contentious.</hi> The wise man tells us what is the only cause of Contention. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Only by</hi> pride <hi>comes contention.</hi> And how much of this, together with the evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of it, Jealousies, reproaches, Slanders, Alienations of spirit &amp;c. has there been in Churches and other Societies! The Remembrance of those woful Contentions that have been in many Churches, may justly humble us this day; as also the Dissentions, Heart-risings and counter-actings, that have been in Courts and civil Assemblyes, while we were otherwise at quiet. Oh how high have we been in our Contests <hi>with,</hi> and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures one of another!

On which side in our late Differences of apprehension about the management of publick affairs, which did rise so high, there was most blame, I shall not affirm. Only I wish that every one, of whatsoever Opinion or Apprehension, might be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of every particular wherein they have been out of the way and too blame, in that or any other controversy, which has at any time unhappily spread among us. It is not so much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of apprehension (that is common to men and the best of men in this world about Circumstantials and non-fundamentals) as vehemency and bitterness of spirit, and the like evils arising from, and accompanying such differences (which sucks away the vital spirits of Gospel charity) that has wounded us. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever provocations therefore there may have been at any <hi>Massah</hi> or <hi>Meribah</hi> of ours, let every one concerned take heed that he do not suffer any bitterness of spirit then taken, to ly and rankle into any Malignity on one side or other; for I intend not one more than another: But earnestly desire that all the Lord's servants, however for some time, through temptation falling out; yet will in the end show themselves to be true Children of peace and lovers of Condescention. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence we have been acted by Self-Interest.</hi> It is sad when it may be said of a Christian people, or any of those among them that have the care or conduct of publick Administrations, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.20.21. <hi>I have no man like minded, who will natural<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly care for your state. For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</hi> When some private Interest of their own, their own Advantage, Preferment, Fame and Reputation or the like, shall carry them off <hi>from,</hi> and make them stand in the way <hi>of</hi> that which is truly for the publick good in Church or State. And this is the want of humility, when we prefer any Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of ours, or make it to justle with the Lords. And would to God we had not cause to lay our hands upon our breasts upon this account! Let all the Lords servants whom he has any way imployed in His work in whatsoever capacity, faithfully examine themselves in this matter: when this or that hath been before them that would really have been beneficial for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, has not some such Thought; <hi>I shall lose by this; Some way of advantage that I have had will be hereby stopt.</hi> or, <hi>I shall be

eclips't or overtopt,</hi> or <hi>I sha'nt have so much glory of the work if it goe so,</hi> or <hi>I have a friend that is concerned</hi>; or the like: I say, hath not some such kind of thought, secretly stirring in your mind (though it may be too unobserved) made you to oppose or at least not to be earnest for, or staunch in what would have been for good, yea and it may be sometimes not in that which is just or honest? I make no particular Application or Instance here, I know good men have their failings, and those who in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral do truly seek the Interest of Christ, may yet in this or that particular be too much swayed by private interest, and we must not presently cashier them (especialy if otherwise men of worth and use) because of this. But I heartily wish that those scales of self-interest and affection, which blind the eyes of many men, might wholly fall from the eyes of all you whom the Lord hath or shall any way improve in his service in this <hi>Israel,</hi> and from the eyes of every Christian.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence <hi>we have born too high a sail.</hi> That there hath been an affectation of Gallantry unbecoming our condition, hath been long complained <hi>of,</hi> and many times testified against in this place and on these occasions, and that I believe rationally. But its most apparent that this hath exceedingly grown upon us of latter times, and is accompanied also with <hi>sufficient,</hi> if not much too great delicacy of living, wherein we abuse our mercyes God hath given us. Further, it is not improbable but that some for whom Providence hath favourably and honourably cast their Lot may have been under temptation to have their hearts lifted up above their Brethren; through the gales of Popular applause, or an overweening esteem of their own worth or the Largness of Divine Bounty to them in any remarkable Dispensation, or the like; to make too much of themselves, &amp; it may be too little of others; overlooking, neglecting, or too much imposing. As One says
<q>It's a hard matter for a man to be a painful Preacher, a zealous Professor, a faithful Statesman, or a man that has laid out himself for the Publick any way,<note place="margin">

Finally, let it not be offensive if I mention it as a thing worthy of Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, Whether this Government or the Persons managing it; have not in some instances born themselves too high, assumed more than God hath given them full ground for: and if it should be so, no doubt but that they have been a provocation, and no wonder if God threaten to bring you low.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence <hi>We have not been subject to Order and Government, civil, ecclesiastical or domestical.</hi> We have been a Corporation that have lived too much in the violation of our own Laws: Of some good Laws we have been too high to bear the Execution of them at the hand of our Neighbours, whether such as were called to see them observed, or such as would secure themselves by them: There has been to much of a lawless, ungovern'd spirit. And for the true Order and Government of Christ in His Church, <hi>that</hi> hath been in some places little practised, in some much withstood, and in others quite overthrown, whilst power and Government hath been fixed in those that should be ruled, and only a liberty to lift up their hands left to the Rulers, and together therewith other Ordinances of Christ have been undervalued and abused. And as for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Government and Order, <hi>that</hi> is in a great Measure lost in <hi>New-England,</hi> as those who undestand what it is, do too too sensibly complain.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hence <hi>We have set other things in the place of GOD.</hi> We have left God and our <hi>first love</hi> to Him. Through want of true poverty of spirit, we have not maintained that constant feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sense of our need of Him, and so have suffered our selves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and go away from Him, away from that strict and close dependance and communion which was sometimes in Christians. We have not been so earnestly careful to ly alwaies in the arms

of a Gracious Saviour under the full expressions of His Love, but have been slothful and slumbering in carnal rest and ease, hard and loth to be awakned and stirred up to open to Christ and let Him fully in to our souls, as the Spouse. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 3. — <hi>the voice of my Beloved that knocketh, saying, open to me — I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them.</hi> And our hearts have gone after some other thing, some <hi>new</hi> love, some vanity or other, which we have entertained, embraced and set in God's place: and these we have Idolized, set our hearts upon them, and given more than their due to them. Thus we have done to the World, we have fallen down to that, and that hath lifted us up in our minds, wherein we have violated that solemn caution God left with His People to be minded by them when in a rise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition in the World. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.12.13, 14. <hi>Beware lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly Houses, and dwelt therein: And when thy Herds and thy Flocks multiply, and thy Silver and thy Gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied: Then thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.</hi> Truly here is our main wound, and the great cause of God's Controversie with us, that we are declined and gone off so much from God, from the life and power of Grace and Godliness, from keeping our hearts and walking with God; and have suffered other inferior things to take up, fill and take away our hearts. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Nevertheless</hi> (notwithstanding all that was commendable among them, in purity of Doctrin &amp; Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and travel in God's work and service) <hi>I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love.</hi> These inward soul-declensions and decayes, and goings off of the heart from God, were very offensive to him: as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Because I am broken with their whorish heart which hath departed from me, and with their eyes which goe a whoring after their Idols.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is not unlikely, but we have abused the most glorious priviledges of the Gospel here afforded, to be in some degree and too much haughty because of God's holy Mountain. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.11. So does want of true humility and poverty of spirit expose us to abuse the best things. And if there be any other particular wherein this people have incurred like guilt, I had
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000381_0027_0FA4FECCE8CA8CF8"/>
much rather they should take notice of it themselves than hear it from mee. Whatever it be that men have their eyes upon, whether any thing they suppose in themselves, or any thing that hath been done for them, or any priviledge bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, these cannot give them rest and security in God's Favour, and it will be an error to have recourse <hi>to,</hi> or depend <hi>upon</hi> them for divine Protection, while we neglect true humility poverty of spirit and trembling at God's Word. There is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a tall <hi>Eliab,</hi> that even some <hi>Samuels</hi> may think to be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly favoured of God, which yet God will reject: But the true spirit of <hi>David</hi> which we have in <hi>Psal.</hi> 131. <hi>Lord my heart is not haughty &amp;c.</hi> He never will reject.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Hence, <hi>We have been Impatient of Reproof; though necessary, orderly, and without Reflection.</hi> Too much uncircumcised in heart and ears, resisting, or turning away from the Holy Ghost speaking to us <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> his Word. The form of Religion, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lifted up therewith, is (as One speaks) a <hi>Buff Coat</hi> to their sins, to turn the sharpest reproofs that can be levelled against them. It was so with that people, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.11.12. <hi>They refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears that they should not hear, yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant stone, lest they should hear the Law, and the words which the Lord of Hosts hath sent in His spirit by the former Prophets.</hi> And we have reason to acknowledge &amp; be humbled that it has been too much so with us; that so much unwillingness <hi>to,</hi> impatience <hi>of,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibleness <hi>under</hi> the Reproofs of God's Word, hath shown it self among us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Consider <hi>What we have</hi> suffered <hi>for want of this humble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> This hath been the procurer of all our sorrows, that we have been no more humble and submissive unto God. For this we have been threatned: It was said upon a like Occasion, now twelve years agone,
<q>Probable it is, that it must be some sharp affliction,<note place="margin">

Whether the whole of what God intended by
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000381_0028_0FA4FECDA38041C0"/>
and like words, be come upon us, is yet a question: but much we have suffered, which we may justly reckon to this account: God has brought many of our fears upon us, because we have been too high to answer His Calls, and we know not what He may doe more therein. <hi>Isai.</hi> 66.4. — <hi>and will bring their fears upon them, because when I called none did answer, when I spake they did not hear, but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.</hi> God hath drawn out His sword against us, and hath given it a charge to devour round about our Coasts, and many have fallen down slain by it. God hath blown upon the Labour of our hands, by Blastings, Flouds, Droughts, and losses by Ship-wrecks and otherwayes; and of what hath remained he hath found out continual waies for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursment, to make and keep us empty. God hath sent sore Sicknesses and Pestilential diseases upon us which have sorely wasted us. God hath again and again contended by terrible Fires, which have eat up a great part of our pleasant Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He has also frustrated our expectations and hopes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes: as it is <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.15. <hi>We looked for peace but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble.</hi> Now all these things God hath done to humble us; for we are His covenant People: we have not been therefore humble enough. The Lord's goodness would not have suffered Him to doe thus, if our <hi>badness</hi> did not force Him to it <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, behold, I will melt them, and try them: for how shall I doe for the daughter of my people? q. d.</hi>
               <q>What other course can I take but this according to the nature of man? The Gold-smith hath no other way to sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the dross from the mettal but by melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it down.<note place="margin">

All that we have suffered and been threatned with, it has been but necessary for us; <hi>less</hi> would not bring us to tremble <hi>before</hi> God, and <hi>in</hi> our selves: And Oh that <hi>this</hi> might! God could <hi>yet,</hi> and doubtless would save us, give us favour with Himself and what wee should need elswhere, for the continuance of our mercies, our precious &amp; pleasant enjoyments.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:000381_0029_0FA4FED27AC8D400"/>II. <hi>VSE. Exhort.</hi> Let this people and every person of us, <hi>get and keep</hi> in <hi>this frame of spirit</hi> mention'd in the Text and Doctrine, to be <hi>poor and contrite in spirit, and tremble at GOD's Word.</hi> That which you are now exhorted to is, to be true and through Christians, and to keep alwayes in a Christian frame of spirit, or to be eminent in the exercise of Christianity. For this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al poverty and contrition of spirit and trembling at God's Word is to be found no where else, but where true grace is, and where the spirit of Christ dwels and Rules. You are herein exhorted to be Christs true Scholars and followers. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi> Phil. 2.5. <hi>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.</hi> To <hi>be</hi> and <hi>carry</hi> like Christians indeed.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Motive. <hi>Consider the disadvantage of being without this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> In several respects,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Word you hear will doe you no good.</hi> Pride is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to profiting.
<q>It is observed that the ground whereon the <hi>Peacock</hi> that proud bird sits, is barren: the heart where Pride sits is barren.<note place="margin">

               </q>
The Word must be received in meekness, that it may be savingly efficacious. <hi>Ja.</hi> 1.21. While men remain in the pride and unhumbledness of their hearts, whatever their professions be, and whatever they may <hi>doe,</hi> the best counsels &amp; cautions will not work kindly upon them. A People will never be brought to do their business throughly with God, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with His Word, till they be brought to such a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling frame. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God, to put away — according to the counsel of my Lord, and of those that</hi> tremble <hi>at the Commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the Law.</hi> There must be an awful, sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reverential, fiducial fear in all our Transactions with God, otherwise they will be but formal, Hypocritical, vain and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous; there will be no good effect of the Word of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. The Lord's Words will indeed do good and come to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in those that walk uprightly. <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.7. But it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that his soul which is lifted up, is not upright in him. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. Therefore such will doe nothing to purpose with God, in attending to His Word, let it be spoken never so
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000381_0030_0FA4FED4B5E3E218"/>
plainly, closely, solemnly and frequently. Neither will the Word spoken go down with an unhumbled people, unless it be such as suits them, they not so much desiring that their <hi>wills</hi> should be brought to the <hi>Word,</hi> as that the <hi>Word</hi> should be brought to their <hi>wills.</hi> A sad Instance we have of this <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.1.2. <hi>And it came to pass, that when</hi> Jeremiah <hi>had made an end of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto all the people all the words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their God had sent him to them even all these Words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then spake</hi> Azariah <hi>the son of</hi> Hoshaiah, <hi>and</hi> Johanan <hi>the son of</hi> Kareah, <hi>and all the</hi> proud <hi>men, saying unto</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>thou speakest falsly; the Lord our God hath not sent thee to say, goe not &amp;c.</hi> Notwithstanding their solemn profession. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 42.5, 6. Then they said to Jeremiah, The Lord be a true and faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness between us, if we doe not even according to all things for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us, whether it be good or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we send thee, that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This will make men that <hi>they will not be afraid when God is displeased with themselves or others</hi>: When sin is committed or Judgement threatned. <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.23.24. <hi>And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth, yet they were not</hi> afraid, <hi>nor rent their garments, neither the King nor any of his servants that heard all these Words.</hi> This is from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward stoutness and unsubduedness of heart. Hence many a professor, can be loose in his walk; formal and slighty in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties; careless of the Sabbath; indulge his corruptions; comply far with some sins of the times; neglect the trust and charge committed to him: and yet his heart not smite him, the thoughts hereof do not trouble him, nor make him afraid. And this is a dangerous thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will <hi>expose us to Misery and Destruction.</hi> If we should have no other Molestation come upon us any way, yet if we be without this spirit of awful fear and trembling before God, we shall be like enough quickly to sink in our own ruines, under the weight of our pride and other corruptions. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.10, 11.

               <hi>They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my Law, nor in my Statutes that I set before you and before your Fathers. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.</hi> For in setting up our selves, we reject and forsake God. And this People have been told that if they forsake God, God will cast them off for ever. 1. <hi>Chron</hi> 28.9. <hi>Vzziah</hi>'s self-exaltation emboldned him to venturre upon such things as were the occasion of his destruction. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16. <hi>But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction, for he transgressed against the Lord, and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn Incense.</hi> A heart not duly subdued will expose men to venture upon such things as will tend to wound their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences dishonour Religion, and procure their calamity. <hi>All the world can never keep that man</hi> up, <hi>that never seeks to keep his own spirit</hi> low. GOD has not been wont to prosper any People long, however good they were, or however good their cause were, if their spirits have been high, and so shown more of themselves, than of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, as it is too often with God's people. So true is it which the Holy Ghost saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.23. <hi>A mans pride shall bring him low.</hi> and <hi>Chapt.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Pride goeth before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and an haughty spirit before a fall.</hi> If <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s heart be lifted up, there is a Dispensation of wrath near. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25. — <hi>for his heart was lifted up, therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</hi> The loftiness of man shall be made low, God will have it so. <hi>Isai.</hi> 2.11.17. <hi>The lofty looks of man shall be</hi> humbled, <hi>and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed</hi> down, <hi>and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the LORD of Hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be brought low, &amp;c.</hi>

God could not over-look them when thus humbly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20. <hi>I have surely heard Ephraim bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself thus, Thou hast chastised me and I was chastised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a bullock unaccustom'd to the yoke: Turn thou mee, and I shall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was turned, I repented: And after that I was instructed I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed yea even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.

We have therefore encouragement and all Reason on every hand, to imitate those more eminent and illustrious Saints, which are noted by the Elders round about the Throne in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> who cast not only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves but there Crowns down before the Lord; laid all their Honour, Worth, or Endowments at the Lord's feet, as sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, and acknowledging their own utter emptiness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 4.10.</p>

and one cryed unto another and said, Holy, Holy, Holy is the LORD of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory. And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cryed, and the house was filled with smoke, Then said I, wo is me for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips.</p>

            <p>For a Close of this Discourse, this Doctrine and Exhortation may by a particular Application be proposed</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>To Labour for a large measure of this spirit of humbleness of mind and meekness in your selves.</hi> You need it to make You meet for your work, that You may be accepted therein of God and men.

When God chose a man to lead his people in a Wilderness of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, Dangers, Sufferings and Temptations, He chose <hi>Moses</hi> the meekest man in all the earth; one able, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy of his acquaintance with God, to bear things intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto others: And yet notwithstanding even <hi>Moses</hi>'s spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was sometimes too much provoked. What need then have You to be eminent in this respect, to be beyond exception for true Gospel-Humility and subjection to the Word of God, to be wholly mortified to <hi>Self,</hi> to the Pride, Vanity, Profit, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, Grandure and Love of the World.</p>

This Exhortation may be proposed <hi>To the Lord's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Ministry.</hi> Fathers, and Brethren, suffer this word of Exhortation from the unworthiest of your Order, or rather from your Lord Jesus Christ: <hi>Shew your selves Patterns,</hi> as in other things, so <hi>in the Humility, and meekness of your spirits,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and brokenness of your hearts, awful trembling at God's Word, and <hi>in</hi> the Administration of His Worship, and <hi>labour</hi> to <hi>promote this frame in the Lord's people,</hi> by shewing them their sins in the vileness &amp; desert of them, &amp; by setting before them the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and Glory of God. When God hath eminently improved suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded and honoured to the last any of his servants in the work of the Ministry, He hath given them a good measure of His Spirit. Our Work is <hi>to receive the Word</hi> from God's mouth, and to <hi>give His people warning</hi> from Him: To both which a large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this spirit is necessary; so much as is not easily or presently attained. It was some <hi>time</hi> before <hi>Elijah</hi>'s spirit at <hi>Horeb</hi> the mount of God, was sufficiently prepared to an awful regard of the Divine presence, and to the receiving the Lord's message.

mind of God. 1. King. 19.11, 12, 13. To <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Lord appears in such glorious manner as makes him cry out, Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips; and then He <hi>gives</hi> him and sends him upon his special errand to his people. <hi>Isai.</hi> 6. This spirit also is needful for the due deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Lords mind to His people. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>The servant of the Lord must — be gentle, — patient, in meekness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing &amp;c.</hi> Whatever message we have; whether of Mercy or Judgment, our souls should be feelingly and heart-breakingly concerned for those to whom we speak. In the discharge of our Trust, as we are special servants of Jesus Christ, we should have much of His spirit, who could not denounce Judgment against <hi>Jerusalem</hi> without many tears and heart-breakings for them. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41, 44. <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, saying, If thou hadst known even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. For the day shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, &amp;c.</hi> I need not say what present cause there is for the Lord's faithful Watch-men to be alike deeply affected for <hi>Zion.</hi> And in all our Administrations we should be carried forth with a full sense of our own weakness and unworthiness.
