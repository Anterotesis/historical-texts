            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And here in my Text, when the ambitious Diſciples came to him to determine a Diſpute which they had been no doubt warmly engaged in; <hi>Which of them ſhould be the greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> Nay, ſays our Lord, Not too faſt! <hi>Except ye be converted, and become as little Children,</hi> ye ſhall not ſo much as <hi>enter in</hi> there at all. Pride, and Strife, and Emulations, are no Preparatives for that World. Nor the Kingdom of Grace below, nor the Kingdom of Glory above, is to be enter'd with this unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,

aſpiring Temper. Converſion, Humility, and a new Life, muſt make us meet for that Inheritance in Light. CHRIST himſelf has determined this Matter, and it therefore comes to us with all Authority and Conviction. Let us then attend earneſtly to the Illuſtration and Application of the Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Except ye be converted,</hi> ſays the Text. Converſion, and to be converted, are Phraſes often found in the Holy Scriptures; and our Salvation turns upon our right underſtanding what they mean. The Literal Senſe of the word <hi>Converſion</hi> then is no more than this, <hi>turning about.</hi> And this is the meaning of the Word in this Place: and ſo it is explained in many other Texts. Sinners are called upon to <hi>turn:</hi> and this Short Word comprizes in it all Salvation. Let us meditate a little here, and endeavour to underſtand it well.</p>
            <p>Man was at firſt created holy and happy in the Enjoyment of GOD. The Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> was filled with Thoughts of GOD, and love to him. The Glory of GOD was his End in all that he did. A Senſe of GOD, Love to GOD, and Satisfaction in the Will of GOD, made up the Happineſs of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe. The Soul was ſatisfied and crowded with the Enjoyment of the Infinite Being; and a Senſe of his Glories, and his Love.</p>
            <p>But no ſooner did <hi>Adam</hi> ſin, and renounce this Happineſs, than GOD forſook him, and he was left deſtitute and empty. That Soul which was once filled full of GOD, has now in it a vaſt Chaſm. We feel indeed our want of Happineſs: But our dark Minds know not where to find it. The Deſire remains: but the Satisfaction is loſt and gone. Our Souls feel ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting. There's a vaſt Hollow there without any thing to fill it up. It is conſtantly craving, <hi>Give, Give.</hi> That's the Reaſon that Men are never perfectly eaſy and at Reſt. They are forever purſuing that Happineſs which they conſtantly miſs of. GOD is gone, and Happineſs with Him: and they try to fill up the empty Space, with every thing they can lay their Hands on. Riches, and Honours, and Senſual Pleaſures, theſe they fancy will make them happy. They try; and try again; and repeat their tryal: But they ſtill meet a Diſappointment. They think; If ever I obtain ſuch a thing I ſhall be ſatisfied: If ever I get into ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, I ſhall ſet down contented. They obtain what
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:041920_0004_101B6C9EA3620F48"/>
they deſire, and are juſt where they were before. Then they put off the Point of Happineſs a little further, and ſtill think on ſome Temporal Good which they have not yet enjoyed. If they obtain this too, they are ſtill diſappointed. Thus they go on from one Deceit to another, till Death overtakes them, before they have tryed their laſt Project. This has been the Caſe of all Mankind, a very few excepted, from <hi>Adam</hi> until now: Nor will Men take Warning after all. All paſt Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and all their own Experience to this Moment, will make no laſting Impreſſion on them. They have loſt their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in GOD? they wander from Creature to Creature in Purſuit of it. Madneſs is in their Hearts while they live; and after that they go down unto the Dead. I am not at all wandering from my Text, in theſe Obſervations, but making clear the Way to it.</p>
            <p>Converſion then lies here. The Man as he is purſuing Happineſs in Creatures, is ſtop'd ſhort, and convinced that theſe will not do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> GOD gives him a New Sight of things. He <hi>ſees an End of all Perfection</hi> below GOD. He ſees he is undone every where elſe. Now his Will is renewed. He <hi>turns about:</hi> (THAT'S CONVERSION) he TURNS ABOUT to God, and from this Time ſeeks all Happineſs in Him alone. He ſays, <hi>Who ſhall ſhew me any Good?</hi> and he replies, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon me. Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides Thee.</hi> For ever after this Turn of Soul, the Man is ſet upon pleaſing GOD: upon yielding to the Will of GOD: upon approving himſelf in the Sight of GOD. He never ſeeks his Happineſs in the Creature any more. He may indeed, under the Power of Temptation, caſt a wiſhing Look at them: But he recalls it in a Moment. He never can reſt eaſy one Moment ſhort of the Favour of GOD. Like the Needle touch'd by the Magnet, ſtill pointing Northward. When it is ſhaken indeed and toſt about, it trembles, it wavers, it vibrates, it varies a Point this way and that, but it never fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es but right North again. So a Soul thus touched by the SPIRIT of GOD, may be toſt by Temptations, and the Hurries of the World, and look this Way and that among the Creatures, till the Violence of the Shock is over, but it never fixes; never reſts, till it points full and ſteady to GOD again. This ſhort Paragraph is, I think, a full and clear Account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:041920_0005_101B6CA249709488"/>We all are ſeeking Happineſs. Every Natural Man ſeeks for it ſomewhere below GOD. Converſion is, The Man ſeeing he is infinitely wrong, <hi>turns about</hi> to GOD again to ſeek his whole Satisfaction there. I hope I have now ſaid enough in a few Words to explain the Matter, and ſhew what Converſion is. Before we proceed, we may make one or two ſolemn and affecting Reflections.</p>
            <p>From what we have heard, we perceive that <hi>Converſion is out of our own Power.</hi> It is impoſſible for us to convert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or for all the Angels in Heaven to do it for us. To convince you of this, Let the Natural Man make the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Try this Moment. Try and ſee whither you can bring your Hearts to this, to renounce all Happineſs in every thing but the Favour of GOD; to let GOD order for you; to have no Will of your own; to be ſwallowed up, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd with his Will, whatever it is. Can you renounce every mortal Idol? Can you leave this World, and all the low Delights of it, to go to a World where you will have none of them, but the Love of GOD will ſwallow you up? Theſe things are ſo diſtant from an unrenewed Heart, that they look like wild Paradoxes to it. The Man finds he can't bring his Heart to this; and he thinks no Body ever could. And yet, there is not a Good Man upon Earth, but knows a little what this means. He knows a little what it is to love GOD; to have his Happineſs in GOD; to exult that the Will of GOD is done. Not a Good Man upon Earth, but would gladly leave all the Delights of Life, only to be made perfectly holy. Nay, all he fears in Death is, leſt it ſhould not convey him to World of perfect Holineſs. Could he be ſure that conſummate Holineſs would be to him the immediate Conſequent of Death, he'd die chearfully, without a Struggle or a Groan. Seeing then that Converſion is not in our own Power, let us repair to GOD for it. Senſible, and amazed at our own Incapacity, let us take to our ſelves Words and pray with repenting <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. xxxi. 18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; for thou art the Lord my</hi> GOD. Be ſenſible of the ſinful Nature which ſtill carries us away from him. Be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of that firſt Sin, by which we departed from him, and pray, Pſal. lxxx. 19. <hi>Turn us again, O Lord</hi> GOD <hi>of Hoſts, and cauſe thy Face to ſhine and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> To ſee our Impotency is the firſt Step towards Converſion</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:041920_0006_101B6CA3E24C0B68"/>We here ſee <hi>our Neceſſity of</hi> JESUS CHRIST We can't turn again to GOD without Him. No man can come to the Father but by Him. The Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween GOD and us is irreconcilable but by CHRIST. Out of him GOD is a conſuming Fire. We may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed feel the Want of Happineſs, but we ſhould never dare to go to GOD for it. He would be our Enemy, and we ſhould hate him for it. <hi>Falſe Notions</hi> of the Divine Juſtice and Mercy could never bring us truly to him: And <hi>true ones</hi> would only drive us farther from him. So that ſet CHRIST aſide, and there can be no Converſion.</p>
            <p>We learn alſo <hi>the Honours of the</hi> HOLY GHOST. He is the Agent who performs this Work. One Reaſon that Men fall Short of this ſaving Change, is the not acknowledging him as they ought. Did men regard the Operation of the Holy SPIRIT more, there would be more frequent Converts. Men are apt to truſt to their own Strength when they ſet about the Work of Converſion. They rob the Spirit of GOD of his Glory, and ſo it all comes to nothing. He it is who makes this great Change in men. He muſt be the Almighty GOD then: and we ſhould honour him as ſo.</p>
            <p>You ſee <hi>how many miſtake in their Notions of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Some think that to be converted is only to profeſs the Chriſtian Religion. They fancy that to turn from Heatheniſm to Chriſtianity is all that is implied in it. To talk of a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed Perſon's being afterward converted they think is Cant and Superſtition. This is the modern (I wiſh I could not add, the obtaining and faſhionable) Scheme. If we ſpeak of our being <hi>Converted,</hi> they aſk, why what were you before? <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Heathen?</hi> Alas, the fatal Miſtake! We are all undone in our Natural State, unleſs we know what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion means. We are all naturally departing from GOD, and ſeeking Happineſs in ſomething below him. If ever we are happy then, it muſt be by our ſtopping here, and turning about to him. Converſion does not conſiſt, in embracing a new Sect, or Party: in Baptiſm, or Approach to the Lord's Table; or any external Privilege, or Advantage, or Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No; it conſiſts in turning from the Creature to GOD.</p>
            <p>We ſee alſo the Propriety of the Expreſſion in the Text, Except ye <hi>become as Little Children.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion implies ſuch a Change as will bring us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:041920_0007_101B6CA58C175A28"/>
our Life anew. We muſt become as Little Children: modeſt, unambitious, teachable as they. Like them, we muſt be <hi>born again;</hi> we muſt begin to live again: begin another kind of Life: purſue a quite different End, by quite different Meaſures. Like a weaned Child, muſt be weaned from Creatures, and the things we were formerly fond of. But I would not enlarge here.</p>
            <p>I proceed</p>
            <p>To ſhew <hi>what we are to underſtand by the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> ſpoken of in the Text. <hi>Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM OF HEAVEN.</hi> I ſhall not be long in explaining this Phraſe. The <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of</hi> GOD, are principally uſed in the Evangeliſts for the State of the Goſpel in This World; or the Rewards of it in the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Sometimes it means the <hi>Kingdom of Grace;</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Kingdom of Glory.</hi> And I ſuppoſe that tho' the Text may ultimately refer to the Latter, yet it takes in the former alſo. And therefore we ſhall conſider them both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Except we be converted and become as little Children, we ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

            <p>Without this we cannot enter into the <hi>Kingdom of Grace.</hi> God cannot receive us as his Favourites even in This World, till we have had this Change paſſed upon us. He will take no Delight in us, while we openly neglect him, and ſet up Self and Creatures in his Throne. We may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed belong to his Kingdom of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and he may have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for our Salvation before our Converſion: But we are by no means Subjects in this Kingdom of <hi>Grace</hi> before this. By no means intitled to his Special Favours, and the Objects of his peculiar Delight.</p>
            <p>We may indeed belong to the Viſible Kingdom of CHRIST in the World, and not be ſavingly Converted. We may be Members of his Church here, and eat and drink in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and yet he know nothing of us. But here too, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our being worthy Gueſts at this ſacred Feaſt, Converſion is a neceſſary Preparation. <hi>Friend how cameſt thou in hither, not having a wedding Garment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But</p>
            <p>Without this Converſion before we cannot enter into the <hi>Kingdom of Glory.</hi> Rev. xxi. 27. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe

enter into it, any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination.</hi> And not only has GOD <hi>declared</hi> this, all over his New Teſtament, but it is impoſſible even in the <hi>Nature of the Thing.</hi> The principal Happineſs in the Kingdom of Glory is, in being perfectly conformed to the Will of GOD: And this, we know, is only attainable by Converſion. We entertain juſter Ideas of Heaven, when we apprehend it as a <hi>State</hi> than a <hi>Place.</hi> There is indeed ſuch a glorious Place; but we know not where, or what it is. But as to the Temper and Happineſs of this Holy World, this every Good Man feels a little of in his own Breaſt. What do they do in Heaven? What do they Enjoy there? Truly they praiſe GOD; they love GOD; they ſeek their whole Happineſs in GOD; and are perfectly conformed to his Will. And now, how can an Unconverted Man enter that glorious World? His whole Soul is bent upon Self and Creatures; here he terminates, and he knows nothing further. Should ſuch a Soul but once get into the Manſions of Glory, he would be like a Swine in a Golden Palace: He'd be quite out of his Element; and long for the Puddle and the Mire again. Like <hi>Uzziah</hi> with his Leproſy in the holy place, 2 Chron. xxvi. 20. <hi>And Azariah the chief Prieſt, and all the Prieſts looked upon him, and behold he was leprous in his Forehead, and they thruſt him out from thence, yea, himſelf haſted alſo to go out.</hi> So would be the Caſe of the Polluted Soul in the Holy Heavens. Not only would the holy <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Juſt Spirits drive</hi> him out from among them, but he <hi>himſelf</hi> would <hi>haſte</hi> alſo to <hi>go out.</hi> What ſhould he do there? His Soul has no turn to this Sort of Happineſs. Unmortified Luſts and raging Appetites, Pride, and Senſuality, and Self-Will would be a Hell in his own Boſom, amidſt all the Glories of Heaven. His whole Nature muſt be changed; he muſt be converted, and begin a New Life, or he could never enter into that bleſſed State. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured as clearly as I could, to explain and demonſtrate the Doctrine, and I come now to the Sole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Application.</p>
            <p>Shall not the Unconverted enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Where then ſhall they go?</hi> They muſt go ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. They are in Being, and they muſt exiſt for ever.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:041920_0009_101B6CAC101F6930"/>
               <hi>Here</hi> they cannot always live: In a few Days more they muſt leave the Earth; not ſuffered to tarry by Reaſon of Death. To <hi>Heaven</hi> they cannot go. They have no Part there; nothing to do there; The voice of CHRIST, like a Flaming Sword, guards the Paſſage againſt them. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, they ſhall not enter</hi> there. Well then, what will become of them! O fearful, deſtitute, ruined State! The infallible Word of GOD informs us where the miſerable Creatures muſt take up their Eternal Lodging, Matt. xxv. 46. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment.</hi> Mark ix. 43, 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into <hi>the Fire that never ſhall be quenched: where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi> Rev. xiv. 10, 11. <hi>The ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of</hi> GOD, <hi>which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and he ſhall be tormented with Fire and Brimſtone, in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb; and the Smoke of their Torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever; and they have no reſt day nor night.</hi> He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, indeed, ſhall inherit all things: He that is converted and has his Nature changed, ſhall enter into the World of Glory: <hi>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and ſorcerers, and idolaters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all liars, ſhall have their Part in the lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone which is the ſecond Death,</hi> Rev. xxi. 7, 8. See now the Place to which the unconverted muſt go! See the gloomy Landskip of that infernal World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And O, are we not amazed? are we not in Agony, about our eſcape from this Ruin? Who can dwell with devouring Fire? who can dwell with everlaſting Burnings? Is not the Caſe awful and dreadful? And do not our Hearts quiver, and our Souls ſink and die within us? Behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Life and Death ſet before us: Eternal Life, and Eternal Fire; and are they inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Things! O the Madneſs! if they make no Impreſſion upon us. On the one Hand we are informed, <hi>Repent and be converted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and your Sins ſhall be blotted out;</hi> on the other, <hi>Except ye be converted ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Nay, we muſt take up our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Abode in the World of Darkneſs, and Fire, and Chains. Ah! miſerable Caſe of Unconverted Men! Who would not fear, who would not fly their Doom? And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:041920_0010_101B6CAFAEC1E110"/>Shall we not, my Brethren, <hi>labour inſtantly after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> which alone can ſave us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Turn ye, Turn ye, why will ye die.</hi> Conſider the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and debate it with your own Hearts. Converſion begins in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration. <hi>I thought on my ways, and turned my Feet unto thy Teſtimonies,</hi> was the good old way, Pſal. cxix. 59. Let us then go alone, and put the Caſe to our ſelves, <q>Am I converted or not? What Happineſs am I purſuing; a Happineſs in the Creature, or a Happineſs in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD? Can I think that the Poſſeſſion of any Temporal Good can make me Happy? Have I not often made the Experiment already; and have I not as often been diſappointed? And why ſhould I try any more? Is it not high Time for me to <hi>turn about,</hi> and ſee if I cannot find that Happineſs in GOD, which till now I have in vain ſought for in Objects below him?</q> Propoſe theſe Queſtions to your own Souls, and ſee what anſwer your Conſcience will frame upon them.</p>
            <p>Now be convinced that you cannot give this Turn to your ſelves. Learn to feel and be ſenſible how attached to Self and Creatures you are. Mourn it, and confeſs it before GOD, and tell him how undone you are without his Almighty Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Plead with Him, in Tears and Agony, to change your vile Nature: to turn you ſavingly to Himſelf. Be importunate, be reſtleſs till you find this done for you: Till you find a Soul intirely forſaking the Creature and purſuing its whole Satisfaction in GOD alone. 'Till CHRIST appears tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently dear and lovely to you; and you can joyfully leave this World to go to His Arms and his Boſom. This divine and ſaving Turn of Soul, may be given to you, as you are in the Uſe of theſe appointed Means labouring to obtain it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>let thoſe of us who have been converted, live becoming the Change we are under.</hi> Be thankful, be joyful: thankful to the God who has turn'd us, and joyful that we are paſſing to Heaven. Let us labour more and more after the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Temper: Love GOD more; think on him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> work for him, long and wiſh to be with him. If ever we find a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Fondneſs for Creatures after this; if ever we find our Wills going to rebel, or our Deſires tend to this World; let us immediately check the inordinate Affection, and ſay, <q>No. I have renounced theſe long ago. I have choſen
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:041920_0011_101B6CB14AAFC760"/>
GOD for my Portion, and his Will for my Law long ago. GOD forbid, that after having eſcaped the Snare, I ſhould be again taken and entangled therein. No, No, farewell Creatures; no more ſhall you tempt me from my true Happineſs. Farewell the Riches I once coveted; the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe I once graſp'd after; the Pleaſures that looked ſo charming. Farewell Felicity on Earth: and welcome the Will of my GOD: welcome Everlaſting Life. Welcome the Good Things of Earth, which my GOD pleaſes to give me: But adieu all Thoughts of Happineſs in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of theſe. Welcome Afflictions too; the Gifts of my GOD, and the Purchaſe of my SAVIOUR. Shall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Good at his Hands, and not receive Evil? 'Tis the Cup which my Father gives me, why ſhould I not drink it! Other Lords have had Dominion over me: But what have I any more to do with Idols?</q>
            </p>
            <p>And while we are thus awakening the Piety of our own Souls, how ſhould we pity a miſerable World about us? Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Creatures! they know not what this Love to GOD means. They never felt what it was to be reſigned to the Will of GOD, and ſwallowed up in his Love and his Praiſes. They are, as we once were, chained down to Senſe and Creatures; and have no Idea of Converſion and the New Birth. You may talk to them eternally of theſe things; but they diſcern them not: you had as good go to explain the Myſtery of Colours to a Man born blind. Ah, Poor Men! how ſhould we pity and pray for them: How ſhould we contrive to ſhew them their Danger and Miſery; and labour with them to make their eſcape? Remember, <hi>He that converteth a Sinner from the Error of his Way, ſhall ſave a Soul from Death.</hi> Sure we never need envy them the little Good they poſſeſs: But O how ſhould we admire the Free Grace which has diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed us from them! There's no Room for boaſting in the Caſe. 'Tis all ſovereign, and all free: To GOD belongs the Glory; and to us Wonder, and Gratitude, and Humility.</p>
            <p>We draw on towards a Concluſion. And how can we leave off better than with a View of that Heavenly World ſpoken of in the Text? This then ſhall cloſe the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What a Holy and Happy Place is the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> There is not one <hi>ſinful Perſon,</hi> not one <hi>ſinful

Frame</hi> in that World. The Spirits of <hi>Juſt men</hi> are <hi>made perfect</hi> before they are admitted there. Tho' the Good Man <hi>here</hi> loves GOD above all, and chooſes his Portion in him, yet this gracious Temper is often ſhock'd and broken by Temptations and Indwelling Sin. But <hi>There</hi> is no Sin, no Corruption, no Tempter. All the Employment, all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and every Thought is about GOD and his Glories. <hi>Alleluia, for the Lord GOD omnipotent reigneth!</hi> This is the Language, the Temper, the Employment, the Felicity of Heaven. There, they are <hi>fill'd with all the Fulneſs of GOD.</hi> There, <hi>GOD is all in all.</hi> In that happy World, every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, and every Object, glorifies GOD and is filled with his Glory. His Perfections and his Love take them intirely up; and nothing alſo is ſeen, or heard, or thought of. O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, happy State!
