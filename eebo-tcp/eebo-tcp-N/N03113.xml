            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have no particular account of the <hi>bigneſs</hi> of this City It was probably of but ſmall extent: Yet was it ſeated in the midſt of a large, fine and fertile country, from whence they ſupply'd themſelves with all manner of proviſions. The <hi>ſpies</hi> ſent forth

from the <hi>tribe of Dan to ſearch the land,</hi> do therefore unite in that Report about it, v. 9. — <hi>We have ſeen the land, and behold, it is very good.</hi> V. 10. <hi>When ye go, ye ſhall come — to a large land: — a place where there is no want of any thing in the earth.</hi> — But I will not detain you too long upon what is leſs pertinent to the deſign I have in view. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="2">II. WE may now conſider the <hi>character</hi> here given of the <hi>inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of</hi> LAISH. <hi>And they came to</hi> LAISH, <hi>unto a people</hi> that were AT QUIET AND SECURE. We have much the ſame account in v. 7. <hi>They dwelt</hi> CARELESS, — QUIET AND SECURE. That is to ſay, they did not perplex their minds with concern about their enemies; had no ſenſe of danger; were tho't leſs of a ſurpriſe, and without expectation of any ſudden aſſault. Being at peace with their neighbours, and having been ſo, perhaps a long time, they had ſettled into habitual ſecurity, dwelt without fear, and knew no uneaſineſs from an apprehenſion of being liable to be deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>AND as the effect of this careleſs temper, they were ſhamefully negligent of their own ſafety; had taken no care to keep up a <hi>martial ſpirit,</hi> or encourage a knowledge in the <hi>art of war.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they had no <hi>diſciplin'd ſouldiers</hi>; none us'd to <hi>military exerciſes</hi>; none acquainted with the management of the <hi>ſpear,</hi> the <hi>ſword</hi> or <hi>bow</hi>; or that had either skill or courage to <hi>ſpeak with the enemy in the gate.</hi> Or if they were ever ſo <hi>expert</hi> and <hi>valiant,</hi> it was to little purpoſe, having neither <hi>forts</hi> nor <hi>batteries,</hi> nor any other <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> to defend themſelves. Perhaps they had never been at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of erecting <hi>fortifications</hi>; or otherwiſe, they had careleſly ſuffer'd them to fall into ruin, and were now in no poſture of defence. The paſſes into their city were all naked and unguarded; they were altogether unprepared for an attack, and every day lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be ſurpriſed and taken: And yet they were as calm and eaſy, and as ſafe from danger in their own apprehenſions, as tho' they had been ever ſo well guarded; and in circumſtances to defend themſelves againſt the moſt powerful enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003758_0006_1002574A0F780988"/>THIS is the <hi>character</hi> of the <hi>inhabitants of</hi> LAISH: thus careleſs and ſecure were they. And two things are mention'd in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, which might contribute hereto.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THEY had their <hi>dependance</hi> on ZIDON for protection and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Several hints are given from whence we may collect this. In the latter part of my <hi>text,</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>There was no deliverer becauſe it was far from</hi> ZIDON. And in the 7. v. 'tis recorded of the <hi>ſpies,</hi> that <hi>they found it was far from the</hi> ZIDONIANS. It looks as tho' the ZIDONIANS were the great protectors of the LAISHITES; their chief ſtrength and ſecurity. Perhaps they were a COLONY planted from ZIDON, ſtill under their care and juriſdiction. They are ſaid v. 7. to have <hi>dwelt after the manner</hi> of the ZIDONIANS. i. e. They imitated their cuſtoms, and conformed to their way of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; one very natural account whereof is, their having originally ſprang from them. To be ſure, the ZIDONIANS were at amity with them, firmly attacht to their Intereſt, and in readineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage on their behalf againſt all oppoſers.</p>
            <p>Now the ZIDONIANS were a large and powerful people; well able to defend themſelves, and upon <hi>timely notice</hi> to protect the city of LAISH. And upon this account, they might be off their guard, and in their own opinion free from danger. However weak and defenceleſs in themſelves, they were yet eaſy; depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſtrength of ZIDON; not conſidering their <hi>diſtance</hi> from that place; and that they might be ſurpriſed and deſtroyed, before they could call in their aſſiſtance. Perhaps they flattered themſelves, their enemies would not dare attempt an expedition againſt them, while they knew they were the <hi>friends,</hi> and it may be the <hi>Government</hi> of a people ſo powerful as were the ZIDONIANS.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEY <hi>had no Magiſtrate in the land to put them to ſhame in any thing,</hi> as we read in v. 7. There is no need of underſtanding theſe words in the moſt rigid ſenſe, as if there were none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the LAISHITES cloath'd with <hi>civil Authority</hi>; But only that there was wanting a due care in <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to execute the truſt
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003758_0007_1002574BCEF12E18"/>
repos'd in them: One flagrant inſtance whereof, was, their being themſelves eaſie, and ſuffering the People to be ſo too, while their Country lay in a wretched defenceleſs ſtate; expos'd to every invader, and liable to be taken from them. It belong'd to thoſe who were the <hi>heads</hi> of the People, to provide for their ſafety and ſecurity. They ſhould have been ſenſibly touch'd with concern to behold their weak and ſhiftleſs condition, and taken effectual care, by <hi>warlike</hi> preparations, to place them in a poſture of defence. They ſhould have <hi>put the People to ſhame</hi> in conſideration of their faulty eaſe and ſecurity, while naked and unfortify'd; and encouraged their coming into meaſures to ſtrengthen their borders againſt the attempts of their enemies And their not being ſo tho'tful of this as was proper and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was no doubt one great reaſon of their living in ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded circumſtances.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, this careleſsneſs of the <hi>People</hi> of LAISH, was a Character very diſgraceful. 'Tis recorded in my Text to their diſhonour; as an argument of their want of policy, and a due regard to their own ſafety. And 'tis really a reproach to any People, conſidering the luſts of Men, and the wars and fightings every where ariſing in the world here from, to neglect ſecuring themſelves againſt invaders. It was owing to this that LAISH was deſtroy'd. If they had been ſtrengthen'd with walls and bulwarks; if they had encouraged among them a number of <hi>men of valour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in war, that knew how to keep rank</hi> and withſtand an enemy, the DANITES would have been diſcouraged from any attempts againſt them. 'Twas the careleſs, ſecure poſture they were in, that invited them to enter their land; and it muſt be aſcribed chiefly to this, that they ſo eaſily <hi>ſmote them with the edge of the ſword, and burnt their city with fire</hi>: Which leads me,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To conſider the <hi>conqueſt and overthrow of</hi> LAISH. <hi>And they came to</hi> LAISH, — <hi>and ſmote them with the edge of the ſword, and burnt the city with fire.</hi> Two things are here worthy of notice. (1.) The <hi>perſons</hi> making this conqueſt. (2.) The <hi>conqueſt</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003758_0008_1002574F618C3DD8"/>1. THE <hi>perſons</hi> making this conqueſt. And theſe were the DANITES: Not the whole tribe, who, ſo long ago as when they enter'd <hi>Canaan,</hi> were above ſixty thouſand men <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 26.43.</note>; but only a ſmall <hi>regiment</hi> choſen out of the reſt upon this occaſion. They had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as became the ſubtilty of DAN, who was as a <hi>ſerpent by the way</hi>) ſent out <hi>ſpies to ſearch the land,</hi> and inquire into the <hi>poſture of its inhabitants</hi>: And from the account they brought of their ſtrange ſecurity and unguarded condition, they concluded ſix hundred men, <hi>expert</hi> and <hi>valiant,</hi> and well fitted with <hi>weapons of war,</hi> would be ſufficient to make an eaſy prey of them. A ſmall force it ſhou'd ſeem to enter into an enemies country! and this upon a deſign of making themſelves maſters of it: But knowing their circumſtances before hand, that they ſhould find them careleſs and at eaſe, and in no poſture of defence; they wiſely thought a handful of men would be able to ſurprize and take them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>conqueſt</hi> it ſelf. And this was great and ſurprizing. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>they ſmote them with the edge of the ſword,</hi> i. e. the <hi>inhabitants of</hi> LAISH. And this they did, it ſhould ſeem, without limitation or diſtinction. Their eye did not pity, nor their hand ſpare; but they greedily fell upon them, and made a moſt awful and univerſal ſlaughter. As <hi>Iſrael</hi> was commanded to do to <hi>Amalek,</hi> they <hi>ſlew both man and woman, the infant and the ſuckling.</hi> Having drawn the ſword, they did not return it back, till they had deſtroy'd both male and female, the high as well as the low; <hi>the young man and the virgin; the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> alſo, and the man of gray hairs.</hi> A moſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing deſtruction! — O the diſtreſs of the poor frighten'd and amaz'd people! — How bitter were their ſhreiks and cries! — how doleful their dying groans and agonies! — But what ſtill heightens the horror, <hi>the city</hi> was ſet into flames, and conſumed to aſhes. For ſo it follows, <hi>and burnt the city with fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT may look as tho' the DANITES were herein wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their own intereſt. But poſſibly they did this in the heat of battle, when men's tho'ts an't about them, and they are
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003758_0009_10025751D5D73B78"/>
wont to neglect their own future advantage: or which is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, they might <hi>ſet the city on fire,</hi> the more to ſurprize the people, to ſtrike them with the greater terror, that they might obtain a more eaſy conqueſt over them.</p>
            <p>AND in this action of theirs againſt LAISH, we have a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accompliſhment of an ancient <hi>prophecy</hi> concerning <hi>Dan.</hi> We read, Deut. xxxiii. 22. <hi>And of Dan, he ſaid, Dan is a lions whelp.</hi> And in this expedition he prov'd himſelf to be ſo. i.e. He reſembled a fierce and couragious <hi>young lion.</hi> It follows, <hi>He ſhall leap from Baſhan. Dan</hi> had no inheritance near <hi>Baſhan.</hi> The compariſon therefore lies in his being like a <hi>lion leaping on Baſhan.</hi> "'Tis one property of the <hi>lion</hi> to leap upon his prey, and faſten his nails and teeth into it: And ſo did the DANITES ſuddenly leap, as it were from one end of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the other, and ſeize upon the city of LAISH". And no doubt, this is the thing, the <hi>ſpirit of GOD</hi> had in view in this <hi>prophetic</hi> deſcription. And it's a good illuſtration of the jewiſh ſtory, that this event, ſo many hundred years, before its accompliſhment, ſhould be made one of the main ſtrokes in <hi>Dan</hi>'s character.</p>
            <p>BUT here ariſes a queſtion of ſome importance, and that is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HOW could the</hi> DANITES, <hi>without great wickedneſs, barbarity and injuſtice, thus come upon the</hi> LAISHITES, <hi>and totally deſtroy them</hi>?</p>
            <p>IF we conſult our <hi>context,</hi> we ſhall find, the great reaſon of their undertaking this expedition was, that they might have a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Settlement. That which they poſſeſt already was too ſcanty; they were by the <hi>Amorites</hi> pent up into a narrow compaſs: and 'twas this that obliged them to ſeek out for better quarters elſewhere, at leaſt for part of their tribe; and that led them to go up againſt LAISH, having received a favourable report of their land. But where is the juſtice of warring againſt this people, and taking away their lives, that they might ſeize upon their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and inherit their land? What right does the want of a good ſettlement in one people, give them to invade the poſſeſſions and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003758_0010_100257548C596850"/>
deſtroy the lives of another, who are favour'd in this reſpect? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it can convey none at all: and if it was all that could be ſaid in defence of this action of the DANITES, that they <hi>wanted an inheritance,</hi> it would deſerve no better a name than wicked vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; the moſt barefac'd robbery and murder.</p>
            <p>LET it therefore be obſerved,</p>
            <p>THE <hi>whole land of Canaan</hi> (within the bounds of which lay the city of LAISH, with all its territories,) was firmly convey'd by <hi>deed of gift</hi> from the GREAT SOVEREIGN of the World, to ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM, and his POSTERITY, to be their poſſeſſion forever. To this purpoſe we read, Gen. xii. 6, 7. <hi>And</hi> ABRAM <hi>paſſed thro' the land —. And the</hi> CANAANITE <hi>was then in the land. And the</hi> LORD <hi>appeared unto</hi> ABRAM, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> UNTO THY SEED WILL I GIVE THIS LAND. The ſame promiſe is very particularly repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Chap. xiii v. 14, 15. <hi>And the</hi> LORD <hi>ſaid to</hi> ABRAM, — <hi>lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art, northward, and ſouthward, and eaſtward, and weſtward. For all the land which thou ſeeſt,</hi> TO THEE WILL I GIVE IT, AND TO THY SEED FOR EVER. And in the xv. chap. 18. v. we have recorded a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and formal grant of this land. <hi>In that ſame day the</hi> LORD <hi>made a covenant with</hi> ABRAM, <hi>ſaying,</hi> UNTO THY SEED HAVE I GIVEN THIS LAND, <hi>from the river of Egypt, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</hi> And when THE SEED OF ABRAHAM were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied into a great people, we find the bleſſed <hi>GOD</hi> thus beſpeaking them, Exod. vi. 8. <hi>And I will bring you into the land, concerning the which I did ſwear to</hi> GIVE IT, <hi>to Abraham, to Iſaac, and to Jacob; and</hi> I WILL GIVE IT YOU FOR AN HERITAGE. From theſe texts it appears plain, that the <hi>land of Canaan</hi> was given of <hi>GOD</hi> to the <hi>people of Iſrael</hi>; and that the <hi>grant</hi> was ſeveral times repeated in the moſt ample and ſolemn manner.</p>
            <p>Now the infinite GOD having the firſt and moſt abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable title to this whole earth, a grant of any part of it from him muſt convey the beſt and ſureſt claim; a title paramount to all others, and that will remain good againſt every other claim,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003758_0011_100257561223B8F8"/>
how long ſo ever any perſons of any nation or character may have been in poſſeſſion of the land thus convey'd. For all nations as well as particular perſons, originally hold what they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, under <hi>GOD</hi> as maker and Lord-proprietor of the world: and therefore they are at beſt but <hi>tenants at evill</hi>; and he may at his pleaſure make over a right to other perſons: nor may any dare ſay to him, what doeſt thou?</p>
            <p>FROM theſe premiſes, it may be affirm'd, tho' the city of LAISH and the land bordering thereon, were poſſeſt by thoſe who had long been inhabitants of <hi>Canaan</hi>; yet that they were not the <hi>true owners</hi> of what they had in poſſeſſion. The city they liv'd in, and the lands they had under improvement, were the <hi>property</hi> of the <hi>feed of Abraham,</hi> freely granted and confirmed to them from the <hi>great Lord</hi> of the whole earth: and they had a right to enter upon poſſeſſion of what had been thus given them, whenever they ſaw fit. And as the DANITES, who were the <hi>poſterity of Abraham,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>tribes of Iſrael,</hi> were now in want of a good ſettlement, there was no obſtacle in the way of their coming to LAISH, if they were able to conquer and turn them out of their land. And tho' in the doing of this, they might be inſtrumental of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their lives, yet might they warrantably do it: for the <hi>people of Iſrael,</hi> of whom the DANITES were a part, not only had a title to the <hi>land of Canaan</hi> made over to them, but were commanded and encouraged by the great <hi>GOD,</hi> to go and take poſſeſſion of the land, as we may ſee at large, in the firſt chap. of <hi>Joſhua.</hi> And over and above this, they were impower'd to deſtroy the <hi>old inhabitants of the land,</hi> as is plain from a great number of texts, which we are all acquainted with, in the ſeries of the <hi>moſaick</hi> hiſtory. And it looks as if the <hi>ſupreme majeſty</hi> had manifeſted it to be his mind, that <hi>his people Iſrael</hi> ſhould be the <hi>executioners</hi> of his wrath upon the <hi>ſimul inhabitants of Canaan, the meaſure of whoſe iniquity was now full.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE caſe before us is therefore an extraordinary one. What the DANITES did, would in any other people, have been utterly unlawful; a great piece of injuſtice and iniquity: but a warrantable
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003758_0012_10025757ACBBE398"/>
action in them, becauſe the <hi>ſovereign GOD</hi> had vacated the right the <hi>inhabitants of Canaan</hi> had to their poſſeſſions, and convey'd it away from them to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>: and over and above this had conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>this people</hi> his <hi>Deputies,</hi> to puniſh their iniquities, which had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd them for deſtruction.</p>
            <p>NATIONS and cities ſhould learn herefrom the dreadful evil and danger of ſin; and be afraid to go on commiting it, hardening themſelves againſt <hi>GOD,</hi> leaſt he ſhould be provoked in his holy and righteous providence, to bring them to ruin.</p>
            <p>THEY ſhould alſo take heed of encouraging themſelves, from this action of the DANITES, which was out of the common courſe of things to take up arms againſt others. If neceſſitated hereto in order to redreſs Injuries, or defend themſelves when unrighteouſly invaded, or for any other wiſe and good cauſe, they may do well to make uſe of force: 'tis conſonant to the reaſon of things, and perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the laws of our holy religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tho' 'tis contrary to both, for nations to act in conformity to the <hi>pattern</hi> of theſe DANITES, i. e. to make war with a people and take away their properties and lives, without provocation, or having been abus'd by them: unleſs with the <hi>men of Iſrael</hi> they could produce a <hi>warrant from heaven,</hi> to juſtify their <hi>warlike</hi> proceedings. But I muſt not enlarge here, 'tis time we proceed now,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To conſider, <hi>their having no deliverer, becauſe they were far from</hi> ZIDON. Several times in this <hi>chapter</hi> particular notice is taken of the <hi>diſtance</hi> of ZIDON from LAISH. The ſpies from the <hi>tribe of Dan,</hi> preſently got acquainted with this, and ſet a ſpecial mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, v. 7. And no doubt upon their return, this was one encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging article in their report to their brethren. And now that they had gone to LAISH, and taken and deſtroy<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d it, an emphaſis is laid upon this; <hi>there was no deliverer, becauſe they were far from</hi> ZIDON.</p>
            <p>THE leaſt that can be gathered from hence is, whatever was the condition of LAISH, yet that the DANITES were aware of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003758_0013_1002575A27034630"/>
ſtrength of ZIDON: and at the ſame time well appris'd of their being in league with LAISH, and in readineſs (at leaſt if apply'd to herefor) to ſend a ſufficient force to guard and protect them. Their greateſt concern therefore ſeems to have been, to carry on their deſign againſt LAISH <hi>ſo ſecretly,</hi> as that it might not be known, nor if poſſible ſo much as ſuſpected. And this they were under ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to do, by reaſon of the diſtance between LAISH and ZIDON. Theſe two cities were not very remote from each other; yet wer<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they ſo far aſunder, that with due care and caution, the <hi>men of Dan</hi> might come againſt LAISH, without the knowledge of ZIDON. And it was owing to their policy in thus coming againſt them, that they were not diſappointed in their attempt. If they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed their deſign; advanced towards the city by ſlow and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely ſteps, giving warning of their approach; the <hi>men of</hi> LAISH would doubtleſs have had help from ZIDON. But falling upon them ſuddenly, without the ſuſpicion of the ZIDONIANS, and while the LAISHITES themſelves were tho'tleſs of danger, they at once deſtroy'd them: and this, without any <hi>deliverer.</hi> Says my text, <hi>there was no deliverer, becauſe they were far from</hi> ZIDON.</p>
            <p>AND herein appears, in the ſtrongeſt light, the folly of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of LAISH, in ſuffering their city to lie ſo ſhamefully <hi>expos'd</hi> to enemies. Notwithſtanding the ſtrength of ZIDON, and their dependance on them for protection and defence, we ſee they were totally deſtroy'd. And there is <hi>no place</hi> weak and defenceleſs in it ſelf, but is equally liable to be ſurpris'd and taken, let the <hi>power</hi> that is their chief guard and ſafety be ever ſo <hi>formidable,</hi> if it be <hi>at a diſtance.</hi>

            <div type="application">
               <head>THE APPLICATION now remains.</head>
               <p>AND the <hi>uſe</hi> I would make of my <hi>text</hi> ſhall be, to <hi>recommend a due concern and care that our</hi> TOWN <hi>and</hi> LAND <hi>may be both put and kept in a ſutable poſture of defence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF it may not be ſaid of us at preſent, as of the <hi>men of</hi> LAISH, that we are <hi>a people at quiet and ſecure,</hi> 'tis becauſe we have but very

lately awoke out of that deep ſecurity, which ſeem'd univerſally to reign in all parts of the country. To what elſe can it be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd, that ſo little of a <hi>martial ſpirit</hi> has been viſible among us in the days that are not far paſt? ſo ſtrange a neglect to become acquainted with <hi>warlike exerciſes</hi>? ſo ſhameful a diſregard to the appointed days of <hi>muſter,</hi> by <hi>officers</hi> as well as <hi>ſouldiers</hi>? To what elſe can it be attributed, that our <hi>frontiers</hi> have been ſettled in ſo ſcatter'd a manner? and that the people inhabiting them are ſo generally at eaſe, while they lie naked and unguarded, and in caſe of an unexpected aſſault, in no condition to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? And what other account can be given of that miſerable poor ſtate, in which the <hi>chief bulwark</hi> to the whole Province has been reduced? and that the <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Batteries</hi> in <hi>this</hi> and our other <hi>Sea-port</hi> Towns, have been ſuffered gradually to decay, till at length they have fallen to the ground?</p>
               <p>THESE are certainly inſtances of a temper and conduct, as far from reflecting honour upon us, as they proclaim a ſad neglect of our own ſafety. If a number of <hi>Spies</hi> had been ſent from thoſe who wiſh us no good, <hi>to ſearch our land,</hi> and inquire into the poſture of its inhabitants, they muſt with the <hi>Men from the tribe of Dan</hi> when they came to LAISH, have <hi>ſeen the people of the land, how they dwelt careleſs, quiet and ſecure</hi>: And the report they would have made upon their return, muſt have been like that which the <hi>Spies</hi> in my <hi>context</hi> made to their brethren, <hi>Ariſe that we way go up againſt them, for we have ſeen the land, and behold, it is very good.

And being your ſelves thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the <hi>martial art,</hi> we ſhall depend upon your care and fidelity to diffuſe this uſeful knowledge thro' our whole <hi>militia.</hi> And as with great ſtrictneſs you have endeavour'd to know the ſtate of your ſeveral <hi>wards,</hi> how they have been provided with <hi>arms</hi> and <hi>ammunition,</hi> we flatter our ſelves you will take a like care to inſtruct our ſouldiers in the uſe of their <hi>arms</hi>; how to <hi>keep rank,</hi> and with art and eaſe to put &amp; keep themſelves in the beſt poſture as well to <hi>offend</hi> an enemy, as to <hi>defend</hi> themſelves. In order whereto, you will not fail to call them together, as you are impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd: nor upon the appointed ſeaſons of <hi>training,</hi> will you paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the time in <hi>meer appearance</hi>; but employ <hi>your ſouldiers</hi> in ſuch <hi>warlike exerciſes,</hi> as may happily tend to increaſe that <hi>skill</hi> and <hi>valour,</hi> which may fit them for <hi>ſervice,</hi> whenever in the providence of God, you ſhall be call'd to fight for the lives and <hi>properties,</hi> and <hi>cities</hi> of <hi>your country.</hi>

               <p>AND it were to be wiſht, our <hi>ſouldiers</hi> would more generally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their duty upon the known ſeaſons of <hi>muſter.</hi> There is not indeed ſo great a neglect in this regard, as in the days that are not far paſt; nor is the appearance of our <hi>militia</hi> ſo ſhamefully <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>ſhatter'd</hi>: yet it is not ſo <hi>large</hi> and <hi>honorable,</hi> as it might and ought to be. And would it not have a happy tendency to increaſe the number, and inhance the beauty and glory of our <hi>companies,</hi> if perſons of <hi>circumſtances</hi> and <hi>character</hi> would give their attendance? Nor need they be aſham'd to be ſeen in <hi>arms</hi> upon our days of <hi>train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> It would ſoon become reputable, and be eſteem'd an honour,

if <hi>maſters</hi> as well as <hi>ſervants,</hi> if <hi>gentlemen</hi> as well as thoſe in <hi>lower life,</hi> would for a while more generally appear in the <hi>habit of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> upon <hi>military</hi> days. And if nothing elſe will oblige hereto, 'tis pity but the <hi>fines on delinquents</hi> ſhould be increaſed. They are found, as ſtated at preſent, to be inſufficient to anſwer the good end aim at. And we cannot but hope, as there is a wholſome law requiring an <hi>appearance in arms</hi> on days for <hi>training,</hi> care will be taken to guard it with a ſtill heavier penalty: this being a thing ſo reaſonable in it ſelf, and ſo neceſſary to ſupport the honor of a <hi>law,</hi> without a regard to which, our country muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably be in a very unſafe condition.</p>
               <p>AND as we ſeem united in a concern for the ſecurity of the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> in this juncture of affairs, it may be humbly offered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would not tend to our honor as well as the ſafety of our <hi>trade,</hi> which is now become ſo conſiderable, if meaſures were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed in order to our having ſome guard upon our <hi>coaſis.</hi> In caſe of a rupture, we are not likely to ſuffer more in any thing than by rapine and violence on the <hi>ſea.</hi> A certain <hi>harbour</hi> moſt ſtrongly fortified, not many hundred miles from this place, lying in the way of all our veſſels as they go and come upon foreign voyages, will doubtleſs be the reſort of a number of <hi>privateers,</hi> from whence they may run out, and make fearful depredations on us A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not unworthy of our ſerious conſideration: nor is our intereſt more deeply concerned in any one thing. And it looks as tho' we ſhould very much neglect our own ſecurity, if for want of ſome <hi>naval guard,</hi> we ſhould ſuffer it to be in the power of every little <hi>Pickeroon</hi> to make a prey of our veſſels.</p>
               <p>IT may now be expected I ſhould addreſs the HONOURABLE COMPANY, at whoſe deſire I ſtand in this place.</p>

               <p>How ſoon ſuch a day may come upon us <hi>GOD</hi> only knows.

               <p>YOU are by <hi>profeſſion</hi> ſouldiers; and by <hi>charter,</hi> as it were a <hi>ſchool</hi> to teach and propagate the <hi>military art</hi>: wherever therefore in our land, there may be wanting a <hi>warlike ſpirit</hi> and <hi>dexterity,</hi> we may juſtly expect to find it here.

               <p>IN order whereto,</p>
               <p>YOU will no doubt judge it needful to take care, who you admit into your number: being always cautious of thoſe who may have a greater regard to <hi>artillery treats</hi> and a few <hi>legal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions,</hi> than to accompliſh themſelves to ſerve their <hi>king</hi> and <hi>country.</hi>

               <p>WITH ſuch aims we would hope, you have now put on your armour: and we accordingly wiſh you a <hi>bleſſing out of the houſe of the Lord</hi>; commending your <hi>perſons</hi> and the <hi>affairs of this day</hi> to the direction and care of <hi>heaven</hi>; beſeeching the almighty to make you <hi>ſtrong and couragious</hi>; to furniſh you with <hi>martial</hi> skill and good conduct; and ſo every way accompliſh you, as that you may be the <hi>beauty of our Iſrael,</hi> our ſafety and defence.</p>
               <p>AND let nothing be ever ſeen among you, that ſhall ſtain your glory. Always beware of ſin; and arm your ſelves againſt all temptations to it.

               <p>IN fine, forget not your <hi>ſpiritual warfare.</hi> Often think, how many the enemies are that war againſt your ſouls; how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful their ſtrength; how deep their policy; how indefatigable their pains, that they may pain you forever: And O beware of their devices! Always be upon your guard; — and fight couragiouſly for your precious and immortal ſouls.</p>

               <p>ONLY as he has directed, Let us <hi>take to ourſelves the whole armour of God.</hi>—Let us get acquainted with the uſe of thoſe <hi>weapons that are not carnal, but ſpiritual; and mighty thro' God, for pulling down of ſtrong holds.</hi>—Let us take heed of <hi>entangling our ſelves with the affairs of this life, that we may pleaſe him who has choſen us to be ſouldiers.</hi> And <hi>as good ſouldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, let us endure hardneſs.</hi> Let us be <hi>ſober, vigilant, circumſpect.</hi> — And let us <hi>do all</hi> that we can <hi>to ſtand; praying always with all prayer and ſupplications in the ſpirit.</hi>
