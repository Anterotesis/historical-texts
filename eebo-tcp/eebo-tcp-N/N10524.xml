            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>A BOOK without a preface is like a face without a noſe. Let the other features be ever ſo agreeable and well poportioned, it is looked on with deteſtation and horror if this material ornament be wanting.</p>
            <p>Or rather, a book is like a houſe: The grand portico is the dedication; the flagged pavement is an humble addreſs to the reader, in order to <hi>pave</hi> the way for a kind reception of the work; the front door with its fluted pillars, pediment, trigliffs and modillions are the title page with its motto, author's name and titles, date of the year, &amp;c. The entry is the preface (oftentimes of a tedious length) and the ſeveral apartments and cloſets are the chapters and ſections of the work itſelf.</p>
            <p>As I am but a clumſy carpenter at beſt, I ſhall not attempt to decorate my little cottage with any <hi>out of door</hi> ornaments; but as it would be inconvenient and uncomfortable to have my front door open immediately into the apartments of my houſe, I have made this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face by way of entry.</p>
            <p>And now, gentle reader, if you ſhould think my entry too plain and ſimple you may ſet your
<pb facs="unknown:013339_0003_0F8FFC44C6352068"/>
imagination to work, and furniſh it with a grand ſtaircaſe, with cornices, ſtucco and paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. That is, you may ſuppoſe that I entered very unwillingly upon this work, being compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it by a chain of unforeſeen circumſtances: That it was written in the midſt of a great hurry of other buſineſs, and under particular diſadvantages of time and place, and that it was only intended for the inſpection of a few friends, without any expectations of ever ſeeing it in the Preſs.</p>
            <p>You may, kind reader, go on to ſuppoſe that when my friends peruſed my work, they were ſtruck with the energy of my genius, and inſiſted that the public ought not to be deprived of ſuch a fund of amuſement and improvement through my obſtinate modeſty; and that after many ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations and powerful perſuaſions I had been prevailed upon to bleſs mankind with the fruits of my labour.</p>
            <p>Or, if you like not this, you may ſuppoſe that the following ſheets were found in the cabinet of ſome deceaſed gentleman; or that they were dug out of an ancient ruins, or diſcovered in a Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit's Cave, or dropped from the clouds in a hail ſtorm. In ſhort, you may ſuppoſe juſt what you pleaſe. And when, by the help of imagination, you have ſeaſoned the preface to your palate, you may turn over this leaf, and feaſt upon the body of the work itſelf.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>ONCE upon a time, a great while ago, there lived a certain Nobleman, who had long poſſeſſed a very valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble farm, and had a great number of children and grandchildren.</p>
               <p>BESIDES the annual profits of his land, which were very conſiderable, he kept a large ſhop of goods; and being very ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in trade, he became, in proceſs of time, exceeding rich and powerful; inſomuch that all his neighbours feared and reſpected him.</p>
               <p>WITH reſpect to the management of his family, it was thought he had adopted the moſt perfect mode that could be deviſed, for he had been at the pains to examine the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of all his neighbours, and had ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their plans all ſuch parts as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be equitable and beneficial, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe which from experience were found
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013339_0005_0F90552AA82924A8"/>
to be inconvenient. Or rather, by blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſeveral conſtitutions together he had ſo ingeniouſly counterbalanced the evils of one mode of government with the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of another, that the advantages were richly enjoyed, and the inconveniencies ſcarcely felt. In ſhort, his family was thought to be the beſt ordered of any in his neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>HE never exerciſed any undue authority over his children or ſervants; neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could he oppreſs them if he was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; for it was particularly covenanted in his marriage articles that he ſhould not at any time impoſe any taſks or hardſhips whatever upon his children without the free conſent of his wife.</p>
               <p>NOW the cuſtom in his family was this, that at the end of every ſeven years his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage became of courſe null and void; at which time his children and grandchildren met together and choſe another wife for him, whom the old gentleman was obliged to marry under the ſame articles and reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as before. If his late wife had conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf, during her ſeven years marriage, with mildneſs, diſcretion, and integrity, ſhe was re-elected; if otherwiſe, depoſed: By which means the chidren had always a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013339_0006_0F90552D24723728"/>
great intereſt in their mother in law; and through her, a reaſonable check upon their father's temper. For beſides that he could do nothing material reſpecting his children without her approbation, ſhe was ſole miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the purſe ſtrings; and gave him out, from time to time, ſuch ſums of money as ſhe thought neceſſary for the expences of his family.</p>
               <p>BEING one day in a very extraordinary good humour, he gave his children a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his hand and ſeal, by which he releaſed them from many badges of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and confirmed to them ſeveral very important privileges. The chief were the two following, viz. That none of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be puniſhed for any offence, or ſuppoſed offence, until his brethren had firſt declared him worthy of ſuch puniſhment; and ſecondly, he gave freſh aſſurances that he would impoſe no hardſhips upon them without the conſent of their mother in law.</p>
               <p>THIS writing, on account of its ſingular importance, was called THE GREAT PAPER. After it was executed with the utmoſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, he cauſed his Chaplain to publiſh a dire <hi>Anathema</hi> against all who ſhould attempt to violate the articles of the <hi>Great Paper,</hi> in the words following.</p>

               <p>NOW it came to paſs that this Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had, by ſome means or other, obtained a right to an immenſe tract of wild uncultivated country at a vaſt diſtance from his manſion houſe. But he ſet little ſtore by this acquiſition, as it yielded him no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, nor was it likely to do ſo, being not only difficult of acceſs on account of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but was alſo overrun with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wild beaſts very fierce and ſavage; ſo that it would be extremely dangerous to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt taking poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>IN proceſs of time, however, ſome of his children, more ſtout and enterpriſing than the reſt, requeſted leave of their father to go and ſettle on this diſtant tract of land. Leave was readily obtained; but before they ſet out certain agreements were ſtipulated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them—the principal were—the old Gentleman, on his part, engaged to protect and defend the adventurers in their new ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements; to aſſiſt them in chacing away the wild beaſts, and to extend to them all the benefits of the government under which they were born: Aſſuring them that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſhould be removed ſo far from his preſence they ſhould nevertheleſs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013339_0009_0F90553073DDAA08"/>
as the children of his family, and treated accordingly. At the ſame time he gave each of them a bond for the faithful performance of theſe promiſes; in which, among other things, it was covenanted that they ſhould, each of them in their ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, have a liberty of making ſuch rules and regulations for their own good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they ſhould find convenient; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided theſe rules and regulations ſhould not contradict or be inconſiſtent with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtanding orders eſtabliſhed in his farm.</p>
               <p>IN return for theſe favours he inſiſted that they, on their parts, ſhould at all times ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be their father; that they ſhould not deal with their neighbours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave, but ſend to his ſhop only for ſuch merchandize as they ſhould want. But in order to enable them to pay for ſuch goods as they ſhould purchaſe, they were permitted to ſell the produce of their lands to certain of his neighbours.</p>
               <p>THESE preliminaries being duly adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our adventurers bid adieu to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and conveniencies of their father's houſe, and ſet off on their journey.—Many and great were the difficulties they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on their way: But many more and much greater had they to combat on their

arrival in the new country. Here they found nothing but wild nature. Mountains overgrown with inacceſſible ſoliage, and plains ſteeped in ſtagnated waters. Their ears are no longer attentive to the repeated ſtrokes of induſtrious labour, and the buſy hum of men, inſtead of theſe, the roaring tempeſt and inceſſant howlings of the beaſts of prey fill their minds with horror and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may. The needful comforts of life are no longer in their power—no friendly roof to ſhelter them from inclement ſkies; no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs to protect them from ſurrounding dangers. Unaccuſtomed as they were to hardſhips like theſe, ſome were cut off by ſickneſs and diſeaſe, and others ſnatched away by the hands of barbarity. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan however, with great perſeverance, to clear the land of encumbering rubbiſh, and the woods reſound with the ſtrokes of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; they drain the waters from the ſedged moraſs, and pour the ſun beams on the reek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoil; they are forced to exerciſe all the powers of induſtry and oeconomy for bare ſubſiſtence, and like their firſt parent, when driven from Paradiſe, to earn their bread with the ſweat of their brows. In this work they were frequently interrupted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of the wild beaſts, againſt whom they defended themſelves with heroic prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs and magnanimity.</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:013339_0011_0F90553160990050"/>AFTER ſometime, however, by dint of indefatigable perſeverance, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves comfortably ſettled in this new farm; and had the delightful proſpect of vaſt tracts of land waving with luxuriant harveſts, and perfuming the air with delicious fruits, which before had been a dreary wilderneſs, unfit for the habitation of men.</p>
               <p>IN the mean time they kept up a conſtant correſpondence with their father's family, and at a great expence provided waggons, horſes and drivers to bring from his ſhop ſuch goods and merchandize as they wanted, for which they paid out of the produce of their lands.</p>

               <p>NOW the new ſettlers had adopted a mode of government in their ſeveral families ſimilar to that their father had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the old farm; in taking a new wife at the end of certain periods of time; which wife was choſen for them by their children, and without whoſe conſent they could do nothing material in the conduct of their affairs. Under theſe circumſtances they thrived exceedingly, and became very numerous; living in great harmony amongſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013339_0012_0F905532813E92B0"/>
themſelves, and in conſtitutional obedience to their father and his wife.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING their ſucceſsful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, however, they were frequently annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the wild beaſts, which were not yet expelled the country; and were moreover troubled by ſome of their neighbours who wanted to drive them off the land, and take poſſeſſion of it themſelves.</p>
               <p>TO aſſiſt them in theſe difficulties, and protect them from danger, the old Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſent over ſeveral of his ſervants, who with the help of the new ſettlers drove away their enemies. But then he required that they ſhould reimburſe him for the expence and trouble he was at in their behalf; this they did with great chearfulneſs, by applying from time to time to their reſpective wives, who always commanded their caſh.</p>
               <p>THUS did matters go on for a conſiderable time, to their mutual happineſs and benefit. But now the Nobleman's wife began to caſt an avaricious eye upon the new ſettlers; ſaying to herſelf, if by the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their intercourſe with us my wealth and power are ſo much increaſed, how much more would they accumulate if I can perſuade them that all they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013339_0013_0F905533D0C716F8"/>
to us, and therefore I may at any time demand from them ſuch part of their earnings as I pleaſe. At the ſame time ſhe was fully ſenſible of the promiſes and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments her huſband had made when they left the old farm, and the tenor and purport of the <hi>great paper.</hi> She therefore thought it neceſſary to proceed with great caution and art, and endeavoured to gain her point by imperceptible ſteps.</p>
               <p>IN order to this, ſhe firſt iſſued an edict ſetting forth, That whereas the tailors of her family were greatly injured by the people of the new farm, inaſmuch as they preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make their own clothes whereby the ſaid tailors were deprived of the benefit of their cuſtom; it was therefore ordained that for the future the new ſettlers ſhould not be permitted to have amongſt them any ſhears or ſciſſars larger than a certain fixed ſize. In conſequence of this, our adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers were compelled to have their clothes made by their father's tailors: But out of regard to the old gentleman, they patiently ſubmitted to this grievance.</p>
               <p>ENCOURAGED by this ſucceſs, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in her plan. Obſerving that the new ſettlers, were very fond of a particular kind of cyder which they purchaſed of a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013339_0014_0F9055345A52C8E8"/>
neighbour who was in friendiſhp with their father (the apples proper for making this cyder not growing on their own farm) ſhe publiſhed another edict, obliging them to pay her a certain ſtipend for every barrel of cyder uſed in their families! To this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſubmitted: Not yet ſeeing the ſcope of her deſigns againſt them.</p>
               <p>AFTER this manner ſhe proceeded, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing taxes on them on various pretences, and receiving the fruits of their induſtry with both hands. Moreover ſhe perſuaded her huſband to ſend amongſt them from time to time a number of the moſt lazy and uſeleſs of his ſervants, under the ſpecious, pretext of defending them in their ſettlements and of aſſiſting to deſtroy the wild beaſts; but in fact to rid his own houſe of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, not having employment for them; and at the ſame time to be a watch and a check upon the people of the new farm.</p>
               <p>IT was likewiſe ordered that theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors as they were called, ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with bread and butter cut in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular form: But the head of one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies refuſed to comply with this order. He engaged to give the gueſts, thus forced upon him, bread and butter ſufficient; but inſiſted that his wife ſhould have the liberty of cutting it in what ſhape ſhe pleaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013339_0015_0F90553745F51DB0"/>THIS put the old Nobleman into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion, inſomuch that he had his ſon's wife put into gaol for preſuming to cut her loaf otherwiſe than as had been directed.</p>

               <p>AS the old Gentleman advanced in years he began to neglect the affairs of his family, leaving them chiefly to the management of his ſteward. Now the ſteward had debauched his wife, and by that means gained an entire aſcendancy over her. She no longer deliberated what would moſt benefit either the old farm or the new; but ſaid and did whatever the ſteward pleaſed. Nay ſo much was ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by him that ſhe could neither utter <hi>Ay</hi> or <hi>No</hi> but as he directed. For he had cunningly perſuaded her that it was very faſhionable for women to wear padlocks on their lips, and that he was ſure they would become her exceedingly. He therefore faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened a padlock to each corner of her mouth; when the one was open, ſhe could only ſay <hi>Ay</hi>; and when the other was looſed, could only cry <hi>No.</hi> He took care to keep the keys of theſe locks himſelf; ſo that her will became entirely ſubject to his power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:013339_0016_0F90553761D34D40"/>NOW the old Lady and the ſteward had ſet themſelves againſt the people of the new farm; and began to deviſe ways and means to impoveriſh and diſtreſs them.</p>
               <p>THEY prevailed on the Nobleman to ſign an edict againſt the new ſettlers, in which it was declared that it was their duty as children to pay ſomething towards the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their fathers table with proviſions, and to the ſupporting the dignity of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; for that purpoſe it was ordained that all their ſpoons, knives and forks, plates and porringers, ſhould be marked with a certain mark, by officers appointed for that end; for which marking they were to pay a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtipend: and that they ſhould not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſevere penalties, preſume to make uſe of any ſpoon, knife or fork, plate or porringer, before it had been ſo marked, and the ſaid ſtipend paid to the officer.</p>
               <p>THE inhabitants of the new farm began to ſee that their father's affections were alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from them; and that their mother was but a baſe mother-in-law debauched by their enemy the ſteward. They were thrown into great confuſion and diſtreſs. They wrote the moſt ſupplicating letters to the old Gentleman, in which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him to be their father in terms of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013339_0017_0F90553911612C48"/>
greateſt reſpect and affection—they recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him the hardſhips and dfficulties they had ſuffered in ſettling his new farm; and pointed out the great addition of wealth and power his family had acquired by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of that wilderneſs; and ſhewed him that all the fruits of their labours muſt in the natural courſe of things unite, in the long run, in his money box. They alſo, in humble terms reminded him of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and engagements on their leaving home, and of the bonds he had given them; of the ſolemnity and importance of the <hi>Great Paper</hi> with the curſe annexed. They acknowledged that he ought to be reimburſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the expences he was at on their account, and that it was their duty to aſſiſt in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dignity of his family. All this they declared they were ready and willing to do; but requeſted that they might do it agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the purport of the <hi>Great Paper,</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to their ſeveral wives for the keys of their money boxes and furniſhing him from thence; and not to be ſubject to the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and caprice of an avaricious mother-in-law, whom they had never choſen, and of a ſteward who was their declared enemy.</p>
               <p>SOME of theſe letters were intercepted by the ſteward; others were delivered to the old Gentleman, who was at the ſame time
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013339_0018_0F905539A1EB9800"/>
perſuaded to take no notice of them; but, on the contrary, to inſiſt the more ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon the right his wife claimed of marking their ſpoons, knives and forks, plates and porringers.</p>
               <p>THE new ſettlers obſerving how matters were conducted in their father's family be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came exceedingly diſtreſſed and mortified. They met together and agreed one and all that they would no longer ſubmit to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary impoſitions of their mother-in-law, and their enemy the ſteward. They deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to pay no manner of regard to the new decree, conſidering it as a violation of the <hi>Great Paper.</hi> But to go on and eat their broth and pudding as uſual. The cooks alſo and butlers ſerved up their ſpoons, knives and forks, plates and porrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers without having them marked by the new officers.</p>
               <p>THE Nobleman at length thought fit to reverſe the order which had been made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſpoons, knives and forks, plates and porringers of the new ſettlers. But he did this with a very ill grace: for he, at the ſame time avowed and declared that he and his wife had a right to mark all their furniture, if they pleaſed, from the ſilver tankard down to the very chamber pots: that as he was their father he had an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013339_0019_0F90553A5D718578"/>
controul over them, and that their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, lives, and properties were at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire diſpoſal of him and his wife: that it was not fit that he who was allowed to be <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, immortal,</hi> and <hi>incapable of error,</hi> ſhould be confined by the ſhackles of the <hi>Great Paper</hi>; or obliged to fulfil the bonds he had given them, which he averred he had a right to cancel whenever he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>HIS wife alſo became intoxicated with vanity. The ſteward had told her that ſhe was an <hi>omnipotent</hi> Goddeſs, and ought to be worſhipped as ſuch: that it was the height of impudence and diſobedience in the new ſettlers to diſpute her authority, which with reſpect to them, was unlimited: that as they had removed from their father's family, they had forfeited all pretenſions of being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as his children, and loſt the privileges of the <hi>Great Paper</hi>: that, therefore, ſhe might look on them only as tenants at will upon her huſband's farm, and exact from them what rent ſhe pleaſed.</p>
               <p>ALL this was perfectly agreeable to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, who admitted this new doctrine in its full ſenſe.</p>
               <p>THE people of the new farm however took little notice of theſe pompous declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013339_0020_0F90553B1DF3D4D8"/>
They were glad the marking decree was reverſed, and were in hopes that things would gradually ſettle into their former channel.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>IN the mean time the new ſettlers increaſed exceedingly, and as they increaſed, their dealings at their father's ſhop were propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably enlarged.</p>
               <p>IT is true they ſuffered ſome inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from the protectors that had been ſent amongſt them, who became very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in their houſes: They ſeduced their daughters; introduced riot and intemperance into their families, and derided and inſulted the orders and regulations they had made for their own good government. Moreover the old Nobleman had ſent amongſt them a great number of thieves, raviſhers and murderers, who did a great deal of miſchief by practiſing thoſe crimes for which they had been baniſhed the old farm. But they bore theſe grievances with as much patience as could be expected; not choſing to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their aged father with complaints, unleſs in caſes of important neceſſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:013339_0021_0F90553BF05371D8"/>NOW the ſteward continued to hate the new ſettlers with exceeding great hatred, and determined to renew his attack upon their peace and happineſs. He artfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated to the old Gentleman and his fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh wife, that it was very mean and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in them to receive the contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people of the new farm, towards ſupporting the dignity of his family, through the hands of their reſpective wives: that upon this footing it would be in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to refuſe his requiſitions whenever they ſhould be thought to be unreaſonable, of which they would pretend to be judges themſelves; and that it was high time they ſhould be compelled to acknowledge his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power, and his wife's <hi>Omnipotence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOR this purpoſe, another decree was prepared and publiſhed, ordering that the new ſettlers ſhould pay a certain ſtipend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particular goods, which they were not allowed to purchaſe any where but at their father's ſhop; and that this ſtipend ſhould not be deemed an advance upon the original price of the goods, but be paid on their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at the new farm, for the expreſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſupporting the dignity of the old Gentleman's family, and of defraying the expences he affected to afford them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:013339_0022_0F90553D5E479258"/>THIS new decree gave our adventurers the utmoſt uneaſineſs. They ſaw that the ſteward and their mother-in-law were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to oppreſs and enſlave them. They again met together and wrote to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as before, the moſt humble and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive letters; but to little purpoſe: A deaf ear was turned to all their remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and their dutiful requeſts treated with contempt.</p>
               <p>FINDING this moderate and decent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct brought them no relief, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to another expedient. They bound themſelves in a ſolemn engagement not to deal any more at their father's ſhop until this unconſtitutional decree ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed; which they declared to be a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Great Paper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS agreement was ſo ſtrictly adhered to, that in a few months the clerks and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices in the old Gentleman's ſhop began to make a ſad outcry. They declared that their maſter's trade was declining exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and that his wife and ſteward would, by their miſchievious machinations, ruin the whole farm; they forthwith ſharpened their pens and attacked the ſteward, and even the old Lady herſelf with great ſeverity. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it was thought proper to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013339_0023_0F90553D811D1090"/>
this attempt likewiſe upon the rights and liberties of the new ſettlers. One part only of the new decree remained unreverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—viz. the tax upon <hi>Water Gruel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW there were certain men on the old farm who had obtained from the Nobleman an excluſive right of ſelling <hi>Water Gruel.</hi> Vaſt quantities of this <hi>Gruel</hi> were vended amongſt the new ſettlers; for it became very faſhionable for them to uſe it in their families in great abundance. They did not however trouble themſelves much about the tax on <hi>Water Gruel</hi>: they were well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the reverſal of the other parts of the decree, and conſidering <hi>Gruel</hi> as not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the comfort of life, they were determined to endeavour to do without it, and by that means avoid the remaining effects of the new decree.</p>
               <p>THE ſteward found his deſigns once more fruſtrated; but was not diſcouraged by this diſappointment. He formed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcheme ſo artfully contrived that he thought himſelf ſure of ſucceſs. He ſent for the perſons who had the ſole right of vending <hi>Water Gruel,</hi> and after reminding them of the obligations they were under to the Nobleman and his wife for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive privilege, he deſired that they would
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013339_0024_0F90553E1A61FF70"/>
ſend ſundry waggon loads of <hi>Gruel</hi> to the new farm, promiſing that the accuſtomed duty which they paid for their excluſive right ſhould be taken off from all the <hi>Gruel</hi> they ſhould ſend amongſt the new ſettlers: And that in caſe their cargoes ſhould come to any damage, he would take care that the loſs ſhould be repaired out of the old Gentleman's coffers.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Gruel</hi> merchants readily conſented to this propoſal, knowing that if their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes were ſold, they would reap conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profits; and if they failed, the ſteward was to make good the damage. On the other hand the ſteward concluded that the new ſettlers could not reſiſt purchaſing the <hi>Gruel</hi> to which they had been ſo long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed; and if they did purchaſe it when ſubject to the tax aforeſaid, this would be an avowed acknowledgment on their parts that their father and his wife had a right to break through the tenor of the <hi>Great Paper,</hi> and to lay on them what impoſitions they pleaſed, without the conſent of their reſpective wives.</p>
               <p>BUT the new ſettlers were well aware of this decoy. They ſaw clearly that the <hi>Gruel</hi> was not ſent to accommodate, but to enſlave them; and that if they ſuffered any
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013339_0025_0F9055409938B5F8"/>
part of it to be ſold amongſt them, it would be deemed a ſubmiſſion to the aſſumed <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence</hi> of the <hi>Great Madam.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>ON the arrival of the <hi>Water Gruel,</hi> the people of the new farm were again thrown into great alarms and confuſions. Some of them would not ſuffer the waggons to be unloaded at all, but ſent them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately back to the <hi>Gruel</hi> merchants: others permitted the waggons to unload, but would not touch the hateful commodity; ſo that it lay neglected about their roads and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways until it grew ſour and ſpoiled. But one of the new ſettlers, whoſe name was <hi>Jack,</hi> either from a keener ſenſe of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries attempted againſt him, or from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his ſituation, which was ſuch that he could not ſend back the <hi>Gruel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a number of mercenaries whom his father had ſtationed before his houſe to watch and be a check upon his conduct: he, I ſay, being almoſt driven to diſpair, fell to work, and with great zeal ſtove to pieces the caſks of <hi>Gruel,</hi> which had been ſent him, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly demoliſhed the whole cargoe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:013339_0026_0F905541D4C98C68"/>THESE proceedings were ſoon known at the old farm. Great and terrible was the uproar there. The old Gentleman fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great wrath, declaring that his abſent children meant to throw off all dependence upon him, and to become altogether diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. His wife alſo tore the padlocks from her lips, and raved and ſtormed like a Billinſgate. The ſteward loſt all patience and moderation, ſwearing moſt prophanely that he would leave no ſtone unturned 'till he had <hi>humbled the ſettlers of the new farm at his feet,</hi> and cauſed their father to trample on their necks. Moreover the <hi>Gruel</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants roared and bellowed for the loſs of their <hi>Gruel</hi>; and the clerks and apprentices were in the utmoſt conſternation leſt the people of the new farm ſhould again agree to have no dealings with their father's ſhop. —Vengeance was immediately ſet on foot particularly againſt <hi>Jack.</hi> With him they determined to begin; hoping that by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an example of him they ſhould ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the other families of the new ſettlers, that they would all ſubmit to the deſigns of the ſteward, and the <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of the old Lady.</p>
               <p>A VERY large <hi>Padlock</hi> was, accordingly, prepared to be faſtened upon <hi>Jack's</hi> great gate; the key of which was to be given to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013339_0027_0F905541F078B4E8"/>
the old Gentleman; who was not to open it again until he had paid for the <hi>Gruel</hi> he had ſpilt, and reſigned all claim to the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the <hi>Great Paper</hi>: nor then neither unleſs he thought fit. Secondly, a decree was made to new model the regulations and oeconomy of <hi>Jack's</hi> family in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they might for the future be more ſubject to the will of the ſteward: and, thirdly, a large gallows was erected before the manſion houſe in the old farm, and an order made that if any of <hi>Jack's</hi> children or ſervants ſhould be ſuſpected of miſbehaviour, they ſhould not be convicted or acquitted by the conſent of their brethren, agreeable to the purport of the <hi>Great Paper,</hi> but be tied neck and heels and dragged to the gallows at the manſion houſe, and there be hanged withot mercy.</p>
               <p>NO ſooner did tidings of this undue ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity reach the new farm, but the people were almoſt ready to diſpair. They were altogether at a loſs how to act, or by what means they ſhould avert the vengeance to which they were doomed: but the old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſteward ſoon determined the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the <hi>Padlock</hi> was ſent over, and without ceremony faſtened upon <hi>Jack</hi>'s great gate. They did not wait to know whether he would pay for the <hi>Gruel</hi> or not, or make the requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

acknowledgments; nor give him the leaſt opportunity to make his defence— The great gate was locked, and the key given to the old Nobleman, as had been determined.</p>
               <p>POOR <hi>Jack</hi> found himſelf in a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition. The great inlet to his farm was entirely blocked up, ſo that he could neither carry out the produce of his land for ſale, nor receive from abroad the neceſſaries for his family.</p>
               <p>BUT this was not all—His father, along with the <hi>Padlock</hi> aforeſaid, had ſent an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer to hector and domineer over him and his family; and to endeavour to break his ſpirit by exerciſing every poſſible ſeverity: for which purpoſe he was attended by a great number of mercenaries, and armed with more than common authorities.</p>
               <p>ON his firſt arrival in <hi>Jack</hi>'s family he was received with conſiderable reſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the delegate of their aged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for, notwithſtanding all that had paſt, the people of the new ſettlements loved and revered the old Gentleman with a truly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial attachment: attributing his unkindneſs entirely to the intrigues of their enemy the ſteward. But this fair weather did not laſt

long. The new overſeer took the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhewing that he had no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of living in harmony and friendſhip with the family. Some of <hi>Jack</hi>'s domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks had put on their Sunday clothes, and attended the overſeer in the great parlour, in order to pay him their compliments on his arrival, and to requeſt his aſſiſtance in reconciling them to their father: but he rudely ſtopped them ſhort in the midſt of their ſpeech; called them a parcel of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſcoundrels, and bid them go about their buſineſs. So ſaying, he turned upon his heel, and with great contempt left the room.</p>

               <p>NOW <hi>Jack</hi> and his family finding themſelves oppreſſed, inſulted, and tyranniſed over in the moſt cruel and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary manner, adviſed with their brethren what meaſures ſhould be adopted to relieve them from their intolerable grievances. Their brethren, one and all, united in ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſing with their afflictions; they adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to bear their ſufferings with forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for a time, aſſuring them that they looked on the puniſhments and inſults laid

upon them with the ſame indignation as if they had been inflicted on themſelves, and that they would ſtand by and ſupport them to the laſt. But, above all, earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it to them to be firm and ſteady in the cauſe of liberty and juſtice, and never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of their mother-in-law; nor yield to the machinations of their enemy the ſteward.</p>
               <p>IN the mean time, leſt <hi>Jack</hi>'s family ſhould ſuffer for want of neceſſaries, their great gate being faſt locked, liberal and very generous contributions were raiſed among the ſeveral families of the new ſettlements for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent relief. This ſeaſonable bounty was handed to <hi>Jack</hi> over the garden wall—all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the front of his houſe being ſhut up.</p>
               <p>NOW the overſeer obſerved that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and domeſticks of <hi>Jack</hi>'s family had frequent meetings and conſultations toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſometimes in the garret, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the ſtable: underſtanding, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that an agreement not to deal in their father's ſhop, until their grievances ſhould be redreſſed, was much talked of amongſt them, he wrote a thundering prohibition, much like a Pope's Bull, which he cauſed to be paſted up in every room of the houſe: in which he declared and proteſted that theſe

meetings were treaſonable, traiterous, and rebellious; contrary to the dignity of their father, and inconſiſtent with the <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> of their mother-in-law: denouncing alſo terrible puniſhments againſt any two of the family who ſhould from thenceforth be ſeen whiſpering together, and ſtrictly forbidding the domeſticks to hold any more meetings in the garret or ſtable.</p>
               <p>THESE harſh and unconſtitutional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings irritated <hi>Jack</hi> and the other inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the new farm to ſuch a degree that</p>
