            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have Read the Account you ſent me of the State of your Town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> (which in many particulars, agrees to the whole Province, as well as to your Town, &amp; may indeed be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the State of <hi>New-England</hi> in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.) The late Pamphlets on that Subject diſcover plainly eno' the diſtreſſing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we are fallen into, tho' I don't perceive they have been at all Succeſsful to relieve us in the great thing complained of, <hi>viz.</hi> The want of a ſufficient Medium to carry on the Trade, of the Town and Country; But on the contrary, what was ſuggeſted in them for that end, has produced a quite different Effect, and occaſioned much Contention.</p>
            <p>It is unhappy, when Perſons who are concern'd in one common Diſtreſs, can't conſult their own Intereſt, and declare their Minds freely upon it, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Offence to one another. And when men ſuffer themſelves to be thus put out of Temper, they are in no good Condition either to give or take Counſel.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen who have Printed their Thoughts on this Occaſion, do (as far as I can diſcern) deſire to ſee their Country in a Flouriſhing Trade, &amp; Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Condition, as they have ſeen it formerly; They differ indeed in their Conjectures about the Meaſures proper to be taken at this Juncture for this End; But its much to be Lamented, that Gentlemen who deſire the good of their Country, can't declare their differing ſentiments, about the beſt Means to promote it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling under the Diſpleaſure of thoſe whom they
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002169_0003_0FBC79B393D6A8B8"/>
ſtudy to ſerve. This tends to Diſcourage our beſt Friends from lending us their Aſſiſtance when we want it moſt. If a man that candidly ſpeaks his Mind, &amp; declares what he Judges fitteſt to be done, under any Difficulty, which he ſuffers in common with others, muſt for that reaſon be treated with Diſreſpect and Anger, he'l be tempted to conclude its much better for him, to ſuſtain his ſhare of the Calamity, in Silence.</p>
            <p>As far as I am able to obſerve, from what has been Publiſhed relating to the Relief ſo much deſired, the principal Controverſy in this Matter, is, whether the Emitting more Bills of Credit, or the calling in thoſe that are Extant, will beſt anſwer that end?</p>
            <p>Some are of Opinion that the Emitting of more Bills, either by the Publick, or by Private Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, would be the propereſt way to revive our Trade, and recover us out of our preſent Languiſhing Circumſtances:</p>
            <p>Others, on the contrary, are of Opinion, that the Emitting of more Bills in ſuch manner, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Augment our Diſtreſs; and they are therefore for calling in thoſe that are out, as ſoon as may be; and Emitting no more.</p>
            <p>And each Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty, tenaciouſly adhearing to their own Sentiments, and firmly believing their own Method the Propereſt, to Extricate us out of our preſent Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, are under ſtrong Temptations to look on all that oppoſe their ſeveral Schemes, as Obſtructions of the Publick Good, and treat them accordingly. While they themſelves alſo, at the ſame time, are requited with the ſame hard Meaſure.</p>
            <p>But this Anger is I think Unreaſonable, &amp; without any juſt Occaſion; for although theſe Opinions ſeem Repugnant, yet if we could be perſwaded to conſider them (&amp; the reaſons by which they are ſupported)
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002169_0004_0FBC79B55905A3C0"/>
calmly, and be cool in our Reflections upon them, we might probably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a way to Reconcile them, &amp; ſhew how they may be underſtood &amp; improved to that Common Good, which both parties aim at; &amp; even perſwade the Diſſenting Gentlemen themſelves to be of one mind, in the manner of promoting it.</p>
            <p>This is what I truly deſire. Tho' I muſt confeſs I ſhould be loth to write my mind ſo freely on this Subject, if I were not well aſſured of your Candour. Who ever undertakes the part of a Mediator, where the Contention between the Parties is at all warm, may expect to be encountred with Prejudices from both ſides; But I fear nothing of ſuch a Kind, from a Gentleman of Your Wiſdom and Temper. I am ſatisfied that whatever Favour You have for either of theſe Opinions, it will not be unacceptable to You, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ſee that a good Uſe may be made of them both;</p>
            <p>And this is what I aim at; My Deſign is to avoid entirely, what may appear in the form of Oppoſition, or tend to overſet either of theſe differing Opinions, and only to conſider, Whether there are not certain Principles which both Parties will agree to, and which may well be Improved to unite them firmly in one and the ſame Meaſure, for promoting the Publick Intereſt.</p>
            <p>And if it ſhould prove that I am miſtaken in my Thoughts, or deceived in my Hopes, yet to attempt what is ſo Deſireable, as it can't give any juſt ground of Offence to any, ſo I am ſure, it will never be taken ſo by You.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore obſerve here a few things, which I take to be beyond Diſpute &amp; ſerviceable to the end which I propoſe, and ſubmit them to your better Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002169_0005_0FBC79B68B487938"/>
In the firſt Place. It will eaſily be granted, that</p>
            <p>Trade or Commerce is neceſſary to a peoples Proſperity, or Flouriſhing in the World. This, ſome of your late W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ters. lay much weight on; from hence they urge the neceſſity of being provided with a Medium for carrying it on; And if others ſeem to ſpeak of Trade as a Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us, it muſt be underſtood only with reſpect to ſome Circumſtances which attend ours in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as, (for Inſtance) our carrying it to a degree beyond what we are able to manage; Which is as I ſuppoſe, what they mean by our Overtrading; Or our giving to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> long a Credit, whereby people that are never like to Pay, are Tempted to run in Debt: Or becauſe its Managed moſtly by a Credit which is not Supported as it ought to be; and is therefore vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and raiſed or depreſſed as Managers happen to meet with Chapmen. But it would be unfair to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them as real Enemies to our Commerce.</p>
            <p>No Country has within it ſelf every thing Uſeful and conducive to the common Flouriſhing and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of its Inhabitants. Many things will be wanting, eſpecially in new Settlements (as ours may in many Regards be conſidered) for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and Comfort of Perſons, which things muſt be ſupplyed from other Places; and that ſupply muſt ordinarily be by Trade.</p>
            <p>And the ſame holds true, of perſons in the ſame Country, who by the means of Commerce must ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply each other, with what one wants and another has: Providence has ſo Eſtabliſh'd the State of Mankind, that the World in General, or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Country in ſpecial, can't Flouriſh and be Proſperous, without ſuch a mutual Communication of Goods, or Uſeful Commodities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002169_0006_0FBC79B7F9437838"/>
Again,</p>
            <p>To the carrying on this neceſſary Commerce, ſome proper Medium muſt be made uſe of. It is not abſolutely Impoſſible but that it may be done by Barter, or exchanging of one Commodity for another; but ſince the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Money, that method has been much laid aſide; and Money has been Univerſally Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived &amp; Improved, as the (moſt ſuitable) Medium, for carrying on of Trade, between Perſons &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. This I think is a Point uncontroverted. That ſteady value which the general eſteem of Men has put upon Silver, (Intrinſecally conſidered) and its aptneſs to be formed (as it has been by Authority,) into ſuitable pieces, of greater and leſſer Quantities, and thoſe of a Determinate Value, eaſy to be known, has rendred it the moſt agreeable Medium, by which to rate the Value of all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, and to be made uſe of in purchaſing the ſame. And 'tis as unqueſtionable, that</p>
            <p>The Trade of any Country muſt be Supported by the Produce of it. The only ſolid Foundation which any Country has to erect a Trade upon, are ſuch Commodities as may be ſpared from their own Occaſions, and exported to ſupply the Wants of other Places. Whether thoſe Commodities are of the Growth or Produce of ſuch Country, or imported from other Countries, at ſuch a cheap rate, that they may be exported again &amp; Sold to Advantage.</p>
            <p>But generally, The Trade of any Country is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by its own proper Produce, <hi>i. e.</hi> By ſuch Effects as are raiſed, or Manufactures which are wrought therein. And its no leſs certain,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002169_0007_0FBC79B98DE79200"/>
That,</p>
            <p>What ever Trade is Managed in any Country to Advantage, the Export muſt exceed the Import. When the Produce of any Country is ſo conſiderable that the Exportation of it, exceeds the Value of what Goods are Imported from other Places, and conſumed in it, ſuch Country will have that Overplus, or Ballance of its Trade in Caſh. When our G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, Proviſion, Furr, Lumber, Fiſh, or any kind of Manufacture, or what we can raiſe either on the Land, or out of the Water, and can export to other Parts, exceeds in Value all the Goods from other Places, which we have Occaſion to Buy and Conſume, the Ballance of Trade will be ſo much in Caſh to our Advantage. On the contrary, when the Import is more in Value than our Export, the Ballance will be to our Diſadvantage, ſo much as that exceeds this; If we want European or any other Goods, in ſuch a Degree, that all the Produce of our Country, which we can ſpare, is not Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to it, we ſhall be ſo much more in Debt, than we can Pay with our Produce; And this Ballance muſt be Paid in Money.</p>
            <p>I may here alſo Obſerve, That</p>
            <p>The Medium of Trade, does Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow Trade, and is Gained by it. Such Countries as can't Produce the matter of this Medium, <hi>viz.</hi> Silver, out of their own Bowels, have ordinarily no way to ſupply themſelves with it, but by their own Produce. And when any Country can afford the Commodities, wanted in other Places, at ſuch a Rate, that thoſe who Improve themſelves in Trade, can purchaſe them with Money and Export them to Advantage, their own Intereſt will put
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002169_0008_0FBC79BC92E71898"/>
them upon bringing Money into ſuch a Country for that end.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>The Medium of Trade, or Money, thus brought into a Country, will remain there in a Sufficient Plenty for its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Occaſions, ſo long as the Ballance of their Trade is in their Favour, <hi>i. e.</hi> So long as ſuch Country does not Purchaſe &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume more forreign Goods, than it vends of its own.</p>
            <p>And hence it follows, That</p>
            <p>The Diligence and Frugality of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is Neceſſary to Preſerve the Trade of any Country, in ſuch a State of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to themſelves. No Country can hope to be in a Flouriſhing Condition, when the People of it are not Diligent in their Buſineſs, or don't govern themſelves as to their Expences, ſo as not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their Produce or Income; for ſo much as they exceed that, they will be in Debt: and that Debt may in time exceed the value even of their Real Eſtates, &amp; Reduce them to be worſe than nothing. This ſhews, that the Diſcourſe of thoſe Gentlemen, who are for retrenching our needleſs, Extravagant Expences, as one neceſſary part of the Project, to remedy our preſent Diſtreſs, is very reaſonable. Nothing can be more Obvious, than that thoſe whoſe Expences are greater than their Gains muſt needs in time be Reduced to Penury; though the beſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of Trade be never ſo plenty among them. We
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002169_0009_0FBC79BE00145708"/>
ought therefore to conſider, what our diligent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and good Huſbandry will afford us, and be ſure to keep within thoſe Bounds, in our Apparel. Buildings, Tables, Funerals, and every Article of Expence. For if by any Methods we ſpend more than we Gain, we are not like to eſcape the Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Poverty.</p>
            <p>It muſt be conſidered alſo, That</p>
            <p>A Diligent and Frugal People may ſometimes be in great want of Money. Their Circumſtances may be ſuch, that their Intereſt and Preſervation may demand on a Sudden, a greater Sum, than they can poſſibly furniſh themſelves with at the time. So it ſometimes happens in War, when their all may ly at Stake, and they muſt do their utmoſt to ſave themſelves. Such a Defence may put them to ſo great a Charge, that a Sum of Money ſufficient to defray it, can't be Collected at the time, tho' their Eſtates are worth very much more and they are well able in proceſs of Time to produce a much greater Sum; And ſo it may happen on other Occaſions; as, for the carrying on of ſome great and uſeful Works, or profitable Manufactures, or for purchaſing ſome great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which would be of general Benefit to them for Generations to come.</p>
            <p>And certainly</p>
            <p>In ſuch Caſes as theſe, it may be very Prudent for ſuch a People to make uſe of their Credit. <hi>i. e.</hi> To ſupply ſuch Urgent Occaſions, with their BILLS or BONDS, whereby they oblige themſelves to raiſe and Pay the Sum
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002169_0010_0FBC79BFA14C5A60"/>
of Money which they want, in ſome Convenient time. This PUBLICK CREDIT, if it be good, (<hi>i. e.</hi> if there be no doubt but that ſuch a People are well able to raiſe, &amp; will Honeſtly Pay the Money, by the time,) will ſupply the want of Money, and furniſh them with what they need as effectually, as the Money it ſelf. It would be the undoubted Intereſt of particular Perſons, to furniſh the Publick with Money, or any thing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they have Occaſion for, on their Credit thus good and undoubted.</p>
            <p>Of this Nature ſome of our Publick bills are eſteemed to be, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe that have been Emitted for the Payment of Publick Debts. (And for that reaſon I ſuppoſe ſome Gentlemen ſpeak of the Bills themſelves, as a Medium of Trade,) becauſe they ſupply the Want of Money; though I think what they intend therein, has been miſtaken by many; as if they meant another Medium, clear and diſtinct from Money; Whereas I don't take them to intend, that Money is not, properly ſpeaking, the Medium of Trade. For we ſtill reckon the Value of every thing we Trade in, by <hi>Pounds, Shillings, &amp; Pence;</hi> Which Terms are Denominations, or Names of ſeveral Pieces of Money; and theſe Names are conſtantly uſed in Trade to expreſs the worth of any Merchandiſe; Money therefore abides the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, by which the Prices of the Goods we Trade in, are computed and expreſſed. And when we uſe our Publick Bills in Payment, it is a Trading for Money <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ill, though that Money is not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Paid, but by a certain time, for which the Bill given in Payment is (<hi>or ought to be</hi>) a good Security. And he that takes the Bill in Payment, is aſſured, that if he has that Bill at the time ſet for the Payment of it, he ſhall if he pleaſe have its Value in Money. Whence its evident that theſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002169_0011_0FBC79C14DF453A0"/>
Publick Bills, are really of the ſame Nature with the Bill or Bond of a Private Perſon, of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Credit, that every one would take his Bill for <hi>Twenty,</hi> or <hi>Forty Shillings,</hi> or any other Sum as ſoon as ſo much Money. Becauſe that Bill is ſuch a Security for the Money, as he dares rely upon; and which he is aſſured will not fail him.</p>
            <p>But then we muſt always remember, That</p>
            <p>When any Neceſſity or Conſideration whatſoever, puts a Country on making uſe of their Credit in want of Money, ſuch Credit ought to be very punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Supported. And to the Support of this Credit, Two things muſt neceſſarily be evident to all that ſhall have any Occaſion to depend upon it.</p>
            <p>As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Ability of ſuch a Country, to anſwer by the time, all the Bills they have given, if it be demanded of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Integrity and Honeſty of ſuch a Country, that as They are well able, ſo They will certainly be as good as their Word; and keep time punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with all that have truſted them, and taken their Bills, in payment.</p>
            <p>If either of theſe be Suſpected, their Credit will Sink; and if ſuch a Country don't remove all juſt grounds of ſuch Suſpition, their Credit will lower as that Suſpition riſes, &amp; when it has paſſed thro many Degrees of Contempt, will come to nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002169_0012_0FBC79C2F29D3AC8"/>
Further,</p>
            <p>The Supporting of ſuch a Publick Credit, is neither Impracticable, nor a matter of meer Prudence only, or purely Arbitrary, which may be done or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected at Pleaſure, but ſuch Credit can and ought to be Supported. I ſay it can, becauſe its ſuppoſed in this caſe that ſuch a Country has a Sufficient Eſtate, &amp; can fulfil all its Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now for ſuch a Country to ſuffer their Credit to be Diminiſhed, or ſink, ſo that perhaps <hi>Twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> in their Credit, will be no better in Trade to thoſe that have it, than <hi>Fourteen,</hi> or <hi>Twelve,</hi> or <hi>Ten Shillings</hi> in <hi>Money,</hi> is not only to deal Falſly, and be worſe than their Word, but its alſo a great wrong to multitudes; For ſome perſons, muſt neceſſarily looſe or ſuffer as much wrong, as the <hi>Publick Credit</hi> becomes worſe than <hi>Money.</hi> Wherefore this Credit ought in Juſtice to be Supported; and wilfully to ſuffer it to Sink, is to be guilty of great Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jury to many, and particularly to all Publick Miniſters and Creditors, as alſo to Widows &amp; Orphans, whoſe Intereſt &amp; Protection ought to be Conſulted.</p>
            <p>To this I may add, That</p>
            <p>When the Publick Credit, ſo made uſe of, is well ſupported, it can't be Injurious. For if the Publick Bills Emitted are kept up to their full Value during the whole time of their Circulation, whoever takes them at the Value of their Denomination, &amp; gives for them, what he would Sell for ſo much <hi>Money,</hi> may immediately
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002169_0013_0FBC79C3F63A6688"/>
make the ſame uſe of them himſelf; And ſo may every one who ſucceſſively receives them, till the time of their Circulation is up, and there is <hi>Money</hi> to anſwer them, to all that deſire it.</p>
            <p>Let now the <hi>Publick Bills of Credit</hi> be thus Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, which They ought to be, and will be, if we can but convince thoſe that have occaſion to receive them in Trade, that we are not more in Debt than we are worth, and that we will honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pay our Debts, and I can ſee no harm in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the Deſire of thoſe Gentlemen, who are for Emitting more Bills, for preſent Uſe, if there ſhould by any means happen a ſcarcity of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of Trade,</hi> or <hi>Money,</hi> among us; and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, They don't ſeem to deſire it.</p>
            <p>I will add this one Thing more.</p>
            <p>If any particular Perſons have occaſion to take up Money on Uſe, I don't ſee why the Publick in ſuch caſe may not ſupply them, by lending the Publick Credit, when Money is not to be had. And if during ſuch Loan, the <hi>Publick</hi> will Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Credit they lend, ſo that it may hold its value in Trade, and be as good as <hi>Money,</hi> I don't ſee but They may juſtly receive the ſame Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the loan of this <hi>Credit,</hi> as they might for lending the like Sum in <hi>Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Gentlemen therefore, who declare againſt Emitting more Bills on Loan; or, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ſame Thing, againſt the Country's lending their Credit, muſt be underſtood, only, in Caſe the <hi>Publick Credit</hi> ſhould remain under its preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002169_0014_0FBC79C649852DF8"/>
and not be reſtored to its juſt Eſteem as it may, and in Juſtice, Ought. For in ſuch Caſe, Every one may be ſenſible, that to increaſe the Number of Bills of Credit, would be a great Miſchief, and certainly increaſe the Wrong which many ſuffer by their being already ſo greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraged.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Publick Credit</hi> as often as it is made Uſe of, either in paying of Debts or in Loan, be Supported, and kept up to its juſt Value, ſo that it will in Trade anſwer the End, and be as Uſeful as <hi>Money,</hi> I ſuppoſe no Gentlemen would take Offence at a more Extenſive Improvement of it; or think it an Injury for the Country to make ſuch a Loan of their Credit, to any perſons that can make a good Uſe of it. Eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that tho' the Perſons that Borrow it, deſign to improve it to their own particular Advantage, Yet if they ſucceed in their deſign, as its to be hoped They may, it will at laſt redound to the Publick Advantage;</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Conſiderations, I think thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who have differed ſo much in their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, about ſupplying at this Juncture the want or ſcarcity of the Medium of Trade, may well be Reconciled.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p>Whether we do, or do not, make any further Uſe of the <hi>Publick Credit,</hi> certainly it concerns us to hearken to what is ſo earneſtly inſiſted on by many Gentlemen; the retrenching Our Expences, that They may not exceed our Gains; or that our Import may not be greater than our Export; without which we muſt needs be greatly diſtreſſed, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en undone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002169_0015_0FBC79C883E94C08"/>
And, Thoſe who are for calling in all the Bills of Credit emitted, by the time ſet for it, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Danger be gratified, Provided the Publick does but ſupply, what want we may be in of Caſh, by Emitting more Bills of Credit.</p>
            <p>And, Thoſe who think it very neceſſary at this Juncture, that the Government ſhould ſtill make uſe of their Credit, both to Pay their Debts, &amp; to ſerve other Emergencies, may ſafely be gratifyed. Provided effectual care be taken to ſupport ſuch Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, the whole time it is made uſe of.</p>
            <p>Nay even, Thoſe that Favour a Private Bank or Credit, rather than a Publick one, may for ought I know be gratifyed without Danger, provided it be under ſuch a Publick Regulation, as would ſatisfy all, that the Bills of ſuch a Private Bank ſhould be upheld in Trade, and be made as uſeful as Money, during the Convenient time ſet for their Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that when ſuch time is expired, thoſe that have any ſuch Bank Bills in their Poſſeſſion, may if they pleaſe exchange them for Money.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the chief thing neceſſary, that whatever Credit there may be Occaſion to make uſe of, it ſhould be ſupported in ſuch an eſteem and Uſefulneſs as it ought to have in Trade, that is to ſay (at leaſt) equal to Money during the whole time of its Circulation. That this is practicable appears from what has been ſaid already; againſt the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it no man can reaſonably Object. And were this once done, we ſhould ſoon ſee an end of the Contention about Emitting more Bills. For, Then no man would have any juſt reaſon to fear,</p>
            <p>Either, That the Bills would be hoarded up, more than Caſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002169_0016_0FBC79CA20CBA140"/>
Or, That our Credit would be extended too far;</p>
            <p>Or, That our Bills would be Improved for any longer time, than till our Ordinary Occaſions of Trade &amp; Expence, may well enough be Supplyed, with ſuch a Stock of Money, as by our Diligence &amp; Good Huſbandry, we may procure.</p>
            <p>Becauſe, When ſuch a Stock is attained, there will then be no neceſſary Occaſion for Improving Credit any longer in ſuch a manner.</p>
            <p>Wherefore thoſe Gentlemen who have differed in their Sentiments, about Emitting more Bills, &amp; calling in thoſe that are Emitted, would I am perſwaded find themſelves well ſatisfied, in any fair &amp; reaſonable Project, to reſtore &amp; keep in good Credit the Bills Improved in Trade, ſo that they ſhould be of Value equal to Money; until ſuch time as we might be furniſhed with a Sufficiency of Money, to ſupply our Ordinary Occaſions, and to carry on a Trade, within the Compaſs of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch an one as does not exceed what we are able to ſpare out of our own produce, for the carrying of it on;</p>
            <p>Eſpecially conſidering that when the Bills of Credit are reſtored to the Value of Money; a much leſs Quantity of them would ſuffice for theſe Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
            <p>And I can't ſee but They muſt on both ſides find themſelves diſappointed at laſt, if there ſhould be no care taken to revive the Credit of Our Bills, but they are ſuffered to remain under the preſent diſadvantage, and increaſing Diſcount.</p>
            <p>For, Suppoſe No more Bills be emitted, and thoſe that are out, be drawn in as faſt as may be, by
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002169_0017_0FBC79CB74FA6890"/>
Sueing the Mortgages on which the moſt of them are Lent, then indeed the Mortgagers may many of them looſe their Eſtates, but They that happen to have the Bills in their keeping, may be as far as ever from receiving either Money, or Money's worth, for them. For as there never was any <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Proviſion</hi> made for the drawing in thoſe loan Bills by a Common Rate; or having Money in the Treaſury to Ballance againſt them; ſo neither can thoſe that have them, be ſure of having any part of the Mortgaged Eſtates in Exchange for them. When the Publick has ſued the Mortgages and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Eſtates, who can tell what they may think good to do with them? Some have thought that when the Mortgagers have paid by Intereſt, the Value of the principal, the principal will be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them; and if ſo, there may then be no Mortgaged Eſtates, for theſe Gentlemen to take in Exchange for their Bills; or (which is the ſame thing) to purchaſe with thoſe Bills, if they reſerve them for that end.</p>
            <p>This project of Remiſſion ſome may think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, but it may not ſeem ſo to others, who may poſſibly have a great Influence in the ordering of that Affair.</p>
            <p>Or if it ſhould, yet they may think it fair to leaſe thoſe Eſtates to the Mortgagers with Condition of Redemption in ſome convenient time; ſince it may ſeem hard in ſuch a caſe if no time of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be allowed. Or</p>
            <p>It may be thought neceſſary to Sell them for <hi>Money</hi> only. Theſe are things which may appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in a quite different View, to the Government, both at Home, &amp; Here, than they do now to us.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002169_0018_0FBC79CFA4E338D8"/>
Upon all which accounts it may not be ſo ſafe for any Gentlemen, who may reſerve ſuch Bills by them, to Flatter themſelves, that they ſhall ever be able to exchange them, for Moneys worth, (or their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in Money) unleſs the Credit of them be Reſtored &amp; Eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be ſuppoſed, that when the Mortgaged Eſtates are Recovered, the Government muſt then call in by Rate all the outſtanding Bills, or Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Money in ſtead of them; and that then there would be Money in the Treaſury to Exchange for them.</p>
            <p>This Suppoſition is as Uncertain as any of the former. Thoſe that may be then in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be of another Mind.</p>
            <p>There is no Proviſion of ſuch kind made by any Act of the Government, whereby They ſtand engaged ſo to do; Which, If it had been deſign'd at laſt, would probably have been declared at firſt. Yea, The Contrary ſeems to be implied by the Acts for the Loan of Bills; for it does not appear by thoſe Acts, that Thoſe Bills were to have any Credit, but what the Mortgages gave them; Which men might rely upon as They ſaw Good.</p>
            <p>Its pretty remarkable, that many who pleaſe themſelves with this Conceit, that the Government muſt at laſt, (if Suing the Mortgages don't bring in the Bills) take this Method, and provide that all the Outſtanding Bills ſhould within a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time be drawn into the Treaſury by Rate, or Money inſtead of them; are nevertheleſs utterly againſt the ſame Project, when its propoſed as a preſent method to recover the Credit of our Bills even to the Value of Money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002169_0019_0FBC79D1CEAE1268"/>
But, How can ſuch Gentlemen who are diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from making this Attempt now, imagine, that Thoſe who are in the Adminiſtration when the Mortgages are Sued out, will be perſwaded to do the ſame thing on a Puſh, which muſt needs be much more difficult, and a far greater burthen on the People. If there be any Reaſon for it, Yet it does not ſeem ſo fair for Us to think, that thoſe who come after Us, if they can help it, will put themſelves to greater Difficulties to pay the Debts we have contracted, than ever We were willing to do our ſelves.</p>
            <p>It ſeems therefore that tho' no more Bills ſhould be Emitted, it is of great Conſequence that the Credit of thoſe that are now Extant ſhould be reſtored and maintained during the whole time of their Circulation.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, if no Care be taken to revive the Credit of our Bills, what Satisfaction can we take, in the Emiſſion of More? When it is ſo manifest that the Diſcount which is come on thoſe that are already emitted, and which has been the Occaſion of ſo much Unrighteouſneſs, and great wrong to many, will thereby be increaſed!</p>
            <p>I will make but one Remark more, which ſhall be</p>
            <p>Upon the Caſe of thoſe that have taken up Bills on Loan. Which many begin to look upon with Concern. Their Eſtates are Mortgaged; And if the Bills that are Extant, are (as ſome think) in Hands which reſerve them, for ſome conſiderable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſo that the Mortgagers can by no means procure them, to Redeem their Eſtates, They will in a little time be forfeited:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002169_0020_0FBC79D2F837A9A0"/>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of a Mortgage given to a private perſon, it would be look'd on as a Hardſhip, if the Mortgagees ſhould take Advantage of the Mortgagors, and eject them out of their Land, as ſoon as the time ſet in their Mortgages is expired. Nor is this ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily done. The Mortgagees don't think much (having good Security for their <hi>Money</hi>) to allow many Years after the time is up, to the Mortgagors, to procure the <hi>Money</hi> and ſave their Eſtates; and this is thought but a reaſonable Favour, provided the Mortgagors duely pay the Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Whereas, as ſoon as the Mortgages made to the Publick are forfeited, they muſt its concluded, be Sued out immediately; this being the way propoſed to bring the Bills into the Treaſury, and keep them from ſinking into the laſt Contempt.</p>
            <p>But if our Bills of Credit, were reſtored to be as good as <hi>Money,</hi> men would ſoon unlock their Hoards, &amp; make uſe of the Bills they keep by them. By which means the Mortgagors might be able to procure what they want to redeem their Eſtates; And if they ſhould not be able to do it by the time ſet in the Mortgages, the Publick might, as well as any Private Perſon, allow them more time for it, and not put them to the Extremity of Redeeming their Eſtates now or never. For if during ſuch time, the Credit of our Bills be kept up to a Par with <hi>Money,</hi> as they may &amp; ought to be, No Perſon could be Injured by ſuch a Favour to the Owners of the Mortgaged Eſtates, or have the leaſt reaſon to be troubled at it.</p>
            <p>To me therefore, it ſeems, as if the reſtoring &amp; upholding our Bills of Credit to their juſt Value, would be an excellent means to put an End to theſe Controverſies, and give every one Content. Then,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002169_0021_0FBC79D498639B48"/>
If a ſuitable Quantity of Bills ſhould be Emitted, They would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            <p>But, Its to be hoped that by this reviving the Credit of our Bills, We ſhould in a little time, and by eaſy Degrees, extricate our Selves out of thoſe Difficulties which at preſent bear ſo hard upon Us.
