            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But it ſeems not long, before this happy Scene was changed. Thro' the Subtilty of the old Serpent, Man was prevailed upon to rebel againſt his Maker, and break that ſacred Covenant which included his Poſterity, and bro't himſelf, with his numerous Race, deſcending from him by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Generation, under the terrible Sentence of Death: upon which, Man was immediately driven out of the earthly Paradiſe, and his Return was guarded with the flaming Sword, which turneth every Way, to keep the Tree of Life.

come, had not a merciful GOD, out of his infinite Wiſdom and Grace, laid a ſure Foundation in his Son, for the Pardon of the Guilty, and reſtoring them to his Favor, and making them happy in the Enjoyment of himſelf forever. This Way of Salvation God was pleaſed to make known unto Adam in that early Promiſe, that the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's Head. And he was pleaſed to unfold this Miſtery of divine Grace, more and more, until the Fullneſs of the Time was come, that this glorious Savior ſhould make his Appearance in this World, and reveal his marvelous Grace fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goſpel Diſpenſation.

Teachers may preach; yet the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the eternal Son of GOD, who was choſen of the Father, elect and precious, is the only Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Salvation of Sinners; all the Bleſſings of Providence and Grace, of a civil and religious Nature, come to us in and through him. Here many important Truths might be brought under our Conſideration; but I ſhall confine my Diſcourſe to a few Particulars under theſe general Heads:
<list>
                  <item>I. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of the Pardon and Salvation of Sinners.</item>
                  <item>II. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government.</item>
                  <item>III. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of the wiſe and good Government eſtabliſhed in his Church.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of the Pardon and Salvation of Sinners. When we view the human Race fallen in Adam, their public and federal Head lying under the amazing Threatning of Death, which included in it all the Miſeries of a temporal and ſpiritual Death, and the Pains of Hell forever. Horror and Deſpair muſt have ſeized the Guilty; had not GOD, out of his own free and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Grace, provided a Way for the Pardon and Redemption of Sinners, in and thro' his Son the Lord JESUS CHRIST. When we conſider this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Miſtery of divine Grace, opened unto us in the ſacred Oracles of GOD, it ſeems like Life from the Dead. Here the ſacred and adorable Trinity are repreſented doing their Part, in this marvelous Method of divine Grace, in bringing about the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Sinners; and here JESUS CHRIST lays as the Foundation;—which may be illuſtrated in a few Particulars.</p>

1. JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation, as he becomes our Surety in the Covenant of Redemption made between the Father and the Son. The Covenant of Redemption was that eternal Compact made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son, concerning the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Sinners, in which the Father makes great and precious Promiſes to his Son, that he would furniſh him for, aſſiſt him in, and give him Succeſs in this important Undertaking, Iſai. xlii. at the Beginning. And the Son engages to ſecure the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honor, and procure Salvation for all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Covenant. The great Immanuel ſays, <hi>Lo I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> do thy Will, O God.</hi> Heb. x. 7. In this Covenant we may conceive the Father addreſſing his Son in ſome ſuch Language as this—"My Son, behold here the Poſterity of fallen Adam, who have utterly undone themſelves by Sin, and my Juſtice requires Satisfaction, and if it takes Place on them, they will be miſerable to all Eternity. What can be done for their Salvation? I am willing to admit a Surety." The Son replies, "O my Father, ſuch is my Compaſſion for theſe miſerable Sinners, I will undertake for them, I will be their Surety, I will do and ſuffer for them all your Juſtice demands." The Father ſays, "If you undertake for them, my Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you muſt expect no Favor on Account of your being my only and beloved Son; it will coſt you dear." The Son anſwers, "I am content to bear any Thing. Tho' I muſt leave thy Throne, thy Boſom, and vail my Glory in the Fleſh—tho' I muſt ſuffer thy Wrath, which will fill me with the utmoſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs in Soul and Body; yet ſuch is my Love, I am willing to tread the Wine-preſs of thy Wrath alone, that theſe poor, ſinful, helpleſs Creatures might
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010605_0007_0F80EFD26911C370"/>
be pardoned, and reſtored to thy Favor, and be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the Enjoyment of Thee forever." Thus we may conceive the Father and the Son ſtipulating with each other, and coming into mutual Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to do what was requiſite to lay a ſure Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for the Salvation of Sinners. This Compact which was made in the Days of Eternity, is open'd unto us in the Covenant of Grace. Which brings me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation, as he is the Mediator of the Covenant of Grace made between GOD and Man. The Covenant of Redemption made between the Father and the Son, opened the Way for the Covenant of Grace to be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſinful Children of Men. This Covenant contains in it all that Sinners need to reſtore them again to the Favor of God, that they might be happy in the Enjoyment of him. In this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the glorious Mediator is exhibited, diſplaying the moſt ſurprizing Condeſcention, in the miſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Union of the divine and human Nature, in the Perſon of the Mediator: <hi>For God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> Gal. iv. 4, 5. And being made under the Law, he did, as Mediator fulfil the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and yield that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which the Law required of Sinners, which they were not able to perform, and ſo is become the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to them that believe, Rom. x. 4. He has alſo ſuffered the full Curſe of the Law due unto Sinners, and made compleat Satisfaction to divine Juſtice; that GOD can, conſiſtent with his glorious Perfections, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſave Sinners. Rom. iii. 26. And now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010605_0008_0F80EFD3179F1E80"/>
and Remiſſion of Sins are preached in His Name. The Terms of our Acceptance with GOD, are plainly propounded in the Goſpel; we muſt have Repentance towards GOD, and Faith in the Lord JESUS CHRIST—that Faith which unites us to him, and makes us Partakers of him; and being in CHRIST, no more any Condemnation belongs to us. Rom. viii. 1. We are made new Creatures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto GOD, adopted into his Family, and have Aſſurance of his Grace, to qualify us for, and bring us finally unto Glory; ſo that we may well ſay, <hi>There is no other Name given under Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we can be ſaved, but Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator has prepared the Way for the ſolemn tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting of the Covenant of Grace, which we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of in ſome ſuch Way as this,</p>
            <p n="1">1. CHRIST the Mediator, ſays to GOD the Father, <hi>"Lo, O Father! I have done thy Will.</hi>—The Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Law required of theſe Sinners, which they were not able to perform, I have fulfiled; the Sentence of Death that was out againſt theſe Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I have ſuffered for their Sakes; this, Father, was what you required of me, in Order to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Now, Father, glorify thy Grace on theſe periſhing Sinners, for my Sake be reconciled unto them, and receive them into thy peculiar Favor."—The glorious Mediator ſays to poor Sinners, "Now freely accept me for your Savior, upon my own Terms—receive me by Faith, for the Lord your Righteouſneſs; rely on the Merit of my Blood, to purge you from all Sin, and reſtore you to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of GOD; then how aggravated ſoever your Sins have been, and how deſperate ſoever your Caſe may appear in your own Eyes, yet I am able to ſave
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010605_0009_0F80EFD3D909F920"/>
you to the uttermoſt, all you who will come to GOD, in and thro' me."</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Covenant of Grace, the Father ſays to Sinners, "The Price my Son has paid by his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Life, his cruel Sufferings and Death, is to my full Satisfaction: I am willing to acquit you from Condemnation, and receive you into my Favor, and make you my Sons, and beſtow upon you all thoſe precious Gifts and Graces, which will fit and qualify you for Heaven and Happineſs. I delight, ſays GOD, to glorify my Grace in this Way of your Converſion and Salvation. O, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners! Why will you remain obſtinate and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? Why will you die, when I ſtand with open Arms, full of Grace and Mercy, to receive you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Embraces, and beſtow upon you all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Covenant of Grace?"</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Sinner viewing the Covenant of Grace, with divine Light let into his Soul, with Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on replies, "O, what Manner of Love is this! Not that I loved GOD, but he firſt loved me, and gave his Son to die for me. Here is a Savior exactly ſuited to my ſad Caſe; and the Terms of GOD'S accepting me, in CHRIST, are reaſonable and good: I will therefore, by the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, take GOD the Father, for my GOD and Father, in JESUS CHRIST, and take the Lord JESUS CHRIST for my Savior and Redeemer, upon his own Terms. I will take the HOLY SPIRIT for my Inſtructor and Sanctifier, that the whole Work of Grace may be carried on in me, to the Glory of GOD the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." Thus, the Covenant of Grace is propounded by GOD to Sinners, thro' the Mediator, and complied with by poor Sinners; and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010605_0010_0F80EFD5197FEC70"/>
the Terms of Peace and Reconciliation are ſettled again between GOD and Man, thro' CHRIST, as the Foundation of their Salvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation, as he doth by the Holy Spirit, apply the Redemption he had purchaſed, unto the Soul of Sinners, and brings them up to the Terms, and makes them Partakers of all the Bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace.—The bleſſed Spirit, the third Perſon in the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Trinity, applies the Redemption purchaſed by CHRIST unto poor Sinners, and ſo makes them Partakers of the precious Benefits of the Covenant of Grace, of which CHRIST is the Foundation. This important Work is ſometimes, in Scripture, aſcribed to the Father, John vi. 14. <hi>No Man cometh unto me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> Sometimes it is aſcribed to the Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> John xii. 32. <hi>And I</hi> (ſays the Redeemer) <hi>if I be lifted up from the Earth, will draw all Men unto me.</hi> But it is empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically applied to the Holy Ghoſt as a Work proper for him in the Salvation of Sinners: And therefore CHRIST aſſures his Diſciples, that when he ſhould leave them, and go unto the Father, he would ſend the Comforter, the Holy Spirit unto them, John xvi. 7. <hi>If I go not away, the Comforter</hi> (which means the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>will not come unto you; but if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, I will ſend him unto you;</hi> not only to endue you with Power from on High, to furniſh you for extraordinary Services in his Church; but effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call and ſanctify all them who ſhall be ſaved. <hi>He ſhall glorify me</hi> (ſays CHRIST) <hi>for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> John xvi. 14. He ſhall open the Doctrines of Grace in a powerful and ſaving Light; and apply the Merits of Chriſt with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010605_0011_0F80EFD5746AA3E0"/>
ſuch a divine Energy, that Sinners are ſaid to be regenerated and born again, of the Spirit. Joh iii. 6. The Holy Spirit, in bringing Sinners to Salvation by JESUS CHRIST, always applies the Redemption pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by CHRIST, by working Faith in them, and thereby uniting them to CHRIST, in their effectual Calling. Here I ſhall a little enlarge, in ſhewing how the Spirit works upon the Hearts of Sinners, in bringing them up to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, in applying the Redemption purchaſed by CHRIST.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In convincing them of their Sin and Miſery, and ſo making them in Earneſt for Salvation. The firſt Work of the Spirit upon the Hearts of Sinners, is to enlighten the Mind, and awaken the Conſcience to an affecting Concern for their own Salvation: And from a Diſcovery of their ſinful and miſerable State, they cry, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> This is the Work of the Spirit; for when he comes, ſays CHRIST, he ſhall reprove the World of Sin, John xvi. 8. When he leads the Sinner into the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his own Heart and Ways, and he ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf altogether defiled and polluted with Sin, for which he deſerves to be made miſerable in this Life, and that which is to come: And alas! he ſees he can't help himſelf, he can't redeem his own Soul, or give to GOD a Ranſom for it: He is ſtrip'd of all Confidence in his Duties, and good Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and ſees, that all his Refuges he has betaken himſelf to, will not ſave him from the Storm of GOD'S dreadful Wrath. A deep Senſe of his Sin and Miſery, brings him as a guilty Criminal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Foot of GOD, with earneſt Cries for Mercy, Mercy: He ſees that Nothing but free Grace can
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010605_0012_0F80EFD60C015958"/>
ſave him from the Pit of everlaſting Deſtruction. Thus the poor, guilty Sinner ſtands trembling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an angry GOD, and ſees all his awful Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings pointed right at his Heart, and ready to fall upon him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Holy Spirit enlightens the guilty Sinner, into the Knowledge of CHRIST, and the Way of Salvation in and thro' him. The Holy Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds the Miſtery of the Covenant of Grace reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel, and ſhews the poor Sinner the Savior GOD has provided; and, as it were pointing to CHRIST, ſays, "Behold, O Sinner! that GOD, whoſe Wrath you fear, has found a Ranſom for you—he has given his beloved Son to be your Savior, and he is an almighty Savior, exactly ſuited to your Caſe; what you find you can't do, he has done for you; what you fear ſuffering, as the juſt Deſert of your Sins, he has ſuffered for you: He has endured the amazing Wrath of God, in his Body and Soul, for your Sake and Salvation: He has paid a full Price for your Redemption, and he has Power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſave you from what you feel and fear. And there is infinite Safety in appearing before GOD, in the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST; and his Blood cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from all Sin." Thus the Holy Spirit enlightens the Underſtanding of the Sinner, into the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of CHRIST, and the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, and the Way of the Salvation of Sinners propounded in the Goſpel, and the Sinner's Aſſent to all. Then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Holy Spirit renews the Sinner's Will, and brings him to accept of, and rely upon CHRIST for Pardon, and compleat Salvation. While the Spirit enlightens the Underſtanding, to behold the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010605_0013_0F80EFD934D1B698"/>
Glory and Excellency of CHRIST, as the Savior of poor periſhing Sinners, the Will is renewed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded and enabled to ſay, "This is the Savior I choſe for mine: Tho' I have ſought Happineſs in other Things, yet could never find Eaſe to my Conſcience. The Refuges I have betaken myſelf to, have proved Refuges of Lies: But in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior GOD has provided, there is Nothing wanting: He is every Way compleat, he is altogether lovely; and with all my Heart I take him for mine upon his own Terms. I reſolve I will be his forever. I ſee GOD can, conſiſtent with his own glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, juſtify me thro' CHRIST, and receive me again into his Favor, and this is the only Way I can hope, and do deſire to be ſaved." Now the whole Soul relies upon CHRIST, and can ſafely truſt in him for Pardon and Salvation. Thus the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween CHRIST and the Believer is brought about, and Salvation is ſecured to all ſuch, upon the Terms of the Covenant of Grace. O! remember, if you chuſe CHRIST upon his Terms, you will find them directly croſs to Fleſh and Blood; for you muſt be diveſted of all Confidence in yourſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be found of GOD in CHRIST: And you muſt be willing to deny all Ungodlineſs and every worldly Luſt, and live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent evil World. You muſt take CHRIST with his Croſs, as well as his Crown, and have the whole chriſtian Temper formed in you, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing you to the Practice of all chriſtian Duties; and ſo adorn the Doctrine of GOD your Savior in all Things; that you may have the Evidence in yourſelves, and manifeſt to others, that the Holy Spirit has applied the Redemption purchaſed by
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010605_0014_0F80EFDA6B1144C0"/>
CHRIST unto you for your Salvation; and ſo the Heart is prepared to aſcribe his whole Salvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to CHRIST from the Foundation, to the bringing in of the Top-Stone of his Salvation with Shouts, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, Grace.</p>
            <p>II. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government. That glorious Perſon who is the Baſis of all the Hopes and Happineſs of GOD'S People, he is the great Creator of all Things, John i. 3. <hi>All Things were made by him; and without him was not any Thing made that was made;</hi> and it is his Right and Prerogative to rule in the Kingdom of Providence, and govern all the Affairs of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and lower World: The Prophet Iſaiah ſpeaks of him as having the Government of the Univerſe devolved upon him, ixth Chap. 6th Ver. <hi>The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall be upon his Shoulder.</hi> When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior was about to give his laſt Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, juſt before his Aſcention into Glory, he ſays, Matt. xxviii. 18. <hi>All Power is given unto me, in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> By his Wiſdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he conducts all the Affairs of his providential Government, and accompliſhes his own Purpoſes; altho' he makes Uſe of Means and Inſtruments yet he himſelf always ſtands as the Wheel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Wheel, in Ezekiel's Viſion, to direct all the Motions of ſecond Cauſes, that nothing ſhall ever happen without his ſpecial Direction. This glorious Perſon hath on his Veſture and on his Thigh, a Name written, (which beſpeaks his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Dominion in the Kingdom of Men) <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Rev. xix. 16. He ſets up and pulls down, when he will, at his Pleaſure. Tho' the Forms of civil Government are various,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010605_0015_0F80EFDA8BEE0808"/>
in Kingdoms and Nations, yet it is calculated in each of them, for the general Good of the Body Politic. And all thoſe who are promoted to Places of Rule and Government, receive their Power from him, who is the bleſſed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, 1 Tim. vi. 15. I ſhall illuſtrate the Truth before us, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Particulars. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Civil Rulers receive their Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from CHRIST. The Apoſtle, ſpeaking of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrates, ſays, <hi>The Powers that be, are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God.</hi> Rom. xiii. 1. CHRIST, the Wiſdom of GOD, proclaims, Prov. viii. 15, 16. <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice: By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi> This important Subject has been ſo often well illuſtrated on the like Occaſion, that I ſhall proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. CHRIST directs and regulates Rulers in their Duty. This great and wiſe Governor has given Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers wiſe and general Maxims in his ſacred Word, by which they may form a good Plan of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and has furniſhed them with compleat Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make good Laws, and enforce Obedience on all, by proper Sanctions. By his own Authority he has laid the moſt powerful Reſtraint upon Rulers, to keep them from all unjuſt &amp; oppreſſive Meaſures, by aſſuring them they ſhall die like other Men, and ſtand at his Bar, and give a ſtrict Account of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as Rulers. The Lord of all expects and requires that they have a principal View at his Glory, in all they do, in their different Offices. And in Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Glory of GOD, they are to exerciſe their Authority for the Good of the Ruled. You muſt be a Miniſter of GOD to his People for Good: You are
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010605_0016_0F80EFDB516166E0"/>
not to be a Terror to the Good, but to the Evil; and make them know, you do not bear the Sword in vain. The ſweet Laws of our moſt holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uling in your Hearts, and attended to in your public Adminiſtrations, will moſt happily direct you in your Duties, and make you reach the good End of Government.</p>
            <p n="3">3. CHRIST requires all due Subjection and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Rulers, as his Miniſters. By the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the King of Kings, you are not only requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fear GOD, but honor the King, 1 Pet. ii. 17. paying due Reverence to his Vice-gerents, <hi>Submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's Sake; whether it be to the King, as Supreme, or unto Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, as unto them that are ſent by him, for the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Evil-Doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well.</hi> 13, 14 Ver. You muſt be ſubject to civil Government out of Conſcience, and Obedience unto GOD, by obeying the Laws, and willingly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their honorable Support, paying Tribute to whom Tribute is due; giving full Proof of your Loyalty, by your earneſt Prayer for them; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that divine. Exhortation, 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2, 3. <hi>I exhort, therefore, that firſt of all, Supplications, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men; for Kings, and all that are in Authority, that they may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Honeſty; for this is good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Savior.</hi> Thus he who has the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment on his Shoulders, has inveſted you with Power to act for him, and directed you in the wiſe Exertion of it, for the Good of his People; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that Subjection, which will make your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment eaſy and beneficial and prove the length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010605_0017_0F80EFDC238C9218"/>
out of our Tranquility, under the happy Privileges which this Government has been long favored with.</p>
            <p>III. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of the wiſe and good Government eſtabliſhed in his Church. The great Governor among the Nations, ſpreads his divine Influences thro' the whole Univerſe, with a peculiar Deſign for the good of his Church, to ſupport it on the Foundation already laid; and he is Head over all Things to the Church, Eph. i. 13. He has reſerved to himſelf the whole Authority to give Laws to his own Kingdom, and none may teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, to bind their Conſciences. CHRIST, the glorious Head, has given to his Church, all neceſſary Doctrines and Laws, in his ſacred Oracles: <hi>And if any ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to add unto theſe Things, God ſhall add unto him all the Plagues that are written in this Book: And if any Man ſhall take away from the Words of the Book of this Prophecy, God ſhall take away his Part out of the Book of Life.</hi> Rev. xxii. 18, 19. CHRIST governs in his Church, by accompanying the Doctrines of Grace with ſuch powerful Influences, as to make his People willing and obedient unto him. Thoſe important Doctrines which are plainly revealed in GOD'S Word, are made powerful on the Heart of GOD'S People, ſo as to awaken ſecure Sinners; to humble proud Sinners; and bring them to renounce all Confidence in any Thing they have, or can do, to recommend them to the divine Favor. <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,</hi> with the Apoſtle, <hi>to be found in Chriſt, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on their own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is thro' the Faith of Chriſt, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is by Faith,</hi> Phil. iii. 9. And having
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010605_0018_0F80EFDCCAC79CF0"/>
received CHRIST by Faith, and become united unto him, they receive ſuch ſpiritual Influences from CHRIST their Head, that they bring forth Fruit, in their different Stations among Men, to the Praiſe and Glory of GOD. He has furniſhed them with ſuch a Variety of important Truths in his ſacred Word, that they may grow in Knowledge and Grace, and be directed in all virtuous Living, and become Ornaments to the Church, of which CHRIST is Head, and uſeful Members of civil Community. CHRIST will take Care that the important Doctrines of Religion be maintained, and that Religion, in the Power and Practice of it, more or leſs prevails. He will rule in the Hearts of his own Children, and train them up, in his Church Militant, to become Members of the Church Triumphant. But while the Church is in this imperfect State, their will be Corruption in Doctrines and Practice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wiſe Governor has eſtabliſhed good Laws, to direct his Church, in a faithful Dealing with all ſuch Offenders, to bring them to a Sight and Senſe of their Sins and Errors, that they might repent, and obtain Mercy and Forgiveneſs. But if they remain obstinate, after proper Means have been uſed, and Patience exerciſed; they muſt be cut off as fruitleſs and corrupt Members. Now, that theſe Laws of Diſcipline might be more eaſily underſtood, and practiſed upon, it has been the Practice of all chriſtian Churches, in all Ages, to collect the Laws of CHRIST, inſtituted for the Government of his Church, into ſhort Syſtems. And altho' none of theſe, as far as they are Human, may be eſteemed perfect, but in ſome Things may need Amendation; yet, perhaps, none more agreable to the Pattern
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010605_0019_0F80EFDE23C9F8D8"/>
given us in GOD'S Word, than what our Fore-Fathers have drawn up to our Hand, in our eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Conſtitution, which has received the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the legiſlative Authority of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Here the Rights and Liberties of particular Churches are maintained; and the Power of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, in the Management of Diſcipline, in Relation to any Scandals that fall out within the ſame, is clearly aſſerted and maintained. And that Churches might afford to each other, ſuch mutual Aſſiſtance as may be requiſite, upon all Occaſions eccleſiaſtical; neighbouring Churches are to form into a Conſociation; and all Caſes of Scandal and Hereſy, falling out within their Limits, are to be there tried and iſſued, unleſs the Matter is ſo great in its Nature, ſo doubtful in the Iſſue, or of ſuch general Concern, that it be thought beſt to call a neighbouring Conſociation, to iſſue and determine ſuch a Caſe. This Conſtitution has made Proviſion for the fair Trial of Criminals, and for the Relief of the aggrieved. And if you look carefully into the Form of Proceeding, you will find it well calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to anſwer the good End of Government in the Church. We ſhould eſteem it a ſpecial Favor of the Great Head of the Church, that we have ſo wiſe and good Conſtitution eſtabliſhed in our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: And may it be a Means of guiding, purging, and defending the Church, which is built upon CHRIST as the Foundation, that the Gates of Hell may never prevail againſt it; but Religion may flouriſh, and the Church appear clear as the Moon, bright as the Sun, and terrible as an Army with Banners, Cant. vi. 4.</p>
            <div type="part">

               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p n="1">1. From what we have heard we may learn, that we ſhould take ſpecial Care how we build upon this Foundation. Thoſe who own CHRIST for the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of all their Hopes of Happineſs, had need be careful that their Building anſwer the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Foundation. There are precious Doctrines for you to adhere to, compared in our Context to Gold, Silver, and precious Stones: Theſe will make us rich, honorable, and comfortable. Others who hold corrupt Doctrines, which lead to unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Practices, are compared to Wood, Hay, and Stubble. Whatever your Building is, remember, O Chriſtian! your Work ſhall be made manifeſt, for the Day ſhall declare it; becauſe it ſhall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Fire; and the Fire ſhall try every Man's Work, of what Sort it is, whether it be good or no. We are aſſured this ſhall be the Caſe; let us take Heed how we build upon CHRIST, that we might reap the Benefit and Comfort of Religion, and be daily preparing for a glorious Manifeſtation of our firm Adherence to CHRIST, and his ſacred Truths.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We learn, that the Foundation Men may lay, beſides what is already laid, will certainly fail them. It is ſuppoſed in our Text, that Men will have ſome Foundation to build their eternal Hopes upon; and while ſome are building upon CHRIST, Others who profeſs Chriſtianity, will deny the peculiar Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Goſpel, and bring in damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, denying the Lord who has bought them, and ſo ſtrike at the Foundation GOD has laid. We can't but be ſenſible of a very ſad Corruption of the chriſtian Faith, ſpread abroad in many Books, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010605_0021_0F80EFDF9573B300"/>
the Divinity of our bleſſed Savior, and the Price he has paid by his righteous Life, and cruel Sufferings and Death, for our Redemption; and the ſpecial Agency of the Holy Spirit, in applying the Redemption purchaſed by CHRIST, thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and carrying on the Work of Sanctification in the whole Man, and thus preparing for Glory and Happineſs. Perhaps there never was a Time when more dangerous Errors prevailed in our Land than at this Day: But we may be ſure that the Stone which theſe fooliſh Builders reject, is become the Head Stone of the Corner, in the Salvation of Sinners, Pſalm cxviii. 22. However you may now treat the great Savior, and his precious Doctrines; e'er long your Faith and Hope will entirely fail you. If you now deny him before Men, he will deny you before his Father which is in Heaven, Matt. x. 33. You are now warned that all other Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will ſail: Therefore, look well to yourſelves, that you build upon the Foundation of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Prophets, JESUS CHRIST himſelf being the chief Corner Stone, Eph. ii. 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We learn, that we ſhould attend to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and Duties required in GOD'S Word, in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon CHRIST as the Foundation. In the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles, we have a compleat Syſtem of what we are to believe and do. And we muſt feel ſuch a powerful Senſe of theſe ſacred Truths upon our Hearts, as to bring us to reſt and rely upon CHRIST, and him only, for Life. And the Hope we have founded upon CHRIST, ſhould purify our Hearts more and more, and make us fruitful in every good Work, to the Praiſe and Glory of GOD. We muſt be ſtudious to know the Mind and Will of GOD,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010605_0022_0F80EFDFC93B76E0"/>
and ſearch the Scriptures daily, that we may build our Faith upon the Teſtimony of GOD, and keep his Inſtitutions and Ordinances pure and unmixed, and attend them with Care and Diligence; and never give Way to our own Devices, or be led away by the crafty Deſigns of thoſe who lie in Wait to deceive.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Redemption CHRIST hath purchaſed, muſt be applied unto us by the Holy Spirit, in fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, ſavingly, upon the Foundation GOD has laid. It is the Office and Work of the Holy Spirit, in bringing Sinners to Salvation, to apply the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchaſed by CHRIST; thereby working Faith in us, and uniting us unto CHRIST, as our Head, and making us Partakers of theſe divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, by which we are renewed, and ſanctified, and ſtrengthened in the inner Man; that CHRIST may dwell in our Hearts by Faith; that we being rooted and grounded in Love, may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with all Saints, what is the Length, and Breadth, and Heighth; and to know the Love of CHRIST, which paſſeth Knowledge, that we may be filled with all the Fullneſs of GOD, Eph iii. 10. and on. If you han't the Power, nor don't taſte the Fruit of the Spirit, in this great Work of applying the Redemption purchaſed by CHRIST, you can't have any ſolid Hopes, that you are built on CHRIST, as the ſure Foundation, O then, what will become of thoſe who deny the Influences and Agency of the holy and bleſſed Spirit, in uniting them to CHRIST! they can have no Part in him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Glory ſhould be given unto CHRIST, for all the happy Privileges both civil and ſacred, which we have long enjoyed. It is by the wiſe and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

Diſpoſal of CHRIST, the great Governor of the World, that we are diſtinguiſhed above the moſt of our fellow Men, in thoſe ſacred Privileges of Worſhip and Diſcipline, which, by the Bleſſing of Heaven, may make us perfect in every good Work, and build us up on CHRIST, as the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in Faith and Holineſs, unto eternal Life. Our civil Privileges are diſtinguiſhingly great; and the great Good we have enjoyed in them, ſhould raiſe our Gratitude and Thankfulneſs to the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Upholder of them.

You know the Terms, what you muſt experience in yourſelves, and what you muſt believe in your Hearts, and what you muſt profeſs with your Mouths, if you would be ſaved. Now, if your Faith and Hope be rightly fixed on CHRIST, the Foundation GOD has laid; then you may know for your Comfort, that <hi>the Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal, the Lord knows
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010605_0024_0F80EFE3BA35FA40"/>
them that are his.</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 19. This you will find the beſt Support, under the great Burthens of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at this Day, which is greatly increaſed by ſome peculiar Circumſtances; which calls moſt loudly upon you to exert all your Wiſdom and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in conducting our public Affairs, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing our moſt valuable Rights and Privileges, and tranſmit them down to our Poſterity as a ſacred Treaſure.</p>
               <p>While you are employed in theſe arduous and important Services, may you find ſome ſweet Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to CHRIST, and receive that Wiſdom and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from Him, which ſhall make you Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of GOD for Good to his People; that you may all cloſe your uſeful Lives in Peace, and be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eternal Glory.</p>
               <p>Let me urge you to improve your Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in enacting all good Laws which may be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſuppreſs Sin, and encourage Virtue &amp; Religion.</p>
               <p>Pray ſee that your Laws be well executed, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to ſuppreſs thoſe crying Sins, which have bro't down GOD'S Judgments upon the Land. The Want of the due Execution of the Laws, is one great Occaſion of GOD'S Sabbaths being openly profaned, his Worſhip neglected, and many other Evils prevailing before our Eyes. And theſe Things forebode our Ruin, except we be reclaimed by the civil Power.</p>
               <p>While you are Guardians to the common Wealth, let me aſk your tender Regard for the eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, which has received your Approbation, and is of vaſt Importance, to the building up of the Kingdom of CHRIST amongſt us, in the Unity of the Faith, and the Bond of Peace; until we all
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010605_0025_0F80EFE44BE78FC8"/>
come unto the Fulneſs of the Stature of a perfect Man in him.</p>
               <p>As you love the Church of the Lord JESUS, let the College always ſhare in your paternal Care and Kindneſs, under its preſent Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and then we may well hope, the Doctrines of the Goſpel will be preſerved pure, and many will be trained up for eminent Service in Church and State; and may your Frowns cauſe all its Enemies to hide their Heads.</p>
               <p>I can moſt heartily recommend to your wiſe and moſt ſerious Conſideration, the important Affair of chriſtianiſing the poor Heathen in our Land. This is what your Savior juſtly expects from you, at ſuch a favorable Opportunity as now preſents. Your Wiſdom and Help are needed; and the more you do, to build them up upon the Foundation God has laid, the more you may hope and expect the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bleſſing will attend your pious and wiſe Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, for the Good of all under your Care and Government.</p>
               <p>I would earneſtly beſeech you, my political Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to make ſome more effectual Proviſion for the Inſtruction of our Children, in our common Schools, both in Virtue and good Learning. For that End Schools ſhould be ſteadily maintained; and the Teachers ſhould be qualified Perſons, of good Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; who will inſtil the beſt Principles into them, by Inſtruction, and a good Example, of Virtue and Religion; and inſtruct them, by Rule, in thoſe Parts of Learning, which are needful, to furniſh them for Uſefulneſs in their Day. For that End, perhaps it might be well, if none be ſuffered to teach in our Schools, but thoſe who have been exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010605_0026_0F80EFE51F0C22A8"/>
and licenſed by proper Judges, of their good Qualifications, to be wiſe and profitable Inſtructors. The Want of ſpecial Proviſion in this Caſe, has proved ſuch a deſtructive Evil already, that Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes grow up in Ignorance and Vice, which will naturally occaſion a ſad Decay in Religion and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and make them unprofitable Members of the common Wealth. The Importance of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Schools, to remedy the Evils we ſee in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Generation, muſt plead in a Language which no Tongue can expreſs, to excite your Pity, and employ your Wiſdom and Power, to do ſomething more than has been done, for the inſtructing our Children.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add but one Thing more, which I would humbly ſubmit to your ſuperior Wiſdom—Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Proviſion can't be made, to prevent ſuch vaſt Expences in Law-Suits, and ſuch oppreſſive Meaſures in collecting in juſt Debts, which often makes the Charge much more than the original Debt? O! may the diſtreſſed State of the People you govern, make you exert your Wiſdom and Skill, in doing Something within your Power, to relieve the Burdens we are groaning under, and to encourage thoſe Meaſures, which may contribute to the lengthening out of our Tranquility! O! may GOD give you Wiſdom in all Things, to conduct the Affairs of Government, and ſhew great Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, to the Church, and Intereſt of the great Redeemer's Kingdom; and that you may lead GOD'S People, as the Flock of GOD ought to be lead.</p>
               <p>I would addreſs myſelf to my Fathers and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are under the moſt ſolemn Charge, to preach the important Doctrines of the Goſpel, and to ſhew to GOD'S People, that CHRIST is the only Foundation of the Sinner's Pardon and Acceptance with Him: And if we fail of this, to the Ruin of Souls, their Blood will be required at our Hands. We muſt then be exceeding careful to diſtinguiſh between Truth and Error; and make a faithful Stand againſt the prevailing Errors of the Times, which ſubverts the Foundation GOD has laid; and plainly and faithfully teach the Doctrines of Grace, and preſs them with the powerful Arguments and Motives of the Goſpel; and ſhew the Neceſſity of having them in wrought in their Hearts, by the all-powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Holy Spirit, to bring them up to the Terms of Salvation by JESUS CHRIST. And we muſt maintain good Government in the Church, according to the Laws of CHRIST's Kingdom, to purge out corrupt and incorrigible Members, with all Gentleneſs and Meekneſs; and we muſt ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thoſe whom CHRIST would have ſupported. For this Purpoſe, we muſt maintain our eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conſtitution, in the Senſe in which it has always been underſtood, and practiſed upon, and improve it for the Good of the Church. And while we are vigorouſly endeavouring the Salvation of Others, we ſhould take Heed to ourſelves, that we be not Caſt-aways at laſt. We muſt experience the Power of thoſe Truths upon our Hearts, which we preſs upon Others; and be ſavingly acquainted with JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, and the Way of Pardon and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thro' Him. Our Hearts muſt cordially comply with the Terms upon which CHRIST will become our
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010605_0028_0F80EFE6EDEFB848"/>
Savior. We muſt build upon CHRIST as the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and make him the chief Corner-ſtone of our Salvation. A powerful Senſe of Religion upon our Hearts, ſhould make us take Heed to our Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that we build nothing but Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, ſuch as will bear the Tryal, at the laſt Day, when every Thing ſhall be made manifeſt. We muſt take Heed to our Converſation, that we adorn the Doctrine of GOD our Savior, and become Examples to the Flock, in every Thing which is virtuous and praiſe-worthy, that we might ſave our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and them that hear us. How loudly doth GOD, in his Providence, call upon us to be always ready, to give up an Account of Ourſelves to our glorious Judge, by the many Breaches he has made by Death, upon our ſacred Order, in the Year paſt; four of our Brethren,<note n="*" place="bottom">

And the late Rev'd Preſident, THOMAS CLAP, who vaſtly excelled in univerſal Learning, and in his great Skill of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which has been very conſpicuous in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Labours in the College for more than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven Years, &amp;c. was truly a pious, as well as a great Man. He ſincerely loved the Doctrines of Grace, and exerted himſelf, in his high Station, to the Admiration of all, in ſupporting thoſe peculiar Doctrines of the Goſpel, which ſtand inſeparably connected with building upon CHRIST as the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation GOD hath laid. And altho' he did not eſcape the Reproach of Men, he has doubtleſs received the Approbation of his Judge, and a glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

of his great and faithful Labours. How ſhould theſe Admonitions from GOD, animate us, as Brethren, to live in Love, and ſtudy the Things which make for Peace, and carefully fulfil our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; that we may at laſt, receive the ſweet Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of our Judge, and hear him ſay to each One of us, <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servants:—Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you, from the Foundation of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would addreſs myſelf to the whole Aſſembly, We all profeſs, there is no other Name under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, given among Men, whereby we can be ſaved, but by JESUS CHRIST: He is the Foundation GOD has laid. It is then of the greateſt Importance, that each One of you perſonally partake of Him as your Savior, and experience the powerful Influences of the Holy Spirit, applying the Redemption he has purchaſed, unto you, bringing you ſeverally up to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace; forming the new Creature in your Hearts; implanting thoſe divine Principles in your Souls, which will make you pay a due Reſpect to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in all the Branches of chriſtian Duty, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD, the ſupreme Governor of the World, and all thoſe he has ſet in Authority over you. You can't but know the Burden of Government lays heavy upon them, and they are under many Diſcouragements: The Power of Religion in you, ſhould excite you to do all you can, to encourage their Hearts, and ſtrengthen their Hands. O! do all you can to maintain their Honor and Influence among the People; and honor Religion, in your Loyalty to them who rule over you. My Brethren, <hi>fear thou the Lord, and the King, and meddle not with
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010605_0030_0F80EFE84BE384A0"/>
thoſe who are given to Change,</hi> Prov. xxiv. 21. Bear your full Teſtimony againſt all evil ſpeaking of Dignities; for GOD has ſolemnly charged, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the Gods, nor curſe the Rulers of thy People,</hi> Exod. xxii. 28. Always maintain good and honorable Thoughts of your Rulers, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them to GOD, in your fervent Prayers; for it is the Will of GOD, that <hi>Supplications, Prayers, and Interceſſions—be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority: That we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 2. This is the Way for us to obtain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom and Direction for our Rulers, that they might be made very rich Bleſſings unto us, in protecting our Rights and Privileges, and directing our public Affairs, to the great Advantage of the whole Community; and happily inſtrumental to ſuppreſs Vice, and cheriſh Virtue; to ſupport the Church, and ſtrengthen the Hands of GOD'S Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; that we may ſee Religion revive in our Day, and enjoy the Benefit and Comfort of it to our own Souls, and be forever happy, in the full Enjoyment of GOD, in eternal Glory.
