            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> from whoſe Lamentations our Text is taken, lived to ſee the Ruin of his Nation. His patriotic Soul glowed with an enthuſiaſtic Love for his Country, and he felt all her Miſeries by Anticipation. The Man ſuffers doubly whoſe Eyes are open to foreſee future Calamities. This holy Patriot's Heart was broken long before the Miſeries, which he bewails, came upon his Countrymen; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it is difficult to tell which is the moſt melancholy, his Prophecy or his Hiſtory of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> His La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations were evidently written with a Pen dipped in Tears. Every Line is full of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and every Word ſeems big with Diſtreſs. But in the Midſt of his Complaints we find that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013649_0004_0F919CAC2B566BE0"/>he juſtifies GOD, and confeſſes that it is becauſe his Compaſſions fail not, that they are not <hi>entirely</hi> conſumed. Afflictions, whether public or private, always bring good Men to a Senſe of their Sins, and the firſt Efforts of their Reſentments are againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>POLITICAL Subjects do not belong to the Pulpit, but to direct to a right Improvement of the Times is the Duty of every Miniſter of the Goſpel. An unnatural Diſpute hath ariſen between <hi>Britain</hi> and the <hi>American</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and the Queſtion is of no leſs Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude than whether we ſhall continue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Privileges of Men and <hi>Britons,</hi> or whether we ſhall be reduced to a State of the moſt abject Slavery. It is equally beyond my Province and Inclination to enter into the Merits of this Controverſy. It will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for my Purpoſe to remark, that we have lived to ſee our Country involved in a common Calamity. The Cry of Oppreſſion is already heard in one Corner of our Land. The Groans of many Thouſands of our Brethren have reached our Ears, and GOD only knows how ſoon they will be echoed back from every Part of the Continent. A dark Cloud hovers over us. We are threatened with Slavery. War, Peſtilence and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, thoſe ordinary Miniſters of GOD's Vengeance, are tranſient, partial or local Evils. Slavery is a general and perpetual Evil. It includes all Ages, Claſſes and Sexes.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013649_0005_0F919CAC9639D990"/>It reaches to every Corner of a Land. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the preſent and all future Generations. It precludes all Hopes of Redreſs, for it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails thoſe Crimes and that Depravity of Soul which at firſt procured it. In a Word, it is the prime Miniſter of GOD's Vengeance, and it has been called upon only in thoſe Caſes where leſs Scourges were unequal to the Demerit of Crimes, or when they had been uſed to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Dictates of blind Paſſion are to imprecate Vengeance upon the guilty Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Calamities, and to reſolve to endure the greateſt Hardſhips rather than ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render the Privileges we have derived from Nature and our Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>IT is true, the impartial Judge of the World will vindicate the Cauſe of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and although in righteous Judgment he may leave them to ſink under the Load of their Oppreſſions, yet will he not forget the Oppreſſor. He hath aſſured us in his Word, that he will "vindicate the Poor, and break in Pieces the Oppreſſor. This is the Portion of the wicked Man with God, and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage of the Oppreſſors, which they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Almighty. If his Children be multiplied, it is for the Sword, and his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring ſhall not be ſatisfied with Bread. Thoſe that remain of him ſhall be buried in Death, and his Widow ſhall not weep. Tho' he heap up Silver as Duſt, and prepare Raiment
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013649_0006_0F919CAD53739188"/>as Clay, yet ſhall the juſt put it on, and the innocent ſhall divide the Silver. He buildeth his Houſe as a Moth, and as a Booth that the Keeper maketh. The rich Man ſhall lie down, but he ſhall not be gathered. He openeth his Eyes, and he is not. Terrors take hold of him as Waters. A Tempeſt ſtealeth him away in the Night; for GOD ſhall caſt upon him, and ſhall not ſpare. He would fain flee out of his Hand. Men ſhall clap their Hands at him, and ſhall hiſs him out of his Place."</p>
            <p>NOR is the Uſe of Means to obtain Relief from our Oppreſſions inconſiſtent with the neceſſary Principles of human Nature, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of GOD. But there is too much Reaſon to fear, that while we exclaim againſt the Inſtruments of our Calamities, and deliberate about the beſt Meaſures to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate ourſelves from them, we forget to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt the prevailing Iniquities of our Country, and to conſider them as the only Cauſes which have drawn down the Frowns of Omnipotence upon us. The Experience of all Ages ſhews that the ſureſt Way for any Nation to obtain or perpetuate public Bleſſings, is to acknowledge that GOD who alone can beſtow them. It was never known, that a People became unhappy until their Iniquities ripened them for the divine Vengeance. The Hiſtory of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation is, in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, a ſtriking Leſſon to all Mankind. Their
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013649_0007_0F919CB022F83D70"/>Piety and Proſperity always kept Pace with each other, and their Defection from GOD was always a Prelude to their Deſolation.</p>
            <p>IT ſhould be an invariable Rule with <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to regard the Hand of GOD in every Thing which happens, but eſpecially in public Calamities. Not a Blade of Graſs is trodden down, nor does a Hair fall from your Heads without his Notice. He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules likewiſe the grand Machine of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and however confuſed it may appear, yet let <hi>Chriſtians</hi> remember that there is Order in this Confuſion. Not one Event is vain, and God's Glory will be the Reſult of the vaſt Combination.</p>
            <p>THE corrupt Paſſions of Men, while they aim only at their own Gratification, are the Means whereby God accompliſhes his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in the Government of the World. Even the Wrath of Man, the moſt malevolent of all Paſſions, "worketh his Will." Devils follow the Malignity of their Natures in all their Actions, but the Almighty carries on, through their Inſtrumentality, the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Purpoſes of his Wiſdom and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>NATIONS, like Individuals, have their Vices, which call for Puniſhment. The Vices of Individuals are ſeldom fully puniſhed in this World, but it is in this World only that GOD has erected a Tribunal for the Trial and Puniſhment of national Vices. As Individuals have their Day beyond which
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013649_0008_0F919CB04A5F6D10"/>GOD's Patience will not wait, ſo likewiſe have Nations. Though he may forbear long, yet the Time <hi>will</hi> come when he will either reduce them to Obedience, or utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them. The Meaſure of the Iniquity of the <hi>Amorites</hi> was more than four hundred Years in filling up, but at length it was full, and they were deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>THERE can be no Sign of a Nation's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Deſtruction more certain than its univerſal Corruption. Ten pious Souls might have ſaved <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the other Cities of the Plain, from Fire and Sulphur, but many more might not have ſaved them from ſome heavy Judgments. We cannot certainly tell when the Day of Vengeance will come, yet we have always Reaſon to fear it; and it becomes us in a particular Manner, when we behold the Hand of GOD lifted up, to tremble and bow down before him.</p>
            <p>IF we examine the religious and moral Character of the Inhabitants of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire, we have the utmoſt Reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a Time of general Correction is not far from us. Our Lord found Fault with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of his Day for being blind to the Signs of the Times. When we behold the weſtern Sky red in the Evening, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a fair Day. When we behold the Fields yellow, we know that Harveſt is at Hand. Theſe Signs, in the natural World, are not leſs certain and invariable than the Sign of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013649_0009_0F919CB14BD97E38"/>moral Depravity in a People being a Prelude to their Deſtruction. GOD has not thrown the Reins of the Univerſe out of his Hands, nor will he leave the World to go on at Random. Good Men, who have made it their Buſineſs to find out and bewail the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of our Nation and Country, have been, for Years paſt, looking for ſome great and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Cataſtrophe to befal them. The Words of our Text form a Part of their daily Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: "It is of the Lord's Mercy that we are not conſumed, becauſe his Compaſſions fail not."</p>
            <p>IN order to illuſtrate the Truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition contained in our Text, I ſhall point out in a few Words the religious and moral Character of our Nation and Country. It will be neceſſary to include the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation in this Picture, as their Liberty and Happineſs are as much at Stake as the Liberty and Happineſs of the Colonies in the preſent Controverſy.</p>
            <p>WE cannot ſurvey the <hi>religious</hi> Character of our Nation and Country without complaining, in the firſt Place, of the univerſal Prevalence of Infidelity. It has infected not only our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe Philoſophers, but every Rank and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Even the Coxcomb and Petit Maitre affect to treat the Chriſtian Revelation with Ridicule. It is ſome Conſolation to reflect that this Evil will in Time cure itſelf, for the principled Infidel will ſoon be aſhamed of Opinions which are now no longer ſingular,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013649_0010_0F919CB1C7DAB248"/>and which ceaſe to raiſe him above the moſt vulgar and contemptible Part of Mankind.</p>
            <p>WHAT ſtrange Hereſies prevail in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches! What a general Defection from Articles and Confeſſions of Faith! What inſidious Interpretations of the Word of God! There cannot be a more awful Sign of our general Corruption than this Treachery in the Miniſters of the Goſpel! How little do we find even of the <hi>Form</hi> of Religion among us! I do not mean here that there are few who go to Church, or have their Children baptiſed, or call themſelves Chriſtians. There was a Time indeed when theſe Things were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as true Badges of the Chriſtian Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but in our wiſer Age the very Ideas of theſe things are changed. They are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered only as Matters of Cuſtom, and in ſome Caſes are complied with only to ſecure a Title to an Eſtate, or as legal Qualifications for holding civil Offices.</p>
            <p>How few are there that keep the Incenſe of Prayer daily ſmoking in their Families! The Heathens had their Lares and Penates. The Want of Family Worſhip would have been eſteemed a Mark of the Want of Religion in ancient <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ſhamefully is the religious Inſtruction of our Children neglected in this Country. It is one of thoſe new Paradoxes in which the preſent Age is fruitful, that the Mind ſhould be left unprincipled in Religion, until it is
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013649_0011_0F919CB281146DA0"/>able to chooſe a Syſtem for itſelf. It would be an Affront to your Underſtandings to ſhow the Abſurdity of this Conduct. Would to God there was the ſame Zeal among us to tranſmit to our Children the Religion, as there is to tranſmit the Liberty we derived from our pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anceſtors!</p>
            <p>How little do we find of the Influence of the Goſpel among thoſe whom Charity obliges us to hope are real <hi>Chriſtians!</hi> Lukewarmneſs has taken the Place of Zeal, and there is little to diſtinguiſh the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from the reſt of the World. The Love of GOD has waxed cold in many, and if our Nation and Country were to be judged by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of GOD's People alone, we ſhould have Reaſon to forebode the moſt dreadful Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Yes, my <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Friends, I am ſure you ſubſcribe to our Text with Reſpect to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, "that it is of the Lord's Mercies that you are not conſumed."</p>
            <p>LET us now examine the <hi>moral</hi> Character of our Nation and Country.</p>
            <p>FORMERLY Vices were deſcribed by the Claſſes of Mankind to which they belonged, but we find they have ſpread themſelves ſo univerſally among all Ranks in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire, that we can no longer deſcribe them in that Manner.</p>
            <p>WE ſhall begin by mentioning the univerſal Profanation of the Sabbath Day. This is a true Mark of national Impiety, and hence we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013649_0012_0F919CB347E9C990"/>find that it never was forgotten when the <hi>Jews</hi> were reproached, or puniſhed for their national Sins. The Sabbath is now the fixed Day with ſome for Entertainments and Jaunts of Pleaſure, as being moſt free from the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Company, and the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of meeting the ordinary Vehicles of Buſineſs. The Merchant is now no longer aſhamed to own in Company, that he ſpends his Sabbath in poſting his Books, or writing his Letters. I muſt not except here the Manner in which public Worſhip is performed among us from being a Profanation of the Lord's Day. A Gentleman would think you injured him greatly if you took his going to Church as a Profeſſion of Religion, or his ſaying AMEN as an Evidence of his Belief in the Prayers of the Church. Surely it is of the Lord's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that we are not conſumed for this Crime!</p>
            <p>HOW much does ſwearing and curſing abound, and how often is the ſacred and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal NAME profaned among us. Formerly this was the Vice of <hi>low Life</hi> only, but it has now infected the Army, the Navy, the Bar, the Court, and every Order of Men in the higher Ranks of Society. Formerly it was a Vice of the Men only, but it is now common to both Sexes. An affecting Story, a Fly, or any other Inſect, will ſometimes produce Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations from our Ladies, which are equally ſhocking to Religion and Delicacy. I might here enter into a Detail of the Abuſe of Oaths
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013649_0013_0F919CB532CFB890"/>in thoſe Caſes where Government has made them lawful and neceſſary. It will only be ſufficient to name the Cuſtom-Houſe, our Courts of Juſtice, and our popular Elections, to remind us that general Perjury belongs to the Catalogue of our national Crimes. It is indeed of the Lord's Mercy that we are not conſumed!</p>
            <p>DRUNKENNESS, and Intemperance in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, form another Claſs of our Vices. It would take up too much Time to ſhow the miſchievous Effects of theſe Sins upon our Souls, Bodies, Families, and upon Society in general. When we reflect upon the univerſal Prevalence of this Vice in this Country in particular, we have Reaſon to ſay, that it is becauſe the Compaſſions of the Lord fail not, that we are not conſumed!</p>
            <p>LET me here draw a Veil over the <hi>ſecret</hi> Vices of our Nation and Country. I ſhall not poiſon your Imaginations by going into a Detail of what the Eye of GOD beholds covered only by the Curtain of Night. It would profane the Pulpit to mention ſome of theſe Crimes. If <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> if <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boim</hi> and <hi>Admah</hi> in the untaught Ages of the World had Showers of burning Sulphur rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down upon them, it is ſurely of the Lord's Mercy that our Cities, our Neſts of Iniquity, are not conſumed!</p>
            <p>TALK not of the public Charities of our Nation and Country. The higheſt Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013649_0014_0F919CB593992E70"/>we can erect to the Honour of Charity, can never atone for that general Want of Piety, Sobriety, Juſtice, and Chaſtity which characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize us.</p>
            <p>I conclude our religious and moral Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, therefore, by agreeing with thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that Infidelity, Irreligion, Venality, and Vices of every Kind, have never prevailed in a greater Degree, and cannot well riſe to a higher Pitch than they have lately gained in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Country. They prevailed, it is true, in a great Degree, in the diſſolute Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, but they were confined chiefly to the Channel of the Court. The middle and lower Claſſes of People, and the Inhabitants of Villages and Country Places continued Strangers to them. But this cannot be ſaid of the preſent Generation. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Country People ſeem to vie with the firſt Claſſes of Mankind in Vices, which were formerly peculiar to them alone.</p>
            <p>IF there is any Virtue in the <hi>American</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, or laudable Attention to divine Things among every Claſs of People, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that they are to be found chiefly in that Colony where GOD has begun to lay his Hand upon us. It is true they have degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated greatly from the Piety, and pure Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their Anceſtors, but ſtill I am bold to ſay, from my own Knowledge, that there is more Appearance of the Goſpel in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> than in any other of the Colonies. And if
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013649_0015_0F919CB6676A0EB0"/>"Judgment has begun at the Houſe of GOD," what more dreadful Calamities await thoſe who have no Pretence to the Character of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! Lord enter not into Judgment with us!</p>
            <p>WHEN we take a Survey of all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which aggravate our Guilt, we have Reaſon to be confounded. Our Light, Mercies and Privileges have been ſuperior to thoſe of almoſt any People on the Face of the Earth. The Sun of Proſperity has ſhone without a Cloud on our <hi>American</hi> Hemiſphere. GOD has given us a fruitful Soil, plentiful Harveſts, profitable Commerce, free Governments, and repeated Victories over the <hi>native</hi> Enemies of our Country; and to all theſe Bleſſings of Nature and Society he has added the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Treaſures of Heaven have been exhauſted for us. Our Crimes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have been committed againſt the greatſt Profuſions of Love and Grace. Surely it is becauſe "GOD's Compaſſions fail not," or we ſhould long ago have been conſumed for ſuch unparalleled Ingratitude!</p>
            <p>BUT further, ſhould you aſk, why is the Blow which is aimed at our Liberties ſo long delayed? Why is the Sword of civil War ſtill at reſt in its Scabbard? Why are not our Cities in Flames, and our Streets ſtreaming with Blood, and why is not the Yoke of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage riverted on our Necks? I anſwer once more, it is becauſe the Compaſſions of the Lord have not failed towards us!</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="unknown:013649_0016_0F919CB740C68838"/>
            <p>WHEN the mere Politician weighs the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or the Safety of his Country, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes them in Proportion to its Fortreſſes, Arms, Money, Proviſions, Numbers of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, and its Enemies; but when the Chriſtian Patriot weighs the Danger and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Country, he computes them by its Numbers of ſinful or praying People, and its Degrees of Holineſs and Vice. It is not the Threats or Boaſtings of our Adverſaries, that ſhould make Melancholy ſit upon our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances. We have more to dread from our Iniquities than our Enemies.</p>
            <p>I Do not mean to propoſe in a little Chriſtian Aſſembly, Meaſures of Reformation to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted by a whole Nation and Country. It will be more to our Purpoſe to mention the Duty of Individuals upon this alarming Occaſion.</p>
            <p>CONFESSION, PRAYER, and REFORMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, are Duties to which every Individual is called, as well for the Welfare of his Country, as for the Sake of his own Salvation. Say not that you are but one, and can do Nothing.—It is of ſingle Perſons that Kingdoms are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and that Argument pleads equally againſt all Reformations. If you cannot ſave your Country, is it not worth while to ſave your Souls?</p>
            <p>GOD will ever be a Shield to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to cover them in the Day of Trouble. It is ſaid that few or no <hi>Chriſtians</hi> periſhed in the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013649_0017_0F919CBBAA0CB988"/>gives perſonal Safety; and if GOD does not find a Way for the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s entire Eſcape in a Time of Calamity, yet he will make that very Calamity the Means of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging his Happineſs; and Death itſelf the immediate Door to Glory.</p>
            <p>CONFESSION is the firſt Step to Safety. A Senſe of our Crimes is a hopeful Dawn of Deliverance. And here I cannot help repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Paſſage of a Letter which I lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from an aged Servant of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom it becomes me to revere; "If (ſays my honoured Correſpondent) I could hear our People exclaim againſt their Sins as warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as againſt Lord <hi>North,</hi> I ſhould have Hopes of Deliverance. Alas, they hug their Crimes while they decry the Executioner! Were we as harmonious in our Remonſtrances againſt ourſelves, as we are againſt the late oppreſſive Acts, our Caſe would not be ſo doubtful!"</p>
            <p>LET us then bow down before the Hand of GOD, and confeſs our Iniquities with the deepeſt Proſtration of Heart. In three Days (without Repentance) <hi>Nineveh</hi> would have been deſtroyed. It will be impoſſible to bring us to the Feet of a boaſting Miniſter of State, if we firſt humble ourſelves properly at the Feet of the Lord.</p>
            <p>PRAYER to ALMIGHTY GOD is a powerful Defence againſt public Calamities. This is a Duty not of more private than pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Benefit. To whom does Nature or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013649_0018_0F919CBD0B6AAF08"/>encourage us to go in all Times of Diſtreſs but to him who holds the Hearts of Kings in his Hands, and wields the Sceptre of the Univerſe. It can be the Buſineſs of but a ſmall Part of our Community to plan Schemes for our Deliverance, but we may all co-operate in the Duty of Prayer; and let the Chriſtian Patriot remember, that in an Age and Country when Petitions and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances to earthly Rulers have loſt their Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, Prayer to GOD ſtill poſſeſſes, I had almoſt ſaid, an Almighty Efficacy. The Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of one Man once ſaved a City devoted to Deſtruction; and it is not attributing too much to it to add, that the Prayers of one Chriſtian Society may yet ſave our ſinking Country.</p>
            <p>BUT in vain are Confeſſions and Prayers, unleſs we turn from our evil Ways by a thorough Reformation. To this the Goſpel of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> calls you at the Peril of your Souls, as well as of your Country. To this every Motive from Heaven, Earth, and Hell invites you. A general Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my Brethren, would be a greater Act of Benevolence to our ſuffering Brethren in the North than all your generous and ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Contributions. Take GOD, therefore, for your GOD, and become the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and be aſſured of Safety here, and of Crowns of immortal Glory hereafter.</p>
