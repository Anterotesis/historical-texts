            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A GENTLEMAN in this town, to whom Mr. Leaming's "Defence" was lately ſent, ſaw fit, a few days ago, to put it into my hands, deſiring I would give it a reading; which I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done.</p>
            <p>How far it may be juſtly called, <q>a Defence of Epiſcopacy againſt your ſermon,</q> I am not able to ſay; not having had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> pleaſure of ever ſeeing it: But 'tis with great impropriety ſtiled <q>a defence againſt mine;</q> as nineteen parts in twenty of what I had ſaid, is paſſed over, without ſo much as an attempt to examine its force, or ſhew its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſiveneſs in point of argument. Was it not that my name is now and then mentioned, no one would imagine he had it in view to anſwer me, any more than an hundred others, who have appeared on the ſame ſide of the queſtion in diſpute.</p>
            <p>I eſteem my ſermon as full an anſwer to his "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence," as if wrote on purpoſe to confute it; and aſk no other favour than that they be carefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with each other, and an impartial judgment formed thereupon. If this is done, I can't ſuppoſe that any one, beſides Mr. L. will be diſpoſed to think, <q>that he has anſwered the moſt material things advanced by Dr. Chauncy:</q> It muſt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, on the contrary, that he has ſcarce taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing material that I have offered.</p>
            <p>I have no other knowledge of this gentleman, than what may be collected from this ſmall work of his; which has not, I confeſs, given me an exalted opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:031609_0003_0FED5AD13B176930"/>of him. Was I inclined to engage-in the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal controverſy, I ſhould chooſe for my opponent, one that is better able to manage a diſpute, than he appears to me to be. What good purpoſe would it ſerve to write, though it were never ſo clearly and ſtrongly, when one knows before hand, that little notice may be taken of what is wrote, and yet the whole be completely anſwered?—He has ſaid but little, very little but what has been anſwered an hundred times over, and with arguments much too powerful to be ſet aſide by him.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry your lot is caſt among thoſe who are deeply tinctured with high-church principles. Such are always bigots themſelves, and zealouſly endeavor to make others ſo too. This was the caſe among us in former years; but theſe high-flying notions are now almoſt abſorbed in a more generous way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There are but few who dare openly profeſs their adherence to theſe tenets, whatever their private thoughts may be. 'Tis indeed high time they were univerſally eradicated out of men's minds, they are ſo ſenſeleſs in themſelves, as well as contrary to the word of God.</p>
            <p>However, as the caſe is circumſtanced with you, it may be well for you to take him to taſk, and point out his weakneſs; which, as I imagine, you will find no difficult matter.</p>
            <p>It would be doing too much honour to him, for us both to be engaged in the diſpute with him: Though I believe it is in reality a diſpute with the combined clergy in thoſe parts. By the account I have of Mr. L. he is not equal to the performance that comes out in his name, however inſufficient it may be as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to either of us.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN I preached and publiſhed my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon ordination, I had no thoughts of engaging in a controverſy. Providence had caſt my lot in that part of Chriſt's vineyard, where there are ſundry epiſcopalians, interſperſed among the people of my charge, as well as in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Though I never could find any ſcripture warrant, for the peculiarities that diſtinguiſh that church from the reſt of the proteſtant world; tho' it has many defects in its orders, worſhip and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and is conſiderably different from the plan laid down by our Saviour and his apoſtles, and followed by the primitive chriſtians in the next ſucceeding ages; yet as it appears to have the eſſentials of religion, it has ever been my prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to treat its profeſſors as chriſtian brethren, tho' miſtaken in ſome points; agreeable to the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic direction,
<q>Him that is weak in the faith receive, but not to doubtful diſputations.</q> A wrangling diſputatious temper among the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, eſpecially among the miniſters of the Prince of Peace, is odious and unchriſtian. As the things in which we agree, are, by all allowed, to be of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater importance than thoſe in which we differ; how can that zeal be defended which ſpends itſelf only, or principally, about the latter, while the former are treated with comparative neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? Is it not much more becoming the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of chriſtians and miniſters of the goſpel, to lay aſide theſe bickerings, and unite our endeavours
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:031609_0004_0FED5A9894C517C8"/>in oppoſing the growing cauſe of infidelity and irreligon, and promoting the more important truths of our common chriſtianity? Theſe are the principles agreeable to which I have ever treated our epiſcopal diſſenters: And I challenge the whole party <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> produce an inſtance, in which I have ever begun a diſpute with them upon the controverted points, or attempted, publicly or privately, to prejudice them againſt their own worſhip or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry. I eſteem it a greater honour to promote the real intereſt of religion, than that of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular denomination; and, if I know my own hears, had much rather be the happy inſtrument of ſavingly converting one ſoul to Chriſt; than of making a thouſand proſelytes, merely to the low deſigns of a party. It has ever given me pain, to obſerve the prevalence of a contrary temper and conduct, in thoſe of any denomination, whether clergy or laity. How far this has been the caſe with the epiſcopalians in theſe parts, would, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be deemed invidious in me to ſay. Sure I am, if I had not obſerved too many inſtances of this kind; had I not been repeatedly ſolicited, to preach and publiſh upon the ſubject, as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary antidote againſt the effects of them; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I am now called upon to vindicate, never would have ſeen the light. In compoſing of it, I ſtudiouſly guarded againſt every thing offenſive; for I had no deſire to be drawn into a controverſy. Had I been diſpoſed to this, I could not have been at a loſs for materials. It is well known, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the exorbitant, unſcriptural claims of their biſhops, and the mean, ſervile ſubjection of the preſbyters, in that church; there are ſome things in her articles, and in her worſhip and diſcipline many more, which are, (at leaſt in our opinion) highly exceptionable. However naturally many of theſe things fell in my way, while writing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:031609_0004_0FED5A9894C517C8"/>this ſubject, I carefully ſuppreſſed them; for my maxim was to act only on the defenſive, and endeavour, by ſcripture and reaſon, to vindicate our miniſterial authority from the perpetual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of the party. In theſe circumſtances, I had reaſon to conclude, that the moſt ſanguine and zealous among them would not be offended, or look upon themſelves concerned to anſwer me, either from the pulpit or the preſs. But no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was the piece publiſhed, than the epiſcopa pulpits, here and in the neighborhood, reſounded with the old cry, "the power, the power;" and repeatedly rung over all the various changes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>nullity</hi> of preſbyterian orders and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the abſolute <hi>neceſſity</hi> of uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and the <hi>unalterable and divine right</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> epiſcopacy. And among the reſt, it was ſaid, Mr. L. often diſtinguiſhed himſelf upon the topic, with ſingular pathos and zeal.</p>
            <p>IT was ſoon given out, that an anſwer to my piece would be publiſhed: But as no particular author was named, and the rumour abated; it was generally concluded, as they had no call to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the controverſy, the deſign was laid aſide. However, after a preparation of near three years, Mr. L. has ſeen fit to ſtep forth, and favor the public with the firſt fruits of his pen, in what he is pleaſed to call
<q>A defence of the epiſcopal government of the church, containing remarks upon two late noted ſermons, on preſbyterian ordination.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT I was to expect, from ſuch an opponent, I was at a loſs to determine; having never had a taſte of his abilities for managing a controverſy. When the book came out, I read it with a good degree of attention; and was not a little ſurprized to find, that after ſo long preparation, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had ſo little to ſay, upon the two pieces he had
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:031609_0005_0FED5A9C57322028"/>ſet himſelf to anſwer. As to Dr. Chauncy's, the Dr. juſtly obſerves, nineteen parts in twenty are paſſed over without a ſingle remark. And as to mine, whoever compares it with Mr. L's anſwer, will, I am confident, make much the ſame remark. Whether he has ſo fully ſucceeded, in thoſe parts he pretends to anſwer, muſt be ſubmitted to the judgment of the public, to which I appeal.</p>
            <p>FOR theſe and ſuch like reaſons, it was judged at firſt, that to attempt an anſwer was no ways neceſſary. But as the party ſoon began to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in it, as an unanſwerable piece, and boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of great exploits done by it, in the addition of ſundry converts to the epiſcopal cauſe; it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally concluded, that ſomething ought to be wrote by way of reply. This, I hoped, would have been undertaken by Dr. Chauncy, as every way my ſuperior, eſpecially in his acquaintance with this controverſy. But as he has declined the ſervice, for the reaſons mentioned in his letter, prefixed to theſe ſheets; it of courſe devolves upon me.</p>
            <p>As I am conſcious of no other motive in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, than a ſincere regard to truth, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of our churches, which I really believe to be the intereſt of the Redeemer's kingdom; I ſhall endeavour fairly to examine <hi>every thing</hi> in Mr. L's book, that looks like an argument, and give it its due weight. For as it is truth rather than victory I aim at; ſo the former will ſhine brighteſt when placed in <hi>contraſt</hi> with every thing that oppoſes it; and as to the latter, he who ſhould challenge it for only <hi>nibbling</hi> at here and there a ſentence in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, muſt I conceive, appear with a very ill grace. This, however, will make me more leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, than might otherwiſe be thought needful.</p>
            <p>ONE thing I think proper to premiſe.—Since, notwithſtanding the caution uſed, both by the Dr.
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:031609_0005_0FED5A9C57322028"/>and myſelf, to avoid a controverſy with epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians, they have ſeen fit to engage in one; and will not ſuffer us even to defend our cauſe, when called upon ſo to do, without taking the alarm; I ſhall not look upon myſelf holden to obſerve the like caution, in that reſpect, as I did in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. If therefore in the courſe of this diſpute, I ſhould happen to treat them with leſs ceremony: If there ſhould occaſionally drop from my pen, any direct reflections, or free animadverſions, upon ſome very exceptionable and unſcriptural parts of their ſcheme, when they fall in my way, I requeſt the candid reader to impute it to the proper cauſe.</p>

               <p>MR. L. has uſhered his "defence" into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic view, with a letter ſigned, S. I. Who this gentleman is, we are not concerned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. As he has ſeen fit to give us only the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial letters of his name, and left us to gueſs the reſt; he muſt expect no more ceremony than any anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous writer, whatever honorary titles he may happen to be dignified with.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>OUR opponents, ſays he, have of late, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any provocation, been muſtering up their old ſophiſms againſt the ancient epiſcopal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the church, which have been long ago abundantly anſwered over and over.</q> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the gentleman thinks all arguments againſt his ſcheme, deſerve the name of <hi>ſophiſms.</hi> He ſhould remember however, that though to call an argument that pinches, by an ugly name, may be an eaſy method to get rid of it; yet in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the candid, a ſolid refutation would be more ſatisfactory. That our arguments are <hi>old,</hi> is readily granted; for ſo is truth: But that they are the worſe or the weaker upon that account, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not. Nor does it appear that theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been all abundantly, I mean ſolidly <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi> To pretend to anſwer an argument, is one
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031609_0006_0FED5AB1AAFAEA18"/>thing; to do it effectually, another. The former, in the preſent caſe, we allow. The latter perhaps wants proof: We have only his bare word for it; and as he ſeems to be an intereſted perſon, the public, and not he, will be preſumed the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt judge. But then,
<q>Theſe ſophiſms have been muſtered up againſt the <hi>ancient</hi> epiſcopal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the church.</q> Had he ſaid againſt the <hi>preſent</hi> government of the church of England, as explained by ſome of her zealous ſons; the words would have read as well, and been more agreeable to truth. Every ſect, almoſt, is apt to boaſt of its antiquity; and if bare <hi>aſſertions</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as proof, one has as good a claim to the honour as another. That the preſent government of the church of England, is <hi>epiſcopal,</hi> none will deny: But that it is very <hi>ancient,</hi> at leaſt ſo <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> as ſome of its advocates pretend, is by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny denied. As to myſelf, I am fully perſuaded, that notwithſtanding all its high pretences to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; it is comparatively a mere novel, upſtart inſtitution. So far from being the true <hi>ancient</hi> epiſcopacy, that prevailed in the apoſtles times, and the ages next following; that it is, in many reſpects, diametrically oppoſite to it and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of it. This, I preſume, will appear in the following pages.</p>
               <p>BUT after all, if we had attacked even the church of England, without <hi>provocation,</hi> it was doubtleſs wrong. This is a charge commonly brought by our epiſcopalians. Notwithſtanding the uncommon generoſity, with which they are treated in this country, and the ſingular indulgence of the ſtate towards them, above what was ever ſhewn to <hi>diſſenters,</hi> in any part of the chriſtian world; they are often complaining of oppoſition and ill-uſage. At leaſt, if we will believe them, they never begin a controverſy. They are forced
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031609_0007_0FED5A8A8865BFF0"/>into it, in their own defence. This gentleman tells us,
<q>theſe opponents, (meaning, I ſuppoſe, Dr. Chauncy and I) have of late been muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. againſt the church, <hi>without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi>
                  </q> Mr. L. ſays,
<q>I am fully perſuaded, upon the ſtricteſt enquiry, it will be found, that there cannot be one ſingle inſtance produced, for thirty years paſt, in which our clergy have begun the diſpute.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Defence, p. 7.</note> And,
<q>When the church of England is <hi>attacked,</hi> her clergy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they ought to <hi>defend</hi> it.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 8.</note> His book is
<q>therefore called a <hi>defence,</hi> &amp;c. And this is the only reaſon that cauſes him to publiſh this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>
                  </q> But is this repreſentation honeſt? Are preſbyterians ſuch quarrelſome neighbors, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be <hi>attacking</hi> the church of England? And <hi>beginning</hi> the controverſy with her, <hi>without provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Nothing leſs. The firſt piece wrote upon the controverſy, in this country, was on the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ſide. And the firſt in this colony, by one with whom, I preſume, S. I. is intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. What then can theſe gentlemen mean, by <hi>attacks</hi> upon the church of England? Had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Dr. or I, denied her the eſſentials of a true church; had we diſputed the <hi>validity</hi> of her miniſtry;—pronounced a <hi>nullity</hi> upon her admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtrations;—ranked her clergy among the ſons of <hi>Korah,</hi> or her members with <hi>heathen Jews</hi> and <hi>infidels;</hi> or had we <hi>directly</hi> attempted to expoſe any of thoſe many things, which are, at leaſt, highly exceptionable in her doctrines, diſcipline, orders, and worſhip; they might, with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety ſound the alarm, and cry,
<q>an <hi>attack</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the church.</q> Every one knows, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon theſe <hi>cants</hi> are, from a certain quarter. But is there any thing of this kind in the pieces Mr.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031609_0007_0FED5A8A8865BFF0"/>L. pretends to anſwer? Certainly nothing. They bravely <hi>defend</hi> our miniſtry, from the exceptions of theſe zealous advocates for epiſcopacy, whoſe high-flying principles, lead them to anathematize all of our communion, and leave all the proteſtant world, but themſelves, to the uncovenanted mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God. According to theſe gentlemen, it ſeems, there can be no defence of preſbyterian principles, however modeſt, without <hi>attacking</hi> the church of England. This is a great miſtake. Let but the church of England, even in her preſent form, be put upon her original and true footing;— let her reſt upon the foundation, which the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and all her moderate and catholic ſons ſince, have fixed for her; I mean <hi>the civil authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King and parliament;</hi> and they never need fear being <hi>attacked</hi> by us. A <hi>defence</hi> of preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ordination and government, will be no direct oppoſition to the church of England, in this view of it. Had there never been any higher claims for her, (and, to me, it is clear there never oughts) Had her ſons in this country, contented themſelves, with challenging for her, the honour of being a valuable branch of the reformation, and of having the authority in England, engaged for her eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment and ſupport there; I am confident, "the annual lecture in Cambridge," at which Mr. L. is ſo much nettled, never would have had a being; nor the pieces he pretends to anſwer, have ſeen the light.</p>
               <p>BUT the grand ſecret no doubt is:—The cauſe of epiſcopacy is to be puſhed in America, at all events. And, upon trial, this it ſeems, has been found the beſt expedient—to unhinge and perplex the minds of ignorant people,—to fill their heads with airy notions of the <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ordination, prejudice them againſt their own miniſters, as having no <hi>commiſſion</hi> from Chriſt, no <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:031609_0008_0FED5A83C1788E70"/>to perform the divine offices of religion, and boldly pronouncing <hi>nullity</hi> upon all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations. This is the general ſtrain of all the pieces upon the controverſy, that have been wrote in this country. If this was not Mr. L.'s deſign, he had no call to engage in the diſpute. This, however, is no new art. All oppoſers of religion, have ever made their moſt ſucceſsful attacks, through the ſides of its clergy. Thus did Korah, Dathan and Abiram. They fell upon Moſes and Aaron, and denied their authority, as officers in God's church. "Ye take too much upon you." The ſcribes and phariſees did the ſame in their oppoſition to chriſtianity in its infancy. They "compaſſed ſea and land to make proſelytes," they attacked the divine author of the goſpel, and boldly queſtioned his authority, as a public officer in the church.
<q>By what <hi>authority</hi> doſt thou theſe things? And who gave thee this <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
                  </q> The apoſtle Paul met with the ſame treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Judaizing teachers, (who, by the way, were notable ſticklers for uninſtituted rites and ceremonies in religion,) traduced his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, denied his miniſterial authority, and in that way endeavoured to prejudice people's mind, and draw off a party to follow them. This laid him often, under the diſagreeable neceſſity, of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating himſelf againſt ſuch aſperſions; as may be ſeen in his epiſtles. The grand topic of declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of papiſts, againſt proteſtants, has ever been this.
<q>You have thrown off the pope's authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeparated from the <hi>catholic apoſtolic</hi> church; you have therefore no <hi>authentic miniſtry,</hi> no <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid</hi> goſpel adminiſtrations.</q> The ſame clamor was raiſed in England, by the non-jurors, againſt the church of England, at the revolution. And moſt of us remember, how ſucceſsful the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice has been, in the hands of our enthuſiaſtic ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031609_0008_0FED5A83C1788E70"/>of this country, in the late times.—But to return.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>FOR ten years, ſays Mr. L. before this, the church of England and <hi>diſſenters,</hi> lived in a peaceful ſtate: But ſince they have publiſhed ſo many things againſt that church, it has a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſconcerted the deſign of our clergy.</q> If the "deſign of their clergy" is to promote prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical godlineſs, and make converts to Jeſus Chriſt; I am at a loſs to find any thing in the books he ſpeaks of, tending to <hi>diſconcert</hi> it. But if their grand <hi>deſign</hi> is, to convert <hi>preſbyterians</hi> to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of <hi>prelacy,</hi> and make proſelytes to the church of England, I don't doubt but that it has been a little, perhaps not a very little <hi>diſconcerted,</hi> by the publications aforeſaid.—He adds,
<q>Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, as much as poſſible, to live peaceably with all men.</q>—Peace, without doubt, is a very deſirable thing; but if <hi>truth</hi> muſt be the purchaſe of it, we beg to be excuſed. We ſhould heartily rejoice to find them, ever more diſpoſed to a <hi>peaceful</hi> conduct, than at preſent they appear to be; and are not conſcious of any thing on our ſide, to make them otherwiſe. But if their <hi>deſigns are diſconcerted,</hi> by opening peoples eyes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the truth; if their tempers are ſoured, and they become unſociable, and <hi>unpeaceful,</hi> by a bare detection of the weakneſs of their cauſe, and they are reſolved not to live in <hi>peace,</hi> unleſs we will give up all pretences to the character of miniſters and chriſtians, and, right or wrong, come over to their party; we muſt plainly tell them, they hold their friendſhip too dear.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>THIS conduct of their miniſters, ſays S. I. to his client, has made it neceſſary for us to write again, in defence of the church; and I am glad, and thank you, that you have undertaken this office, and ſo well acquitted yourſelf in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031609_0009_0FED5AE9136C1F48"/>of it.</q> How well Mr. L. has acquitted himſelf in this <hi>office,</hi> muſt be left to the reader.— However, if all our arguments are but <hi>ſophiſms;</hi> eſpecially if they
<q>have been long ago abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered over and over by others;</q> 'tis no great purchaſe to do it again. But a ſmattering of logic will ſerve, to anſwer a <hi>ſophiſm,</hi> and detect its fallacy. And if in the preſent caſe, this has been ſo often done before, ſome perhaps may be ready to doubt, whether Mr. L. has not acted the <hi>plagiary,</hi> and only publiſhed the works of others, in his own name. Beſides, if all our <hi>ſophiſms</hi> have been ſo often, ſo abundantly anſwered before, what occaſion was there for doing of it again?— Not that I would detract from Mr. L.'s perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. It is really better than I expected from <hi>him;</hi> and, ſo far as he enters into the ſubject, as good, I imagine, as the cauſe will well admit. After all, I can hardly think he has done quite ſo much exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with it, as his friend ſuppoſes. According to him, all our arguments ſtand no more chance, before the formidable artillery of this mighty champion, than mere cobwebs or puffballs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mouth of a roaring cannon.
<q>They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly vaniſh into duſt and ſmoke.</q>
                  <q>But no wonder: Since whatever plauſible appearance they make, they are but mere cavils.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THEIR chief appearance of ſtrength, he adds, lies in the promiſcuous uſe of the words, biſhop and preſbyter.</q> This gentleman muſt allow me to tell him, he here labours under a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. If he had read the pieces he makes ſo free with, he muſt have ſeen that we argue the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preſbyterian ordination, from the one general commiſſion to miniſters in the goſpel. As this commiſſion belongs to all Chriſt's miniſters, we think they muſt be intitled to all the powers it contains; therefore to ordination, which is one of theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031609_0009_0FED5AE9136C1F48"/>We argue it, from all goſpel miniſters being ſucceſſors to the apoſtles, in their ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and ſo poſſeſſed of all the powers belonging to them, in that capacity, of which ordination is indubitably one.—We argue it, from there being but one kind, or order of miniſters, to be found in the New-Teſtament,—but one ſet of qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations required,—one general work or buſineſs aſſigned,—and only one method of introduction into office preſcribed for them all. Finally, we produce, as we think, plain and expreſs inſtances, from ſcripture, of ordination by preſbyters, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, which is more than our opponents have ever been able to do, for epiſcopal ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though often requeſted ſo to do.</p>
               <p>'TIS true,
<q>the promiſcuous uſe of the words, biſhop and preſbyter in ſcripture</q> is one of our arguments, and, we think, a good one. For if theſe names were applied in common to all goſpel miniſters at that time; if every ſcripture preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was really a biſhop then, we ſee no reaſon why it ſhould be otherwiſe now. At leaſt the inſtance he brings to convince us of our miſtake; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that though biſhop and preſbyter were one office in the apoſtles times, yet they <hi>ought</hi> not to be ſo now; does not ſeem ſo happily choſen to prove the point, though it ſerves well enough, to ſhew how the alteration was introduced into the chriſtian church, the motives leading to it, and the means uſed to accompliſh it.</p>
               <p>THE inſtance he produces is this.—<q>They might, ſays he, with juſt the ſame reaſon, argue and conclude, that Pompey and Auguſtus were of the ſame office, becauſe they were both call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>imperatores;</hi> when all the world knows, that within 50 years, (as the caſe hath often been with other words) a different ſet of ideas was
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031609_0010_0FED5A9F1D2BAAA8"/>annexed to that word from what it meant 50 years before: Which was plainly the caſe, with the word, biſhop, when the church came to be ſettled, &amp;c.</q> The truth of the fact he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to the Roman ſtate. I readily allow,— nor will I diſpute the propriety of the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It has indeed, in this inſtance, (as he juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves) fared with the chriſtian church, much as it did with the ancient Roman common-wealth. While Rome was free, and retained her happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican form of government; the term, <hi>impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> meant only an officer in the army, of equal authority with his brother officers of the ſame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. But when Julias Caeſar, that grand uſurper, not content with the original honours and powers of his office, as general; but fired with unbounded thirſt of dominion, found means to deſtroy the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient form of government, and enſlave his country; then he appropriated the title to himſelf and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and ſo the word, <hi>imperator,</hi> in proceſs of time, came to ſignify, one of ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>hers, both in the army and ſtate.</p>
               <p>AND has it not happened, even ſo, with the word, <hi>biſhop,</hi> in the chriſtian church? Originally it ſignified, <hi>barely</hi> a miniſter of Chriſt, a ſtanding officer in the church, only of equal power with the reſt of his brethren in the miniſtry. But the church of Rome, in imitation of the ſtate, have long ſince, deſtroyed the original parity, that firſt ſubſiſted among the goſpel miniſters, and, togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the <hi>power,</hi> appropriated the <hi>title</hi> of biſhop, in its higheſt ſignification, to the pope, the grand uſurper and enſlaver of God's people, in ſpirituals, and made him lord paramount, over all the officers and members in the church of Chriſt. And pity it is, that any proteſtant church, ſhould ſo far af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ape and imitate them, as to adulterate the ſcriptural meaning of the word, biſhop, to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031609_0010_0FED5A9F1D2BAAA8"/>the title to a pretended ſuperior order of officers in the church, as expreſſive of a lordly authority over their brethren in the miniſtry, who were all originally upon a level, as to power; all true ſcripture-biſhops. Is not this too much like ſymbolizing with the church of Rome, the moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of harlots and abominations? Is it not too lightly departing from the ſcripture pattern, and treating with too much neglect, that ſolemn cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, given by the great head of the church, to his miniſters,
<q>be ye not called <hi>rabbi, maſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>LET the candid reader now judge, whether there is not ſome weight in this argument, drawn from the <hi>identity</hi> of
<q>the names, biſhop and preſbyter in ſcripture</q> in ſupport of preſbyterian ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after all this gentleman has ſaid to defeat it? Or whether it is, as he ſays,
<q>a mere <hi>logomachy,</hi> or ſtrife about words, fixing modern ideas to old names?</q> Beſides, who is it that has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced this logomachy,
<q>this ſtrife about words?</q> Who,
<q>that affix modern ideas to old names?</q> They, who have affixed to the name biſhop, originally the ſame, by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, with preſbyter; the
<q>modern additional ideas</q> of ſuperior authority, and a lordly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, over his brother biſhops and fellow preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters? Or we, who conſider him, in the ſame ſtate of equality with his brethren, in which the ſcripture has fixed him? They, who arrogate to him, the ſole power of ordination and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Or we, who, agreeable to ſcripture pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, leave theſe powers in common to all goſpel miniſters? If there is any adulteration, any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of words from their original ſignification, "or affixing modern ideas to old names," let thoſe be anſwerable who have given the occaſion.</p>

NOTHING of conſequence occurs in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of this letter, but what we ſhall meet with in the piece it accompanies, and which will be there conſidered. He indeed tells us
<q>they maintain</q> the ancient government of the church "was epiſcopal;" that Timothy was an inſtance of it at Epheſus, and the apocalyptic angel anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp;c. &amp;c. To which he finally adds, the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the fathers, who, if we may believe him, were all upon their ſide of the queſtion: And then ſays;—<q>They, (the fathers) muſt have as well known the form, in which the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, under divine inſpiration, eſtabliſhed and left the church; as we now know how ours was, in Q. Elizabeth's time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>IT is not true in fact, that theſe ancient fathers, had ſuch perfect knowledge of the original inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the church, or that their writings in this caſe are ſo certainly to be depended upon, as his argument ſuppoſes. If their writings are a ſure guide for us in one caſe, they are in another. But 'tis well known theſe ſame fathers maintained the doctrine of the millennium, and practiſed giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſacrament to infants; and moreover de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they received theſe things from the apoſtles themſelves. This they aſſert as fully, as they do the doctrine this gentleman cites them to prove. And yet his church, and all others, for many hundred years, reject the teſtimony of the fathers in the aforeſaid inſtances, as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the word of God. But further, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aſſertion to be true,
<q>that theſe writers knew as well what form of government prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the apoſtles times, as we do, what was the eſtabliſhment of the church of England in Q. Elizabeth's time;</q> yet this will not prove that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan epiſcopacy is of divine right. This gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and other zealots of his party, aſſert, that epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy 
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031609_0011_0FED5AD67103E1D0"/>in England, at the time of the reformation, was ſettled upon the foot of divine inſtitution.— Others, not only preſbyterians, but many eminent and learned epiſcopalians, affirm the contrary:— They deny it has any pretence of divine right in its original eſtabliſhment, but reſts wholly upon the civil authority and acts of parliament, for its exiſtence in its preſent form. Now both of theſe opinions can't be true. If then we can't, at this day, certainly know, upon what footing the church of England ſtood in the reign of Q. Elizabeth; we certainly cannot know from the writings of theſe fathers, what was the apoſtolic inſtitution of the church, even allowing that they knew it, as well as we do, what was eſtabliſhed by Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and her parliament: For, it ſeems, we are far from being agreed in that, and therefore don't certainly know it.—But what ſpoils the whole of this argument for epiſcopacy, is that it takes for granted a fact which is not true.
<q>The fathers teſtify in favour of dioceſan epiſcopacy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of divine inſtitution.</q> I deny the fact. It is ſo far from being true, that any of the fathers of the two firſt centuries, declare in favour of dioceſan epiſcopacy, much leſs that this was the form of church government handed down to them from the apoſtles; that, on the contrary, their writings unanimouſly exhibit to view a form, diametrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to and abſolutely deſtructive of, the preſent dioceſan epiſcopacy, that prevails in the church of England. This I propoſe to prove in its proper place, to which I refer the reader.</p>
               <p>HE goes on; <q>This was always <hi>my way</hi> of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.</q> Anſwer. Some men are obſerved, to have a very odd and wrong-headed <hi>way</hi> of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all their days. But barely its being <hi>their way,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> they have always been uſed to, will not prove it to be a good one, or ſerve to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to thoſe, who have been accuſtomed to a better <hi>way.</hi>

HE adds,
<q>juſt in the ſame way do our diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neighbours, with us, very rightly argue the cauſe of infant baptiſm, and the firſt day ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; only they have not near ſo many clear, inconteſtible facts, either of ſcripture or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, for them, as we have for epiſcopacy; ſo that they muſt either give up <hi>them,</hi> or embrace <hi>that,</hi> or be ſelf-condemned, as inconſiſtent with themſelves.</q>—I anſwer. There is, at leaſt in our opinion, much better evidence, both from ſcripture and antiquity, in ſupport of infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the firſt day ſabbath; than for dioceſan epiſcopacy. But if there were not, there is this material difference between us and them. They, from ſcripture and antiquity, are convinced, as they tell us, that dioceſan epiſcopacy is of divine inſtitution, and therefore practice it. But then they virtually exclude all other chriſtians, from the benefits of the goſpel, by denying the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their clergy, and the validity of their admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtrations, and leaving them in the deplorable ſtate of heathen and infidels.—We, on the other hand, from the ſame teſtimonies, believe infant baptiſm, and the firſt day ſabbath. We accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly practice them. But then,
<q>we have not ſo learned Chriſt,</q> as to think it our duty, either by our principles or practice, to unchurch and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianize all who differ from us in theſe points: But, if they are otherwiſe qualified, cheerfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their miniſters into our pulpits, and their members to communion, in goſpel ordinances.— We are content to enjoy our principles, without taking upon us to damn all who differ from us.— Upon the whole then, we don't find ourſelves greatly embarraſſed with this powerful <hi>dilemma,</hi> in which he means to entangle us, in order to draw us over to the church. We really think, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all he has ſaid, we may ſafely retain
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031609_0012_0FED5AB50E8018E0"/>our old principles and practice, without incurring the character of ſelf-inconſiſtency, in the judgment of the impartial, or feeling the reproaches of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemnation in our own conſciences.</p>
               <p>HIS letter concludes with theſe words.—<q>Let us then faithfully adhere to the doctrine, gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and liturgy OF THE MOST EXCELLENT CHURCH OF ENGLAND, WHICH CERTAINLY ARE, AND HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE, THE MOST SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURAL, OF ANY NOW IN THE WORLD.</q>—A high encomium! and if juſt, abundantly ſufficient to recommend his beloved epiſcopacy to the good graces of all mankind. Let him only favour us with ſufficient proof of his aſſertion, and we will, at once, quit our preſent way, and all in a body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cordial proſelytes, to his moſt excellent, truly apoſtolic, and beſt conſtituted church in the world. Till then, he muſt allow us a little to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate,—to conſider who this pompous character comes from. Poſſibly it may be juſt.—Of this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he has given us no proof but his bare word. Perhaps he may have obſerved, that it is no new thing for men to cry;
<q>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are theſe.</q> All men are apt to like their own principles beſt, and entertain a partial fondneſs for their <hi>own way.</hi> And for ought I can ſee,—the cry, of
<q>THE MOST EXCELLENT CHURCH, THE MOST SCRIPTUAL, PURE, PRIMITIVE DOCTRINE, GOVERNMENT AND LITURGY OF ANY IN THE WORLD,</q> are words, that ſound as ſmooth and harmoniouſly in the ear, and offer full as much conviction to the underſtanding of an impartial judge, from the mouth of any other enthuſiaſtic ſectary, as from that of an epiſcopal <hi>diſſenter</hi> in New-England.

               </head>
               <p>MR. L. charges me with a miſtake, in calling Mark an apoſtle
<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 30.</note>. My words are,
<q>Thus Matthew, Mark and John, are all called evangel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, tho' at the ſame time they ſuſtained the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of apoſtles.</q> How I came to make the miſtake of calling Mark an apoſtle, I know not, unleſs through inadvertency; as knowing it no ways affected the argument, whether he in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular bore that character or no. A miſtake how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I confeſs it was, and thank him for pointing it out. I ſhall now do him the ſame friendly office, in pointing out a few of his; ſome of which greatly affect the ſubject he is upon. The firſt I ſhall notice is a general one that runs thro' his piece, as well as the letter prefixed to it; I mean, his calling thoſe of our communion in this country, <hi>diſſenters.</hi> 'Tis pity, I think, theſe gentlemen don't conſider where they live, before they give themſelves ſuch airs. Not that I imagine there is any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful in the name, when properly applied, though doubtleſs this is their meaning. <hi>Diſſenter</hi> is one, who differs from the eſtabliſhed religion of the country where he lives. I muſt therefore
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031609_0013_0FED5A7D8BF4CE68"/>inform him, if he don't know it, that the term is merely <hi>topical.</hi> That in England, for inſtance, the ſame perſon who is a member of the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed church there, conſequently no <hi>diſſenter;</hi> let him but only paſs the Tweed into Scotland, or croſs the Atlantic, and fix in New-England, and he commences a very <hi>diſſenter</hi> as any in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The reaſon is, in the former country, the epiſcopal perſuaſion, in the latter, the preſbyterian or congregational, is the religion by law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This miſtake, I do not pretend, greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the point in diſpute. It may tend however to give people's minds a wrong bias. At leaſt it is always beſt to call things by their proper names. And as Mr. L. as well as I, is a young writer, it may be a kindneſs to him juſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, that however weak and deficient his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, his readers will at leaſt expect of him propriety in point of diction.</p>
               <p>IN page 37, he is chargeable with another miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and that too expreſſed in a manner, hardly conſiſtent with the character of a polite gentleman, upon which, 'tis ſaid, he pretty much values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—What I intend is, his charging me with downright falſehood and diſhoneſty for a certain paſſage in my book. His words are,
<q>Mr. Welles, in P. 27, has theſe remarkable words. By biſhops, they, (the church) mean, I hope, true ſcripture biſhops, not merely creatures of the ſtate, of human inſtitution!</q> On which he very <hi>genteelly</hi> remarks.
<q>I muſt be ſo free as to tell him, he did not hope any ſuch thing, ſo he <hi>knew</hi> the contrary to be true.</q> What he could find in theſe harmleſs expreſſions to awaken his ire, (for he certainly was angry) or what induced him to cite them, and paſs ſuch illiberal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious reflections upon them; I confeſs myſelf
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031609_0014_0FED5AA4E1D27A50"/>utterly at a loſs to determine. Was it that he tho't they carried in them an inſinuation, that their church was really a creature of the ſtate, in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat form, and not of divine inſtitution? No ſuch thing was expreſſed. But if there had, he ought to know that this is the opinion not only of preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians; but of many great and learned writers in his own church; I may ſay, of the generality of the reformers, and all the more moderate epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians ever ſince.

                     <p>Biſhop Whitegift, ſays,
<q>I am perſuaded that the external government of the church, under a chriſtian magiſtrate, muſt be according to the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of government, uſed in the <hi>commonwealth:</hi> Elſe how can you make the prince, ſupreme governor of all ſtates and cauſes occleſiaſtical.</q> Defen. of anſ. 372.</p>
                     <p>Of the ſame opinion were Dr. Edwards, and their celebrated Hooker. The former of which, delivers his own and Mr. Hooker's ſentiments, in theſe words,
<q>The judicious Mr. Hooker holds, that epiſcopacy may be abrogated; conſequently it is not of <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>apoſtolic</hi> right, but the <hi>political inſtitution</hi> of the church.</q>—Edw. remains, 257.</p>
                     <p>Agreeable to which is an act of parliament, in the reign of Hen. VIII. cap. 17, in theſe words,
<q>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, biſhops, archdeacons, and other eccleſiaſtical officers, have no manner of juriſdiction <hi>eccleſiaſtical,</hi> but by, under and from his royal majeſty,—<hi>the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head</hi> of the church of England and Ireland, to whom, by holy ſcripture, all authority and power is wholly given, to hear and determine, all manner of cauſes <hi>eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame is declared in an act of parliament, made 1 Edw. VI. cap. 2.
<q>All authority and juriſdiction, ſpiritual and temporal, is derived and deduced from the King's majeſty, as ſupreme head of theſe churches and realms of England and Ireland.</q>

                     <p>This clearly ſhews, that the epiſcopal government of the church in England, is not ſuppoſed to reſt upon the foundation of ſcripture; but upon the King's authority, as ſupreme head of the church. As a further proof of which, in the beginning of the reformation, biſhops ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually took out their commiſſions from the King, and were promoted by his letters patent; the form of which, as biſhop Burnet tells us, was,
<q>that the King appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch an one to be biſhop, during his natural life, or ſo long as the behaved well, and <hi>gave him power to ordain, or deprive miniſters to exerciſe eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, and perform all other parts of the epiſcopal function,</hi> and this they were to do, IN THE KING'S NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY.</q>

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031609_0014_0FED5AA4E1D27A50"/>contradiction between this ſentence, and the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he pretends to quote from P. 50 of my ſermon? The words I there uſe (for he has not quoted them right) are theſe,
<q>Another argument made uſe of, &amp;c.—is, that the New-Teſtament has actually appointed three diſtinct orders in the goſpel miniſtry, viz. that of biſhops, &amp;c.</q>— Now let the candid reader compare theſe two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and ſee if there be any contradiction: Or any thing that could provoke him to treat me ſo rudely. In one I ſay, epiſcopalians argue their three orders from ſcripture. In the other I expreſs my hope that
<q>by one of thoſe orders, biſhops, they mean ſcripture biſhops.</q> In the former, I aſſert what they declare their belief in this caſe to be. In the latter, I expreſs my charitable hope of their hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty in ſuch declaration. Theſe were the <hi>hopes,</hi> the only <hi>hopes,</hi> I mentioned. But Mr. L. very politely replies, "I muſt be ſo free as to tell him he never <hi>hoped</hi> any ſuch thing. In ſome caſes, I would be far from calling his knowledge in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But how he could know my heart; how he
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031609_0015_0FED5AA694780938"/>could certainly tell what I did, or did not <hi>hope,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond me to conceive. But he tells me, not only that I did not "<hi>hope</hi> ſo;" but that
<q>I <hi>knew</hi> the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to be true.</q> Now if I <hi>knew</hi> the contrary to be true, it muſt be becauſe it <hi>was</hi> true: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is utterly impoſſible I could know it to be true. But what, I aſk, is this <hi>contrary,</hi> which he ſays, I know to be true? Plainly this,
<q>that by biſhops, epiſcopalians do not mean true ſcripture biſhops.</q> This, and nothing elſe, ſtand oppoſed, to what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared was the matter of my hope. All therefore I am able to make of this <hi>remarkable</hi> ſentence, is this. I had ſaid,
<q>I hoped, by biſhops, epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians mean true ſcripture biſhops.</q> Mr. L. denies they mean any ſuch thing. I had declared, that when they talked ſo much about the divine right of epiſcopacy, I was charitably inclined to think they were honeſt. But this gentleman plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells me it is no ſuch thing. Since therefore he muſt be ſuppoſed to know beſt, and will needs have it ſo; I will grant I was miſtaken, as to him in particular; though as to others of his party, he muſt allow me to entertain the ſame charitable opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ſtill; at leaſt till they give me the ſame reaſon to alter it, as he has done in his caſe. If this is not his meaning in <hi>theſe remarkable</hi> words of his; 'tis indeed difficult to ſay, what his meaning is.— They ſeem to have no meaning at all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (to uſe another of his courtly phraſes)
<q>they might have been left out, and his defence would have been as good as it is now.</q>
               </p>
               <p>MR. L. ſeems to be diſpleaſed with the <hi>length</hi> of my ſermon. In page 30 he has theſe words,
<q>Tho' he (Mr. Welle's) <hi>fleers</hi> about our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deacons; yet I believe it is really true, that Stephen preached as good a ſermon as Mr. Welle's <hi>divine right,</hi> &amp;c. though it was not ſo long.</q> I have examined the paſſage, to which he refers in this remark, but can find nothing that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031609_0015_0FED5AA694780938"/>looks like a <hi>fleer</hi> there. After giving an account of the inſtitution of deacons, Acts 6, beginning, and anſwering the arguments they bring for their preaching; I have theſe words,
<q>Since therefore it plainly appears, that theſe deacons, were in no ſenſe, goſpel miniſters, but expreſſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ſet apart to quite another ſervice; it undeniably follows that no order in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian miniſtry can be founded upon this inſtance; and conſequently, that their pretended order of preaching deacons, has no warrant—from the word of God.</q> Now what is there in theſe words, that looks like a <hi>fleer?</hi> It is true, I deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>preaching</hi> was any part of the ſcripture dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con's office; and if after I had proved it was not, I called it, a <hi>pretended order,</hi> &amp;c. I can ſee noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing criminal in it, nothing that looks like <hi>fleering.</hi> The order of preaching deacons in the church of England, is either a <hi>real</hi> and ſcriptural, or a <hi>pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and unſcriptural one. The former he knows we deny. He knows it was the very thing I was then diſproving; and if, when I had, as I thought, ſufficiently diſproved it, I called it a <hi>pretended</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I can ſee no reaſon he had to be offended. I hope he would not have me call it a <hi>real ſcriptural</hi> order of the miniſtry, when I did not believe it to be ſo, and had proved it not to be ſo.—But
<q>he believes it is really true, that Stephen preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as good a ſermon as mine, tho' it was not ſo long.</q> Poſſibly he does; tho' why he believes it, he has not told us. Sure I am, the ſcripture, to which he ſo often appeals, furniſhes no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it. That indeed gives a lengthy account of this <hi>protomartyr,</hi> but ſays not a word about his <hi>preaching</hi> as I can find. 'Tis true it ſpeaks of his <hi>diſputing;</hi> but then Mr. L. I preſume, will not pretend that all <hi>diſputing</hi> is <hi>preaching.</hi> He has <hi>diſputed</hi> againſt my ſermon; but he has not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly told us, he ever <hi>preached</hi> againſt it, tho' oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031609_0016_0FED5AC455E57BE8"/>ſay he did at ſundry places and times. Wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er his <hi>ſermon,</hi> upon theſe occaſions, was <hi>langer</hi> or <hi>ſherter,</hi> whether it was <hi>better</hi> or worſe than mine, as it is of little importance, I am not anxious to know. Be that as it will, I do not ſee what great reaſon <hi>he</hi> had to complain of the <hi>length</hi> of my ſermon; ſince long as it is, it has given him ſo little trouble. For all he profeſſedly attempts to anſwer of it, is only my firſt argument, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compriſed in little more than two pages, could not, one would think, give him any great pain.— Whether it was the <hi>length,</hi> or the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the other arguments, that diſcouraged him from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with them; as he has not ſeen fit to tell us, every one muſt be left to conjecture for himſelf.</p>
               <p>THE pieces Mr. L. attempts to anſwer, had <hi>occaſionally</hi> mentioned "the right of people to chooſe their miniſters." This he has repeatedly remarked upon, tho' not directly connected with the main point; while ſundry arguments that were, are paſſed by unnoticed. What could be his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for this, is difficult to gueſs. Perhaps he tho't ſo long as people were left to claim and prize this invaluable privilege; all he could ſay upon his <hi>divine-right</hi> and <hi>beſt conſtituted-church,</hi> would be inſufficient to draw them away from a communion, where this priviledge is enjoyed, to one where it is utterly denied. He attacks Dr. Chauncy upon this head, and ſpends near two pages in endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to diſprove it; and, as if that was too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he falls upon it again in his remarks upon me. He demands of the Dr.
<q>Where we find in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this to be declared a part of chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</q> &amp;c. I preſume, ſcripture pattern will ſatisfy for proof of this point, ſince it is all they <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> to bring for epiſcopacy, and much more than they are able to produce. And of this kind of proof there is plenty in ſcripture. From the goſpel hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory it appears, that this was the univerſal prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031609_0016_0FED5AC455E57BE8"/>in the apoſties times. When the vacancy made in the breach of apoſtles, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

To theſe, many more might eaſily be added, from the ſame quarter. I ſhall ſubjoin one from Cyprian, biſhop of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, who flouriſhed A.D. 250.
<q>The people, ſays he, have the chief power of <hi>chooſing</hi> worthy miniſters, and refuſing the unworthy.</q> He adds,

<q>author of the inquiry into the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, &amp;c. of the primitive church,</q> ſuppoſed to be Sr. Peter King, afterwards lord chancellor, abundantly proves, from numerous teſtimonies, that this was the univerſal practice of the primitive church, for people to chooſe their own miniſters. And indeed, the contrary practice is ſo repugnant to reaſon, to all notions of liberty, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal cuſtom in all other caſes, that, one would think, nothing but the higheſt degree of prejudice could reconcile people to it. Do not we eſteem it a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege to chooſe our civil rulers, and look upon the people as in a degree of ſlavery, who are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprived of it? Would we ſubmit to have others chooſe for us a lawyer to defend our property, or a phyſician to take care of our health,—and oblige us to improve theſe and no other? Certainly no. But if we are ſo tenacious of our natural rights, where our temporal intereſt and bodily health only are concerned,—how much more ought we to be, in things that relate to the health of our ſouls, our future and eternal intereſt? Surely as much more, as the latter exceeds the former in point of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. No wonder then Mr. L. conſidered the want of this, a very important objection againſt his favourite church; and though ſomewhat beſide
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031609_0017_0FED5AA94EEBE688"/>his ſubject, ſet himſelf ſo zealouſly to remove it. How far he has ſucceeded, I leave to the reader. But if he is not able, wholly, to vindicate his own church in this reſpect, he ſeems to think it ſome excuſe that others, and ours in particular, is in the ſame ſtate. This ſeems to be his meaning in theſe words:
<q>I believe if the matter be carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, it will be found, that the right of the New-England churches, to chooſe their miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is ſounded, not upon ſcripture, but upon the law of the province, which declares who ſhall be the patrons, in each pariſh to chooſe their miniſters. As far as I have been able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this matter, the law of the province conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the heads of the famiſies to chooſe,</q> &amp;c.
<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>How far Mr. L.
<q>has been able to underſtand this matter,</q> he muſt know beſt. The <hi>defect of</hi> his underſtanding, it is not in my power to help. Whether it was for want of <hi>underſtanding</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> certain, I am, the account he gives of this affair is not true. According to the law of this colony, (and I ſuppoſe the caſe is much the ſame in the reſt of New-England, where there is an eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical eſtabliſhment) the right of chooſing a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter, is declared to be, not in the heads of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies excluſively; but in them and the members of the church, whether heads of families or not. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this right is not founded, as he ſuppoſes, in the law of the colony, any more than the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any divine law, adopted by the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. The <hi>obligation</hi> in one caſe, and the <hi>right</hi> in the other, is founded in ſcripture. The civil law only recognizes the right, and protects peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the enjoyment and exerciſe of it. And all men acquainted with our eccleſiaſtical conſtitution, know that we are ſo far from having any thing to do, with what he calls
<q>patrons, in each pariſh,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031609_0018_0FED5ADD37B85FB0"/>to chooſe the miniſter;</q> that moſt people know nothing of the term, or what it ſignifies, and I hope, by experience, never may. The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, and all others of our people, who vote in ſociety-meetings for other purpoſes, have all free liberty to vote in the choice of a miniſter. And that they may act with diſcretion in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affair; they have opportunity to make tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the candidate while he is upon probation.— Was it then honeſt in Mr. L. to ſay,
<q>In the ſame way ſocieties, corporations and particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, become <hi>patrons</hi> in the church of England?</q> In that church, <hi>patrons,</hi> clerical or ſecular, chooſe the miniſters for the people. In ours, he is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the church and people themſelves. In the former the biſhop, or ſome lay patron, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never ſaw the candidate, and is never to fit under his miniſtry, has the ſole power of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In the latter, he is elected by the votes of thoſe who have made trial of him, are to maintain him, and attend upon his adminiſtrations. In our method, the law acknowledges the natural and ſcriptural right of the people in this important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and protects them in the enjoyment of it. But in theirs, in defiance of both, their miniſter <hi>is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded</hi> upon them without their conſent. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this view of the caſe,
<q>that good gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, (as Mr. L. calls the Dr.) ſhould real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think their church, ſomewhat culpable in the matter of <hi>patrons;</hi>
                  </q> few people, I preſume, "would greatly wonder at it," ſave he and thoſe of his party; and if, as he ſays,
<q>their church appears to him to ſtand clear of all blame in that matter;</q> it muſt be owing, I think, to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and partiality in a very high degree.</p>
               <p>I FIND but one thing more, in Mr. L's book, proper for this ſection. And that is, the <hi>uncommon</hi> advertiſement tacked to the end of it. I have read it over ſundry times, but can't be certain I have
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031609_0018_0FED5ADD37B85FB0"/>hit upon his meaning after all. He talks much about <hi>conſequences;</hi> cautions his anſwerer againſt "falling upon <hi>conſequences,</hi>" and declares that he "has no concern with <hi>conſequences.</hi>" What he intends by them, is difficult to ſay. A <hi>conſequence</hi> in logic, is an eſſential part of every good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But he can't mean this by his conſequences: For whatever they be, he places them in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>arguments,</hi> for want of which, in confuting his book, they are ſuppoſed to be "fallen upon." And yet this or ſomething like it, muſt be his meaning too; for he warns his antagoniſt againſt "flying from the ſubject," or what he has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in "his book" and "falling upon the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</hi>" But if this be his meaning, he need give himſelf no trouble in the caſe, provided he has only been careful, "to advance" nothing but truth: For truth is ever conſiſtent with itſelf; and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but truth will follow from it, or be the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of it, and this can do him no hurt. But if he has not: If he has advanced things in his book, that are not true, or eſpouſed principles that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

If, for inſtance, he has advanced a ſcheme of church government, which takes the power of diſcipline out of the hands of her proper paſtors, and ſo robs her of this uſeful part of Chriſt's inſtitution: If, according to his principles, the epiſcopal churches in America, cannot be ſaid to have the leaſt ſhadow of diſcipline: If it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows from his poſitions, that it is better to be a papiſt than a preſbyterian, and an ordination received in the church of Rome, "the mother of harlots" is lawful and valid, while one received in the truly proteſtant church of Scotland or Geneva, is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> nul and void.

<q>That it nearly concerns us to know who are the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſters in Chriſt's kingdom.</q> And am well pleaſed with the method he has propoſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this point, viz. "by an appeal to ſcripture and reaſon."

               </p>
               <p>IN the mean time, let us attend to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations he thinks proper to make, previous to his entering upon this deciſion. His firſt obſervation is this,
<q>The whole body of diſſenters, (preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians he means) affirm, that biſhop and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, in ſcripture, ſignify the ſame office: Yet they ſay, no inſtance is to be found there of an ordination, by any perſon unde, the name <hi>biſhop:</hi> And if a preſbyter is the ſame office, then there is none by a preſbyter.</q>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">ibid.</note> But now, who does not ſee the fallacy of this argument? He allows, with us, that biſhop and preſbyter in ſcripture, ſignify the ſame office; that miniſters were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly called by both theſe names, in goſpel times. But then he holds, that the buſineſs of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, &amp;c. ought not to lie in common, to all goſpel-miniſters; but to be confined to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar order, which in their church, are called biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops. We, on the contrary affirm, that as biſhop and preſbyter, in ſcripture, ſignify the ſame office; the power of ordination belongs in common to all miniſters, and therefore ought not to be confined
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031609_0020_0FED5A804C69EAE0"/>to ſome few, under the title of biſhops. To prove this, we obſerve, that though we have ſundry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of ordination, in ſcripture, performed by miniſters, yet there is no ſingle inſtance of one ſo performed by them, under the name <hi>biſhop,</hi> and yet to this, epiſcopalians appropriate the whole power of ordination. But Mr. L. ſays, if this be true, that there is no account in ſcripture of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion performed by any perſon under the name biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op, then it will follow,—What? Why "that there is none by a preſbyter," that is, no inſtance of one performed by a preſbyter. But does it at all follow, that becauſe the ſcripture mentions no ordination as performed by miniſters under their one title of biſhops, therefore there is no inſtance to be found there of their ordaining under their other title, that of preſbyters? Or thus, becauſe the ſcripture never calls miniſters by one of their common names, i. e. biſhops, when acting in ordination; is it a neceſſary conſequence that it never calls them by their other common name, preſbyters, when act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that buſineſs? Is it not poſſible that the ſame office in ſcripture, may be commonly denominated and known by either of the names, biſhop or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter indifferently, and yet only one of theſe names, conſtantly uſed and applied to him, when acting in the buſineſs of ordination? But now this is what his argument proves, or elſe it proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The truth is, he has, either ignorantly or deſignedly, altered the terms in his ſyllogiſm, ſo that his concluſion contains more in it than his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which all logicians call, falſe reaſoning.— His argument reduced to mode and figure, runs thus, <q>Biſhop and preſbyter in ſcripture ſignify the ſame office. No inſtance is to be found there of ordination by any perſon under the name of biſhop.</q> This is his major and minor propoſition. His concluſion is,—<q>Therefore there is no inſtance of an ordination performed
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031609_0021_0FED5A9422AB5DC0"/>by a preſbyter.</q> Whereas, had he kept to the terms in his minor propoſition, his concluſion muſt have been,—"Therefore there is no inſtance of an ordination performed <hi>by any perſon under the name preſbyter.</hi>" Had he done this, his readers would at once have ſeen the weakneſs and fallacy of his argument.</p>
               <p>IN England, biſhop, and lord-ſpiritual are ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous terms. Now ſhould I undertake to prove, that there is no account in the Engliſh hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, of an ordination performed by a biſhop, and in order to it, make uſe of this argument,—Biſhop and lord-ſpiritual ſignify the ſame office: But there is no account in hiſtory, of an ordination perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any perſon under the title of lord-ſpiritual; therefore there is no account of one performed by a biſhop; and from hence ſhould infer, the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of epiſcopal ordination; Mr. L. I preſume would hardly allow the argument to be good.— And yet it is the ſame he has uſed in this caſe, and full as concluſive. However, weak as it is, it ſeems it wrought full conviction in his mind: For he tells us
<q>he is fully perſuaded, at that time in which the ſcriptures were wrote, none had power to ordain miniſters in Chriſt's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but thoſe only who <hi>in ſcripture,</hi> are called <hi>apoſtles.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 9.</note> But then what becomes of biſhop Timothy? Mr. L. has ſpent a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of his book in attempting to prove, the divine right of epiſcopacy, from the inſtance of Timothy biſhop of Epheſus. Yea it is the moſt plauſible argument, and indeed the only thing in his piece that deſerves the name of an argument. But if
<q>none had power to ordain miniſters in Chriſt's kingdom, but thoſe only, who are <hi>in ſcripture</hi> called <hi>apoſtles,</hi>
                  </q> Timothy certainly had no power to ordain, for he is never once called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>apoſtle</hi> in the whole ſcripture, as I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more particularly to ſhew anon: Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all pretence to ſupport his ſcheme from this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is to no purpoſe. Tho' therefore I might now fairly diſmiſs the controverſy, as decided in our ſavour by his own confeſſion: Yet not to take advantage of this inconſiſtency of his, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the argument when I come to it. In the mean time I intirely agree with him in what follows in this paragraph:
<q>That the biſhops in the church of England, do not anſwer, to thoſe that are promiſcuouſly called, either biſhops or preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in ſcripture.</q> I add, neither do they, to any order inſtituted in ſcripture. Dioceſan biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, ſuch as obtain in that church, are ſo far from being of divine inſtitution, that they are doubtleſs <hi>mere creatures of the ſtate,</hi> what the goſpel knows nothing of.</p>
               <p>AND ſo I am ready to attend upon his next obſervation, which is this,
<q>That diſſenters (preſbyterians he ſhould have ſaid) are not agreed among themſelves about the orders of the miniſtry,—ſome holding to one order, oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to two, and others again to three, &amp;c.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 9.</note> But what then? ſhall we mend the matter, in point of unity, or in the leaſt better ourſelves, by going over to the church of England? By no means. Epiſcopalians are really as much divided in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this reſpect, as thoſe he calls <hi>diſſenters.</hi>— Thus ſome of them abſolutely deny that any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular form of government or order, is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſcripture, but the whole is left to the civil magiſtrate.

<q>In the New Teſtament there is no mention of any other degrees or diſtinctions in orders, but of deacons or miniſters, and preſbyters or biſhops.</q>

                  </note> This has always been the opinion of the more moderate epiſcopalians in England; and therefore tho' they conform to the church of England, they do it, not as being of divine inſtitution, but as eſtabliſhed by the king and parliament. And others, with Mr. L. and his flighty brethren, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the three orders of biſhops, prieſts and deacons, as of divine appointment: Theſe plead the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of epiſcopal ordination, and reject all the proteſtant world who are without it. I might add, that there have been other advocates for prelacy, who have pleaded, with equal zeal, for the ſeveral orders of acolyths, lectors, ſubdeacons, archdeacons, chirocpiſcopi, archbiſhops, patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and the Roman hierarchicks, for the pope, as Peter's ſucceſſor, at the head of all.—<q>We may ſee then, (to uſe his own phraſe) the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under debate, cannot be decided by theſe men; for they are not agreed among themſelves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT how does he prove "that diſſenters are not agreed" in this point? Why he tells us, "ſome never ordain their deacons," and theſe of courſe
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031609_0022_0FED5AC6082DAC78"/>"hold, that Chriſt has appointed but one order, preſbyters." But how does this follow? He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuppoſes the biſhop is a different order in their church, and appointed by Chriſt. And yet, as far as I can learn, he has properly no new ordination when appointed biſhop, but only what they call a conſecration to the epiſcopal office. Though therefore ſome of our churches ſuppoſe, that ſince the civil magiſtrate now takes care of the poor, which, in times of perſecution, was the deacon's buſineſs, there is no neceſſity of a formal ordination to that office; it will by no means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a denial of his being an officer in the church, of diviner appointment. We all, I preſume, are agreed that the deacon is an officer of divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, (though not inſtituted by Chriſt, as Mr. L. has it, but by his apoſtles:) And that, whether we ordain him or not. He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quite miſtaken in affirming, that we hold to but one order of officers as of divine appointment.</p>
               <p>BUT then if ſome <hi>diſſenters</hi> hold to but one, and others to two, there are others again, he tells us, "that hold to three orders of miniſters in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt." And for this he quotes Mr. Calvin. But how came Calvin, pray, to be a <hi>diſſenter?</hi> He was indeed a <hi>diſſenter</hi> from the church of Rome: And (I hope) ſo is Mr. L. too. But from the church of England he never was a <hi>diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> for he never belonged to it. Our epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, indeed, warmly contended, in years paſt, that the church of England eſtabliſhment extends to America, and conſequently that all who refuſe to conform to it, are <hi>diſſenters.</hi> But the higheſt ſticklers for uniformity among them, never, that I know of, pretended to carry the claim to <hi>Geneva,</hi> before Mr. L. It ſeems his head is ſo turned againſt <hi>diſſenters,</hi> ſince he has renounced our communion, and become a prelateſt, that he is ready to faſten the opprobrious character, upon every one, who happens to differ from him. Beſides, according
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031609_0023_0FED5AB7C97FCEF8"/>to him, Calvin was no diſſenters; for he held to the three orders of "biſhops, preſbyters, and deacons." I have examined the place in Calvin's inſtitutions, from whence Mr. L. pretends to make his quotation, and boldly affirm there are no ſuch words there. The ſentence truly quoted, is this,
<q>As we have declared that there are three ſorts of miniſters commended unto us in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo all the miniſters that the old church had, is divided into three orders.</q> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; not
<q>
                     <hi>biſhops, preſbyters</hi> and <hi>deacons,</hi> as add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our author; But theſe words: For out of the order of elders, were partly choſen <hi>paſtors and teachers;</hi> the reſt of them had the rule of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and correction of manners. To the <hi>deacons</hi> was committed the care of the poor, and the diſtributing the alms.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Calv. inſt. lib. 4. C. 4. ſec. 1.</note> This plainly ſhews what Calvin's judgment was: That beſides paſtors and deacons, there was the office of rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elders, as practiſed in the church of Scotland. But now what is this to biſhops, preſbyters and deacons, as quoted by Mr. L.? This is not the only time, he has uſed the freedom with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors he pretends to quote, of making them ſpeak what they never intended.</p>

               <p>HOWEVER, that there is mention made, in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of apoſtles, preſbyters and deacons, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted. 'Tis further conceded, that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and deacons, ſignify two diſtinct offices in the church. Finally, it is allowed, that apoſtles are ſuperior to them both. But then they are ſo, only conſidered in their extraordinary character, as apoſtles, in which, as I ſhall ſhew more fully hereafter, they have no ſucceſſors, and ſo all that remain are only the preſbyters and deacons, about which there is no diſpute.</p>
               <p>HE goes on.—<q>Let it be carefully remarked, that thoſe who were commiſſioned to ſend others, who were called <hi>apoſtles,</hi> in the time when the New-Teſtament was penned.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>THE word biſhop, he tells us, being uſed to expreſs the <hi>apoſtolic office,</hi> no more altered the office, than the word, <hi>chriſtian,</hi> altered the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>believers.</hi>
                  </q> Granted. But then there is
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031609_0024_0FED5A81FB0F9930"/>this material difference in the two caſes: The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was done in the apoſtles times: The former, by his own confeſſion in times poſterior.

Till then, he muſt excuſe me, if I think his compariſon nothing to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>BUT he goes on to tell us, in his margin, from Euſebius and Theodoret, that biſhops are the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ſucceſſors.—I anſwer. If he only means that they are ſucceſſors to them, in their ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as goſpel miniſters, we have no diſpute with him, upon that head.

               <p>BEFORE I enter upon a vindication of the Dr's ſermon, from the exceptions of another, it concerns me to do him juſtice, in one particular, in which I have, inadvertently, miſrepreſented him myſelf.</p>
               <p>IN page 67 of my ſermon, I had theſe words;
<q>And although the above learned writer, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dr.) excepts Ignatius out of the number of the primitive writers in his account, and owns, that the epiſtles aſcribed to him, <hi>ſpeak very fully in favour of dioceſan epiſcopacy,</hi>
                  </q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>WHEN I wrote this ſentence, I had my mind upon what the Dr. ſays, in p. 71 of his ſermon: But upon reviewing the paſſage, I find, I miſtook his meaning. His words are not
<q>that thoſe epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ſpeak very fully in favour of dioceſan epiſcopacy:</q> But
<q>that they do, as certainly, as ſtrongly, and as conſtantly, <hi>diſtinguiſh biſhops from preſbyters,</hi> as any of the writings of the third and fourth centuries.</q> Now all that the Dr. aſſerts is, that theſe epiſtles <hi>point out a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of order between biſhop and preſbyter:</hi> And upon reading what Mr. Boyſe has wrote, in his "clear account of the ancient epiſcopacy," in which he has every thing contained in theſe epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, relative to the ſubject; I am fully convinced, that the biſhop deſcribed in theſe epiſtles, even in the preſent ſtate of them, is very different from
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031609_0025_0FED5A856FD06310"/>the <hi>dioceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n biſhop.</hi> The Ignatian biſhop, was merely a parochial one, having no more than a ſingle congregation for his charge, with preſbyters under him: Whereas the dioceſan one, has many ſcores, or hundreds of ſuch congregations in his cure. The interpolations and adulterations in theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>piſtles, were doubtleſs made, before the biſhops power was enlarged, ſo as to comprehend a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of pariſhes in his dioceſe.—Having thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my own miſtake; I proceed to perform the ſame friendly office as to Mr. L.</p>
               <p>As a direct proof of ordination by preſbyters, the Dr. had mentioned, the inſtance of Saul and Barnabas being ſeparated to the work of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, by certain prophets and teachers, as record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Acts xiii. beginning. As this is ſo very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and circumſtantial an account, of a ſeparation to the work of the miniſtry; as all the ſolemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, contained in ordination, are here ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly mentioned; and as this is ſaid to be done, not by apoſtles or biſhops, but by the ordinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the church, here called prophets and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; Mr. L. ſeems to be at a loſs what reply to make to it. He, at firſt, ſeems to be doubtful as to the nature of this action; at a loſs what name to give it. "If, ſays he, this was an ordination:" "If this was a <hi>real</hi> ordination, then," &amp;c. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he denies it to be an ordination.
<q>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is meant, ſays he, by this deſignation, it was not an ordination.</q>
                  <q>In truth this was not an ordination.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 11.</note> He found himſelf ſo preſſed with this inſtance, that he had no way to get rid of the argument, but by flatly denying it to be an ordination. And indeed, this was the only courſe he could take to ſupport his ſcheme. For if this be once granted to be a real ordination, the indiſputable right of preſbyters, to act in this buſineſs, is firmly eſtabliſhed, and all pretences of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031609_0025_0FED5A856FD06310"/>confining it to a ſuperior order, muſt be given up. I ſhall therefore offer a few obſervations, to prove that this was, in fact, an ordination; and then make ſome remarks upon Mr. L.'s objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its being conſidered as ſuch.</p>
               <p>Now by ordination, I conclude, is meant, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſeperation, or ſetting apart to an office in the church, by ſuch as have authority to do it, and that, in the uſe of thoſe rites or actions, the ſcripture has appointed in this caſe. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rites of ordination, are faſting, prayer, and the impoſition of hands. In this way the ſeven deacons were introduced into office,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts vi. 6.</note> which Mr. L. owns to be an ordination. In the ſame way Timothy was ordained.
<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Tim. iv. 14.</note> And in the ſame way he is directed to ordain others.
<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. v. 22.</note> And this has been the general method of introducing men into the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in all ſubſequent ages. But now, all theſe things concurred in the inſtance under conſideration. The perſons acting in it, were church officers of Antioch, <hi>"prophets and teachers."</hi> What they undertook to do, was to "<hi>ſeperate</hi> Saul and Barnabas to the work of the miniſtry, among the gentiles." This was done by the direction of the holy Ghoſt;
<q>ſeperate me Barnabas and Saul to the work, where unto I have called them;</q> that is, to the work of the miniſtry, eſpecially among the gentiles,
<q>to whom they were now ſent.</q> The thing therefore to be done, beyond diſpute, was to ſeperate theſe two men to the work of the goſpel miniſtry. How this was done, the account informs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
<q>For when they had faſted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they ſent them away.</q> As every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every circumſtance pertaining to an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is here ſo very particularly and expreſſly found; if after all, this was not an ordination, I diſpair of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031609_0026_0FED5A8D54D78688"/>ever finding one, in ſcripture or any where elſe. And what ſtill further confirms the matter, if it needs further confirmation, is, that if I am not much miſtaken, the apoſtle Paul himſelf acknowledges it to be ſo. In his inſcription of his epiſtle to the Romans, chap. i. 5.1. he has theſe words,
<q>Paul a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, called to be an apoſtle, <hi>ſeperated</hi> to the goſpel of God.</q> He here evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſigns to give himſelf, his true and prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er character, of an apoſtle, and miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. He therefore particularly mentions, both his <hi>call</hi> to the apoſtleſhip, and his <hi>ſeperation</hi> to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel miniſtry. By the former, he moſt likely means that immediate call from heaven, of which in Acts ix. Then it was he was <hi>called to be an apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> But we find nothing in ſcripture anſwering to this other part of his character, viz. his <hi>ſeperation to the goſpel of God,</hi> unleſs it was this <hi>ſeperation</hi> we are now conſidering. And it is worthy of remark, the word in both places is the ſame, both in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and alſo in our tranſlation. In Acts 13th,
<q>The holy Ghoſt ſaid, APHORISATE, <hi>ſeperate me Barnabas and Saul to the work whereunto I have called them.</hi>
                  </q> In Rom. i. 1. The apoſtle, ſays he, "was, APHORISMENOS, <hi>ſeperated to the goſpel of God.</hi>" Does it not appear highly probable, that when the apoſtle wrote theſe laſt mentioned words, he had his mind particularly upon the action we are conſidering? I confeſs I ſee no other ſenſe in which they can be well interpreted. And if ſo, we have the teſtimony, even of the apoſtle himſelf, that this was, in fact, an ordination.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. L. objects,
<q>that if theſe proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets and teachers were preſbyters, ſo were Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas and Saul. And if this was an ordination, they, who were before preſbyters, were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſuperior office; which, he ſays, is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing they contend for.</q> I anſwer. Tho' Saul, and poſſibly Barnabas too, were in office, as
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031609_0026_0FED5A8D54D78688"/>apoſtles; yet there is no account, that either they or indeed any others, had been formally introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into office, as ſtanding miniſters in the church, by the impoſition of hands, till now. They, and the reſt of the apoſtles, had hitherto, exerciſed their miniſtry, principally among the Jews. But now, that the goſpel was to be ſent to the Gentiles, and churches gathered and ſettled among them, upon a plan which was to be perpetuated, after the times of inſpiration were over, even to the end of the world; it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, to order, that they ſhould be ſet apart, by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn rite of ordination, as a ſtanding pattern for theſe future ages. This, as Dr. Chauncy obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was the opinion of a learned epiſcopal writer, Dr. Lightfoot.
<q>No better reaſon, ſays he, can be given of this preſent action; than that the Lord did hereby, ſet down a platform of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining miniſters, to the church of the Gentiles in former times.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. l. p. 189.</note> This being the caſe, it will by no means follow, that, "if this was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, they were ordained to a ſuperior office," as he ſuppoſes. Tho' they were in office before, they had been only "called to be <hi>apoſtles;</hi>" where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now, they were "<hi>ſeparated</hi> to the goſpel of God," by ordination, that ſo they might, both have a public authentic character, and exhibit a pattern to be followed, in all ſucceeding ages. Had Mr. L's head been leſs crowded, with the unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ideas of <hi>ſuperiority</hi> and inferiority of orders in the miniſtry, he might have recollected, that even <hi>reordination</hi> itſelf, does not neceſſarily "ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a man to a ſuperior office in the church." —He doubtleſs knows ſundry of his brethren in America, who have been twice ordained: Once, "by the hands of the preſbytery," according to ſcripture pattern, and then again by the biſhop, after they conformed to his church: And yet I
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:031609_0027_0FED5AAE4C28D2D0"/>ſuppoſe, he acknowledges them ſtill, as ſuſtaining no higher office, than that of preſbyters. Tho' according to his argument, he ought, in all reaſon, to look upon them as dignitaries in the church;
<q>for who, (to uſe his own words) ever heard, that a preſbyter was ordained, unleſs it was, to advance him to a higher ſtation in the church?</q>
               </p>

It ſeems then, that it was "giving the right hand of fellowſhip:" For that is what was done in the inſtance to which he compares it. Now giving the right hand of fellowſhip, as it is a public declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſign, that the perſon to whom it is given, is now received into a co-partnerſhip of power and office with the givers, muſt neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the perſons giving, are at leaſt, equal in power with him who receives it. Conſequently if what was now done, was, as he ſays, giving the right hand of fellowſhip to Barnabas and Saul, it will follow that theſe prophets and teachers were at leaſt equal in power to Barnabas and Saul. Since therefore, Mr. L. allows the ordaining power to the latter, it muſt equally belong to the former, whether they did in fact exerciſe it at this time or no; and then the validity of ordination by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters will of courſe follow.</p>
               <p>AGAIN. If theſe two actions are, as he ſays, both of the ſame nature, then it will follow, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the perſons acting in both were of the ſame office, or indued with equal power: But thoſe who gave the right hand, in Gal. ii. 9. viz. James, Cephas and John, were undoubtedly veſted with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining power, for they were apoſtles: Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the prophets and teachers, who acted in the other inſtance, muſt be veſted with the ſame
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031609_0027_0FED5AAE4C28D2D0"/>power of ordination too, whether they actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed it at this time or not.</p>
               <p>MR. L. has one objection more to this inſtance of ordination. It is this,
<q>Whatever is meant by this deſignation, it was not ordination to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power Paul,—for it is beyond all diſpute that Paul and Barnabas officiated as public miniſters of Chriſt long before this pretended ordination.</q>

                  </gap>d, it was as apoſtles, by virtue of their extraordinary call; not as ordinary min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, in the gentile church, of ſtanding continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by the impoſition of hands in ordination. Tho' therefore with reſpect to the former, "they were, as he ſays, <hi>apoſtles, not of men, neither by man;</hi>" yet in the latter ſenſe, they received their deſignation from men, as others now do, by the impoſition of hands in a proper ordination. Their "officiating as public miniſters before," by virtue of their extraordinary call, no more proves that this was not an ordination; than the eleven apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ſo officiating, by virtue of a temporary miſſion from Chriſt in his life time, will prove the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he gave them after his reſurrection, was no commiſſion. Mr. L. allows that the commiſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Mat. xxviii. 19. and John xx. 21, was that which authorized the apoſtles to act as min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters. And yet we know that Chriſt ordained the twelve apoſtles, and ſent them forth to preach, long before he gave them this commiſſion.
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Matt. x. Mark. iii. 14.</note> If therefore the eleven apoſtles ſo officiating in Chriſt's life time, does not prove the commiſſion he gave them after his reſurrection, to be no commiſſion; neither will Barnabas and Saul's ſo officiating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, prove that this was no ordination.</p>
               <p>THIS objection indeed the Dr. largely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and anſwered in his ſermon. He there obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that though, "Paul and Barnabas were before this, commiſſioned miniſters of Chriſt;" yet this
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031609_0028_0FED5AB35B3A90D8"/>would by no means prove that they did not now receive a proper ordination.
<q>For the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ordination, is not that the ordainers ſhould commiſſion perſons to do the work of the miniſtry. This is done by Chriſt. It only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them to declare who theſe perſons are, and to ſeperate them to the work to which Chriſt has commiſſioned them.

All therefore they have to do in the caſe, is only to judge of the qualifications of the perſons to be ordained, and give them a ſolemn admiſſion to the exerciſe of their office, by faſting, prayer and the impoſition of hands. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion therefore is not from them, but from Chriſt. But if this power delegated to the biſhops, be <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potical,</hi> as Mr. L. muſt ſuppoſe, or elſe what he here ſays is nothing to his purpoſe: If it be true, as he ſeems to intimate, that biſhops now, have the ſame power of <hi>making officers</hi> in the church, as Chriſt had when here upon earth; then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that no miniſters of the goſpel, ſince Chriſt's aſcention into heaven, can be ſaid to receive their commiſſion or authority from him, but from the ordainers: And therefore in the caſe of a city<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayor; if, as our author aſſerts, he receives his commiſſion, not from the king's charter, but from the recorder, and is therefore not the king's offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, but his who gave him his oath; ſo in this caſe, if miniſters now, do not receive their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt, but from thoſe to whom he has delegated this power of <hi>making officers</hi> in his church, that is, according to Mr. L. the biſhop's;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031609_0029_0FED5AE5B0FFFDB8"/>then they are no longer Chriſt's miniſters, but the biſhop's who gave them commiſſion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they ought to preach, baptize, &amp;c. not in the name of Chriſt, but of the biſhop, whoſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters they are, and who gave them their authority.</p>
               <p>FURTHER, as Chriſt <hi>had all power in heaven and earth,</hi> and ſo was under no limitation as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this power in <hi>making officers</hi> in his church, but might, if he had ſeen fit, multiplied theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and, inſtead of two, appointed twenty, or two hundred different kinds or orders: So from this principle of Mr. L's, it will follow, that not only the apoſtles but their ſucceſſors in office, to whom Chriſt has delegated this power of <hi>mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers,</hi> have the ſame unlimited authority alſo, in this reſpect as he had: That they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to any particular number of orders, in the exerciſe of this their <hi>office making</hi> power; but may appoint and eſtabliſh, as many different orders and degrees as they pleaſe; and inſtead of three orders in the church, might have three hundred or three thouſand. For Chriſt had undoubtedly this power. And indeed this is the ſenſe of the Romiſh church upon this point. The pope, in virtue of his being ſucceſſor to Peter, is, according to them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infallible, but is veſted with all the plentitude of the power that Chriſt had, in this reſpect. And it is by this plentitude of power, with which he is veſted, not only that he has conſtituted that great variety of orders, found among their clergy; but alſo raiſed thoſe they called biſhops, above preſbyters in the church. According to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of that church, biſhops are ſuperior to preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, not by <hi>divine right,</hi> but merely as advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this ſuperior dignity by the plentitude of the pope's power.

               <p>THE truth of the caſe is, thoſe words, "as my
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031609_0029_0FED5AE5B0FFFDB8"/>father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you," on which our author founds the biſhop's power of <hi>making officers</hi> in the church, have no direct reference to the power of ordination at all. They only imply, that as Chriſt received his commiſſion immediately from the father; ſo he did immediately ſend them to diſciple all nations, and teach them whatever he had commanded. But this by no means implies, that whatever power Chriſt had himſelf, he inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his apoſtles with, or gave them the ſame author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and dominion in his church, that belonged to him. His power was <hi>deſpotical;</hi> theirs only <hi>miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial;</hi> and he himſelf warned them againſt aſpiring at any more, Mat. xx. 25, &amp;c. He did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make over to them a <hi>deſpotical</hi> authority of commiſſioning others, but only a <hi>miniſterial</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of inveſting ſuch with the office, his <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſhould authorize and oblige thereto.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus vindicated Dr. Chauncy's notion of ordination, from Mr. L's exceptions, I am now prepared to anſwer the queſtions he has ſeen fit to propoſe.—He aſks, "how the ordainers are to know in theſe times, that Chriſt has commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe men, as his miniſters, whom they let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the miniſtry?"
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 14.</note>—I anſwer.</p>
               <p>As the Dr. no where ſays that men are inveſted with Chriſt's commiſſion, before ordination, as the queſtion ſeems to intimate: He ought rather to aſk, "how the ordainers are to know who are proper to be ordained, or veſted with Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and declared lawful miniſters?"—And here the anſwer is eaſy. They are to know it by the candidate's profeſſing an inclination to enter into the miniſtry, his being upon examination, found qualified for it, and, (in caſe he is to take the charge of a particular church) his being choſen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the church to take the paſtoral charge of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031609_0030_0FED5AE1B0E53640"/>them. All who have theſe qualifications and this call, the ordainers may know are ſuch, as ought to be introduced into office in the church, and as ſuch may ſafely ordain them.</p>
               <p>AGAIN he aſks,
<q>What teſtimony is given to the world, that the perſons he (the Dr.) has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, are the miniſters of Chriſt?<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 14.</note>
                  </q> Anſwer. Their public ordination is a ſufficient evidence in this caſe. This, the Dr. had told him was the deſign of ordination. Not for the ordainers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, to authorize and impower them themſelves, but "to declare who the perſons were that Chriſt's commiſſion has empowered." Not to <hi>make them officers,</hi> as Mr. L. would have it:— But "to give them an authentic character, as ſuch, in the eye of the world." And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this, with us, is done in a very public manner, it muſt be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident to thoſe who attend the ſolemnity. And as to others, I hope, a certificate from the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing council properly atteſted, will be deemed as good evidence, in our caſe, as the biſhop's licence and letter of orders are in that of Mr. L. and his brethren. We, no more than they, "expect or deſire people ſhould believe in this caſe, without evidence." If they can produce ſufficient teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that their miniſters are ordained, we, I preſume, can eaſily do the ſame as to ours, notwithſtanding this <hi>fleer</hi> of Mr. L. to prejudice people againſt us. "And therefore, to uſe his words to the Dr. I hope he will now ſee his error and retract it."</p>
               <p>THUS I have endeavoured particularly to anſwer every objection brought againſt this inſtance of Paul's and Barnabas's ſeparation, and, I preſume, ſufficiently proved it to be a real and proper ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. That it was ſo, was the declared opinion of Chryſoſtom, one of the fathers. He aſſerts that "Paul was ordained at Antioch," and that this is the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031609_0030_0FED5AE1B0E53640"/>ſenſe of Acts xiii. 1—3.<note n="*" place="bottom">As quoted by Euſeb. inermat. p. 43.</note> Biſhop Taylor was of the ſame ſentiment, as I ſhewed in my ſermon. The ſame was the opinion of Dr. Lightfoot and Dr. Hammond, two celebrated writers of the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſide.<note n="*" place="bottom">As quoted by Euſeb. intermat. p. 43.</note> And Mr. Ollyffe another of them, in his diſpute with Mr. Calamy, brings this very text in favour of reordination.<note n="*" place="bottom">As quoted by Euſeb. intermat. p. 43.</note> Finally, "in the book of ordination uſed in the church of England, (as my author ſays, for I have not the book by me) the order for conſecrating biſhops, alledges the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fact we have been conſidering, as an example or precedent."<note n="*" place="bottom">As quoted by Euſeb. intermat. p. 43.</note> This ſhews that the church of England looks upon this as a proper ordination, however ſome of her zealous ſons, for ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are tempted to deny it. But let it be called by what name it will, it is indubitably an expreſs and very circumſtantial inſtance, of perſons being ſeparated, and ſent forth to the work of the goſpel miniſtry, which is all the ſcripture means by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. And as this was confeſſedly done, not by officers of a ſuperior character, not by apoſtles or biſhops, but by teachers or preſbyters, it muſt be conſidered as a proper ſcripture pattern of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian ordination, and a proof that ſuch ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is valid.</p>
               <p>I PROCEED now to conſider what Mr. L. has to ſay, upon the other inſtance of preſbyterian ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in ſcripture, as mentioned by the Dr. viz. that of Timothy, 1 Tim. iv. 14.
<q>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the <hi>preſbytery.</hi>
                  </q> This, the Dr. mentioned, as an expreſs inſtance of ordination by preſbyters, and very fully anſwered all the objections commonly urged againſt it by epiſcopalians. Nor do I find any material one added by Mr. L. He indeed tells us "the text ſays, Timothy was not ordained by
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031609_0031_0FED5AC7B5D831E8"/>preſbyters, but by prophecy."<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 18.</note> I anſwer:—It does not ſay in ſo many words, he was <hi>ordained</hi> by either. The word, <hi>ordained,</hi>

                  </gap>t being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. But then, the thing ſignifying ordination; the rite univerſally in uſe, in ſetting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en apart to the miniſtry, viz. <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, and expreſſly ſaid to be performed, not by an apoſtle, not by an officer of a ſuperior character, nor yet by <hi>prophecy;</hi> but by the <hi>preſbytery.</hi> His ſaying therefore "that Timothy was ordained by <hi>prophecy,</hi>" a phraſe to which he, nor no man elſe can affix any determinate idea, could be with no other view, than to confuſe the minds of his readers, and perplex an argument, which he found himſelf unable fairly to anſwer.— Had he attended to what the Dr. had obſerved, concerning the gift, here ſaid to be given to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, by prophecy, it might have prevented his impoſing upon his readers, and betraying his own ignorance, in the interpretation he has given of this text. At the ſame time, it would have ſaved him the trouble of repeating that other objection, ſo particularly anſwered by the Dr. viz. that Paul was concerned in Timothy's ordination. The word <hi>gift,</hi> here ſaid "to be given to Timothy by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy," &amp;c. Mr. L. inſiſts, is the ſame in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal with that mentioned 2 Tim. i. 6, as given by the putting on of Paul's hands. The Dr. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it is. He moreover allows the ſame thing to be ſignified, in both texts, viz. the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. And further, that theſe were communicated to Timothy by Paul's hands only. For after mentioning the text in queſtion, he ſays,
<q>The meaning of the words, compared with what is ſaid upon the matter in 2 Tim. i. 6, may be fully expreſſed in the following para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe,</q>—<q>Improve the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, which I imparted to you, in an extraordinary
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031609_0031_0FED5AC7B5D831E8"/>meaſure, according to the prophecies which went before concerning you, when you was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated to the work of the miniſtry, with the laying on of the hands of the conſiſtory of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dud. lec. p. 36.</note>
                  </q> In this paraphraſe is fairly and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically included, every thing contained in both texts, concerning Timothy's ordination, and the gift here ſaid to be imparted to him. The <hi>gift,</hi> in both places, ſignifies, the extraordinary HARISMETA or gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. Theſe, the Dr. allows were conferred by the impoſition of Paul's hands only, as mentioned in 2 Tim. i. 6. This was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>prophecy;</hi> that is, agreeable to, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the prophecies, which the apoſtle ſays 1 Tim. i. 18, went before concerning Timothy. Holy men prophetically ſpeaking by inſpiration, of him, as a fit perſon to receive this gift, and in conſequence, to be put into the miniſtry; to which ſervice he is here, in 1 Tim. iv. 14, ſaid to be ſeparated, by the impoſition of the hands of the preſbytery, in ordination. This makes both the accounts, perfectly conſiſtent, which no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, perhaps, can do. To be ſure that given by Mr. L. is very far from doing it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as in the forementioned inſtance of Paul and Barnabas; ſo alſo in this of Timothy, he ſeems very loth to allow, that ordination is intended by the impoſition of hands. "If, ſays he, this was an ordination." Again. "If this was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then," &amp;c. It is eaſy to ſee, in both theſe inſtances, what were his reaſons for expreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo doubtfully in the caſe. If theſe were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be proper ordinations, he was fully ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all he could ſay, would be inſufficient to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the force of the argument, brought from them, in favour of preſbyterian ordination. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he endeavours to perſuade his readers, that it is, at leaſt doubtful, whether ordination is the thing
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031609_0032_0FED5AC968104190"/>intended. But as the evidence in the caſe is ſo full; as every thing included in ordination is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and expreſſly mentioned, in theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, than in any others recorded in the New-Teſtament; and I may add, as there can certainly be found no inſtance of an ordination in the whole bible, if theſe are not allowed to be ſuch; Mr. L. ſeems not quite willing, after all, to hazard the iſſue of the controverſy, upon a bare denial of this fact: But thinks it concerns him to ſhew, that if this was an ordination, yet it was not performed by preſbyters. And the only argument he brings for the purpoſe, is, "that the word <hi>preſbytery,</hi> here, does not ſignify a number of <hi>preſbyters.</hi> His words are;
<q>It ſeems, the Dr. takes it for granted, that a preſbytery means a number of preſbyters only. Calling a number of preſbyters, a preſbytery, does not prove that St. Paul means the ſame, when he uſed the words.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 18.</note>
                  </q> He therefore concludes that "Paul was at the head of theſe elders to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute them a preſbytery, with power to ordain." If therefore I can prove, that the word PRESBUTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RION, a <hi>preſbytery,</hi> always ſignifies, in the New-Teſtament, and other ancient writers, <hi>a number of preſbyters only;</hi> then his whole objection againſt the Dr's interpretation of theſe words, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; and this inſtance of Timothy's ordination, will remain an inconteſtible pattern and proof of preſbyterian ordination.</p>
               <p>Now the word PRESBUTERION is to be found but in two other places in all the New-Teſtament, in both of which it ſignifies "a number of preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only." The firſt is Luke xxii. 66.
<q>And when it was day PRESBUTERION, <hi>the elders</hi> of the people and the chief prieſts and the ſcribes came together,</q> &amp;c. It is very evident the word here means a number of elders or preſbyters only: It is ſo tranſlated; the <hi>elders</hi> of the people, the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031609_0032_0FED5AC968104190"/>ſanhedrim or grand council of the Jews: Not including the chief prieſts, the ſcribes, or indeed any other officer of a ſuperior rank, as Mr. L. would have it in the other inſtance: Theſe are alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly mentioned, and very particularly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the account; the <hi>elders</hi> of the people, PRESBUTERION, and the chief prieſts and the ſcribes. Beſides, the very perſons who are here called by the collective name PRESBUTERION; in the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel place, Matt. xxvii. 1, are called by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or appropriate one, PRESBUTEROUS, (which ſhews the words are uſed ſynonimouſly) and they are there alſo diſtinguiſhed from the chief prieſts or any other officers. It is therefore beyond all diſpute that the word <hi>preſbytery,</hi> here means a number of elders only.</p>
               <p>THE other place, in which the word occurs, is Acts xxii. 5. There it is tranſlated, "the ſtate of the elders," that is, the body or company of preſbyters. Here again they are particularly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the chief prieſt, or any other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior officer; for he is particularly mentioned, and diſtinguiſhed from the TO PRESBUTERION, the ſtate or body of elders.
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Here it may be noted, that the preſbytery or elders among the Jews, called PRESBUTERION or SANHEDRION, was their <hi>ſupreme</hi> court of judicature. We have an account of its inſtitution Numb. xi. 16. The right of government was veſted in them, and they were all veſted with equal power.
<q>They were, as a learned writer tells us, origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intruſted with the power of <hi>ordaining</hi> elders to ſupply the vacancies made in their own body. This continued to be the practice till the time of Hillel, when it was reſolved that none ſhould ordain, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Naſi or Preſident, or a licence from him.</q>
                  </note> The word is frequently uſed by ancient eccleſiaſtical writers, and always to ſignify a number of <hi>preſbyters</hi> only. Numbers of quotations from the fathers, might eaſily be produced in proof of this. I ſhall adduce but one,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031609_0033_0FED5ABA87A6B1C8"/>againſt whom, I hope Mr. L. will make no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. It is his favourite Ignatus. He fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſes this word; and in him it ever ſignifies a number of <hi>preſbyters</hi> only. A few inſtances may ſuffice. In his epiſtle to the Epheſians, he ſays, "Being ſubject to the biſhop, and the <hi>preſbytery."</hi>

TO EPISCOPO KAI TO PRESBUTERIO.</note> In all theſe inſtances, and many more that might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, 'tis evident to demonſtration, that the word, PRESBUTERION, means a number of <hi>preſbyters</hi> and nothing elſe. Not as Mr. L. would have it, "a number of elders with an apoſtle or biſhop at their head." Thus it ſignifies in ſcripture, and in all good authors where it occurs. Nor do I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ever to have ſeen it uſed, in any other ſenſe.</p>
               <p>DR. CHAUNCY had therefore good right "to take it for granted, that a preſbytery means, a number of preſbyters only." And ſince this is the word uſed in this inſtance, it is a clear conſequence, that Timothy was ordained by a number of <hi>preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> and therefore that preſbyterian ordination, is the true ſcripture ordination.</p>
               <p>NOR will it at all alter the caſe tho' we ſhould grant that Paul joined with the preſbytery in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy's ordination: For if he did, he acted, not as an apoſtle, but as a preſbyter, of no more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than the reſt. For it is in this character only, that the perſons who impoſed hands are here ſaid to act: Plainly denoting that they acted as a <hi>preſbytery;</hi> and conſequently, that the right of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is veſted in ſuch a body, and in none elſe.</p>
               <p>HENCE it will follow, that what Mr. L. ſays
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031609_0033_0FED5ABA87A6B1C8"/>about the lower houſe of aſſembly in Connecticut,<note n="†" place="bottom">

                     </gap>
                  </note> is not true. It is not true "that a number of preſbyters have no more power to ordain without a biſhop, than the lower houſe of aſſembly have, to perform acts of legiſlation without the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or." So far from it, that <hi>preſbyters</hi> and they only are veſted with the power of ordination; and even when an apoſtle was joined with them, if that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the caſe; he acted, not as an <hi>apoſtle,</hi> but as a <hi>preſbyter;</hi> therefore the action is expreſſly ſaid to be done by a conſiſtory of preſbyters, as we have ſhewed above. But if it were not ſo: If it were true, as he ſays, that a number of preſbyters have juſt as much and no more authority, with or without a biſhop, than the lower houſe of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have with or without the governor; ſtill it will be nothing at all to his purpoſe. For as the lower houſe, can perform no act of legiſlation, without the governor; no more can the governor without them. The power of the latter, in this caſe therefore, is at leaſt equal to the former. If then we allow this a parallel caſe, it will indeed follow that preſbyters have no power to ordain, without a biſhop: But it will equally follow, that the biſhop has no ſuch power without the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Conſequently their power in this reſpect is equal. But, unluckily for our author, this will at once ruin his ſcheme, agreeable to which the <hi>ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> power of ordination is in the biſhop, and the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters have no manner of authority in the caſe.— Thus have I very particularly, and I think ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently vindicated the Dr's interpretation of this text, and proved it to be a ſtanding pattern and warrant for preſbyterian ordination.</p>

                  </gap> goes on,—<q>Another objection is, that in ſcripture, biſhops are frequently called preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; therefore biſhop and preſbyter mean one and the ſame office. In anſwer to this I
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031609_0034_0FED5ACD55E4DBC0"/>would aſk, whether apoſtle and preſbyter mean one and the ſame office in ſcripture? Anſwer this without a double meaning, and the point is ſettled.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 18, 19.</note>
                  </q>—I anſwer. Conſidered as ſtanding officers in the church, they moſt certainly do; and the apoſtle Peter himſelf ſhall be my voucher.— "The <hi>elders,</hi> ſays he, which are among you, I exhort, who am alſo an <hi>elder.</hi>"<note n="§" place="bottom">2 Pet. v. 1.</note> This then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, muſt ſettle the point.</p>
               <p>As another proof of ordination by preſbyters, the Dr. obſerved, "that beſides deacons, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mentions but one order of officers only, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly called biſhops or preſbyters, therefore that the ordaining power muſt belong to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der." In proof of this he added ſundry texts, and among others, Philip. i. 1, where the apoſtle, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing this church with its officers, makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of but two orders, <hi>biſhops</hi> and <hi>deacons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN anſwer to this Mr. L. ſays, theſe biſhops were the preſbyters of this church; and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them and the deacons, there was an apoſtle, viz. Epaphroditus, preſiding over them in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>biſhop.</hi> In proof of this he quotes chap. ii. 5, 25, where Paul ſays,
<q>I ſuppoſed it neceſſary to ſend to you, Epaphroditus my brother, &amp;c. but your <hi>meſſenger.</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 19, 20.</note>
                  </q> In the original, he tells us, it is <hi>your apoſtle.</hi> Hence he infers, that in this church, were three orders of miniſters.</p>
               <p>ANSWER. Epaphroditus being <hi>ſent</hi> to Philippi is no proof he was ſent there in character of a biſhop. If ſo then Timothy muſt have been their biſhop alſo. For Paul ſays, "I truſt in the Lord to <hi>ſend</hi> Timothy unto you ſhortly," v. 24. But this would be, to have two biſhops in this one church, which is utterly inconſiſtent with the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ſcheme; according to which there can be but one biſhop to one church. Neither will his
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031609_0034_0FED5ACD55E4DBC0"/>being called the Philippian's <hi>meſſenger,</hi> prove that he was their <hi>biſhop,</hi> or held any office in this church. I grant the word in the original is APOSTOLON, an apoſtle. This, however, in its common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appropri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ted ſenſe, means not a biſhop, or indeed any church officer; but according to its original derivation, a <hi>meſſenger,</hi> or one ſent. It is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſo tranſlated, wherever it occurs in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in its unappropriated ſenſe, juſt as it is in this place. We meet with it in John xiii. 16, and 2 Cor. viii. 23. But as it is uſed in its unappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated ſenſe in both, ſo it is tranſlated, as here, not <hi>apoſtle</hi> but <hi>meſſenger:</hi> But if it muſt be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>apoſtle</hi> in this place, as Mr. L. contends, it muſt alſo in the others, and wherever it occurs. And if this be the caſe, John the baptiſt, and thoſe who were ſent to him from the phariſecs, muſt be alſo acknowledged as apoſtles or biſhops: For they are called APOSTELLMENOI, apoſtles, a word of the ſame theme and import with this. And therefore if this word muſt always ſignify <hi>apoſtle</hi> or biſhop, poſſibly Mr. L. will find in ſcripture, an inſtance of a <hi>ſhe-biſhop</hi> or apoſtle: For Junia, which by many is ſuppoſed to be the name of a woman,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chryſoſtom, Theophylact, Occumenius, Origen, Hillary the deacon, Pelagius, Primaſius, Bede, Haimo, and Premigius read, not Junia, but Julia believing her to be a woman, as the learned Bloudel aſſures us.</note> is ſaid with Andronicus, "to be chief among the <hi>apoſtles.</hi>"<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xvi. 7.</note> But the truth of the caſe is: The word APOSTOLON is here uſed in its unappropriated ſenſe. Our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh bibles therefore rightly have it tranſlated, not apoſtle, but <hi>meſſenger</hi> or one ſent. For ſo Epaph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roditus was. He had been <hi>ſent</hi> by the Philippians to carry their bounty to Paul, as appears from chap. iv. 18. And therefore the apoſtle very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly calls him <hi>their meſſenger.</hi> Again. Paul's calling Epaphroditus, <hi>your meſſenger,</hi> plainly ſhews
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031609_0035_0FED5AE7623B7D20"/>that he was not an apoſtle in the appropriate ſenſe of the word. The apoſtles, as ſuch, are never called apoſtles <hi>of the churches,</hi> but of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe apoſtles or meſſengers, they are, who gives them commiſſion, and ſends them forth. Thus Peter and Paul, often call themſelves apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt,<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 1. 1 Cor. i. 1, &amp;c.</note> but they are never once called, <hi>your apoſtles,</hi> or the meſſengers of the church.— Epaphroditus however is called a meſſenger or apoſtle, not of Jeſus Chriſt, but of the church: This plainly ſhews that he was not an officer in that church, but only a <hi>meſſenger</hi> they had ſent, to carry money to Paul. Indeed it looks at leaſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable, had he been their <hi>apoſtle</hi> or <hi>biſhop,</hi> as Mr. L. pretends, that he ſhould be ſingled out by them for ſo inferior a piece of ſervice, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their alms to Paul; eſpecially, as they had a number of preſbyters and deacons, whom they might have improved in this ſervice.</p>
               <p>FINALLY, had Epaphroditus been the biſhop of this church, is it not ſtrange the apoſtle ſhould not mention him in his inſcription of his epiſtle to this church? He particularly mentions the <hi>biſhops</hi> or preſbyters, and deacons, but ſays not a word of any apoſtle. This neglect, moſt certainly, Paul would not have been guilty of, had Epaphroditus been their biſhop, as our author pretends. Upon the whole, theſe reaſons muſt, I imagine, convince every impartial perſon, that he was not the biſhop of Philippi, that there were but only the two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of biſhops or preſbyters, and deacons in this church, as the Dr. aſſerted, and therefore his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for preſbyterian ordination, from this text, ſtands good.</p>
               <p>MR. L's next inſtance of three orders, is the church at "Jeruſalem. We have clear evidence, he tells us, from ſcripture, that St. James reſided for twenty years together, with and over the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031609_0035_0FED5AE7623B7D20"/>and deacons there."<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 20, 21.</note> For proof of this he refers to Acts, chapters vi. and xv. chap. xxi. 18, and Gal. i. 19.</p>
               <p>Two things, he ſays, he has proved from theſe texts. One, that the apoſtle James reſided for twenty years together in the church at Jeruſalem: The other, that he reſided with and <hi>over</hi> the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and deacons of this church, during that time.—Let us examine his proofs.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, it does indeed appear from theſe texts, that Paul found James at Jeruſalem, three ſeveral times, and at the diſtance of ſundry years one from another. But then, at two of theſe times, the ſame accounts ſay, Peter was there with him. And one of them mentions John as there alſo. If, then, from theſe two accounts it can be proved, that James was at Jeruſalem as biſhop, during the term aforeſaid; the ſame muſt follow alſo as to Peter. This argument therefore either proves that both of them ſo reſided, or that neither did. But as they could not, in Mr. L's ſenfe, be both biſhops of this church, the conſequence is plain, that nothing can be concluded from theſe two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that either of them were. All the proof then that remains as to this fact, is the ſingle cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of his being found there by Paul, ſome years after. Acts xxi. 18. But as there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how long he reſided there, barely his being found there, I preſume, will hardly be admitted a ſufficient proof of Mr. L's aſſertion, that the time of his continuance was twenty years. Indeed, as James, by our author's conceſſion was an apoſtle, there is not the leaſt degree of probability, much leſs any proof, that he reſided at Jeruſalem, or any other place, for any conſiderable time togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as his particular charge. So to do would have been utterly inconſiſtent with the apoſtolic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:031609_0036_0FED5AF645F52968"/>and the charge given to the apoſtles by Chriſt, <hi>"go teach all nations," "go into all the world,</hi> and preach the goſpel to <hi>every creature,</hi>" and ſo preach repentance and remiſſion of ſins <hi>among all nations,</hi> beginning at Jeruſalem."<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxviii. 19. Mark xvi. 15. Luke xxiv. 47.</note> How the executing this large commiſſion, could be conſiſtent with any of the apoſtles making Jeruſalem their ſtated reſidence, eſpecially for twenty years together, as Mr. L. aſſerts, for my part I am unable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Wherefore without offering a word more upon this point, I freely ſubmit it to the candid reader to determine, whether the evidence Mr. L. has brought, to prove that James actually "reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twenty years together at Jeruſalem, is ſufficient to ſupport the fact." But if it ſhould be deemed to be, it will by no means follow, that he ſo reſided in character of a biſhop, or as Mr. L. expreſſes it, "with and over the preſbyters and deacons there." This is the other thing he has here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and for proof of it, he refers us to what he calls, "James's conduct in the caſe St. Paul laid before him, Acts xv." I deſire the reader to turn to the place, and read the whole account, and then ſay, what there is in it to prove that James, any more than any of the reſt, that were preſent at that council, was the biſhop of Jeruſalem? Is it that he was at Jeruſalem at that time? So was Peter and John, and other apoſtles. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from this circumſtance bid as fair for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as he. Was it that James attended upon the council there? The ſame did the other apoſtles, yea and the elders and brethren too. Or was it that James gave his judgment, in the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the queſtion before them? This did all that were preſent. And therefore when the decree was drawn up and publiſhed, it is expreſſly ſaid to go forth in the name. "of the apoſtles, and elders
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031609_0036_0FED5AF645F52968"/>and brethren."<note n="*" place="bottom">Verſe 23.</note> Or laſtly, was it that James in particular, ſpoke in the council, and declared his ſentiments concerning the caſe in queſtion?— But the ſame did alſo ſundry of the reſt, as Peter, Barnabas and Paul. Theſe are all particularly mentioned as ſpeaking and declaring their opinion upon the point in debate. Yea, as giving the ſame <hi>ſentence</hi> or judgment, that James afterwards declared to be his. What right, I demand, then had Mr. L. to ſay, "that James's authority was <hi>deciſive</hi> in the caſe," any more than that of Peter, Paul and Barnabas, who had given the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence before? Certainly none. Nothing therefore from this circumſtance, or indeed from any thing elſe, in the account, in favour of James's epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal relation to, and authority over this church, and its officers, but what equally appears in favor of the reſt. And ſince they could not all be biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops of it, it is a plain caſe that none of them are proved to be ſo; conſequently, that there were not three orders of officers in this church as Mr. L. has aſſerted.</p>
               <p>HIS next attack upon the Dr. is for aſſerting, "That the apoſtles as ſuch, were extraordinary officers, and had no ſucceſſors," and then aſks "in what reſpects they were ſo?"<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 21.</note> I anſwer. Let him turn to the page in the Dr's ſermon, from whence he has quoted theſe words, and he will readily ſee.
<q>They received their commiſſion immediately from Chriſt. Their charge was unlimitted; their province the whole world.— They were, by office, the teachers of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; had power to gather churches every where, to ſettle them with proper officers, to inſpect over them, to give binding rules and orders for the government of them; and all this under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible guidance of the Holy Ghoſt.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dud. lec. p. 48.</note>
                  </q> If this
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031609_0037_0FED5AF130489C68"/>don't ſatisfy Mr. L. I would refer him for a more particular account of the diſtinctive character and qualifications of the appſtleſhip, to Mr. Boyſe's "ancient epiſcopacy," p. 253, &amp;c. To Dr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as quoted by him, p. 272, &amp;c. and "the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-biſhop, p. 26, &amp;c. In the mean time, as I ſhall have occaſion, more particularly to conſider this point, when I come to his remarks upon my ſermon, it may be ſufficient to obſerve here, that Mr. L. does not pretend to prove biſhops now-a-days, are indued with theſe extraordinary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, on which the <hi>apoſtolic</hi> character and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were founded; conſequently the former cannot ſucceed the latter in the exerciſe of theſe powers. He ſays indeed as to ſome of theſe qualifications, ſuch as, "the power of working miracles, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from place to place to plant churches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately ſent by Chriſt; that they were not <hi>peculiar</hi> to the apoſtles, for others at that time had the ſame." But now, what is this to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? If they were not <hi>peculiar</hi> to the apoſtles, they were at leaſt <hi>eſſential</hi> to the apoſtolic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and abſolutely neceſſary to furniſh men for the duties of it. Tho' therefore ſome, cotemporary with the apoſtles, might have ſome of theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary qualifications, eſſental to the apoſtolic office; yet as none can pretend to them now; the conſequence is undeniable, that none now can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſucceed the apoſtles, in that part of their character and office, to which theſe extraordinary qualifications were eſſential and abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Since therefore dioceſan biſhops do not, cannot ſucceed the apoſtles, in that part of their character or office which was <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them; it belongs to him, if he would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his ſcheme, to prove, that the apoſtles, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their <hi>ordinary</hi> powers, did in fact make a difference; committing a <hi>chief</hi> power to a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior order, called <hi>biſhops,</hi> and an <hi>inferior</hi> one to others, under the name of <hi>preſbyters.</hi>

THIS is what he next attempts to do.—<q>What we aſſert, ſays he, is that the apoſtles did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a chief power to a ſuperior order, then called <hi>apoſtles.</hi>
                  </q> And for proof he refers us to Acts xiv. 14. Philip ii. 25. 2 Cor. viii. 23.
<q>From theſe texts, he tells us, it appears, that Barnabas, Epaphroditus and Titus are <hi>ſliled apoſties;</hi>
                  </q> and adds,
<q>that he intends to prove Timothy alſo, to have been inveſted with the ſame apoſtolic pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and office.<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 22.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. As to, at leaſt three of the four here mentioned, neither the texts he has quoted, nor indeed any other in ſcripture, proves them to be apoſtles, in the <hi>appropriate</hi> ſenſe of the word. As to Epaphroditus, it has been already proved that he was no apoſtle, but only a meſſenger of the church of Philippi, ſent to carry their contribution to the apoſtle Paul; an errand not over and above apoſtolical.—As to Titus, he is no where, in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, called an apoſtle in any ſenſe whatever. The text Mr. L. quotes to prove him ſo, is this,
<q>Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner, and fellow-helper concerning you: Or our brethren be enquired of, <hi>they</hi> are the <hi>meſſengers</hi> of the churches and the glory of Chriſt.<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. viii. 23.</note>
                  </q> It ſeems Mr. L. thought Titus muſt needs be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; becauſe he found the word, APOSTOLOI, <hi>meſſengers,</hi> in the ſame verſe, in which Titus is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But unhappily for him, it is not Titus, but the <hi>brethren</hi> that went with him, who are called APOSTOLOI, <hi>meſſengers.</hi> Titus is particularly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from them in the former part of the verſe, as Paul's partner and fellow-labourer, and not of the number of the brethren who are called APOSTOLOI, <hi>meſſengers,</hi> in the latter part of it. But if he was not: If he was, as Mr. L. ſuppoſes, of the number of theſe APOSTOLOI <hi>meſſengers;</hi> it would
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031609_0038_0FED5AF2E221B390"/>be nothing to his purpoſe: For it is abundantly evident, from the context, that the word APOSTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOI is here uſed, not in its appropriate ſenſe, to ſignify an officer in the church; but in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and unappropriated one, meaning barely a <hi>meſſenger,</hi> or one ſent. For it is evidently on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being <hi>ſent</hi> to Corinth to receive their collections, and carry them to Jeruſalem, and nothing elſe, that theſe perſons are called APOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOLOI, meſſengers of the churches. If therefore Epaphroditus was no <hi>apoſtle,</hi> much leſs was Titus, who is never once called by that name, in any ſenſe of the word whatſoever. And tho' Mr. L. tells us "he deſigned to prove Timothy to be one;" yet as we find nothing of that kind done in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of his book; 'tis probable, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thought, he was diſcouraged in the attempt. Since therefore he has dropt him out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we have a right to do the ſame, and ſo there remains only Barnabas to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>AND, it is readily granted he is called an apoſtle in Acts xiv. 14. But until it is proved that he <hi>derived</hi> his apoſtolic power from the apoſtles; barely his being called an apoſtle, will not prove his aſſertion,
<q>that the apoſtles did communicate a chief power to a ſuperior order called apoſtles.</q> All that is proved from this text, is that "Barnabas was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle." How he came to be ſo, or from whom he <hi>received</hi> his "chief power" and ſuperior character as an apoſtle, the text is intirely ſilent; nor can it be collected from any thing Mr. L. has ſaid. If his being here mentioned with Paul, ſignifies that he was veſted with the ſame ſuperior office and character as Paul was; no doubt he received his apoſtolic commiſſion and authority, in the ſame immediate way, and from the ſame fountain, as Paul did. How that was, he himſelf has told us. For he was
<q>an apoſtle, not of men, neither by
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031609_0038_0FED5AF2E221B390"/>man, but by Jeſus Chriſt and God the father</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. i. 1.</note> At leaſt till the contrary is proved from ſcripture, we have a right to conclude this was the caſe: Conſequently, that the apoſtles did not
<q>thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ordinary powers of their office, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating to ſome more, to others leſs, and ſo conſtituting the two orders of biſhops and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</q> as our opponents pretend. I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now with propriety, I preſume, take leave of this argument in the words of Dr. Chauncy.
<q>If the apoſtles did thus communicate theſe powers, in a different degree, committing to ſome more, to others leſs, and ſo conſtituting two orders in the miniſtry; it is what we may reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſee evidenced. The new-teſtament is open. If it contains any ſuch evidence, let it be produced. We imagine it contains clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the contrary, and that we have given ſuch evidence. Merely calling biſhops ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to the apoſtles will not prove their ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Tho' by the way they are never called ſo in the ſacred books.—The bible only can ſettle this point.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dud. lec. p. 49, 50.</note>

               <p>OUR author proceeds.—<q>Dr. Chauncy ſeems to allow, that the church univerſally has been governed, in the form of epiſcopacy, (after the firſt two centuries) for ſeveral ſucceeding ages. But, ſays he, <hi>before that,</hi> in the early days of the church, it was governed by preſbyters.<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 22.</note>
                  </q> I have examined the pages, from whence he pretends to quote this paſſage, but can find nothing of that kind there. If by <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> Mr. L. means <hi>dioceſan</hi> epiſcopacy, (which he muſt mean, or it is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his purpoſe) the Doctor is ſo far from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that the church was ever governed in that form, that on the contrary he affirms and proves, that during the firſt century, and the greateſt part of the ſecond, there is no diſtinction to be found,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031609_0039_0FED3213A8D8BDC8"/>in the writers of thoſe times, between biſhop and preſbyter; the names being uſed promiſcuouſly for the ſame office, juſt as they are in the new-teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. And even in the third century, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, after the name biſhop came to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated, ſo as to ſignify ſomething different from preſbyter; he expresſly denies "that the fathers are univerſal or unanimous, in affirming of it for fact, that it was a diſtinction importing a <hi>ſuperior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of order,</hi> or that it was of ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I AM now prepared to conſider his rhapſody of queſtions quoted from Mr. Chillingworth, and thoſe of the ſame ſtrain added by himſelf in pages 22 and 23, of his book: The whole of which amount to no more than this, viz. how, when and by what means it was that the original form of preſbyterian church government, came to be changed to that of epiſcopalian?</p>
               <p>FOR anſwer to which, and indeed, to almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing elſe he has remarked upon the Dr's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I might very fairly refer him to the ſermon itſelf. At leaſt he will there ſee, that when this alteration of a diſtinction between biſhop and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter firſt began, it was very ſmall. "The biſhop was no more than <hi>primus inter pares,</hi> the head preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, the <hi>praeſes</hi> or moderator of the conſiſtory; and it was by gradual ſteps he attained to the power with which he was afterwards veſted. Theſe ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ſuperiorities and inferiorities, which have for a long time been viſible in the chriſtian world, were unknown in the firſt and pureſt ages: Nor did they at once take place. It was the work of time. From prime-preſbyters, aroſe city-biſhops: From city-biſhops, dioceſan ones: From dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan biſhops, netropolitans: From netropolitans,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031609_0039_0FED3213A8D8BDC8"/>patriarchs, and finally, at the top of all, his holineſs the pope, claiming the character of univerſal head of the church."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dud. Lec. p. 64.</note>
               </p>
               <p>IF this anſwer will not ſatisfy Mr. L. I will give him another, in the words of a proteſtant in anſwer to a demand of the like kind from a papiſt. It is as follows.
<q>When Arius, Neſtorius, and ſuch like heretics aroſe; they violently broke out of the church, and forſook all communion. And when Mahomet came from without, he viſibly aſſaulted all chriſtianity. But the <hi>papacy</hi> bred ſilently, as a gangrene in the church within. That cockatrice was long a hatching in the ſhell, before it did appear. It was a ſecret departure from the truth, cauſed by errors ſtolen into the church, <hi>ſenſim, ſine ſenſu,</hi> inſenſibly and unawares: Whence appears the difference between open he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy and clandeſtine apoſtacy. The one is eaſy to be known, becauſe it works openly, in the day: The other hard to be diſcovered, becauſe it makes its approaches only in the night.</q> Let Mr. L. only make the ſmall charge of the word <hi>papacy</hi> into <hi>prelacy,</hi> and the anſwer will be exactly adapted to his queſtion.</p>
               <p>OR if this account ſhould be thought of too late a date, I will refer him to that given by Jerom, one of the fathers. His words are theſe:—<q>The preſbyter therefore is the ſame with the biſhop. And therefore, by the <hi>devil's inſtinct,</hi> there were parties in religion, and it was ſaid among the people, I am of Paul, I of Apollos, I of Cephas; <hi>the churches were governed by the common council preſbyters:</hi> But after every one thought, thoſe he baptized to be rather <hi>his</hi> than Chriſt's; it was agreed in the whole world, that one of the preſbyters ſhould be ſet above the reſt, to whom the care of all the church ſhould belong, and the ſeeds of diviſion taken away.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hieron. com. in Tit. tom. 9, p. 103.</note>

               </p>
               <p>I HAVE ſometimes heard it remarked, indeed, as a fort of inconſiſtency in the church of England, to diſcover ſuch a partial affection to that of Rome, as to allow of their orders as valid while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thoſe of all proteſtant churches; and boaſt ſo much of a ſucceſſion through that church, which in their homilies they call "a filthy old withered harlot, and ſo far from being of the nature of a true church, that for more than nine hundred years before the reformation, nothing could be more." This, however, Mr. L. denies. They did not, he ſays, derive either their power, or chriſtiamity from Rome. "The Britiſh church flouriſhed, he tells us, many hundred years—before the goſpel took place in England." I anſwer:—That chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity was early introduced into England, is not denied. Who firſt preached it there, is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. 'Tis ſtill more ſo in what form, whether preſbyterian or epiſcopalian, that church was firſt ſettled. If Paul was the firſt who brought the goſpel to Britain and planted chriſtianity there, as many writers ſay; it is preſumed, that ſince he himſelf was ordained by preſbyters, that was the form of ordination and government he would eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh there. As to king Lucius, whom Mr. L. makes to be the firſt chriſtian king, and the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of an arch-biſhoprick in London; the time of his converſion is ſo uncertain, that Fuller, in his church hiſtory, reckons up no leſs than twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſix different accounts of it by different writers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt and laſt of which, there is no leſs

All equally ſunk in error, ſuperſtition, and idolatry, and equally "drunk with the cup of abominations, and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fornications, of that old withered har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot." Where then, I aſk, will Mr. L. find a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for their clergy, except through the biſhops of the Romiſh church? His attempts to derive it through a line of "ancient Britiſh biſhops," is a mere chimera, that ſcarce deſerves notice. There were no ſuch biſhops to be found in England, during the greateſt part of that time. I readily allow that chriſtianity had been planted in England, before Auſtin's arrival; that upon the Saxon inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a number of the Britiſh chriſtians retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mountains of Wales, and preſerved their liberty and chriſtianity. It is further granted, that upon Auſtin's coming into England, the old Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh clergy in Wales, refuſed at firſt to ſubmit to the Pope's authority. In conſequence of which the greateſt part of them were cruelly put to the ſword, in the city of Bangor, ſaid to be effected by Auſtin's means.<note n="*" place="bottom">Full. ch. Hiſt. lib. 2, page 63.</note> The remainder were too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable a handful to make any oppoſition to Auſtin, who was commiſſioned by the Roman pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and ſupported by the power of the Saxon kings, ſundry of whom are ſaid to be his early converts. If theſe Welch biſhops therefore, were thoſe Mr. L. means by his "ancient Britiſh biſhops" from whom their clergy derive their ſucceſſion, and who he tells us "as far as poſſible, prevented all that came from Rome from getting into the vacant churches;" the oppoſition they made, could be but very feeble at beſt, and muſt certainly have
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031609_0042_0FED5ABC355657B8"/>ceaſed, after the greateſt part of them were cut off. And as to the remainder of them we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured from hiſtory, that they ſoon after ſubmitted to the church of Rome: "For Laurentius, who ſucceeded Auſtin, as arch-biſhop of Canterbury, by demeaning himſelf more humbly, that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor had done, reduced the reſcuent Britons to ſome tolerable conformity to the Romiſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ful. ch. Hiſt. page 68.</note> And ſo entirely were the ancient Britons, brought under the eccleſiaſtical dominion of the Romiſh church of England, that about A. D. 1279, near three hundred years before the reformation, "John Peckham, arch-biſhop of Canterbury, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually excommunicated their prince, becauſe he could not prevail upon him to be at peace with England."<note n="‖" place="bottom">id.

What then can Mr. L. mean, by pretending to keep up a diſtinction between the Britiſh clergy, and thoſe of the Romiſh church? Wales, for many hundred years before the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was as really under the "papal yoke," as he terms it, and received their biſhops "from Rome" as much as any other part of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>BUT if this had not been the caſe: Had it been, as his argument ſuppoſes, that there was a diſtinct ſucceſſion of biſhops kept up in Wales, in a direct line from the ancient Britiſh biſhops, even till the reformation; this will afford him no manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as to the preſent clergy of their church. They, certainly, can claim no benefit from ſuch a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Welch biſhops; for not one of the

The fact was truly this. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the reformation under Henry VIII. all the biſhops, abbots and priors in England, (Fiſher biſhop of Rocheſter only excepted) complied with it, as far as it was then carried.<note n="*" place="bottom">Burn. eccl. hiſt. abridg. vol 1, page 106.</note> This therefore, could not be the time Mr. L. ſpeaks of, "when all that were ordained at Rome, refuſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the reformation, and returned to Rome from whence they came." For at this time none returned to Rome; and but one in the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, refuſed to comply with the changes that were made. By the reformation, therefore, he muſt mean, the revival of it in Queen Elizabeth's reign. Then indeed, all the biſhops in the kingdom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Kitchen of Landaff, refuſed to comply with it and were turned out. None of them, however, "returned to Rome, as he aſſerts, ſave one only, and but three left the kingdom, viz. Pates, biſhop of Worcheſter, Scot of Cheſter, and Goldwell of St. Aſaph.<note n="‖" place="bottom">id. vol. 2, p. 332. Ful. ch. hiſt. B. 8, p. 58.</note> This is conſiderably ſhort of the number <hi>fourteen,</hi> mentioned by Mr. L. Now this being the caſe, that all the biſhops in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not only of England, but Wales too, except one, were deprived; where will he go to make out a ſucceſſion for their clergy, from the old Britiſh biſhops? They were all, ſave one, deprived, and a new ſucceſſion begun in Parker, from whom all the biſhops ever ſince, muſt derive their claim. Unleſs therefore, he can prove, that Parker was conſecrated by the deſcendants of thoſe "ancient Britiſh biſhops," his pretended ſucceſſion from them, is inevitably overthrown. But to the utter deſtruction of his ſcheme, ſo it happened, that Parker, (from-whom all the clergy of the church
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031609_0043_0FED5AEAC65863C0"/>of England, both biſhops and preſbyters, ever ſince, derive their ſucceſſion) was conſecrated, not by any of the biſhops of Wales, but by four Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh biſhops, who had been conſecrated in king Edward's time, had been deprived in the reign of Queen Mary, and had never been reſtored. For the men who conſecrated Parker, were Barlow, formerly biſhop of Bath and Wells, Scory of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, Coverdale of Exeter, and Hodgſkins fuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan of Bedford.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ful. ch. hiſt. B. 9, page 60.</note> But none of theſe had been biſhops of Wales. It is true the writ of Parker's conſecration, named Kitchen of Landaff for one. But it is equally true that he never appeared to aſſiſt at the conſecration, and ſo it was performed without him by the four above named. Where then, I repeat it, will Mr. L. make out his ſucceſſion, through the line of the old Britiſh biſhops? If he was ſo unacquainted with hiſtory, as not to know that there was no manner of foundation for ſuch a pretence, he was unqualified to write upon the ſubject, and ought not to have meddled with it. If not, he has deſignedly impoſed upon his readers, and ought "to retract."</p>
               <p>THE truth of the caſe is, no hiſtory of the Britiſh church furniſhes the leaſt foundation, even of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for ſuch a ſucceſſion. Biſhop Burnet ſays, that the reformers in England, expreſſly allowed "that England received the faith from thoſe ſent from Rome by pope Gregory the great, i. e. Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin and his monks.<note n="*" place="bottom">Abridg. Vol. 1. page 103.</note> And all the advocates for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted ſucceſſion, I have ever ſeen, till Mr. L's book appeared, unanimouſly agree in tracing it up to Auſtin, and through him to St. Peter. Mr. Beach in particular, ſome years ago, in his controverſy with Mr. Hobart, ſays, "the preſent arch-biſhop of Canterbury is the ſeventy-third, who has fet in that ſee, ſince Auſtin the monk."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Vind. page 7.</note>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:031609_0043_0FED5AEAC65863C0"/>And tho' I don't imagine there is any great prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of an unbroken ſucceſſion, even in that line, yet it muſt be ſought there, or no where. 'Till therefore Mr. L. brings us ſome better authority for one, through the old Britiſh biſhops, than his bare aſſertion; he muſt expect it will be treated with that contempt, ſuch a viſionary enthuſiaſtic ſcheme deſerves.</p>
               <p>I CALL this notion of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion, and the abſolute neceſſity of it to render goſpel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration valid, a <hi>viſionary enthuſiaſtic</hi> ſcheme. It is ſo even when traced in any line. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the fact is ſo ſmall, and the probability, or rather evidence of an interruption, ſo great, that a man muſt renounce the common principles of credibility, and act by an implicit faith, to give in to it, or at leaſt to lay any great weight upon it. But to be very confident of it, and that in a line where it is abſolutely certain it is not to be found, argues, if poſſible, a greater degree of weakneſs and credulity than what the moſt viſionary enthuſiaſts are influenced by. And is not this even the caſe with our author? For though he diſclaims a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion through the Romiſh church and lays the whole ſtreſs upon one thro' the old Britiſh biſhops, which never had any exiſtence, ſave in a heated imagination, he is ſo confident of the truth of it, that he tells us, "we have as good evidence that their clergy derive their authority, by an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſſion from the apoſtles, (meaning thro' the line aforeſaid) as we have of the deſcent of all mankind from Adam by ordinary generation."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 26.</note> The higheſt evidence to which, even Mr. Beach, pretended in this caſe, and that in a line too, which bid much fairer, than the romantic one of our author, was only to put it upon a level, with that of the Levitical prieſthood in the family of Aaron. This indeed was much too high. But even this it
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031609_0044_0FED5AD49FA33288"/>ſeems will not content Mr. L. Nothing ſhort of one, equal to that "of our deſcent from Adam, will ſerve his turn." If the faith of the advocates of this doctrine, continues thus increaſing, we may expect it will ſoon grow up to full aſſurance; and that the next ſtickler for uninterrupted ſucceſſion, will put the evidence of it upon a par with that of our exiſtence.</p>
               <p>LET us however, examine Mr. L's proof: And here let it be noted, that we have the moſt clear and expreſs ſcriptural evidence of our natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from Adam, and therefore are abſolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it.<note n="‖" place="bottom">See Gen. i. 27, &amp; ii. 22. Mal. ii. 15.10. Acts xvii. 26.</note> The ſame he tells us, we have for the uninterrupted ſucceſſion of their clergy from the apoſtles. Let it be alſo remembered, that this ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt be in a line of biſhops as ſuperior to preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for he calls it "a regular ſucceſſion of the <hi>epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power,</hi>" "an apoſtolic ſucceſſion," and "a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the goſpel miniſtry in the three orders." Barely a ſucceſſion in the line of <hi>preſbyters</hi> will not ſuffice. For we have ſuch a ſucceſſion up to their biſhops, and yet he denies us to be the miniſters of Chriſt. Now the argument by which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove his ſucceſſion, is this. Chriſt's promiſe to his miniſters, contained in his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in Mat. xviii. 20, muſt have failed unleſs there has been ſuch a ſucceſſion as he pleads for, that is, in a direct line of biſhops as a ſuperior order in the church. But why muſt the promiſe have failed, unleſs there has been <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſucceſſion? There is nothing in the commiſſion, limiting the promiſe to ſuch a ſuperior order: Not the leaſt hint of the inſtitution of ſuch an order. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is but one, and therefore one order only is inſtituted by it. But if there were two, or ten, it would make no alteration: Since the promiſe is not limitted to any one in particular, a ſucceſſion in either of them would anſwer all the ends of fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031609_0044_0FED5AD49FA33288"/>the promiſe. Mr. L. himſelf allows that this promiſe belongs to preſbyters.<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 29.</note> If ſo, then a continuation of the ſucceſſion in the line of preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, would as effectually ſerve the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſe, as one in the line of biſhops: Conſequently, if it has been continued in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the promiſe is fully accompliſhed, even tho' it has been broken or interrupted in the latter; and therefore his argument from the promiſe, in ſupport of a ſucceſſion in the line of biſhops, is by his own confeſſion, intirely defeated.</p>
               <p>THE truth is, as the commiſſion ſuppoſes but one order in the miniſtry, the utmoſt that can be argued from the annexed promiſe, in favour of a ſucceſſion, even of any kind, is that there ſhall be a <hi>miniſtry</hi> continued in the church, to the end of time. How, or in what manner miniſters ſhall be introduced, whether in a regular unbroken fine of ſucceſſion or not, whether by a ſuperior or inferior order of miniſters, yea whether by the officers of the church or the brethren, as the commiſſion is wholly ſilent upon this head, ſo nothing relative thereto can be concluded from it. And although from other texts it appears, that it belongs, not to the private brethren, but to miniſters to ordain; yet for aught appearing in the commiſſion itſelf, a ſucceſſion of miniſters, even by lay ordination, would have as effectually ſecured the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſe, as one by preſbyters, yea or biſhops themſelves.</p>
               <p>THUS his bold aſſertion "that we have the ſame evidence for the ſucceſſion he pleads for, as we have for our deſcent from Adam, finally comes to this." For one we have the certain, indubitable, repeated, expreſs teſtimony of infallible ſcripture, which is evidence of the higheſt kind. For the other, we have only his forced interpretation of a particular text, which is no evidence at all.</p>

BUT if ſcripture will not ſupport his confidence in this point, perhaps he thinks hiſtory will. For he tells us "there can be no inſtance produced from all eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, of any one man's being owned, by the church univerſal, as a biſhop, who was not ordained by another biſhop, or by an officer in the church ſuperior to a preſbyter."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 26.</note> 'Till this is done, he thinks "it unreaſonable to diſbelieve the ſucceſſion in the three orders." This argument for a ſucceſſion, is the univerſal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the church, that there has, in fact, been ſuch a ſucceſſion. Now the fact here aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is either true, or it is not true. If it is not true in fact, that there has been any ſuch univerſal acknowledgment, in favour of a ſucceſſion, which is doubtleſs the caſe; then his argument founded upon ſuch acknowledgment is at once deſtroyed. But if it is true, his argument founded upon it, is inconcluſive; for if it proves the point in queſtion, it will equally prove other things, which even Mr. L. himſelf will not admit as truths.
<q>The ſum of the argument, he tells us, is this: Chriſt, at firſt, did appoint a certain number of men with power to ſend others: The church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal never could be induced to receive officers, unleſs they were ordained by ſuch officers, as Chriſt appointed to ordain; therefore there has been a ſucceſſion of ſuch officers, as Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at firſt, which are apoſtles, or, as they have been ſince called, biſhops. This evidence for the apoſtolic ſucceſſion, he ſays, is fully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfy a rational enquiry, whatever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> if this argument proves an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of biſhops as ſuperior to preſbyters, it will equally prove the Pope's ſupremacy, together with other doctrines equally abſurd.

CHRIST did at firſt ſay unto Peter, "unto thee I commit the keys of the kingdom," &amp;c. "The church univerſal never could be induced to ſubmit to an authority Chriſt had not inſtituted;" but the church univerſal, for many hundred years, did in fact ſubmit to the pope, as Peter's ſucceſſor and the vicar of Chriſt; therefore the pope's ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, &amp;c. is of divine inſtitution. Or thus:— Chriſt did at firſt appoint the ſacrament of his ſupper, to be adminiſtered to the proper ſubjects of it: The church univerſal never could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to depart from Chriſt's appointment, in this reſpect: But the church univerſal did in fact, for a long time practice giving the ſacrament to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; therefore this practice was no departure from Chriſt's inſtitution. Whether this "evidence will be ſufficient to ſilence the ſpirit of party," in any who ſhould happen to diſpute the pretended au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his holineſs, the pope, or the lawfulneſs of giving the ſacrament to infants, I will not take upon me, abſolutely, to determine. Sure I am, however, it is the ſame evidence he has brought, in ſupport of his apoſtolic ſucceſſion, "and as fully ſufficient to ſatisfy a rational enquiry."</p>
               <p>I HAVE been thus long upon the point of a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, not that the defence of the ſermons I am vindicating, is concerned in it; for neither of them ſay any thing about it. Nor would I be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, abſolutely to deny, that there has been a ſucceſſion in the chriſtian miniſtry. I rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to think there has; though not ſuch an one as Mr. L. contends for, in a line of biſhops ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to preſbyters. Of this there is ſcarcely the leaſt probability. But my motive herein was, to expoſe the weakneſs of ſuch high claims, and the dangerous tendency of laying ſo much weight upon this ſame epiſcopal ſucceſſion, as the zealous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for it commonly do. As to the weakneſs
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031609_0046_0FED5A96E242D408"/>of the proof, I preſume it has been ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. The danger of laying ſo much ſtreſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, muſt be obvious at firſt view. It naturally tends to fill the minds of ſerious chriſtians, with perplexing doubts and ſears, as to the validity and efficacy of the goſpel adminiſtrations, on which they attend; and utterly deprive them of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and edification they might otherwiſe hope to receive from them. At the ſame time, it gives a handle to deiſts and infidels, to banter and ridicule the moſt important truths of chriſtianity, while they thus behold them, and that even by its <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> ſunk to a level, in point of evidence, with the moſt doubtful and diſputable points.</p>
               <p>I SHALL conclude what I have to ſay upon this head, in the words of a learned prelate of the church of England;
<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſh. Hoadley's preſervative, page 75, &amp;c.</note> as probably it will be more convincing to Mr. L. and thoſe of his ſtamp, than any thing I can ſay.

Upon which they condemned the whole church of England, as ſchiſmatical, in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone off from this ſame line of ſucceſſion, our author contends for, and like him and his zealous brethren, arrogated the whole power of the church and miniſtry to themſelves.—Upon which the learned biſhop thus writes.</p>

However, ſince he chooſes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat only this one argument, I ſhall follow him in his remarks upon it. His words are,
<q>Mr. Welles ſays, page 17, theſe laſt words (meaning the promiſe annexed to the commiſſion) plainly ſhew that this promiſe was made, not to the perſons of the apoſtles, but to their office as miniſters in Chriſt's church; and conſequently that their office is to continue to the end of the world.— He aſſerts, page 16, this is the commiſſion, and the only commiſſion we have any account of,—which Chriſt gave to his apoſtles.</q> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which Mr. E. ſays, muſt be this,— "that the commiſſion conſtituted them <hi>apoſtles,</hi> and therefore the <hi>apoſtolic office</hi> muſt continue to the end of time."
<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER.—If by <hi>apoſtolic office,</hi> he means the office the apoſtles ſuſtained, as ordinary miniſters in the church; I readily grant that the commiſſion in Mat. xxviii. did conſtitute them apoſtles, and that their office, in this ſenſe of it, is to continue to the end of the world. But if by <hi>apoſtolic office,</hi> he means their office as <hi>apoſtles,</hi> properly ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conſidered in their extraordinary character, I deny that it was to be continued, and affirm there is nothing in the words he pretends to quote from me, that will infer ſuch a concluſion. 'Tis true I ſaid, and ſtill ſay, "that the promiſe of Chriſt's preſence to the end of the world, annexed to the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031609_0048_0FED5ADB89EA4CB0"/>commiſſion, was made, not to the <hi>perſons</hi> of the apoſtles, but to their <hi>office.</hi>" But as what? Not as apoſtles, but as I there expreſs it, "as miniſters in Chriſt's church," i e. ſtanding ordinary miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I alſo ſaid, "that is the commiſſion, and the only one, we have any account of, that Chriſt gave his apoſtles." But then I added, "in virtue of which they were impowered to act <hi>as miniſters in his church,</hi>" i. e. as ordinary ſtanding miniſters, as the whole connexion of my diſcourſe ſhewed. Had Mr. L. thus quoted my words at large, every reader would have ſeen the weakneſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion he pretends to draw from them. They are ſo far from giving any countenance to his notion of, "a continuation of the <hi>apoſtolic office</hi> as ſuch; that on the contrary, they very expreſſly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between <hi>this,</hi> and their ordinary character, and very clearly ſhew, that it was the latter, and not the former, that was to be perpetuated, and in which they were to have ſucceſſors to the end of time. This, I preſume, is ſufficient to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my words from this conſequence he pretends to draw from them.</p>
               <p>BUT, ſays Mr. L. "the conſequence (meaning from my words) is plainly this; that the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion conſtituted them apoſtles, or elſe that they acted as apoſtles without any commiſſion."</p>
               <p>I ANSWER:—This is by no means a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence neither. Had I ſaid, as he has imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly quoted me, "that this is the only commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we have any account of, that Chriſt gave his apoſtles," and had added nothing further, it would indeed have followed, not as he ſays, "that they acted without any commiſſion;" but that, for aught appeared in ſcripture, they acted without any. Theſe two concluſions are very different.— The ſcripture gives no account of the ordination of Silas, Apollos, Epaphroditus, &amp;c. I truſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he himſelf will not from hence conclude that
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031609_0048_0FED5ADB89EA4CB0"/>they acted as miniſters without any commiſſion or ordination. But then he well knew, that when I ſaid, "this is the only commiſſion," &amp;c. I meant the only one they received <hi>as ſtanding goſpel miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> inveſted with an office to be perpetuated.— This diſtinction was fully expreſſed in the clauſe he has ſeen ſit to ſuppreſs, viz. "in virtue of which they were impowered to act as miniſters," &amp;c.— His concluſion therefore, "that this commiſſion conſtituted them apoſtles, or elſe they acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a commiſſion," no ways follows. For altho' as <hi>ſtanding ordinary miniſters,</hi> they had no other commiſſion, yet they might have <hi>as apoſtles.</hi> It was in the former view I ſpake of them, not in the latter. Certainly they were called apoſtles long before this commiſſion was given, even upon their being called by Chriſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. x. 2.</note> Paul was called and commiſſioned to be an <hi>apoſtle,</hi> and acted as ſuch, long before he received ordination as <hi>a ſtanding geſpel miniſter.</hi> The commiſſion of the apoſtles as ſuch, as extraordinary officers, was in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way; by an immediate call from heaven. As apoſtles, they were all with Paul "not of men, neither by men, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. i. 1.</note> When it was they received <hi>this</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, whether upon their firſt call, as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or at the day of Penticoſt, as others think, is perhaps difficult certainly to determine. As their <hi>apoſtolic office,</hi> properly ſo called, was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and temporary, there was no occaſion the commiſſion, impowering them thereto, ſhould be particularly recorded in ſcripture. This was given to them <hi>in perſon;</hi> and as they were to have no ſucceſſors in it, none elſe had any concern with it. But as <hi>ſtanding ordinary miniſters,</hi> they were to have ſucceſſors to the end of time; and therefore it was neceſſary their commiſſion, in this charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhould be particularly recorded; for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031609_0049_0FED5AF49341E6B0"/>their ſucceſſors as well as themſelves. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find, this commiſſion is in fact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded: 'Tis that we have been conſidering: 'Tis that to which the promiſe is annexed of Chriſt's preſence to the end of the world; and the ſame concerning which I aſſerted in my ſermon, "that it is the only one, we have any account of, which Chriſt gave to his apoſtles, in virtue of which they were improved to act as <hi>ordinary</hi> miniſters in his church." And for this purpoſe, no doubt it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that it might be a ſtanding commiſſion, impowering, authorizing and directing, all the true miniſters of Chriſt to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>OUR author's next remark is to this purpoſe,— that while I am proving from one commiſſion, that one order only of miniſters can be virtuated by it, I myſelf, in effect, allow two, and ſo defeat my own argument: For he ſays, I call the apoſtles in one place, <hi>extraordinary officers,</hi> and in another, <hi>ordinary ones,</hi> and yet theſe are both impowered by one commiſſion; hence he concludes that I am "refuted by myſelf."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 28, 29.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I ANSWER, had he honeſtly cited the paſſage he pretended to quote from me, the weakneſs of this concluſion of his would have been obvious at firſt view. 'Tis true I ſpeak of the apoſtles, as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the twofold character or office, of apoſtles, and ordinary goſpel miniſters. But then it is equally true that I ſpeak only with reſpect to the <hi>latter,</hi> when I ſay, "this is the commiſſion and the only commiſſion we have any account of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from Chriſt." This diſtinction and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation I fully enough expreſſed, in the paſſage from which he quotes theſe words, though he has ſeen fit to ſuppreſs it by a partial and imperfect quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such acts may help to ſupport a bad cauſe: A good one has no need of them. Will it at all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that becauſe the apoſtles, conſidered <hi>ordinary</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:031609_0049_0FED5AF49341E6B0"/>miniſters of Chriſt, are impowered by this one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral commiſſion, that they muſt as <hi>extraordinary</hi> officers alſo be impowered by the ſame? If it will not, then there is no force at all in Mr. L's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from my argument, as though it allowed of two orders being impowered by one and the ſame commiſſion. As there is nothing expreſſly ſaid, or even implied in this commiſſion, of more than one order to be impowered by it; not the leaſt intimation, that the powers it contains are to be divided, and the whole given to one order, and part only to another; and finally, as it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent to ſuppoſe, that two or more officers, the one ſuperior, the other ſubordinate, ſhould be vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated and appointed by one and the ſame commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we may I think, fairly conclude, that one order of goſpel miniſters, and only one, is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and impowered by this commiſſion; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that all the powers contained in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion belong to that one order, and that of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination among the reſt. I preſume therefore, my argument from the one commiſſion, ſtill ſtands good, notwithſtanding all Mr. L. has ſaid againſt it.</p>
               <p>I HAD ſaid in my ſermon, "that the apoſtles in their extraordinary character, had no ſucceſſors." This Mr. L. calls "a bold aſſertion," and demands "what evidence I had produced to ſupport it."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 29.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. As the aſſertion is a negative, had no evidence been produced, it would hardly have deſerved the epithet of "bold." According to the rules of argumentation, the proof lies upon thoſe who affirm a fact, not upon thoſe who deny it. Had Mr. L. however, carefully read over the page in my ſermon, from whence he pretends to quote the paſſage, he muſt have ſeen the evidence he demands. My words are theſe,
<q>It muſt be remembered that the apoſtles ſuſtained a twofold
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031609_0050_0FED5AAFF9F15FC0"/>character; the one extraordinary as apoſtles, the other ordinary as goſpel miniſters. In their extraordinary capacity, they were immediately called by Chriſt. Were ſent forth by him to be witneſſes of his reſurrection.—Were endowed with extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, the knowledge of tongues, the power of diſcerning ſpirits, and of working miracles. They were not limitted to any particular place, one more than another, for the exerciſe of their miniſtry; but had the whole world aſſigned them as their charge; and being under the infallible guidance of divine inſpiration, they had the ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and government of all the churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, until the canon of ſcripture ſhould be full, and compleat rules given for that purpoſe in the word of God. In this they had no ſucceſſors, but this part of their office expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with themſelves: For as there is now no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for theſe extraordinary powers, ſince the ſcripture is ſufficiently atteſted, its canon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, and every thing neceſſary for the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and government of the church, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly revealed; ſo there are no men ſince the times of the apoſtles, who can lay any claim to theſe extraordinary and miraculous powers; and therefore none can pretend to be ſucceſſors to them in that part of their <hi>character</hi> which was founded on theſe powers.</q>—This was the ſenſe in which I aſſerted "the apoſtles had no ſucceſſors," and theſe the reaſons I aſſigned for ſuch aſſertion; and to me they appear concluſive. As this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary character of the apoſtles had its riſe in the extraordinary circumſtances, attending them, and was founded in the extraordinary powers beſtowed upon them, it muſt neceſſarily have ceaſed, if the circumſtances and powers have ceaſed, on which it was founded; but that the latter have ceaſed, Mr. L. will not deny: For whatever powers they
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031609_0050_0FED5AAFF9F15FC0"/>claim for their biſhops, the pretended ſucceſſors of the apoſtles; I think that of working miracles is not one of them. If he can produce any inſtance of that kind ſufficiently authenticated, they ſhall be properly noticed; if not, he muſt not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, if people look upon the claim a little aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, nor pretend the "aſſertion is more bold" than true, if the right to aſſume the character ſhould happen to be denied.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>This aſſertion "that the apoſtles as ſuch, have no ſucceſſors, which Mr. L. calls "an opinion which has nothing to ſupport it but the prejudices of education," is no way peculiar to preſbyterians. The learned Spanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, though a zealous prelatiſt, in his diſpute with the papiſts againſt the Pope's ſupremacy as Peter's ſuceſſor, maintains that the apoſtolic character is founded in an in mediate call, the gift of tongues, and power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, and is not perpetuared.
<q>Let the Pope, ſays he, now deſcend from the capitol. Let him, as did the apoſtles, declare that he has the gift of tongues divinely infuſed. Let him bring viſibly the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt from heaven. Let him work like the apoſtles, ſuch illuſtrious miracles, and then we ſhall yield that he has <hi>apoſtolic authority.</hi>
                        </q> He adds.
<q>They are much deceived who would bring the apoſtles down to the order of particular biſhops. They were not at all called apoſtles, on the account that they were biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, and conſequently, apoſtle and biſhop are quite different things.</q>

<q>That the aportle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was an order forever inimitable in the church.— The apoſtles could not ordain an apoſtle by the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands, as they could ordain elders; but they are forced to uſe a divine lot, which was as the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand of Chriſt impoſed on him that was to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. That opinion took little notice of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, that hath placed biſhops in the place of the apoſtles, by a common and ſucceſſive ordination.</q>

OUR author's next attack upon this argument of the one commiſſion, is from the order of deacons, whom the apoſtles, he ſays, by virtue of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, conſtituted and ordained. "They were ordained, he tells us, to do ſomething which the apoſtles did, before theſe deacons were conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their office."<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 30, 31. Chill. Relig. proteſt.</note> It is pity he had not told us what this <hi>ſomething</hi> was, they were ordained to do. This he purpoſely evades; and he had his reaſons for it. If he had done this, he was ſenſible it would have at once appeared, that their office was not contained in, or virtuated by this commiſſion, and ſo have overthrown his objection againſt my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was "that one and the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, could conſtitute but one office only."— This <hi>ſomething</hi> to which theſe deacons were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was to <hi>ſerve tables,</hi> concerning which work, not the leaſt hint is to be found in the miniſterial commiſſion. That indeed impowers thoſe to
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:031609_0051_0FED5B5F16D79090"/>whom it is given, to <hi>preach, baptize,</hi> &amp;c. but ſays not a ſingle word of <hi>ſerving tables</hi> and managing the church ſtock, the peculiar buſineſs of deacons. As therefore the deacon's office is not contained in, or virtuated by this commiſſion; ſo the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of them no ways militates againſt my argument, that where there is but one commiſſion, there can be but one order or office impowered by it.</p>
               <p>BUT though he cannot find the work of a deacon contained in the miniſterial commiſſion, he ſeems very deſirous of having their office virtuated by it, that ſo he may make out two orders impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame commiſſion, contrary to what I had aſſerted. "If, ſays he, the commiſſion of the apoſtles, impowered them to ordain but one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of officers; how came they to conſtitute the office of deacons."<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 31.</note> I anſwer:—They did it, not by virtue of the <hi>miniſterial</hi> commiſſion we have been conſidering, but of that which conſtituted them <hi>apoſtles.</hi> The former, as has been ſhewed, bolonged to them, not as <hi>apoſtles,</hi> but as ordinary miniſters of Chriſt, impowered thereby to <hi>preach, baptize,</hi> &amp;c. In virtue of this, they were no more impowered to conſtitute a new order, than any of their ſucceſſors in the ſame office. But as <hi>apoſtles,</hi> as divinely inſpired, and under the infallible gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Holy Ghoſt, they had power to do it. And in this capacity, and this only, they act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they inſtituted this office. As therefore, it was not in virtue of, or by power derived from the general miniſterial commiſſion, that this office of deacons was inſtituted; ſo there can be no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument brought from their appointment, in proof of two or more offices virtuated by this commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; conſequently, my argument, "that where there is but one commiſſion, one order only can be virtuated or impowered by it," ſtill ſtands good.</p>
               <p>I READILY allow "the office of deacon, to be
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031609_0052_0FED5AFF9D517288"/>inferior to that of <hi>apoſtle.</hi>" I grant "it is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in which the power of ordination is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded." And if it will pleaſe him, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede too, that they may in a general ſenſe, be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "miniſters in Chriſt's church." But then, as they are ſo, not by virtue of the general commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion given to miniſters as <hi>miniſters of the word and ſacraments;</hi> but by the expreſs appointment of the apoſtles, acting in their <hi>apoſtolic</hi> character; this will afford no argument in favour, either of his preaching deacons, or of his notion that two or more orders are impowered by this one commiſſion. —Let him ſhew in this commiſſion, or elſewhere, as particular an account of the appointment of their two orders of biſhops and preſbyters, as we can produce of the inſtitution of deacons. Let him produce as expreſs warrant for deacons preaching, from the account of their firſt inſtitution, as we have for that of preſbyters, in the general miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial commiſſion; and we will readily allow their ſcheme of dioceſan epiſcopacy to be warranted by ſcripture: 'Till then, he muſt not be offended if people call it by its true and proper name, an unſcriptural ſcheme that has no countenance from the word of God.</p>
               <p>BUT he tells me, that I undertook to prove the right of people to chooſe their own miniſters, from the inſtance of deacons being choſen by the church. "Now, ſays he, if theſe deacons were miniſters, it proves that there was more than one order of miniſters at that time: If they were not, it does not prove the point for which he brought it."<note n="§" place="bottom">Page 30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Deacons being called miniſters in a general ſenſe, agreeable to the original import of the word DIACONOS, will not prove them to be miniſters in the ſenſe of the commiſſion, that is, <hi>miniſters of the word and ſacraments.</hi> If ſo, Mr. L. muſt admit of a <hi>fourth</hi> order into their prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031609_0052_0FED5AFF9D517288"/>viz. that of ſhe-miniſters: For the apoſtle calls Phoebe a <hi>miniſter,</hi> (DIACONON) "of the church of Cenchrea."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. xvi. 1.</note> Conſequently, calling deacons <hi>min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters</hi> in this <hi>general ſenſe,</hi> will not prove "that there was more than one order of miniſters, <hi>in the proper ſenſe,</hi> at that time." And yet their being miniſters in this general ſenſe, that is, officers or ſervants of the church, and as ſuch, choſen and elected by the church, affords a good argument in proof of the church's right to chooſe her own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in general, and conſequently thoſe who are to miniſter in the word and ſacraments in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. This inſtance therefore, of the deacons elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the church does as effectually "prove the point for which I brought it," as if they had been miniſters in the moſt ſtrict and appropriate ſenſe of the word. Thus my arguments for but one order of goſpel miniſters, ſtand, I truſt, fully vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated from this cavil alſo.</p>
               <p>THOUGH deacons, in the general ſenſe above, may be called miniſters, yet 'tis plain from their original inſtitution they never were deſigned to be miniſters of the word. The occaſion of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and the buſineſs they were appointed to do, is there expreſſly ſaid to be, "to ſerve ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,"
<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts vi. 1—4.</note> and that with a ſpecial expreſs view that the apoſtles being releaſed from this care; might be at liberty to purſue their proper work, to "give themſelves to prayer and the miniſtry of the word." Who can once imagine then, that preaching is any part of the deacons buſineſs? That when the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles found, that "ſerving tables" was inconſiſtent with and too much for the miniſters of the word, and accordingly inſtituted the order of deacons to eaſe them of that burden, they ſhould nevertheleſs devolve the whole burden of both upon the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons they had appointed? The apoſtles themſelves were not ſufficient for both; but the deacons whom
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:031609_0053_0FED5B08B115A4B0"/>they appointed, it ſeems were, if the doctrine of <hi>preaching deacons</hi> be true. When the deacon is employed in his proper work, I know no body that "deſpiſes him" (as Mr. L. complains.) It is an honorable office in the church, and ought to be ſo eſteemed. But when he leaves his buſineſs, and becomes "a buſy body in other mens matters;" when he invades an office the ſcripture never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him, and preſumes to preach as a miniſter of the word; if he is not to be <hi>deſpiſed</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, moſt certainly he ought to be <hi>rebuked</hi> for his raſhneſs and preſumption.</p>
               <p>IN my argument from the one commiſſion, I had theſe words. "Who hath a right to divide the powers Chriſt has evidently connected in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and give the whole to one order of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, and but half to the other; or rather to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a new order of officers in the church which the goſpel knows nothing of?" From theſe laſt words Mr. L. attempts to prove, that I have cut myſelf off from a regular ordination. For if either the biſhops or preſbyters in their church, are this "new order which the goſpel knows nothing of;" as we derive our ſucceſſion from the biſhops of their church, by whom our firſt miniſters in this country were ordained, we muſt, he ſuppoſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it from this new order, and therefore our ordinations muſt be null.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 31.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. When any officers in Chriſt's church, in addition to the powers granted them in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, engroſs and exerciſe thoſe which do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, they are ſo far forth "a new order which the goſpel knows nothing of." This I take to be the caſe with dioceſan biſhops. They ingroſs and monopolize the whole power of ordination and government, which the goſpel leaves, in common, to all goſpel miniſters. In doing this, they uſurp a power, which does not belong to them, and in
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031609_0053_0FED5B08B115A4B0"/>the exerciſe of this uſurped power, are "an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the goſpel knows nothing of." This, however, does not nullity thoſe actions, which the goſpel impowers them to perform. Now one of theſe is ordination. Though therefore, in <hi>ingreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole power of ordination,</hi> &amp;c. to themſelves, they act as "a new order of which the goſpel knows nothing of," becauſe they have no right ſo to do; yet barely in <hi>ordaining,</hi> they are an order which the goſpel owns, becauſe, by the goſpel, they have a right to ordain. Again, when an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of officers, from principle, neglect a part of the duties of their office, and which their commiſſion obliges them to do; they are ſo far forth; "a new order which the goſpel knows nothing of." This is the caſe of the preſbyters in the epiſcopal church. Conſidered as ſet apart to the miniſtry by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are lawful goſpel miniſters. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as abridging themſelves of one half of the powers that belong to them, as living in a ſtate of ſervile ſubjection to the biſhop by their oath of canonical obedience; and preaching, not in virtue of Chriſt's commiſſion, but the biſhops licence; they are merely of human inſtitution, a "new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the goſpel knows nothing of." But until it is proved, that an officer's pretending to claim and exerciſe a power which he has not, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troys and nullifies the power which he lawfully has; Mr. L's conſequence, as to the unlawfulneſs of my ordination, will by no means follow. If a juſtice of the peace ſhould pretend to engroſs all the authority of his brother-juſtices in a whole county, 'tis plain in ſo doing, he would be an officer which the law knew nothing of. This, however, would not invalidate thoſe acts, which, as a juſtice, the law impowered him to do. The Pope, with his impious and unſcriptural claim of infallibility and univerſal dominion, over the whole
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031609_0054_0FED5B055287D5E0"/>chriſtian church, I hope Mr. L. will allow, is an officer which the goſpel knows nothing of: And yet he, and all other advocates for uninterrupted ſucceſſion, muſt derive it from him, or upon their own principles, they can have no claim to the miniſterial character. However therefore this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his, might move one to pity its wealt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I find nothing in it to make us "aſhamed of proper beaſting in the miniſterial authority we have received."</p>
               <p>IN page 28 of my ſermon, I argued, that as a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and juſtice of the peace being different of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, muſt be impowered by different commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſo if there were different degrees of office in the goſpel miniſtry, we might reaſonably expect different commiſſions, authorizing them to theſe offices.</p>
               <p>TO this Mr. L. replies, that a governor, by virtue of the king's commiſſion, can authorize a juſtice of the peace and other officers, and juſt ſo the apoſtles, by virtue of their commiſſion from Chriſt, "can authorize men of different orders to act in Chriſt's name."<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 32.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Though a governor can authorize a juſtice and other officers which the laws of the king or conſtitution have appointed, yet he can create no new officer in the ſtate. So in the other caſe. Though the apoſtles could ordain ſuch officers as the goſpel had appointed, yet they could make no new ones, different from, or in addition to thoſe which the laws of Chriſt's kingdom, and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel conſtitution have eſtabliſhed. We know it was agreeable to the goſpel conſtitution, that they ſhould appoint the office of deacon; becauſe they have in fact done it. Beſides this, we read of no other order appointed by them. If there be any, it belongs to our opponents to produce them.— When Chriſt aſcended, he left only his eleven apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031609_0054_0FED5B055287D5E0"/>in commiſſion; all of one order, all equal in power. Had two or more orders been neceſſary in the goſpel miniſtry, he "who was faithful in all his houſe," would certainly have appointed them, or left orders with his apoſtles to do it. As he has not; as neither he nor his apoſtles have inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, except deacons, any more than one order or officers in the goſpel church, 'tis a certain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence there are no other. And therefore Mr. L's plea, from what the apoſtles were "impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to do in authorizing different orders," is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. What they were "impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to do," we muſt judge from what they have in fact done. And as, in fact, they have, beſides deacons, appointed no other order, we may ſafely preſume they were not impowered by Chriſt to appoint any other. As to the three orders which he ſays, they appointed in the church of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, it has already been conſidered and refuted, and his aſſertion proved to be groundleſs.</p>
               <p>HIS next attack upon me, is for ſaying, "that preſbyters have a right to govern the church."— This, he ſays, "I labour hard to prove."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 32.</note> 'Tis true I mentioned this occaſionally, and, I think, ſufficiently proved it, without any "hard labour." He himſelf allows them ſome power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. "That they have a right, in ſubordination to "their apoſtle or biſhop, to govern their own flocks."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 32.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. What kind or degree of government, the miſſionary of Norwalk, as a <hi>ſimple</hi> preſbyter, pretends to, or what manner of diſcipline he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes over the <hi>flock</hi> there, I am not able to ſay. This, however, I can ſay, that if he exerciſes any diſcipline at all, as a ruler in the church, it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out book. The canons of his church and the rules of his order, having allowed nothing of this kind to him, but reſerved the whole affair to his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. If therefore he ſhould preſume to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:031609_0055_0FED5B0A667A72D8"/>any ſuch power, and take it upon him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline any of his unruly <hi>flock,</hi> "I can't ſay, (to uſe his own words to me) how they will reliſh theſe high claims of his." If he ſhould ever attempt any thing of this kind;—"unleſs he does it under the ſpecious pretence of oppoſing <hi>preſbyterians,</hi>"— "and his people ſhould once come to be cool, he muſt take a great deal of pains, and uſe much art, to bring them tamely to ſubmit to this his claim of authority over them."</p>
               <p>FOR the direct proof of the preſbyters right of government, the reader is referred to the latter part of this, and the next ſection. In the mean time there is one ſentence more in this paragraph, which deſerves a remark. It is this:—"If he will allow our biſhops, the ſame power over the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, that the apoſtles exerciſed over their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, we will contend for no more in their behalf."</p>
               <p>ANSWER. 'Tis granted the apoſtles exerciſed authority over thoſe he calls preſbyters, in the age in which they lived. But the ſame did they alſo, over thoſe be calls biſhops; particularly over Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus. If this then is any argument in proof of three orders in the church, in proof of the biſhop's authority over the preſbyter now, it equally proves the neceſſity of four orders, and will as effectually eſtabliſh the authority of the Pope over all other biſhops, as it will theirs over preſbyters. But the authority the apoſtles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed over other goſpel miniſters, whether preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or biſhops, or by whatever name they were called; they did it, not as ordinary miniſters of the church, not as an order to be perpetuated; but as apoſtles, as officers divinely inſpired, &amp;c.— When therefore Mr. L. can prove his biſhops, to have the ſame immediate miſſion, miraculous powers, infallible guidance, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which conſtituted the apoſtolic character and ſuperior au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; it will be then time enough for him to make, and us to grant the above demand.</p>

MR. L. next imputes to me an argument, for ſupport of our ordination, that I never uſed. He ſays "I take a great deal of pains to prove, and often repeat it, that the power of the apoſtles, to ordain and govern, was not expreſſed, but only implied in their commiſſion."
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 32, 33, 34.</note> "This, he ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do in order to prove that the firſt miniſters of this country had power to ordain, though no ſuch power was expreſſed, in the commiſſion they received from the biſhops that ordained them."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 32, 33, 34.</note> Though I never thought of this argument he here frames for me, yet as he advanced ſome things in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon it, which may tend to miſlead the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive, it may be proper to make a few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon what he here offers.—He firſt tells me, that to the account of the commiſſion in Mat. xxviii. I ought to have joined that given by John; chapter xx. 5, 21, 22, 23. Where Chriſt ſays, "As my father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you. Whoſoever ſins ye remit," &amp;c.—"If, ſays he, we lay together the accounts, theſe two apoſtles give of the matter, we ſhall plainly ſee, that in the apoſtles commiſſion, they were expreſſly impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to ſend others—to govern the church—to preach and to baptize."<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 33.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Great weight. I am ſenſible, is laid by the advocates for prelacy, upon theſe words of our Saviour, "as my father hath ſent me," &amp;c. The warm patrons of epiſcopacy, pretend here to find, the biſhops excluſive right to the power of ordination, &amp;c. Though by what logic, is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to ſay. Papiſts, from the ſame text, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſacrifice of the maſs. For as God the Father ſent Chriſt to offer a ſacrifice for lin; ſo Chriſt ſent his apoſtles, and they others, to offer the ſacrifice of the maſs, that is, the real fleſh and blood of Chriſt in the ſacrament of the ſupper. So that theſe words will prove almoſt any thing and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:031609_0056_0FED5B344B718CD8"/>every thing. Now though I don't conceive the miniſterial commiſſion, to be contained in theſe words, but rather in thoſe of Matt. xxviii. Yet if it will gratiry Mr. L. I am willing, for once, to allow it; to allow the commiſſion to be collected from both. But then I don't ſee what ſervice it will be to his cauſe. For though the power of <hi>government</hi> is rather more particularly expreſſed, in John's account than thoſe in Matthew's; <hi>the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power,</hi> about which we are contending, is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as clearly expreſſed in Matthew as in John: Of rather, it is expreſſed in neither. However, tho' the commiſſion in Matthew, ſays nothing expreſſly about ſending others; yet the promiſe of Chriſt's perpetual preſence, annexed to the commiſſion, neceſſarily ſuppoſes it, as I ſhewed in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; conſequently the ordaining power is fairly implied in the commiſſion. But the utmoſt that can be pretended in John's account, is barely as implication of ſuch power. Mr. L. ſuppoſes that the power "of ſending others," is expreſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> theſe words; "As my father hath ſent me, ever ſo ſend I you." Here indeed is expreſs mention of "the Father's ſending Chriſt," and of "Chriſt's ſending the apoſtles;" but not a ſingle word of "the apoſtles ſending others," or any thing <hi>expreſſly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that ſuch power was committed to them. In order to this, the words muſt have been, "as I ſend you, even ſo do ye ſend others." Mr. L. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> conclude, will ſay, that the words, "as my father hath ſent me," &amp;c. contain in them a power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the apoſtles of <hi>ſending</hi> others. I gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> they do. But how? Not <hi>expreſſly,</hi> but only b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> implication. But then the ſame does the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Matthew. As to this then, there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> manner of difference. "Perhaps, therefore, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> uſe his own words) no better reaſon can be given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why Mr. L. will not allow the commiſſion in Mat. xxviii. to be the only miniſterial commiſſion, that
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031609_0056_0FED5B344B718CD8"/>that it does not comport with his <hi>ſcheme.</hi>" Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to "his <hi>ſcheme,</hi>" there are three grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the miniſtry. Men muſt be firſt ordained deacons, then preſbyters, and finally advanced to the higheſt order, biſhops. But, for this, he found, one and the ſame identical commiſſion would not ſuffice. He has therefore, beſides tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mentioned by me, Matthew xxviii. found, as he thinks, another in John xx. "This, he tells us, Chriſt gave to his apoſtles, the night after he roſe from the dead," and ſo before the other. By this then, according to "his <hi>ſcheme,</hi>" the apoſtles muſt have been ordained to no higher order than <hi>deacons,</hi> or at moſt <hi>preſbyters.</hi> The other commiſſion, that in Matthew, he tells us, "was given ſome time after in Gallilee, which therefore, "to comport with his <hi>ſcheme,</hi>" muſt have made them <hi>biſhops.</hi>— But, unhappily for "his <hi>ſcheme,</hi>" the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, according to him, contains the powers of <hi>ordination and government,</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> only thoſe of <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and baptizing.</hi> According to his account, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the apoſtles muſt <hi>firſt</hi> have been ordained to the <hi>higheſt</hi> office of biſhops, and <hi>afterwards</hi> to the <hi>lower</hi> one of preſbyters or deacons; which, to make the moſt of it "comports with his <hi>ſcheme</hi>" but very indifferently, and muſt well nigh "prove faral to his deſign."</p>
               <p>BUT if this will not help his own cauſe, he thinks it will overthrow ours. For he ſays,—"if we find that the words of the commiſſion that their miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters received from our biſhops, are not expreſſive of ſuch power, viz. (of ordination and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:) We muſt conclude they did not receive ſuch authority as is pretended."
<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 34.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. If there is but one miniſterial commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as has been proved, then all who are lawfully ordained, are veſted with this commiſſion, and all the powers it contains, of which ordination is one,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031609_0057_0FED5B246F02DDC8"/>let the intention of the ordainers be what they will. The biſhops, who ordained our firſt miniſters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, I hope, to make them lawful miniſters of Chriſt, and inveſt them with his commiſſion; and moreover, uſed words ſufficiently expreſſive of ſuch intention. If they did not do this in our caſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they, I preſume, in that of Mr. L. and his brethen: They are therefore not lawful miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Chriſt, not being veſted with his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But if this was done in the caſe of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was equally ſo in that of the former; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they were veſted with Chriſt's general commiſſion and with all the powers of it, and thoſe of ordination and government among the reſt.</p>
               <p>As a proof of but one order in the miniſtry, I mentioned, in my ſermon, the elders of the church of Epheſus, Acts xx. and ſaid, "the intire gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and government of the church was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to theſe elders, without any mention of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. I find it in the words directed to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by the apoſtle, v. 28. He there charges them in theſe words.
<q>Take heed therefore to yourſelves and to all the flock over the which the Holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ghoſt hath made you <hi>overſeers;</hi> to <hi>feed</hi> the church of God.</q> But he tells me
<q>they are here expreſſly ſaid to be made overſeers, not to <hi>govern,</hi> but to <hi>feed</hi> the flock; and he is really <hi>amazed</hi> I ſhould aſſert, that the intire guidance and government of the church is committed to them, for he can ſee nothing of it there.</q> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the following obſervations may help him <hi>to ſee</hi> it.</p>
               <p>IN the firſt place,—I find this power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contained in the <hi>name,</hi> by which theſe elders are there called. The apoſtle expreſſly calls them
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031609_0057_0FED5B246F02DDC8"/>
                  <hi>ourſelves.</hi> He tells them they were made, EPISCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POUS, biſhops, over this church, and that by the Holy Ghoſt. This name includes in it the power of rule or guidance. It is rendered, by the beſt lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cographers, by <hi>epicopus,</hi> biſhop, <hi>inſpector,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector, <hi>praeſes,</hi> a preſident or chief ruler. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it is the very name that epiſcopalians have appropriated to the higheſt order of their clergy, the biſhops; and that as peculiarly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the power of government or chief rule.— If therefore their biſhops, as ſuch, are veſted with the power of government, theſe elders are alſo; for they are expreſſly called <hi>biſhops;</hi> and were made ſuch even by the Holy Ghoſt. Doubtleſs the Holy Ghoſt, in making them biſhops, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them the whole power of biſhops, and this of government among the reſt. Mr. L. allows, thoſe who are made biſhops, by other biſhops in their church, or even by the grand <hi>pontiff</hi> at Rome, to be inveſted with the power of governing the church. But to theſe biſhops at Epheſus, who were made ſuch by the Holy Ghoſt; he will not allow any ſuch power. How partial is this, to ſay no more? This power of government therefore is included in the very <hi>name</hi> by which theſe elders are called.</p>
               <p>AGAIN. It is included, and that expreſſly, in the charges the apoſtle gives them. The words are, "to <hi>feed</hi> the flock of God, POIMAINEIN.
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Paſco, <hi>rego,</hi> curo, doceo. Schrevel. Lex. in verb.</note>— The word in the original, ſignifies to <hi>rule</hi> or feed, as a ſhepherd does his flock, and ſo includes in it all acts of <hi>paſtoral</hi> government and care. It is derived from POIMEEN, a ſhepherd, whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, not only to feed, but to <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> his flock. Which title our Lord applies to himſelf, as peculiarly expreſſive of his character, as the "chief ſhepherd and biſhop of ſouls," and of all that power and authority he exerciſes in that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John x. 2.</note> Accordingly he uſes the ſame word as his apoſtle does here, in his charge to Peter an apoſtle, and that as expreſſive of the whole care he was to take of Chriſt's flock, both in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and inſtruction.<note n="†" place="bottom">John xxi. 16.</note> Peter uſes the ſame word, in his charge to the elders or biſhops of the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to whom he directs his epiſtle.<note n="§" place="bottom">1 Pet. v. 2.</note> That theſe were the proper biſhops or rulers of theſe churches, is plain from the apoſtles charging them to "take the over-ſight of them." EPISCOPOUNTES. To act the biſhop among them; as alſo from his caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them againſt "<hi>lording</hi> it over God's heritage," i. e. uſing this power of government tyranically. But to put the matter beyond all diſpute; we find the word ſundry times uſed in the New-Teſtament, where it can't poſſibly admit of any other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation but to <hi>rule,</hi> and therefore is ſo rendered by our tranſlators. Thus when Chriſt is ſpoken of under the expreſs character of a <hi>governor:</hi> He is ſaid, as ſuch, (POIMANEI) "to <hi>rule</hi> God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Iſrael."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. ii. 6.</note> Again.

And yet becauſe our tranſlators uſe the word <hi>feed</hi> in this place, Mr. L. confidently aſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> "that the direction given to them, was only to

And he "is really <hi>amazed,</hi> he ſays, that I ſhould aſſert the contrary, when the place referred to ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly ſays, that the Holy Ghoſt made them overſeers, not to <hi>govern,</hi> but to <hi>feed</hi> the church of God."<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 34, 35.</note>. What the poor gentleman's <hi>amazement</hi> aroſe from, whether from the overbearing luſtre of the evidence he oppoſed, or from what other cauſe; ſure I am, he has groſſly perverted the meaning of this text, by ſo confidently aſſerting, that <hi>nothing concerning the government</hi> of the church, is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; when that is the very thing the apoſtle gives them in charge; and that by a word as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of it, as perhaps, any in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I hope he did not do this, with a diſhoneſt deſign, to impoſe upon his unlearned readers. I will not therefore tell him as he <hi>politely</hi> does me, "that he himſelf knew the contrary to be true." This, however I will tell him, that if he did not, he was utterly unqualified for the controverſy he has undertaken, and therefore ought to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined it.</p>
               <p>HAVING thus made good the aſſertion in my ſermon, "that the government of the church was veſted in theſe elders, the argument deduced from it in ſupport of preſbyterian ordination ſtill ſtands good. The inference Mr. L. draws from what he calls "this claim of mine, as to the effect which he ſuppoſes it will have, upon the minds of my hearers, gives me not the leaſt uneaſineſs. The communicants of our church, which he is pleaſed
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:031609_0059_0FED5B2620BFD9A0"/>to call the <hi>meeting</hi> of Stanford, by twenty years experience, well know my principles and practice, as to church government. Every one who reads my ſermon will readily ſee what I meant by ſaying "the intire guidance and government of the church, was committed to the elders." That is, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of the church, but in contradiſtinction to any other pretended ſuperior officer. That they were the only perſons who, <hi>as officers,</hi> had any thing to do in governing the church. This I expreſſed by ſaying, "the Holy Ghoſt had made, <hi>not Timothy,</hi> but <hi>theſe elders,</hi> the ſole biſhops of the church." Whereas, when I am profeſſedly ſpeaking of the powers committed to miniſters, by Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; I expreſs it in theſe words,—"To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the word and ſacraments, to <hi>preſide</hi> in the government of the church, and to ordain others."<note n="†" place="bottom">Preſ. ord. def. page 19.</note> This, I think a ſufficient anſwer to all his quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as to the "powers I claim," in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church. His remarks upon it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the foundation he acted upon, and his end in view; appear as weak, as they are ill natured.</p>
               <p>THUS have I very particularly conſidered, all Mr. L's remarks upon my ſermon, and, as I think, abundantly refuted, all his objections againſt my arguments from the one commiſſion. Having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, that as there is but one commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion given by Chriſt to his miniſters, there can be but one order only, virtuated and impowered by it; conſequently that all who are authorized by this commiſſion, to any part of the miniſterial office, muſt be veſted with all the powers the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion contains; therefore with that of ordination, which is one of theſe powers. And as this is the only argument Mr. L. has pretended to attack, all the others in my ſermon, muſt be preſumed to ſtand good.</p>

               <p>THE whole of what our author calls "his direct proof of epiſcopacy," turns upon "the directions given by the apoſtle to Timothy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with his charge to the elders of Epheſus." "There are ſome things, ſays he, given in charge to theſe elders, in common with Timothy: Such as,—to take heed to themſelves and to their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine," &amp;c. "But beſides theſe, he tells us, there are ſeveral particulars, of great importance, that Paul gave in charge to Timothy, which he did not ſo much as mention to all theſe elders."<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 39.</note>— Particularly.—He informs him as to the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of preſbyterians and deacons.—Orders him to charge ſome that they teach no other doctrine. Charges him to lay hands ſuddenly on no man.— Directs him how to receive an accuſation againſt an elder.—Orders him to rebuke them that ſin, before all.—And finally charges him to keep this commandment unrebukable, till the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. "Theſe things, he ſays, Paul gave in charge to Timothy, but did not ſo much as mention them to the elders of Epheſus." Hence he infers, "that Timothy was ſuperior in office to theſe elders, and charged with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of them, and of the church at Epheſus."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 43, 44.</note>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:031609_0060_0FED5B105B70F6A0"/>He then concludes, "that Timothy had the ſame authority that their biſhops claim, and the elders the ſame power only that the preſbyters, in their church, exerciſe," conſequently, "that epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy is of <hi>divine right,</hi> and the whole diſpute is at an end."<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 44.</note> This is the true ſtate of his argument preſented in its full force. It turns wholly upon this.—"Timothy had <hi>more, and more important</hi> charges given him than theſe elders, therefore he was ſuperior to them in office, veſted with epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal authority over them.—In anſwer to which I obſerve,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT if his arguments proves Timothy ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to theſe elders; it equally proves Peter ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the reſt of the apoſtles, and ſo eſtabliſhes the ſupremacy of the Pope above all other biſhops, according to the doctrine of the church of Rome.</p>
               <p>IT is evident from the whole hiſtory of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that Peter is, in various reſpects, diſtinguiſhed from the other apoſtles. Whenever their catalogue is given, he is placed the firſt.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Matt. x. 2.</note> Are any ſelect number choſen, upon any ſpecial occaſion, Peter is always one.

And I will give unto <hi>thee,</hi> the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>thou</hi> ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever <hi>thou</hi> ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven."<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xvi. 18, 19.</note> In the ſame manner, after his reſurrection, he addreſſes Peter only, though the other apoſtles were preſent, with this <hi>important charge,</hi>—"feed my ſheep,—feed my lambs."<note n="‖" place="bottom">John xxi. 15, 16, 17.</note> Here now are not only a number of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances mentioned, which ſeem to give Peter a precedency to the reſt of the apoſtles; but ſundry <hi>important charges</hi> given to him which are not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, though they were preſent at the ſame time. And what is remarkable, theſe are the very arguments uſed by the church of Rome, to eſtabliſh the Pope's ſupremacy, as Peter's ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and give him a ſuperiority to all other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in the chriſtian church. If therefore they are ſufficient to prove Timothy's ſuperiority to the elders of Epheſus, they are equally ſo to prove that of Peter to the other apoſtles, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to eſtabliſh the ſupremacy of the Pope over all other miniſters. As the argument is the ſame, it is certainly as concluſive, in the mouth of an Italian Roman-catholic, for the Pope's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, as in that of an Engliſh prelatiſt for the biſhop's ſupremacy. And indeed it is worthy of note, that there is no one argument uſed, by the latter, for the <hi>divine right</hi> of epiſcopacy againſt preſbyterians; but what has been uſed with equal force, and equal ſucceſs, by the former for the <hi>divine right</hi> of the <hi>papacy,</hi> againſt proteſtants.—If
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:031609_0061_0FED5B5519170CC8"/>then our author inſiſts upon this argument, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive in his caſe, he muſt own it to be equally ſo, in that of the Pope, and, to be conſiſtent with himſelf, muſt turn Roman-catholic: Or if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it in one caſe, he muſt give it up in the other, and own there is no force in it when brought to eſtabliſh dioceſan epiſcopacy.—Moreover,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this argument proves Timothy's ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority to the elders of Epheſus, it will equally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and upon the ſame principles, that he was ſuperior to many others alſo, whom yet Mr. L. himſelf allows to be biſhops in his ſenſe of the word. He has told us that Barnabas was an apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or biſhop;<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 22.</note> that Epaphroditus was the biſhop of Philippi, and James of the church at Jeruſalem.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 20.</note> But no where will he find thoſe particular direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given to them, as are here given to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Where does he find Barnabas the apoſtle, James the biſhop of Jeruſalem, or Epaphroditus of Philippi receiving thoſe <hi>more, and more import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant charges,</hi> which, as he pretends, diſtinguiſh and prove the epiſcopal character of Timothy biſhop of Epheſus?—In this reſpect even the Epheſian elders, to whom yet our author will not allow the epiſcopal authority, have evidently the advantage. Fort hey, he allows, received charges and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the apoſtle, though not ſo <hi>many</hi> and <hi>important</hi> as Timothy did. But theſe, whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he owns were proper biſhops, received no ſuch charges. Either therefore he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the epiſcopal character of James, Epaph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roditus, &amp;c. and give up his argument for epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy thence ariſing; or elſe he muſt allow theſe elders of Epheſus to the biſhops, and ſo give up his preſent argument; or finally, which will amount to the ſame, muſt ſuppoſe Timothy to be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to both, and, by divine right, an arch-biſhop, a prince, apoſtle or Pope. Nay further, as there
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031609_0061_0FED5B5519170CC8"/>are no ſuch particular directions and <hi>important</hi> charges, in ſcripture, given, even to the twelve apoſtles themſelves, as are here given to Timothy, it muſt follow, from this argument, that Timothy was ſuperior even to them. And that although he received his directions and charges from the apoſtle Paul, he was nevertheleſs Paul's ſuperior: For we no where find ſuch particular directions and <hi>important</hi> charges given even to him, as are here given to Timothy. Thus this argument for Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>othy's ſuperior power and character, while it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives the Epheſian biſhops of paſtoral authority, at the ſame time cuts off all others mentioned in ſcripture, even the apoſtles not excepted, from any claim to the powers of ordination and government.</p>
               <p>THERE is no way, I conceive, to get clear of this difficulty, upon his ſcheme, but only by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that though the apoſtles had not theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular directions given them that Timothy had, yet all the powers that belong to the paſtoral or epiſcopal function are included in their general commiſſion given them by Chriſt, and this is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to conſtitute them proper biſhops. It is granted they were. But then the ſame muſt be granted in the caſe of theſe elders, to whom he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nies this power, and then his whole argument is defeated. They alſo were veſted with the powers included in the miniſterial commiſſion given by Chriſt, and beſides, had a particular charge given by the apoſtle, which, as I ſhall ſhew anon, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſed theſe powers. Either therefore this argument intirely cuts off the apoſtles, and all others mentioned in the goſpel, from any claim to the powers of ordination and government, and leaves. Timothy the only apoſtle or biſhop; or elſe, if the others are allowed to be veſted with theſe powers, in virtue of the general miniſterial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions the ſame muſt be granted to theſe elders
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:031609_0062_0FED5B56CB20A9D0"/>alſo, and ſo his argument to prove dioceſan epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, from this inſtance, looſes all its force.— But,—</p>
               <p n="3">3. IT is not true, in fact, that Paul gave more <hi>important charges</hi> to Timothy, than what he gave to theſe elders, and therefore, Mr. L's argument, founded upon the ſuppoſition that he did, is not concluſive. His charge to theſe elders, very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly conſiders them as biſhops of the church of Epheſus; yea as appointed and fixed in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral or epiſcopal office over that church, even by the Holy Ghoſt. "Take heed therefore to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath <hi>fixed or eſtabliſhed you biſhops.</hi>"<note n="†" place="bottom">ATHETO EPISCOPOUS gr. Acts xx. 28.</note> When therefore the apoſtle here charges them to "take heed to the flock over which they were conſtituted biſhops;" it is a direct charge, to do all the work to diſcharge all the duties, and execute all the powers of the epiſcopal office, conſequently tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of ordination and government which are part of thoſe powers. When the ſame apoſtle directs Timothy "to do the work of an evangeliſt," all will allow it a command to diſcharge all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that office. And when our Lord, in his general commiſſion to his apoſtles, bids them "go teach all nations," &amp;c. it is granted on all hands, to be a command, authorizing and requiring them to exerciſe all the offices and powers of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. So when the apoſtle here commands theſe elders to "take heed to the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt had made them biſhops; it equally, comprizes in them a charge to the exerciſe of the whole power and duty of a biſhop, as though they had been all particularly enumerated, as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they were in the directions to Timothy.— Is Timothy, for inſtance, "charged to ſee to the qualifications of ſuch who were to be ordained preſbyters and deacons?" The ſame is given in
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031609_0062_0FED5B56CB20A9D0"/>charge to theſe elders, when they are commanded to "take heed to this whole flock as its proper biſhops or paſtors," to which office this work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. Is Timothy ordered to charge the elders that they teach no other than goſpel doctrines? The ſame is included in the charge given to theſe elders. They are expreſſly commanded to "take heed to the whole flock," &amp;c. to <hi>feed,</hi> i. e. not only to reach, but, as I have largely proved above, to <hi>rule</hi> and govern this church of Epheſus. Paul had particularly reminded them, "how that he had kept back nothing that was profitable to them, but had taught them publicly, and from houſe to houſe;" that the doctrine he had preached, was repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;" "and that he had not ſhunned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And that they ſhould take care, <hi>that as other doctrine</hi> ſhould be taught by others, is very particularly contained in his exhortation to them. For after he had given them the above charge, as a reaſon of it he immediately ſubjoins "for I know this, "that after my departure, ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock; alſo of your ownſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them. Therefore watch," &amp;c.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Verſe 29, 30, 31.</note> But to what purpoſe was it for him to forewarn them of theſe "grievous wolves, theſe falſe teachers," "and men ſpeaking perverſe things," when, if Mr. L's principles be true, they had no power to prevent them? And how weak, and even impertinent, will the apoſtles
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:031609_0063_0FED5B3BC8357C78"/>diſcourſe appear, to aſſign <hi>that,</hi> in particular, as a reaſon, why they ſhould take heed and watch over this church, as its proper biſhops or paſtors, when at the ſame time the apoſtle knew, if Mr. L's doctrine be true, that they had no power, no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as rulers of the church, to call theſe falſe teachers to account, againſt whom he had warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them? Would it not appear extremely imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, not to ſay ridiculous, for the biſhop of London, Mr. L's dioceſan, to give him a ſolemn charge, to "take heed to the church at Norwalk, to watch over it, to feed and govern it as a proper biſhop or paſtor," and that with a ſpecial view to prevent "falſe teachers from thruſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in, and drawing away diſciples after them;" when at the ſame time, his Lordſhip well knew, that he was ſo far from having any power to <hi>rebuke an</hi> elder, to <hi>receive an accuſation</hi> againſt theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>THIS power therefore moſt certainly they had. A power of "receiving an accuſation againſt as elder," againſt any of their own number, "any that ſhould ariſe from among themſelves;" and if found guilty, "of rebuking them openly before all, that others might fear;" a power, in ſhort, of putting to ſilence falſe or ſcandalous miniſters, and of laying on hands upon others and ordaining them in their ſtead.—This power they had equally with Timothy, which though not ſo particularly expreſſed, is yet as neceſſarily included in the charge
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:031609_0063_0FED5B3BC8357C78"/>given to them, as in that given to him. Beſides, Timothy himſelf was certainly ordained by ſuch elders, as has been already proved, and therefore theſe elders had the ſame power to ordain.</p>
               <p>AND as to "the one ſolemn charge more" ſo very remarkable, mentioned by our author as given to Timothy, viz. "of keeping the commandment till the coming of Chriſt," ſince he himſelf tells us "that this is of like nature with the promiſe to the apoſtles, <hi>that Chriſt would be with them to the end of the world;</hi>" it is evident from what he expreſſly allows elſewhere, that this muſt belong to theſe preſbyters, equally with Timothy, even upon ſuppoſition Timothy was their ſuperior.— For, ſpeaking of this promiſe, he ſays; "though it might with more propriety be confined to the apoſtolic office, than to the other, i. e. that of preſbyters; yet we allow that it extends to <hi>both,</hi> as <hi>both</hi> are to continue to the end of time." As this charge therefore is what he calls, when applied to Timothy, "a charge, not merely perſonal, but ſuch as had relation to the office he ſuſtained;" and as this, according to him, "is <hi>peculiar</hi> to thoſe officers of Chriſt, who have power to conſtitute other officers in the church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>" it undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from his own conceſſion, that theſe elders, even though inferior to Timothy, had power to conſtitute or ordain other officers in their church; "for to <hi>their</hi> office, he tells us, was the promiſe and charge given, as well as to that of the apoſtles, ſince both are to continue to the end of time;" conſequently theſe elders, having his <hi>own</hi> charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of thoſe who had power to conſtitute others, muſt be inveſted with the power of ordaining by his own conceſſion: And ſo upon his own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, preſbyterian ordination is ſcriptural, "and, to uſe his own words, the diſpute is at an end."</p>
               <p n="4">4. THAT Timothy could not be the biſhop of Epheſus, left there with ordaining power, &amp;c. is
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:031609_0064_0FED5B5C5ACBCD60"/>evident from Mr. L's own definition of an officer veſted with that power. For he tells us "that at the time in which the ſcriptures were wrote, none had power to ordain miniſters in Chriſt's kingdom, but thoſe only who are in <hi>ſcripture</hi> called <hi>apoſtles.</hi>" Again:—"Let it be carefully remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thoſe who were commiſſioned to ſend others, were called <hi>apoſtles</hi> in the time when the New-Teſtament was penned."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 10.</note> This then, with him, is abſolutely <hi>eſſential</hi> to the character of thoſe who had power to ordain at that time, viz. that they are in <hi>ſcripture</hi> called apoſtles. But now Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy is no where in ſcripture called an apoſtle, and therefore, according to his own definition, could not be left at Epheſus with power to ordain. Pity it is he had not thought of this. It would have ſaved him all the learned labour of his "direct proof of epiſcopacy." And though it would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of the pleaſure of thoſe confident tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, with which the concluſion of it is orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and robbed him of the applauſe which his zealous admirers laviſh upon this part of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance more eſpecially; yet, in the judgment of the impartial, "his book would have been as good as it is now, though not quite ſo long."</p>
               <p>BUT perhaps he will endeavour to prove, for he told us he deſigned it, though it ſhould ſeem, he afterwards forgot his promiſe, "that Timothy was admitted to the apoſtolic office." But if he was, why is he never called an apoſtle? Paul fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently joins him with himſelf, in the inſcription of his epiſtles. And though he takes to himſelf the name of apoſtle, yet, 'tis remarkable, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once gives it to Timothy.

But that he was not, is plain from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Paul exerciſes over him. He every where treats him, not as an equal, but an inferior. He writes epiſtles to him, in which he warns, directs, charges, commands him, in the moſt authoritative manner.

                  </gap>us. This would incline one to think, Timothy was ſuperior to theſe elders in no reſpects.—But if he was, yet,—</p>
               <p n="5">5. HE was an evangeliſt, and therefore could not be, as Mr. L. ſuppoſes, a reſident governor or fixed biſhop in Epheſus, or any other place. That he was an evangeliſt, we learn from 2 Tim. iv. 6. Now the work and buſineſs of an evangeliſt was utterly inconſiſtent with a fixed relation to any church, as its ſtated paſtor or biſhop. He was a kind of ſubordinate apoſtle, an extraordinary and temporary officer, whoſe buſineſs was to travel from place to place and water the churches which the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles had planted.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. iii. 6.</note> Or, as Euſebius expreſſes it,— "To lay the foundation of faith in ſtrange nations,

               </p>
               <p>THIS argument of Mr. L's for epiſcopacy, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depends upon the ſuppoſition of Timothy's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixed at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> over the elders of that church, as their proper biſhop, with ordaining and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning powers. He every where ſuppoſes him to be ſuch a fixed officer in that church.

If he can't prove this, all his argument in favour of epiſcopacy, from the more particular directions given to Timothy, than to theſe Epheſian elders, comes to nothing. —This Mr. L. indeed does not once attempt to prove. He ſeems rather to take it for granted: And ſo having begged the main queſtion in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, proceeds to argue from it in ſupport of his ſcheme. And all the evidence that epiſcopalians ever bring, in proof of this main fact, is "Paul's beſeeching of him to abide ſtill in Epheſus, while he went into Macedonia."<note n="§" place="bottom">1 Tim. i. 3.</note> But does this ſound like the language of an apoſtle to a fixed paſtor of a church? If Epheſus was his ſtated charge, why is he <hi>beſought</hi> to abide there, when he could do no otherwiſe, without neglecting his duty and ſinning againſt God? And why is he <hi>intreated</hi> to abide there, only while Paul went into Macedonia? If he was biſhop of that church, a ſtated reſidence there was his indiſputable duty, not only for that ſhort

Accordingly, as he is here deſired, by the apoſtle, to ſtay, for a ſeaſon at Epheſus; ſo we find him upon another occaſion ſent to Corinth. 1 Cor. xvi. 10. He is with Paul again, when he wrote his ſecond epiſtle to that church. 2 Cor. i. 1. As alſo when he wrote his epiſtle to the Coloſſians. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter i. verſe 1.

The word is the ſame, as is uſed for his continuing at Epheſus.<note n="‖" place="bottom">UPEMENON, PROSMEINAI.</note> If therefore, in the one inſtance, his ſo abiding makes him biſhop of Epheſus; it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes him biſhop of Baerea in the other. 'Tis true he ſoon left Baerea, and followed Paul to Athens. Acts xvii. 15. But 'tis equally true that he was to ſtay at Epheſus, only till Paul finiſhed his journey to Macedonia, and returned to him again. 1 Tim. iii. 14, chap. iv. 13. And in the ſecond epiſtle, which was written not long after the firſt, it is moſt probable, from chap. iv. verſe 12, that he had left Epheſus already: But if he had not, 'tis certain he then left it; for the apoſtle there calls him away to Rome, and ſends Tychicus, another evangeliſt to Epheſus. 2 Tim. iv. 9, 12; 21. Eph. vi. 21, 22. In 1 Theſ. i. 1. we find him in Athens; whence he was ſent to Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, and from thence returned back to Athens. 1 Theſ. iii. 1, 2, 6. After this he removed with Paul to Corinth, Acts xviii. 5. From thence he accompanied him to Aſia and Epheſus. Acts xix. 1. And thence he was ſent into Macedonia. Verſe 21, 22. But it would be tedious to follow him, in all
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031609_0066_0FED5B120BB49CD0"/>his travels to ſo many different places. Enough has been mentioned of his unfixed, itinerant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, to ſhew he was an evangeliſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be a fixed reſident officer in any church. The ſame might be ſhewn as to Titus, whom epiſcopalians make to be biſhop of Crete, barely becauſe the apoſtle, for ſome ſhort time, left him there for certain purpoſes. There is the cleareſt evidence from ſcripture, that they were both of them impowered in the work of the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts. And as this was utterly inconſiſtent with their ſuſtaining a relation to any particular church, as their fixed paſtors or biſhops, 'tis a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they did not ſuſtain ſuch relation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all our author has argued in ſupport of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, from theſe directions given to Timothy, is nothing to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As the ſcripture is wholly ſilent as to this notion of Timothy's epiſcopal care of Epheſus; ſo there is nothing in any of the ancient fathers to ſupport this opinion, but much to the contrary.—Dr. Whitby, who was well read in the fathers, confeſſes, as I ſhewed in my ſermon, "that as to the great controverſy, whether Timothy and Titus were indeed biſhops, the one of Epheſus, the other of Crete, he could find nothing of this matter in any writer of the firſt centuries, nor any intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they bore that name." He adds indeed, "that this defect is abundantly ſupplied by the concurrent ſuffrage of the fourth and fifth." "But theſe, as Dr. Chauncy juſtly obſerves, were times too far diſtant from Timothy and Titus, to be relied on for the truth of this fact; eſpecially, as in theſe times they had greatly departed from the ſimplicity of the goſpel."<note n="*" place="bottom">Dud. Lec. page 51.</note> And if Mr. L's quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from Iraeneus be true, this ſilence of the fathers for 300 years, cóncerning the fact in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a certain evidence it never did exiſt. Irae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus's
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031609_0066_0FED5B120BB49CD0"/>words, as quoted by our author, are,—"We can reckon thoſe biſhops who have been conſtituted by the apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, all the way to our time. We have the ſucceſſion of the biſhops, to whom the apoſtolic church was committed in every place."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 51.</note> Now ſince, Iraeneus lived in the ſecond century; if they had in his time, as he declares, "the true ſucceſſion of biſhops in <hi>every</hi> church, and yet in there is nothing to be found of Timothy and Titus the ſucceſſion for Epheſus and Crete, as Dr. Whitby aſſerts; 'tis an undeniable conſequence that they never were biſhops of theſe churches, let the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in following ages ſay what they will to the contrary.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, it is evident from eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, that the apoſtle John was at Epheſus, and <hi>reſided</hi> there for a conſiderable time after Paul's departure thence, and after the writing the firſt epiſtle to Timothy, on which his pretended epiſcopacy over that church is founded. Euſebius, upon the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of Iraeneus and Clemens Alexandrinus, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, "that he returned to Epheſus, after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from baniſhment, and lived there, and among the Aſian churches, until Trajan's reign."<note n="†" place="bottom">Euſeb. Hiſ. cul. Lib. 3, 17, Iraen. adv. Haer. III. 3.</note> Now if the apoſtle John reſided at Epheſus, and ruled that church by his apoſtolic power, certainly Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy was not, could not be the ſupreme biſhop of Epheſus. Conſequently all attempts to prove epiſcopacy from this argument are to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. AND laſtly, we need not recur to eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hiſtory for proof of this point. The ſacred ſcriptures abundantly prove, that not Timothy, but the elders of Epheſus, were the true and only <hi>biſhops</hi> of this church. This is evident from the account given of them in Acts xx. 17, 36. Before this. Paul had been ſucceſsfully labouring for near three years in and about Epheſus. Great numbers
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031609_0067_0FED5B2EAC3B45D0"/>had been converted to the faith. A flouriſhing church gathered, and elders ordained. And now that the apoſtle was about to leave them, never to ſee them more; as one deeply concerned for them, ſince he could not viſit the church in perſon, he ſends for the elders of it, preaches his farewell ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them, and gives him his laſt directions and charge, in a moſt ſolemn and moving addreſs.—In all which there is not one word mentioned, or the leaſt hint given, of ſetting a <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon over them as their biſhop. So far from this, the whole government of the church is expreſſly committed to <hi>them</hi> and them only, in a ſtate of equality. And what is remarkable, though Timothy was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly now preſent, not a ſingle word is ſaid of his relation to this church. No directions are given to <hi>him</hi> as the governor of it, nor the leaſt hint mentioned to theſe elders, to conſider and obey him as their ſuperior: But <hi>they,</hi> the elders, are the only perſons mentioned as the appointed offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in it. They are expreſſly called its <hi>biſhops;</hi> yea are declared to be appointed ſuch by the Holy Ghoſt. The care and guidance of the church, in all things, is committed to them, and they are, in the moſt ſolemn manner, charged to ſeed, teach, <hi>rule and govern</hi> it, as its only proper paſtors or biſhops. And what puts the matter beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, they are commanded to do this with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs view to prevent the future diſorders which the apoſtle foreſaw, were about to ariſe in this church, by "grievous wolves, men ſpeaking perverſe things," "thruſting themſelves in," "to draw away diſciples after them." This is the expreſs reaſon aſſigned for giving this charge. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, they are commanded to <hi>watch,</hi> to <hi>rule</hi> and govern the flock committed to their care, and exerciſe that authority, which, as its proper paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or biſhops, they are veſted with, in warning their people againſt thoſe grievous wolves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:031609_0067_0FED5B2EAC3B45D0"/>theſe gainſayers, or by exerciſing their paſtoral authority, in way of diſcipline; to put to ſilence theſe corrupt teachers. But now how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent will all this appear, if they were not the paſtors, but only the ſubject preſbyters of this church, as our author affirms? What propriety, in giving them, and them only, this ſolemn charge, when they had no power, no authority to comply with the moſt eſſential branches of it? How ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, to direct them in the government and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of this church, both as to private members and corrupt teachers, when they could exerciſe no authority over either, and at the ſame time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to omit Timothy, to whom, and only whom, upon the epiſcopalian ſcheme, the whole of this buſineſs belonged? The ſuppoſition is ridiculous. It deſtroys the whole force of the apoſtle's reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and renders his diſcourſe quite impertinent.</p>
               <p>THE apoſtle, no doubt, had a tender concern for the future welfare and good government of this church. He had long preſided over it in perſon. He was now taking his final leave of its officers, never to ſee them more.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 25.</note> The elders underſtood him in this ſenſe. They took leave of him, as their apoſtolic father, in a manner moſt tender and affecting, with many tears. "Sorrowing moſt of all for the words which he ſpake, that they ſhould ſee his face no more."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ver. 38.</note> This then was the proper time, to provide for the future gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this church and its officers; to provide a <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon to ſucceed him in the government of it, had this been the ſcripture model, as our opponents pretend. Had this been the goſpel plan, certainly Paul would not have concealed it from theſe elders, eſpecially at ſuch a time as this. He called them to record, "that he was pure from the blood of all men," "that he had kept back nothing that was profitable for them, nor ſhunned
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031609_0068_0FED5B07044EC880"/>to declare unto them, the whole counſel of God."<note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 20, 26, 27.</note> And then immediately adds, "that the Holy Ghoſt had made them the <hi>fixed</hi> overſeers, <hi>biſhops</hi> or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this church," without ſo much as hinting that any one was to preſide over them. Had <hi>epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> "been profitable to them," the apoſtle muſt have known it. Had it been any part of the "counſel of God," he muſt have told them ſo; for he "kept back nothing of that." Now was the proper time to have done it when he was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them his laſt, his parting directions. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, nor now, does he mention a word of any ſuch thing. On the contrary, he expreſſly commits to theſe preſbyters, in a ſtate of parity, the whole government of this church, which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews, that dioceſan epiſcopacy was no part of "the counſel of God," and therefore not of divine inſtitution.</p>
               <p>IN this view of the caſe, the <hi>directions</hi> given to Timothy, while at Epheſus, (if indeed he was there when he received them) will nothing weaken the force of this concluſion: And yet on them, the whole ſtrength of Mr. L's argument depends.—For, granting he was there, when he received theſe epiſtles; yet all ſkillful chronologiſts agree, they were wrote, long before the convention of Paul, and the elders at Miletus; and moſt probably, before the church of Epheſus was ſettled according to goſpel order, with preſbyters appointed in it. If this was the caſe, the <hi>directions</hi> muſt be ſent to Timothy, for there was no other officer to whom they could be ſent. His ſtay, however, at Epheſus, was but ſhort at the longeſt. He was ſoon called away by the apoſtle, and there is no account that he ever returned. If he did, it could not be as their biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op; for this office was conferred upon the elders, by the expreſs direction of the Holy Ghoſt. Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this office, the apoſtle found them, when
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:031609_0068_0FED5B07044EC880"/>they met him at Miletus; and in full poſſeſſion of it, he left them, when he took his final leave of them, never to ſee them more. Judge then, who is to be credited in this caſe; our author, who ſays theſe elders were only ſimple preſbyters, without any paſtoral authority in this church; or the apoſtle, who expreſſly charges them, to exerciſe ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the government of it!—Mr. L. who confidently aſſerts, that Timothy was their only biſhop, to whom they and the church of Epheſus were ſubjected, as their ſingle paſtor or overſeer; or St. Paul, who aſſures us, that theſe were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Holy Ghoſt, in parity, the <hi>overſeers</hi> or <hi>biſhops</hi> of this whole flock!—"Look into the ſcriptures. Judge for yourſelves. If what I have advanced, is not fact, it may be eaſily expoſed. If it is an undeniable truth, it is a truth of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, if religion be ſo."</p>
               <p>I AM now prepared for a few remarks upon ſome ſelect paſſages in this part of Mr. L's defence, which will conclude this ſection.</p>
               <p>HE enquires,—"If the elders of Epheſus had power to ordain and govern, what need of <hi>ſending</hi> Timothy there?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 43.</note> 
                  <hi>leaving</hi> him there, he ſhould have ſaid.—I anſwer,—</p>
               <p>IT does not appear from ſcripture, that this church had any ſettled paſtors at this time. But if it had, they needed the divine directions concerning ordination and government, contained in theſe epiſtles to Timothy, as much as we do at this day. And who more proper to receive, and put them in execution, than an evangeliſt, an extraordinary officer, and a faithful companion of Paul? But till he can prove that Timothy was leſt there, as a reſident paſtor over that church, as fully as I have, that the elders were, this will be no ſervice to his cauſe. Barely his being <hi>ſent to</hi> Epheſus, will not prove this. If ſo, Tychicus alſo was their
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031609_0069_0FED5B3D776BA328"/>biſhop, for he was ſent there as well as Timothy. And upon the ſame principle, Timothy muſt have been biſhop alſo of Corinth, Theſſalonica, Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, &amp;c. for to all theſe was he ſent as well as to Epheſus. This would be to make him a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſt</hi> as well as a <hi>non-reſident,</hi> and exhibit a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat idea of modern epiſcopacy.—Again,—</p>
               <p>HE demands a proof from facts recorded in ſcripture, "that <hi>mere</hi> preſbyters, in virtue of their office as ſuch, did ordain officers in the church of Chriſt."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 46, 47.</note>—Anſwer.</p>
               <p>IF by <hi>mere</hi> preſbyters, he means, ſuch as thoſe in his church, profeſſedly ſubjecting themſelves to biſhops, and diſclaiming all paſtoral authority in ordination and government; none will pretend to prove from ſcripture that ſuch ever did ordain.—And good reaſon for it. The ſcripture knows of no ſuch order. But if he means ſcripture-preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſuch as thoſe at Epheſus; preſbyter-biſhops, ſuch as Timothy and Titus were directed to ordain; I have already proved, ſuch preſbyters did in fact ordain, and that by virtue of their office. Of this ſort were thoſe, who ordained Paul, Barnabas and Timothy, as I have already proved, <hi>by expreſs facts recorded in ſcripture.</hi> And what is more:—The ſcriptures plainly ſhew, that none but ſuch ought to ordain; they being the only miniſters, author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized by Chriſt's general commiſſion, and veſted with all the powers it contains.</p>
               <p>WHAT he quotes from Mr. Beach, reſpecting our firſt miniſters, who were ordained by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh biſhops, is no valid objection againſt this, even allowing that there was no expreſſed inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either in the ordainers, or ordained, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the power of ordination. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Chriſt, not the intention of the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is what conveys the power in ordination, as I ſhewed in my ſermon. I now add:—Theſe firſt
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031609_0069_0FED5B3D776BA328"/>miniſters of New-England were ordained, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, in the ſame manner as Mr. L. and his brethren were. Either therefore he is no miniſter of Chriſt, not being veſted with his commiſſion in ordination: Or if the words uſed in his ordination, were ſufficiently expreſſive of ſuch inveſtiture, in his caſe; they were equally ſo in that of our miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; conſequently, they were cloathed with all the powers the commiſſion contains, of which that of ordination is confeſſedly one.</p>
               <p>As to the other part of this objection, the oath of canonical obedience; though it is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, that this, as he affirms, includes in it "a ſolemn promiſe never to ordain others;" yet allowing it did, ſuch promiſe, being evidently ſinful, can't be binding upon conſcience, but is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> null and void. A number of the Jews bound themſelves by ſolemn oath, "not to eat or drink till they had killed Paul."<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xxiii. 12.</note> If this oath was binding, it was their duty to keep it; conſequently, murder is a duty. For the murder of Paul or of themſelves, was a neceſſary conſequence of their keeping this oath. But if it was not binding in this inſtance, no more was it in the caſe he ſuppoſes, conſequently the objection is of no force.</p>
               <p>MR. L. ſays,—"Nothing is now claimed by our biſhops, but the very ſame that St. Paul gave in charge to Timothy. Nothing prohibited to the elders and preſbyters of our church, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the elders to do, at Epheſus."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 47, 48.</note> Is this really the caſe? Do not their biſhops <hi>claim</hi> a power of adminiſtering the ſacraments, of baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper? But where will he find this mentioned in Paul's charge to Timothy? Do not the former <hi>claim</hi> the power of confirmation and abſolution? But does Paul mention either, in his charge to the latter? The biſhops in their church, <hi>claim</hi> the whole excluſive power of eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031609_0070_0FED5B48ADCADEB0"/>rule or government. But where do we find Paul giving this to Timothy? On the contrary, does he not expreſſly <hi>charge</hi> him, that thoſe preſbyters he was to ordain, ſhould be "men that ruled well their own houſes, that they might be able to <hi>rule</hi> the church of God?"<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. ii. 4, 5.</note> Does he not expreſſly command, "let the elders who <hi>rule</hi> well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy of double honour?"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chap. v. ver. 15.</note> But what occaſion for this, if the biſhop had the ſole power of government? I add; where does he find the apoſtle <hi>charging</hi> his grace, Timothy lord biſhop of Epheſus, "to entangle himſelf with the affairs of this life:"<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. ii. 4.</note> To intermeddle, and bear a chief part in civil matters, to erect courts, and preſide in them, either in perſon, or by his <hi>lay</hi> chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, for the trial of all cauſes, teſtamentary and matrimonial, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.? And yet he knows a ſet of biſhops, pretending to be the only ſucceſſors of Timothy and the apoſtles, who actually <hi>claim</hi> and exerciſe all the fore-mentioned powers. Paul tells the Epheſian elders, "that the Holy Ghoſt had made them paſtors or biſhops over the whole flock," and charges them to exerciſe the powers of ſuch, to feed, to <hi>rule</hi> and govern this church as its proper biſhops, to uſe their authority, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in a way of diſcipline, and prevent falſe teachers creeping in, to draw away diſciples: And is there any thing, I aſk, of this kind, <hi>allowed</hi> to Mr. L. and his brother-preſbyters in their church? Not in the leaſt. He himſelf knows, that by the rules and canons of his order, he is abſolutely <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited</hi> every thing of this kind.</p>
               <p>THUS have I anſwered every thing material in this part of our author's defence;—particularly ſhewed, from <hi>facts recorded in ſcripture,</hi> that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy neither was, nor could be a fixed biſhop of Epheſus, ſettled there, with governing powers over theſe elders; but that this church was moſt
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031609_0070_0FED5B48ADCADEB0"/>evidently ſettled upon the preſbyterian plan,—that St. Paul when taking his leave of it, never to ſee it more, very expreſſly left the intire guidance of it, not to a ſingle perſon, not to Timothy, but to theſe elders in a ſtate of parity; conſequently, that this is the true ſcriptural plan of church order and government, and therefore, preſbyters, or ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſtors, in ſuch ſtate of equality, have the power of ordination, &amp;c. committed to them.</p>
               <p>I HAVE nothing to add, but my moſt earneſt wiſh and prayer, that the great head of the church would guide us into all truth, and inſpire all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, eſpecially goſpel miniſters, with the ſpirit of meekneſs, forbearance and charity towards each other, even though not exactly of one mind in all points; that ſo, inſtead of worrying and cruelly condemning our fellow chriſtians, and thereby, giving advantage againſt us to the patrons of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, infidelity and irreligion; we may all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially unite, in oppoſing the common enemies of chriſtianity, and promoting the grand and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant truths, in which we all agree.</p>

               <p>OUR author propoſes, in this part of his work, "to enquire what form of government pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, immediately after the apoſtles." "To anſwer this enquiry, he tells us, he will exhibit a few extracts, from the ancient fathers."</p>

HIS firſt <hi>extract</hi> is, from that truly <hi>ancient apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic father,</hi> arch-deacon Echard of England, who flouriſhed about A. D. 1699. But what purpoſe this <hi>extract</hi> is deſigned to ſerve, the reader muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine for himſelf, for I am not able to help him.</p>
               <p>HIS next is from Euſebius. He, I own, is one of the <hi>fathers;</hi> but far from being an <hi>ancient</hi> one: For he lived in the fourth century. And as he himſelf tells us, in his hiſtory, "that he could trace no footſteps of any going before him, only in a few narratives,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. I. cap. 1.</note> there is little dependence upon what he ſays, of things ſo remote from his time. However, the paſſage quoted is this:—"St. John, being by Domitian's death, releaſed from baniſhment, returned, and took the care of the church of Epheſus; and upon the invitation of the neighbouring <hi>churches, who had enjoyed only the miniſtry of preſbyters and deacons,</hi> he went to them, and conſecrated biſhops," &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. L's def. page 49, 50.</note> I have carefully examined the paſſage in Euſebius, Mr. L. refers to; but find it very different from what he has quoted. None of the words, ſet down in italics, are to be found in the original. The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage truly rendered, is as follows. Speaking of John, he ſays,—"After the tyrant's death, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Epheſus; and being invited ſo to do, went alſo among the neighbouring nations, where he appointed biſhops, eſtabliſhed regular and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat churches, electing to the clerical office whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Holy Ghoſt pointed out for the ſame."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Euſeb. eccl. hiſt. Lib. III. cap. 23.</note> Though I will not charge Mr. L. with diſhoneſty, in thus pretending to quote from Euſebius, what is not to be found in him; ſince 'tis poſſible he might not have <hi>leiſure to conſult the original,</hi> but taking the tranſlation upon truſt, ſet down the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage as he found it, in ſome epiſcopal writer; yet every one muſt ſee, the words added, in Mr. L's
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:031609_0071_0FED5B4B85A9B500"/>quotation, intirely alter the ſenſe of the paſſage, and make it evident it was done, by <hi>ſomebody,</hi> to favor epiſcopacy, and impoſe upon the unlearned reader. With the addition of the words,—"who had enjoyed only the miniſtry of preſbyters and deacons;" the paſſage does indeed <hi>ſeem</hi> to favour the doctrine of three orders in the miniſtry; but let it be read without this corrupt addition, and then let the intelligent reader judge, what it is to Mr. L's purpoſe; or whether any other eight lines, taken at random, from Euſebius, or any other author, will not as effectually prove epiſcopacy, as theſe here quoted? Stripped of this addition, the paſſage mentions but one officer, viz. a biſhop in theſe churches; and as that, in ſcripture, means the ſame as preſbyter, by his own conceſſion, it can be nothing to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>HIS next quotation is from Irenaeus,—"That Polycarp was conſtituted by the apoſtles in Aſia, <hi>biſhop</hi> of the church at Smyrna." Anſwer:—St. Paul, whoſe authority is at leaſt equal to that of Irenaeus, tells us, "that the Holy Ghoſt conſtituted the elders of Epheſus, <hi>biſhops</hi> of the church of Epheſus." If therefore Polycarp's being calle I biſhop, proves him ſuch in Mr. L's ſenſe of the word; theſe elders muſt be ſo too. But then what becomes of his main argument for prelacy, from Timothy's being biſhop of Epheſus? Or if he ſtill denies theſe elders to be biſhops, though they are called ſo, the ſame he muſt do as to Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp's. And ſo this <hi>extract</hi> fails him alſo.</p>
               <p>BUT he tells us, the deſign of Irenaeus was to prove a ſucceſſion of apoſtolic doctrines, "but his argument is equally good in favor of a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of biſhops." And this, he ſays, will prove "that biſhops were ſuperior to preſbyters." An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:—Not till he proves there were, beſides theſe here called biſhops, any preſbyters in that church for them "to be ſuperior to." Irenaeus, in
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:031609_0072_0FED5B182697F970"/>the paſſage quoted, mentions but one order only. This <hi>extract</hi> therefore, is ſo far from helping Mr. L's ſcheme of three orders, that it is wholly in favour of our's which has but one.</p>
               <p>THE ſame anſwer alſo will ſerve, for his three next <hi>extracts</hi> from Irenaeus. As there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in either of them, of more than one order, viz. biſhops, nor the leaſt hint given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any other; it muſt be preſumed, that Irenaeus knew of none, but ſuch biſhops or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters as are mentioned in ſcripture. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the doctrine of three orders, and Mr. L's dioceſan biſhop, was a ſtranger in the time in which this father lived. I ſhall only juſt add:—That Mr. L's <hi>tranſlator,</hi> has again ſerved him ill. For in the firſt of theſe quotations the words of Irenaeus, as recited by Euſebius, are not "that Clement is he of whom mention is made Philip. iv. 3," as Mr. L. has it; but "that Linus is he, of whom Paul makes mention in his epiſtle to Timothy."<note n="†" place="bottom">Euſeb. eccl. Hiſt. lib. v. cap. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>HIS next <hi>extract</hi> is from Jerom,—"Quid facit exceptá ordinatione, epiſcopus, quod preſbyter non facit?" "What can a biſhop do, except ordination, that a preſbyter may not do? Had Mr. L. anſwered this queſtion, according to his own principles, the reader would, at once, have ſeen, how very little it was to his purpoſe. For is there nothing in the church of England, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation excepted, but what is common to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter and biſhop? Certainly there is Mr. L's biſhop can confirm, hold ſpiritual courts, exerciſe diſcipline, &amp;c. But is a preſbyter allowed to do thoſe? Nothing leſs. But Jerom does not even inſinuate, that <hi>ordination</hi> belongs only to the biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op, by <hi>divine right.</hi> And had Mr. L. read the epiſtle, from whence theſe words are taken, he muſt have ſeen, that the whole ſcope of it is to
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031609_0072_0FED5B182697F970"/>prove, that in the apoſtles times, biſhop and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter were the ſame, both in name and office.—This he aſſerts, in ſo many words, and proves it from the ſame texts and topics, as are uſed by preſbyterians at this day; and then goes on to ſhew, how, when, and upon what occaſion the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church was altered afterwards. "That one was afterwards choſen, who ſhould be ſet over the reſt, he tells us, was done as a remedy againſt ſchiſm."<note n="§" place="bottom">Hieron. Epiſ. ad Evagr. Tom. II. p. 109.</note> When therefore he uſes the words Mr. L. has quoted, he evidently does it to ſhew "what was the practice of the church <hi>in his time;</hi>" not what prevailed in that of the apoſtles. 'Tis pity Mr. L. will not be at the pains of reading the fathers <hi>himſelf.</hi> It might, perhaps, ſave his friends many a bluſh upon his account.</p>
               <p>THE next church he mentions, as upon the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal model, is that of Antioch. "In this, he tells us, was a number of believers, whom the apoſtles, Paul, and Barnabas, "took the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of for ſome time." Strange! Two biſhops in one church at once! How different the <hi>modern</hi> epiſcopacy from the <hi>ancient!</hi> Formerly one church could boaſt two biſhops, and both apoſtles. But their <hi>ſucceſſors,</hi> it ſeems, have made ſuch improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the prelatic art, that one biſhop now will ſerve for more than an hundred. This muſt be ancient epiſcopacy inverted. However, this was not the caſe long. "Paul and Barnabas, he ſays, were ſoon ſucceeded by Peter." What, Peter biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op of Antioch! We tho't he had been metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan of Rome. But this was not long. "Euodius ſoon takes his place; to whom ſucceeded Ignatius;" whoſe epiſtles, we are told, contain the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del and marrow of modern epiſcopacy. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly our author is longer upon this favourite pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, than all the reſt of the fathers; though I
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:031609_0073_0FED5AFCDB313E20"/>think he gives us but one or two <hi>extracts</hi> from him, and them but ſhort.<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 52, 53.54, 55, 56.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As to the epiſtles aſcribed to Ignatius, Mr. L. muſt know, if he has read Dr. Chauncy's ſermon, that they lie under very ſtrong ſuſpicions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, or at leaſt of great adulteration and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This the Dr. largely ſhews in his appendix, and offers ſuch arguments in ſupport of the charge, as makes it, at leaſt very highly probable, if not certain this was the caſe. Theſe, Mr. L. does not attempt to anſwer. He indeed tells us, "that biſhops Beveridge and Pearſon have fully confuted, Meſſrs. Daille, L'arroque, and all others, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have advanced againſt theſe epiſtles."—And I can tell him "that L'arroque undertook to anſwer Beveridge and Pearſon, as appears by a manuſcript found among his papers, in which he had made great progreſs; but at the <hi>deſire</hi> of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons, who <hi>leaned too much to be epiſcopal cauſe,</hi> he did not finiſh this reply."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Nov. Rep. Lit. Tout. l. Art. 5, p. 56, 57.</note> A victory obtained by ſuch arts as theſe, can do no great honour to the conquerors. This ſtory, Mr. L. if he pleaſes, may confront with his, concerning Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ndel in page 69 of his book.</p>
               <p>BUT if we ſhould allow theſe epiſtles to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, they will really make nothing in favour of dioceſan epiſcopacy, but much againſt it. 'Tis true, they frequently mention biſhops, preſbyters, and deacons: But then it is equally true, that the biſhop deſcribed in theſe, was eſſentially different from the dioceſan one. The "Ignatian biſhop" preſided over but one ſingle church, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more than a congregational biſhop, or paſtor of a particular church: Whereas the dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan one, preſides over many ſcores or hundreds of congregations. Again,—the former had much the ſame authority over his preſbyters, as the rector
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031609_0073_0FED5AFCDB313E20"/>of a pariſh, in the church of England, has over his aſſiſtant curates, who are not pretended to be of a different order, but have <hi>radically</hi> the ſame power with the rector: But the church of England biſhop, is aſſerted to be a different order from the preſbyter; by divine right, ſuperior to him, and veſted with the ſole power of ordination and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. A few <hi>extracts</hi> from theſe epiſtles will ſerve to prove this. "Let all follow the biſhop as Jeſus Chriſt; and the preſbyters, as the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles."—"Let none do any of thoſe things which belong to the church without the biſhop."—"Where the biſhop appears, let the multitude, or congregation be."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ignat. Epiſt. ad Smyrn. ſec. 8, page 37.</note> "If the prayer of one or two have ſo much efficacy, how much more the prayer of the biſhop, and the whole church? He that comes not to the ſame place, is puffed up," &amp;c.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ad Eph. ſec. 5.</note> "Do nothing without the biſhop and preſbyters, but when you meet together, let there be one prayer, &amp;c. run all together as to one temple of God, as to one altar."<note n="†" place="bottom">Ad Magneſ. ſec. 7.</note> "Where the paſtor is, there do you, as ſheep follow."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Epiſt. ad Philadelph. ſec. 2.</note> From theſe paſſages it appears, that the dioceſe of the Ignatian biſhop, was no larger, than could meet together in one place, for public worſhip, with the biſhop and preſbyters. But it is impoſſible for a modern dioceſe, conſiſting of ſome hundreds of congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to attend divine ſervice in one place.</p>
               <p>AGAIN:—It is plain, from theſe epiſtles, that the ſacraments were not to be adminiſtered, but in the preſence of the biſhop. "Let that euchariſt be accounted valid which is celebrated in the biſhop's preſence, or by his permiſſion; where the biſhop appears, let the multitude be;—it is not lawful without the biſhop, either to baptize or to
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:031609_0074_0FED322344EFE2B0"/>make a love feaſt."<note n="§" place="bottom">Ad Smyrn. ſec. 8, p. 37.</note> "Take care to uſe, or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, one euchariſt; for there is one fleſh of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and one cup for union in his blood; there is <hi>one</hi> altar, as there is <hi>one</hi> biſhop."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ad Philadelph. ſec. 4.</note> "Since every one of you <hi>by name,</hi> with common conſent, meet together,—that you may obey your biſhop and the preſbytery, with an undivided mind, breaking <hi>one loaf,</hi> which is the medicine of immortality."<note n="†" place="bottom">Ad Epheſ. ſec. 20.</note> From theſe paſſages it appears, that as every altar, or communion table, had its biſhop; ſo all the communicants, in his whole dioceſe, ſteadily met together with the biſhop, to receive the ſacraments, and that it was not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive them, but from his hand, or in his preſence. But now, how different is the caſe from this in the church of England? There, one biſhop has many ſcores or hundreds of communion tables in his dioceſe, and a great many thouſand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants; for whom it would be abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to attend the communion at one table, with their biſhop, and receive the conſecrated ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at his hands, or in his preſence.</p>

And having exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to peace, and ſubjection to their ſpiritual guides; the more deeply to impreſs their minds with this exhortation, he tells them, "that the apoſtles, receiving inſtructions, and being ſent out by Chriſt,—went forth, declaring the glad tidings of the coming of the kingdom of God; and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through countries and cities, they conſtituted the firſt fruits of their miniſtry, for <hi>biſhops and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> of thoſe that ſhould afterwards believe, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the ſpirit approved them."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Clem.

               <p>MR. L's laſt teſtimony from the fathers, is from Jerom.

In his commentary upon Titus,<note n="§" place="bottom">Tom. 9, p. 103.</note> having declared, "that preſbyter is the ſame with biſhop, that, according to ſcripture, one is the name of age, the other of office;" and largely proved, from the ſame texts and arguments, as are uſed by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, that in the times of the apoſtles, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>THUS have I particularly examined all Mr. L's teſtimonies from the fathers, and, as I truſt, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhewn, that they make nothing in ſupport of the cauſe he has undertaken to defend: On the contrary, that all he has mentioned, even Ignatius not excepted, are plainly on our ſide. More eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially is this the caſe as to Clemens Romanus, the earlieſt of all the fathers, as appears from the above quotations. That Jerom alſo was full in the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian ſcheme of church order and government, the impartial reader, I preſume, is by this time fully convinced.—I ſhall add a few more teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from ſome of the reſt, and ſo conclude the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> to the fathers.</p>
               <p>POLYCARP, next in order of time to Ignatus, A.

Upon which Dr. Stillingfleet juſtly remarks.

And even in the latter ones, where ſome diſtinction appears, it was no greater than that between the rector of a pariſh, and his aſſiſtant curates, who are yet of the ſame order; conſequently, that there is no foundation

L. utterly denies "that there are any hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, giving an account of any one ſingle church in the univerſe, that has been <hi>preſbyterian</hi> from the planting of chriſtianity."<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 71.</note> I believe the reader is convinced by this time, that the churches men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the foregoing quotations, were really upon the preſbyterian plan. I ſhall adduce a few more inſtances of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p>IN the church of Alexandria, it appears from Jerom, that preſbyters actually <hi>ordained,</hi> for two hundred years, from the firſt planting of it. His words are,—"At Alexandria, from Mark the evangeliſt, to Heraclas and Dionyſius, the biſhop thereof, the <hi>preſbyters</hi> always named one, choſen but of them, and <hi>placed</hi> in an higher degree, their biſhop: As if an army ſhould <hi>make</hi> an emperor, or the deacons ſhould chooſe one of themſelves, whom they knew to be moſt diligent, and call him <hi>

                     </gap>rch-deacon,</hi> of the ſame office with his brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons; and that even this was conferred, not by conſecration, from the hands of a ſuperior order, but by the preſbyters themſelves, who choſe and appointed him thereto. If preſbyters therefore could appoint and conſecrate their biſhop, I hope it will be allowed that they had power to ordain a brother-prreſbyter; conſequently that <hi>preſbyterian</hi> ordination was the original eſtabliſhment there.</p>
               <p>THAT the ancient Gallic or French church was preſbyterian, appears from what I have already quoted from Irenaeus, paſtor of the church of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in France. With him, preſbyter and biſhop are the ſame office, as they are alſo in ſcripture.
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031609_0079_0FED5B13B97A4B60"/>And, (as Dr. Stillingfleet juſtly obſerves) he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, both the <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> he pleads for, and the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> thro' which it deſcended from the apoſtles, intirely to the order of <hi>preſbyters,</hi> and none other."</p>
               <p>THE Iriſh church alſo, in the early times of it, was evidently <hi>preſbyterian.</hi> Certainly it was not epiſcopalian, of the <hi>dioceſan</hi> kind. Ninnius men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions St. Patrick's ordaining 365 biſhops in that church, in the early times of it. And Mr. Clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſhews out of Bernard, and Baronius, that there were, in that kingdom, well nigh as many biſhops as churches.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prim. epiſco. p. 40.</note> Theſe certainly could not be biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops of the dioceſan kind, who have many ſcores or hundreds of churches in their cure; but were evidently congregational paſtors of particular chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, like ours at this day.</p>

               <p>MR. L. ſeems to be ſure that epiſcopacy was the original conſtitution in England. If it was, I am ſure nothing he has ſaid proves it to be ſo.— The authorities he has brought are by no means ſufficient for the purpoſe. In the firſt place, they aſſert no ſuch thing in the quotations he has made from them. They only mention that this church had biſhops; but whether dioceſan ones, or only ſcriptural biſhops, congregational paſtors, they are wholly ſilent. Beſides, they are teſtimonies ſome ten or twelve hundred years too late, to be depended upon, as authentic vouchers in this caſe. If St. Paul planted chriſtianity in England, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuppoſe, 'tis natural to ſuppoſe that he would ſettle the ſame form of ordination, he himſelf had received, and this has been proved to be <hi>preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian.</hi>

The impartial reader will now judge, whether Mr. L. has been able to find any more ſolid foundation, on which to erect his grand fabric of dioceſan epiſcopacy, among the writings of the fathers, than what appears in the New-Teſtament; conſequently, what little reaſon he had, to be ſo very confident of having fully ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the diſpute in his favour, by an appeal to theſe writers, and that even before he had finiſhed his extracts from them.</p>

UPON quitting his favorite Ignatius, he has theſe words,—"But is not this fact evident and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, from the forecited paſſages, that in the next age after the apoſtles, epiſcopacy was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally received, in all the churches of Chriſt?"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 53, 54.</note> What now, I aſk, are theſe paſſages from whence <hi>this fact</hi> is ſo undeniably evident? Why barely one or two quotations, from the pretended epiſtles of Ignatius, without having, as yet given the leaſt intimation, that theſe epiſtles lay under any ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of interpolation, adulteration or forgery, and without afterwards examining, or attempting to invalidate, any of the arguments brought by Dr. Chauncy, to prove their inſufficiency, in point of evidence, on that account. Beſides theſe, Mr. L. had, as yet, brought no teſtimonies from any writer, within two hundred years after Chriſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from Irenaeus only; and theſe barely ſome ſcraps, detached from their connection, and which even then, favour his cauſe in ſound only, not in ſenſe; as has, I truſt ſufficiently appeared, from the foregoing remarks. And yet this is the whole evidence, on which he affirms it "to be <hi>undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fact,</hi> that epiſcopacy, in his ſenſe of the word, was <hi>univerſally</hi> received, in all the churches of Chriſt." What may not one make to be <hi>fact,</hi> and <hi>undeniably</hi> ſo, upon ſuch evidence as this? Much to be pitied is the man, who is ſo far under the government of prejudice, as to imagine ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as this undeniable! Much more, if his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice puts him upon repreſenting that as <hi>undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence</hi> to others, which is truly no evidence at all!</p>
               <p>HE goes on:—"Though this ſtrangely ſlipt Dr. Chauncy's obſervation, when he read the fathers, yet I ſuppoſe their teſtimony may be of ſome weight, with thoſe whoſe obſervation this point has not ſlipt."<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 54.</note>

He well knew that no ſuch <hi>fact</hi> ever took place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that team of time, and ſo muſt every one elſe, who impartially reads the fathers.

                  </gap>e reflects, how groſſly he has perverted the Dr's words.</p>
               <p>MR. L. ſays, "he is ſurprized that the Dr. ſhould deny, that the ancients conſtantly aſſert the government of the church, to have been epiſcopal all along from the times of the apoſtles, without producing a ſentence from one of the fathers, to ſupport his denial."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 60.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ONE would think, a man who engages in a public controverſy, ought to be ſo well acquainted with the rules of diſputation, as to know, that it belongs to thoſe who <hi>affirm</hi> a fact, to bring evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in proof of it; not to thoſe who <hi>deny</hi> it.— This was the caſe here. Dr. Hoadly <hi>affirmed</hi> a certain fact to be declared in the fathers. Dr. Chauncy <hi>denies</hi> they mention any ſuch fact. This he has a right to do, without <hi>proving ſuch denial.</hi> The proof lay upon the affirmer. It lies upon all the advocates of epiſcopacy in this inſtance. It has often been called for:—But the call has never yet been anſwered, by producing ſo much as a ſingle paſſage, within two hundred years after Chriſt, except from the juſtly diſputed epiſtles of
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:031609_0082_0FED5B35F87F97B0"/>Ignatius, wherein this fact is affirmed, either in direct terms, or in words from whence it can be fairly deduced. 'Till this is done, Dr. Chauncy, and all mankind have a right to deny the fact.— Had Mr. L. thought of this, it might have ſaved him his great "ſurprize."</p>
               <p>HE adds:—"Inſtead of ſupporting this denial from the fathers, the Dr. has quoted the opinion of the moderns."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 60.</note> Mr. L. is quite miſtaken in the deſign of theſe quotations. They were bro't only to ſhew, that in the ages poſterior to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond century, and even after the eſtabliſhment of epiſcopacy, it was far from being indubitably clear, that this eſtabliſhment, and the practice upon it, had taken place upon the foot of a <hi>divine right.</hi>— And in this view there are none, I imagine, ſave Mr. L. and his party, but what will think them pertinent and concluſive.</p>
               <p>IN anſwer to the Dr's demand "of an example of epiſcopal ordination within the two firſt centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries," Mr. L. inſtances in the ordination of Titus by St. Paul."
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 61.</note> But pray how came he by the knowledge that Paul ordained Titus? He affirms it, and that is all. If he had any proof, why did he not produce it? Sure I am, the ſcripture affords him none. But if it did, how will this prove he did it in the <hi>capacity</hi> of a biſhop? Paul himſelf was ordained by preſbyters: No doubt then he acted as a preſbyter in ordaining Titus, if he acted at all. "But, ſays he, that Titus had epiſcopal ordination, appears from his being left in Crete to ſet in order the things that were wanting," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>ANSWER:—Theſe directions given to Titus, no more prove him to be biſhop of Crete, i. e. of a ſuperior order to the elders he was to ordain; than like directions given to Peter, prove him to be ſuperior to the other apoſtles. Beſides, thoſe
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:031609_0082_0FED5B35F87F97B0"/>whom he was to ordain, are expreſſly called biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. i. 7.—"<hi>That thou mayeſt ordain elders,</hi> ſays the apoſtle. He means biſhops. <hi>In every city,</hi> ſays he, for he would not have the whole Iſland committed to <hi>one man;</hi> but that every one ſhould have and mind his own proper cure; for ſo, he knew the labor would be eaſier to him, and the people to be governed, would have more care taken of them; ſince their teacher would not run about to <hi>govern</hi> many churches, but would attend to the <hi>ruling of one only,</hi> and ſo would keep it in good order." St. Chryſoſtom, in Tit. iii. 6. To the ſame purpoſe ſpeak Theophylact and Oecumenius.</note> He himſelf was no more, therefore could not be their ſuperior, conſequently not their biſhop, in Mr. L's ſenſe of the word. But if he was, how does this prove that he himſelf received epiſcopal ordination? This, if I underſtand it, is Mr. L's argument: Titus himſelf was a biſhop; therefore, he was ordained by one, or had epiſcopal ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But how does this follow? Paul and Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, he allows, were biſhops: And yet, it has been proved, and that from ſcripture, that they were both ordained by preſbyters. And from Jerom it appears, that he whom they called biſhop, in the church of Alexandria, was choſen from among, and ſet apart to his epiſcopal office by his preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that church, for two hundred years, in the beginning of it.</p>
               <p>AN example of epiſcopal ordination, not from ſcripture, but from the fathers of the two firſt centuries, was what was demanded. Mr. L. ſays he could produce many. Why has he not then done it? Was it for want of inclination, or ability?— Doubtleſs the latter. Thus after all his boaſted appeal to the fathers, they afford him as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as the ſcriptures do.</p>

               <p>IN both the pieces Mr. L. undertook to anſwer, it was obſerved, that this doctrine "of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable divine right of epiſcopacy," was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the firſt reformers, even in the church of England. This was done with a view to expoſe the bigotry of thoſe anathematizing zealots, the modern ſons of that church, who, like Mr. L. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church and unchriſtianize all the proteſtant world but themſelves. Sundry teſtimonies were adduced, from the firſt reformers and latter writers of the church of England, both biſhops and others, to prove that this was not the doctrine of that church, at the time of the reformation, and many years after.—That though for <hi>reaſons of ſtate,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the epiſcopal ſettlement in England; yet they did not look upon it to be of divine right, or ſo eſſential as to nullify all ordinations, unleſs thoſe performed by biſhops, in their ſenſe of the word. And it was particularly ſhewed, that the firſt who publicly maintained that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable anti-chriſtian doctrine, was the famous arch-biſhop Laud, of papiſtical and perſecuting memory; and that he was publicly rebuked by his ſuperior for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>MR. L. declares himſelf of the ſame principles, and undertakes to defend them, by an appeal to the firſt reformers. Let us examine his proofs.</p>
               <p>HIS firſt is from arch-biſhop Cranmer, in theſe
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:031609_0083_0FED5B4150902878"/>words, "We read not that any, not being a biſhop, hath, ſince the beginning of Chriſt's church, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a prieſt." If by biſhop, is here meant a congregational biſhop, all preſbyterians will agree, that none but ſuch have power to ordain: But then it will be nothing to Mr. L's purpoſe.—But if a dioceſan biſhop is intended, then all that Cranmer can be ſuppoſed to mean is, that the buſineſs of ordaining has been confined to ſuch biſhops, not as ſolely veſted with that power by the law of Chriſt; but only by human appointment, and the cuſtom of the church. For biſhop Burnet aſſures us, that Cranmer's opinion was,—"That biſhops and prieſts, were at one time, and were not two things, but one office, in the beginning of Chriſt's religion."
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſt. Refor.

This interpretation makes Cranmer conſiſtent, whereas Mr. L's involves him in a plain contradiction.</p>
               <p>HIS next <hi>extract</hi> is from biſhop Jewel, in theſe words,—"We believe that there be divers degrees of miniſters in the church, whereof ſome be dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, ſome prieſts, ſome biſhops." That Jewel here only aſſerts a matter of fact, or what were the officers then in the church, not a matter of right, or what ought to be by divine inſtitution, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what he ſays in his apology. Speaking of the various degrees of the clergy in Jerom's time, he ſays,—"Chriſt appointed not theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of orders from the beginning."—"This is the thing <hi>we defend,</hi> St. Jerom ſaith, let biſhops underſtand, they are in authority over prieſts, more by cuſtom, than by order of God's truth. A prieſt is the ſame with a biſhop; they are both one thing, and the churches were at firſt, governed by the
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031609_0084_0FED5B639AD48BA8"/>common advice of prieſts."
<note n="†" place="bottom">Apol. part. 2, c. 3.</note> This plainly ſhews that in the paſſage quoted by Mr. L. he does not mean to declare his <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>divine right</hi> of three orders; but only to aſſert a matter of fact; and ſo is no proof that Jewel owned the divine right of epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>BUT Mr. L. ſuppoſes, this is proved to be the doctrine of the reformers, from the preface to the book of ordination. "It is evident to all men diligently reading the holy ſcriptures, &amp;c.—that there have been theſe <hi>three</hi> orders of miniſters," &amp;c.
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 63.</note> Upon which he obſerves,—"It muſt be evident to any man of common ſenſe, that the reformers, who compoſed this preface, believed the three offices of biſhops, prieſts and deacons, to be of divine right, or none of them to be ſo; for they as poſitively aſſert that all are, as that one is." Anſwer:—They do not aſſert that this one is. This preface only aſſerts a matter of fact; that there had been ſuch orders from the apoſtles times. It does not declare that theſe three orders are of divine unalterable right:—Nor does it determine what kind of biſhops were from the apoſtles times, whether dioceſan, or only parochial. And if Meſſrs. Hoadly and Ollyffe, two epiſcopal divines, may be allowed to underſtand the ſenſe of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, as well as Mr. L. it will be nothing to his purpoſe. Mr. Ollyffe in his anſwer to Mr. Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſpeaking of this very preface, ſays,—"The propoſition of this rubrick is formed or expreſſed, with as great a degree of latitude or moderation, as ever could be expected, from an epiſcopal church. <hi>It ſaith nothing of divine right or appointment.</hi> That is Mr. Calamy's addition, as Mr. Hoadly well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. It ſaith nothing of the diſtinction of their powers and officers; or whether they have been eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in every church or no: But only, that from the apoſtles times, there have been theſe orders,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:031609_0084_0FED5B639AD48BA8"/>&amp;c.—From which, the moſt that can be inferred is, that in ſuch churches where there has been need of them, or occaſion for them all, there have been three ſuch ranks of miniſters, for the government and inſtruction of Chriſt's church, from the times of the apoſtles; which yet by Mr. Calamy's leave, <hi>does not prove a divine appointment</hi> of all, (however otherwiſe it may appear to him) there having been other things, in the apoſtles days, which yet, for all that, are not allowed to be of divine appointment." Here we ſee Mr. L's uncharitable interpretation of this preface, as though it meant to nullify all ordinations, ſave thoſe of the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal kind, ſtands expreſſly condemned, by two celebrated divines of his own church. As their interpretation is more charitable and chriſtian-like, than Mr. L's; I preſume every perſon of candor will judge it the true one; and conſequently, that his argument, founded on ſuch a ſtingy interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, can't be admitted as proof, that the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable compilers of this preface, were of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and ſchiſmatical principles.</p>
               <p>THOUGH they here ſpeak of three orders in the church, yet they no where ſay, that biſhops are by divine right, ſuperior to preſbyters:—Nor is there the leaſt intimation, that they looked upon all ordinations to be null and void, unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a biſhop. For though they ſay "no man ſhall be accounted a lawful biſhop, unleſs admitted according to the form there preſcribed;" yet this is expreſily limitted <hi>"to that church of England."</hi> All therefore that can be meant by this, is no more than a declaration, who they will allow to be accounted <hi>lawful biſhops of the national church of England:</hi> But this is no proof that they believed the divine right and abſolute neceſſity of dioceſan epiſcopacy, or accounted thoſe churches to have no valid miniſtry and ordinances, that are without it, as Mr. L. does. The contrary of this,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031609_0085_0FED5B5148FBA6F0"/>is undeniably evident from their practice, as I ſhall ſhew.</p>
               <p>OUR author's laſt argument, to prove that the <hi>reformers</hi> were of his uncharitable ſentiments, in this point, is taken from the 3d, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th, canons of their church, which he has quoted at large.
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page 63, 64, 65.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As the canons of the church of England, as they now ſtand, were compoſed at ſundry times; at periods far diſtant one from another; ſome in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, ſome in that of King James, &amp;c.—Mr. L. ſhould have told us which claſs, thoſe he has quoted belonged to: For if they were among the number of thoſe paſſed in King James's reign; they can't be ſaid to exhibit the ſentiments of the <hi>firſt reformers,</hi> who had no hand in making them, being dead many years before. As he has not ſeen fit to do this, I might juſtly forbear any further notice of them, as being noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purpoſe of his argument.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, allowing they were of the firſt claſs, they will by no means prove, that the compilers of them believed the unalterable divine right of epiſcopacy, and denied the validity of preſbyterian ordination. The ſubſtance of them is, (for they are too long to tranſcribe) "that if any perſon ſhould deny the church of England to be a true church, or declare her government by biſhops, &amp;c. to be anti-chriſtian, or repugnant to the word of God, or upon that account, or any other, ſeparate himſelf from her communion, he ſhall be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicated." But now there is nothing in theſe canons, that will prove the authors of them believed dioceſan epiſcopacy, to be of unalterable divine right. They might think it to be <hi>lawful,</hi> though not expreſſly of <hi>divine inſtitution;</hi> much leſs that it was <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to the being of the church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="unknown:031609_0085_0FED5B5148FBA6F0"/>
As to the <hi>charity</hi> of ſuch excommunicating, anathematizing canons, I muſt leave it to the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Mr. L. and thoſe of his ſtamp: For as to myſelf, I utterly deſpair of ſucceeding in any attempt of that kind. Americans, bleſſed be God, have hitherto been unacquainted with ſuch <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> canons. Their fulminations in this land, are heard, only like the diſtant thunders of the <hi>vatican.</hi> —Had not Mr. L's zeal for epiſcopacy, got the better of his prudence, I ſhould have judged he would have been more tender of the reputation of his <hi>beſt conſtituted</hi> church, than thus to expoſe her nakedneſs, by bringing to view theſe <hi>notable</hi> canons, in a country where they are ſo little known. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his deſign was to let us know what we are to expect, if the ſcheme for ſending biſhops to Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, erecting ſpiritual courts, &amp;c. in the colonies, ſhould take place.—But to return:—</p>
               <p>THE above remarks, I truſt, make it ſufficiently clear, that it cannot be proved, either from the preface to the book of ordination, or from the canons, or indeed from any thing elſe Mr. L. has quoted, that the reformers were of his ſentiments, as to the divine right of epiſcopacy. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the epiſcopal church, as eſtabliſhed by the king and parliament, as what they tho't <hi>lawful,</hi> though not <hi>neceſſary</hi> in itſelf, or of any ſcriptural or divine appointment.—That they did not look upon it as of divine inſtitution, is evident,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. FROM their <hi>expreſs declarations,</hi> both ſingly, and in a collective capacity. I have had occaſion already to cite ſome paſſages from biſhops Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Jewel, in which they expreſſly aſſert it, as their judgment, "that biſhop and preſbyter, in ſcripture, is one and the ſame." The biſhop of St. Aſaph, Therlby, Redman and Cox, declared themſelves of the ſame opinion. Biſhop Morton, in his catholic apology, declares, "that the power of order and juriſdiction, which the papiſts aſcribe
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031609_0086_0FED5B4E83FE27E0"/>to biſhops, doth, <hi>by divine right, belong to all other preſbyters.</hi> And particularly, that, <hi>to ordain,</hi> is their <hi>ancient right.</hi>"
<note n="†" place="bottom">Cited by Mr. Boyſe, Anc. Epiſco. page 12.</note> Biſhop Bedel ſays, "that a biſhop and preſbyter are all one, as Jerom proves from ſcripture and antiquity."

Dr. Reynolds, in his letter to Sir Francis Knolls, mentions biſhop Pilkington, Dr. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, Whittaker, Bradford, Lambert, and Fulk, as all declaring the ſame. To which number we may add, biſhop Carleton, Dr. Field, Mr. Maſon, Dr. Forbes and the arch-biſhop of Spolato, who all expreſſly aſſert the validity of preſbyterian or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.

               <p>To theſe ſingle teſtimonies, I will only add, that in the time of the reformation, the arch-biſhops, biſhops, arch-deacons and clergy of the church of England, in their book, intitled, "the inſtruction of a chriſtian man," ſubſcribed with all their hands, and dedicated to King Henry VIII. A. D. 1537, in the chapter of <hi>orders,</hi> have theſe words,—"In the N. Teſtament there is no mention of any other degrees, or diſtinctions in orders, but of deacons or miniſters, and preſbyters or biſhops."

               </p>
               <p>THESE things, I mentioned in my ſermon, to which Mr. L. has made no reply. I now ſubmit it to the candid reader, whether it is poſſible to ſuppoſe, that men who could expreſs themſelves in this manner, were of Mr. L's principles, "that dioceſan epiſcopacy is of divine right," "and that all ordinations by preſbyters, are a mere nullity."</p>
               <p>MR. L's letter-writer, S. J. tells us,—"the ſentiments of the firſt reformers, are not to be learnt from ſome tranſient expreſſions of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, but from their public acts." I have here produced inſtances of both, in which, as indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, and as public bodies, they give their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for the ſcriptural divine rights of preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ordination and government, in terms, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and poſitive, as can well be conceived.— From theſe teſtimonies it evidently follows, that epiſcopacy was not eſtabliſhed in England, at the time of the reformation, upon the foot of <hi>divine right;</hi> but only as a form of government, ſuited to the civil inſtitution of the ſtate by which it was eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS fact further appears from the <hi>practice</hi> of the church of England, conſequent upon ſaid eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment. It is not denied that there have been ſome particular members of that church, all along, from the <hi>pontificate</hi> of arch-biſhop Laud, to the preſent day, who, like Mr. L. have eſpouſed this uncharitable doctrine <hi>of the divine right</hi> of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and the invalidity of all miniſterial authority and goſpel adminiſtrations, where this is wanting. But that this is not the <hi>doctrine of the church of England,</hi> appears from her repeated practice to the contrary, in admitting miniſters to officiate in that church, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="172" facs="unknown:031609_0087_0FED5B1DDC26D150"/>the offer of a biſhoprick, though he had nothing but preſbyterian ordination, and not even that, if Mr. L. ſays true. In the ſame reign, Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Martin Bucer, and P. Fagius, all foreigners, and who had been ordained only by preſbyters, had eccleſiaſtical preſerments in the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland conferred upon them, without re-ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<note n="†" place="bottom">Owen's Plea for Scrip. Ordina. page 118.</note> Mr. William Whitingham was made dean of Durham, about 1563, though ordained by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters only.
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. page 121.</note> In like manner, Mr. Travers, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by a preſbyter beyond ſea, was ſeven years lecturer at the temple, and had the biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don's letter for it.
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. page 122.</note> And even ſo late as the time of King James I. biſhop Bancroft, though a rigid epiſcopalian, conſecrated Spotſwood and two oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, biſhops for Scotland, without firſt ordaining them preſbyters, though they had received only preſbyterian ordination; and he alledged this as his reaſon, "that preſbyterian ordination was valid."</p>
               <p>Now is it not abundantly evident from theſe <hi>facts,</hi> that the church of England, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> is not of Mr. L's principles, as to the point in debate? He aſſerts the <hi>divine right</hi> of epiſcopacy, and utterly denies the <hi>validity</hi> of preſbyterian ordination:— But here we ſee, the church of England, and her greateſt dignitaries and biſhops, not only aſſerting in words, the <hi>validity</hi> of preſbyterian ordination; but repeatedly declaring this, to be the <hi>ſenſe and doctrine</hi> of that church, by admitting, from time to time, thoſe who had no other ordination, to the free exerciſe of the miniſtry, and placing them in the higheſt offices in the church. Whom now ſhall we believe? Mr. L. who pretends, from the rubrick and canons of this church, to prove that ſhe holds the unchriſtian, ſchiſmatical doctrine afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid? Or ſhe herſelf, who by her practice, denies it? Muſt we not ſuppoſe, that the firſt reformers, the biſhops and dignitaries of the church of England,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031609_0087_0FED5B1DDC26D150"/>underſtand her conſtitution and principles, as well as the <hi>miſſionary</hi> of Norwalk?—But,—</p>
               <p n="3">3. THAT preſbyterian ordination is valid, even in the ſenſe of the church of England, is evident, <hi>from the moſt public and expreſs acts of the king and parliament.</hi> The church of England is properly a parliamentary church. She expreſſly acknowledges the king <hi>as her head, inveſted with ſupreme power in all affairs, eccleſiaſtical.</hi> Her articles and canons are all enjoined, by authority of parliament. 'Till this is done, they are of no force.

But now the validity of preſbyterian ordination has, in fact, been owned and eſtabliſhed, by the king and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, at two ſeveral times, Soon after the <hi>reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration,</hi> A. D. 1661, there was an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſed, "declaring and confirming thoſe to be miniſters, to all intents and purpoſes," who were then <hi>incumbents</hi> in the ſeveral pariſhes; tho' many of them had been ordained, after the biſhops were put down in the preceding adminiſtration, and ſo had only preſbyterian ordination.

               </p>
               <p>AGAIN:—The ſame was done, A. D. 1707, by the act of <hi>union,</hi> whereby England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were united into one kingdom. Previous to this, the parliament of Scotland paſſed "an act, for ſecuring the proteſtant religion, and preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian church-government in Scotland, to poſterity." —Now this act was made an eſſential and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental part of the act of union, and ſo is confirmed by the king and parliament of Great-Britain, and thereby, the preſbyterian order and government of the church of Scotland is as fully to all intents and purpoſes, eſtabliſhed there, and by the ſame authority, as epiſcopacy is in England. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, ever ſince that time, every king of Great-Britain,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:031609_0088_0FED5B2AC3FB8030"/>upon his acceſſion to the throne, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take the following oath,—"I G.—king of Great-Britain, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, &amp;c.—do faithfully promiſe and ſwear, that I ſhall inviolably maintain and preſerve, the ſettlement of the <hi>true proteſtant religion,</hi> with the government, worſhip, diſcipline, rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as eſtabliſhed by laws made there, in proſecution of the claim of rights; and particularly by an act, intitled, an act for ſecuring the proteſtant religion, and <hi>preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an church government,</hi> and by the acts paſſed, in the parliaments of both kingdoms, for the union of the two kingdoms."—"So help me God.—G.

               <p>HERE again we ſee, the ſupreme authority of the nation, king, lords, and commons, <hi>expreſſly</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the religion of the church of Scotland, and her <hi>preſbyterian</hi> form of government, <hi>to be the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion.</hi> As ſuch, they eſtabliſh it to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity; and the king, by his <hi>coronation</hi> oath, moſt ſolemnly promiſes and ſwears, to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend it.

Moſt certainly they muſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſince they have ſo expreſſly declared, by their moſt ſolemn and public acts,—"that a church, founded upon <hi>preſbyterian</hi> principles, is a <hi>true proteſtant church;</hi> and as ſuch, have eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it, and engaged to preſerve and defend it in perpetuity; it undeniably follows, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right of epiſcopacy, was no part of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal conſtitution of the church of England at the
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:031609_0088_0FED5B2AC3FB8030"/>time of the reformation, or a doctrine ſince owned by her, as ſuch. What raſhneſs, what effrontery then, is Mr. L. chargeable with, in ſo confidently aſſerting, as he does, "that the body of the church of England divines, at the time of the reformation, and I may ſay, ever ſince, have conſtantly believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and maintained, the divine right of epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?"

               <p>IN this part of his work, our author pretends to give us ſundry <hi>extracts</hi> from the foreign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants: Not indeed to prove, that theſe foreign churches are of the epiſcopal kind. This he knew was impoſſible: But though they are preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans themſelves, yet that they do not allow our ordinations to be valid. Now, granting his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from Calvin, Beza, Le Mayne, &amp;c. to be genuine; which, conſidering the freedom he uſes with other authors, is at leaſt very doubtful; they will by no means prove that theſe men denied the validity of ordination, even among the diſſenters in England. What they ſeem to blame the old puritans for, is their ſeparating from the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed church of England, not for maintaining preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian principles. Beſides, it is well known what arts were uſed in them times, by the ſticklers for uniformity, to ſolicit the opinion of foreign proteſtants in their favour, and get them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance the ſeparation. "About this time, ſeveral letters paſſed, between the Engliſh divines, on both ſides, and ſeveral learned foreigners.— Matters were falſely repreſented to them, and great arts were uſed, on the <hi>biſhops</hi> ſide, to prevent ſuch perſons writing, who they found would not write in their behalf; and what they thought made for them, they publiſhed to the world in way of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.

<note n="†" place="bottom">Pierce's Vind. page 68.</note> Moreover, theſe foreign divines knew, that epiſcopacy was ſettled in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, not as of <hi>divine right,</hi> but only by <hi>civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> Having this view of the Engliſh hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, they might think it more adviſable for their brethren in England, to ſubmit to it, than to go into a ſeparation <hi>barely upon this account.</hi> For it is only on account of <hi>this,</hi> that they are, in Mr. L's quotations, ſuppoſed to ſeparate, and for which they are blamed. Whereas this was but one thing, among many, that cauſed the ſeparation. But what buſineſs had Mr. L. with the diſſenters of England? The pieces he attacks, undertook the defence of the New-England miniſtry, not that of the diſſenters in England. There was no need of it. This has been repeatedly and ſucceſsfully done by many able writers of their own. Particularly by Meſſrs. Baxter, Calamy, Pierce, and more lately the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gentlemen in anſwer to Mr. White. Beſides, who does he mean by "the diſſenters in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?" If he intends New-England; bating a few anabaptiſts and quakers, I know of no diſſenters, ſave thoſe of his communion. Epiſcopacy never was eſtabliſhed here, though its oppoſite is, to the no ſmall mortification of our author and company. If therefore, the foreign divines had ſuch a regard to peace, as to adviſe their preſbyterian brethren in England not to ſeparate, even from an epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal church, by law eſtabliſhed: Who can ſuppoſe they would not condemn Mr. L. and party, in ſeparating from the <hi>eſtabliſhed preſbyterian churches</hi> here, and becoming <hi>epiſcopal diſſenters?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031609_0090_0FED321A2CCEA078"/>to come to the queſtion, as he has ſtated it; that is, "whether our ordinations in this country are allowed to be valid by the foreign proteſtants?" In anſwering of it I will purſue his method, and "examine their public conſtitutions, their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral practice, and their private ſentiments."</p>
               <p n="1">1. FROM the <hi>public conſtitutions</hi> of the foreign proteſtants, it is evident even to demonſtration, that they do and muſt approve of our ordinations as <hi>valid.</hi> If they allow their own to be valid, they muſt for this plain reaſon allow ours to be ſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their conſtitutions, at leaſt ſo far as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is concerned, are preciſely the ſame with ours. Mr. L. I truſt; need not be told that our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſtrictly preſbyterian, agreeable to our conſtitution: But the ſame is the conſtitution of the foreign churches. "The proteſtant churches abroad, ſays Mr. Boyſe,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Ancient Epiſ. p. 281.</note> are divided into <hi>luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> and <hi>reformed.</hi> For the <hi>lutheran</hi> churches we have the <hi>concord of lutherans</hi> printed at Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, containing the confeſſion of Augſburgh, and the apology for the ſame—the Smalcaldic articles, Luther's greater and leſſer catechiſm." From theſe authentic writings, we learn what the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the Lutherans in this point is. The words are,—"The goſpel gives to thoſe that are placed over the churches, a command to teach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to remit ſins, to adminiſter the ſacraments, and <hi>juriſdiction</hi> alſo. And by the confeſſion of all, even our adverſaries, 'tis manifeſt that <hi>this power,</hi> is by divine right, <hi>common to all</hi> that are ſet over the churches, whether they be called paſtors, or preſbyters, or biſhops.—Since biſhop and paſtor are not different degrees by divine right, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that <hi>ordination</hi> performed by a paſtor in his own church is valid."

<note n="¶" place="bottom">Art. 31.</note> Mr. L. need not be told that the article of the church of Scotland is the ſame upon this head.</p>
               <p>Now can there be a more full and convincing
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:031609_0091_0FED5B44B2049890"/>evidence, of theſe foreign churches allowing of the validity of our ordination, than this univerſal agreement and teſtimony of their public conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this point? Mr. L. and thoſe of his ſtamp, though they renounce our ordinations, yet allow of thoſe performed in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church. The reaſon is, becauſe the principles of the papiſts, in this reſpect, are the ſame with theirs. Epiſcopacy is the doctrine of the church of Rome; the church of England therefore allow their ordinations to be valid, as being the ſame with her own. But now, with an evidence beyond exception it appears, that all the foreign proteſtants are ſtrictly of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as to the ordaining power; from whence it undeniably follows, that they muſt allow and approve of our ordinations, as valid, becauſe they are the very ſame as are pointed out, in all their confeſſions of faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS point is alſo evident from the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>practice</hi> of the foreign churches. All the Dutch churches throughout the united provinces, the proteſtant churches in France, thoſe of Geneva and the proteſtant cantons in Switzerland, &amp;c.— are utter ſtrangers to biſhops, both name and thing. All their clergy are upon a level; all equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the power of ordination, and every other branch of miniſterial authority. And as to thoſe proteſtant churches which have officers they ſtile biſhops, ſuperintendants or ſeniors; they are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than ſtanding moderators, pretending to no ſuperiority, by divine right, over their breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. "All theſe churches, ſays Dr. Stillingfleet, acknowledge no ſuch thing as the <hi>divine right</hi> of epiſcopacy, but ſtiffly maintain Jerom's opinion, of the primitive equality of all goſpel-miniſters."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Iren. page 411.</note> —Nor can they do otherwiſe; having at bottom no other than preſbyterian ordination among them: For Luther, Calvin, Bucer, Melancthon, Bugenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:031609_0091_0FED5B44B2049890"/>&amp;c.—and the firſt reformers and founders of theſe churches, who ordained miniſters among them, were themſelves preſbyters and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>THIS again clearly proves, that they do in fact allow our ordinations to be valid; for they are the ſame with theirs. Theirs are performed by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, paſtors, by divine right, all in a ſtate of equality: The ſame alſo are ours. If therefore, they allow their own, they muſt allow ours, which are the ſame. And that this is the caſe in fact, is evident from particular inſtances of their practice. In Holland, tho' they allow a liberty of conſcience to thoſe of other denominations, yet no miniſters are ſupported by the public, but thoſe of their own profeſſion: But it is an undoubted truth, as I am informed, that they do in fact ſupport one or more Scotch preſbyterian miniſters, juſt as they do their own. This plainly ſhews, that they look upon the preſbyters in Scotland, as their brethren, of the ſame church with themſelves, and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably proves, that they allow of their ordination, and conſequently of ours in this country, which is the ſame. The Dutch churches therefore in Europe, beyond diſpute allow the validity of our ordinations. In America the caſe is the ſame.— Here there are ſundry Dutch churches, originating from, and upon the ſame conſtitution, with the reformed proteſtant churches in Holland. Theſe allow the validity of our ordinations. A number of years ago, a young gentleman of Dutch extract, came to New-Haven, and was ordained by our miniſters, at the College there, as a miniſter for the Dutch churches in the county of Albany.— This, as my author tells me, was done by order of the claſſis in Holland. The Rev. Mr. Wooſly, who was ordained by a number of Connecticut miniſters, over the church and congregation of Southold, on Long-Iſland; after he left that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and removed to his plantation, in Oyſter-Bay,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:031609_0092_0FED5B21AFA91878"/>preached and adminiſtered the ſacrament, in a Dutch church in that town, for twenty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The ſame did the Rev'd Mr. Ketteltas ſince. He was ordained miniſter of Elizabeth-Town, by the preſbytery in New-Jerſey. After he left that people, at the invitation of ſundry Dutch churches in Queen's-County, Long-Iſland, he officiated as their miniſter for ſome time. The ſame gentleman is now improved in the miniſtry, in the French proteſtant church in the city of New-York. Now theſe are ſo many expreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in which our ordinations have been, in fact, acknowledged and allowed to be valid by the foreign proteſtant churches. And yet in direct oppoſition to this inconteſtible evidence, in the very face of theſe ſtubborn and obſtinate facts, Mr. L. has the aſſurance, ſhall I call it? To tell his readers "that none of theſe foreign proteſtants, (meaning the Dutch, French, &amp;c.) will admit of a man ordained by <hi>our diſſenters,</hi> (as he calls us by way of contempt) to adminiſter the ſacraments in their churches." "That they condemn, and find as much fault with our ordinations, as the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians (meaning himſelf and thoſe of his high-flying principles) do." "And that our mode of worſhip, &amp;c. is condemned by all the foreign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants."

               <p n="3">3. FROM the <hi>private ſentiments</hi> of foreign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants it appears, that they both approve of our method of ordination and government, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that of the epiſcopal church. Gerard, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lutheran divine, ſays,—"During the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic age, there was no ſuch thing as a diſtinction, between a biſhop, and a preaching preſbyter."

<pb n="184" facs="unknown:031609_0093_0FED5B60C9211110"/>could be friends to epiſcopacy? Who can entertain the leaſt doubt of their being, in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſtrictly preſbyterian, when they ſo ſtrongly expreſs themſelves in favour of the latter, and in oppoſition, and even deteſtation of the former?
<note n="§" place="bottom">Of the ſtrong attachment of the French proteſtants to preſbyterian principles, and their abhorrence of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, Mr. Hickman gives a ſtriking inſtance,—from Hiſt. eccleſ. tom. p. 767. The caſe was this:—One J. Antonius Caracciolus, biſhop of Troyes, turned proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and appeared before the proteſtant conſiſtory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to be admitted to the miniſtry. And although he had ſolemnly renounced and abjured his Romiſh princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and in the preſence of the conſiſtory, ſigned his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration of them, and his conſent to the proteſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith; yet they would not receive him as a miniſter, until he expreſsly promiſed <hi>to deſert and forſake his epiſcopal function.</hi> This he accordingly did; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was received into the miniſtry. This was done by the advice of that great and good man, Peter Martyr, who happened to be there at that time, in his way to Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich. This therefore ſhews his opinion of epiſcopacy.</note> If theſe teſtimonies, from the <hi>public inſtitutions,</hi> the <hi>univerſal practice,</hi> and the <hi>private ſentiments</hi> of the foreign proteſtants, do not amount to a full proof of their being ſtrictly preſbyterian in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple themſelves, and of their approbation, and allowance of our ordinations, as valid and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, I muſt forever deſpair of ſeeing any <hi>fact</hi> proved, in any caſe whatever.</p>
               <p>BUT Mr. L. tells us, "the whole that is aimed at, in theſe confeſſions, is to condemn the uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope, not to condemn epiſcopacy."

               </p>
               <p>WHEN Chriſt aſcended, he left the eleven apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, the only miniſters of his church; all veſted with the ſame commiſſion, all equal in power. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by this commiſſion they went forth,— preached the goſpel, planted churches, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained miniſters in them; veſted them with the ſame commiſſion they themſelves bore. No ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is to be found of their fixing ſome in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, others in a ſubordinate ſtation. The min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters they ordained, were all of one order, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly called biſhops, paſtors, or elders. As the general commiſſion is but one, ſo one method of introduction into office, one ſet of qualifications in order to it, one work or buſineſs for them when introduced, and one only, is to be found in the word of God. This was the order fixed by Chriſt, and followed by his apoſtles. They invariably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to that divine maxim of the great head of the church,—"call no man your maſter upon earth, for one is your maſter in heaven, even Chriſt, and all ye are brethren." This was tranſmitted to the primitive chriſtians, and obſerved in the pureſt and earlieſt ages of the church. A defection from this original <hi>parity,</hi> 'tis granted, pretty ſoon aroſe.— "The myſtery of iniquity began to work," even before the apoſtles were dead. A thirſt of domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and eccleſiaſtical pre-eminence, early oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated amongſt the miniſters of the meek and lowly JESUS. This increaſed from leſs to more, till "<hi>that</hi> man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himſelf above all that is called GOD, or is worſhiped," got himſelf fairly mounted upon the ſeven-headed beaſt, and enſlaved all chriſtendom with his uſurped dominion. From this yoke of anti-chriſtian tyranny, when great part of Europe
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031609_0094_0FED5B6A438EC058"/>was happily delivered, by the glorious light of the reformation, the ancient <hi>parity</hi> among miniſters, generally took place. By far the greateſt part of the proteſtant churches, recurred to the original ſcriptural plan of preſbyterian order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And where in any inſtance, as in England, they adopted the epiſcopal mode, it was not under any pretence of divine right, but wholly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the form of government in the ſtate.</p>
               <p>THE above facts are indubitably clear, from ſcripture, and eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, ancient and modern. On theſe facts the reaſonings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions are founded, contained in the foregoing pages. For the truth of the facts I appeal to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic writings aforeſaid. For the juſtneſs of the reaſonings and concluſions deduced from them, the candid reader is now to determine.</p>
               <p>IF dioceſan epiſcopacy be of divine right, it is certainly contained in ſcripture. If it be of ſuch vaſt importance, as is pretended, it muſt be very clearly and expreſſly revealed there. Doctrines of importance, truths eſſential to religion, are not left to be collected barely from dark hints and doubtful expreſſions; but are clearly revealed, and often repeated, in various modes of diction, "that he who runs may read them." But is this the caſe with dioceſan epiſcopacy? The warmeſt advocate for it, I preſume, will not pretend it is. All that the learned labor of its ableſt champions has hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto been able to produce, is barely ſome dark hints and doubtful expreſſions, which a fruitful inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may turn to favour it; but theſe capable of a more rational interpretation upon the contrary ſcheme. And yet to this point of <hi>doubtful diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> the moſt eſſential doctrines and expreſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of our holy religion, it ſeems, muſt be made a ſacrifice. That men fulfil their promiſes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their covenant obligations, and religiouſly regard their ſolemn vows, is not only one of the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:031609_0095_0FED5B665E1468B0"/>firſt dictates of natural religion; but very expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and repeatedly enjoined in the word of God. —But when men, who have ſolemnly dedicated themſelves to the miniſtry in our churches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their ordination vows, and take epiſcopal orders: When profeſſors among us, who ſolemnly promiſed and covenanted before God, angels and men, to walk in communion with us, rend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oft, and join the epiſcopal ſeparation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of the divine right of epiſcopacy, who does not ſee that <hi>doubtful points</hi> are preferred to <hi>poſitive precepts;</hi> and that more weight is laid upon the former, than the latter? If this is not to ſubſtitute "mint, aniſe, and cummin, inſtead of the weightier matters of the law," 'tis indeed hard to ſay what is. And after all; what is gained, in point of <hi>valid miniſtry and or dinances?</hi> Why truly, upon their own principles, juſt nothing at all. If our miniſters have no power, then our adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations are invalid, our baptiſms a mere nullity. Thoſe therefore who have been baptized in our churches, are in a ſtate of mere heatheniſm, let them conform to what church they will. As this is the caſe with moſt of their miniſters in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they muſt, upon this principle, be ſo far from being the only regular miniſters, that they are not even viſible chriſtians; and inſtead of being the only perſons impowered to diſpenſe goſpel admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtrations, they have no right even to partake of them themſelves. Conſequently all they pretend to baptize, are ſtill in a ſtate of heatheniſm, and ſo all their miniſters and churches, as well as ours, in the ſame wretched and deplorable condition.— Who can ſuppoſe ſuch doctrines as theſe, are to be found in the bible? Who can imagine, claims and principles, productive of ſuch ſhocking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, have any warrant from the goſpel of Chriſt? A moment's cool reflection, methinks, might ſhew their abſurdity, and give a check to
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:031609_0095_0FED5B665E1468B0"/>the advocates of them, in their warmeſt career of <hi>proſelyting</hi> zeal. Verily, gentlemen, a little more conſiſtency of principle and conduct here, would not be amiſs. Let us firſt ſee you concerned to ſecure for yourſelves, a valid baptiſm: Then it will be time enough to preſs us with the argument of your only valid miniſtry. When we ſee you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly concerned for your own ſafety, it may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly convince us that you are ſincere, in your zealous att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pts to promote ours.</p>
               <p>IF Mr. L. or any other, will juſt remove theſe difficulties, and favour us with a ſolid, ſcriptural and thorough refutation of the foregoing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it will be kindly received, and properly noticed. But if only bold aſſertions, falſe quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a ſuperficial glance, upon here and there a ſentence, is offered to the public, under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of <hi>a full anſwer,</hi> it will be treated with deferved neglect.</p>
               <p>MAY the Father of lights direct our enquiries, and the God of truth lead us into all truth. May the ſaving influences of the ſpirit of peace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, ſo remarkable in the apoſtles and primitive chriſtians, be ſhed forth in plentiful effuſions, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all orders and denominations. That ſo, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we differ in ſentiments in ſome leſſer things, we may all agree in "chooſing the one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful," and finally unite our hearts and voices, in endleſs hallelujahs, to our common Lord and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
