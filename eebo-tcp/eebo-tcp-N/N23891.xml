            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> plea≈øure of ever ≈øeeing it: But 'tis with great impropriety ≈øtiled <q>a defence again≈øt mine;</q> as nineteen parts in twenty of what I had ≈øaid, is pa≈ø≈øed over, without ≈øo much as an attempt to examine its force, or ≈øhew its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øivene≈øs in point of argument. Was it not that my name is now and then mentioned, no one would imagine he had it in view to an≈øwer me, any more than an hundred others, who have appeared on the ≈øame ≈øide of the que≈øtion in di≈øpute.</p>
            <p>I e≈øteem my ≈øermon as full an an≈øwer to his "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence," as if wrote on purpo≈øe to confute it; and a≈øk no other favour than that they be carefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with each other, and an impartial judgment formed thereupon. If this is done, I can't ≈øuppo≈øe that any one, be≈øides Mr. L. will be di≈øpo≈øed to think, <q>that he has an≈øwered the mo≈øt material things advanced by Dr. Chauncy:</q> It mu≈øt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, on the contrary, that he has ≈øcarce taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing material that I have offered.</p>
            <p>I have no other knowledge of this gentleman, than what may be collected from this ≈ømall work of his; which has not, I confe≈øs, given me an exalted opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:031609_0003_0FED5AD13B176930"/>of him. Was I inclined to engage-in the epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal controver≈øy, I ≈øhould choo≈øe for my opponent, one that is better able to manage a di≈øpute, than he appears to me to be. What good purpo≈øe would it ≈øerve to write, though it were never ≈øo clearly and ≈øtrongly, when one knows before hand, that little notice may be taken of what is wrote, and yet the whole be completely an≈øwered?‚ÄîHe has ≈øaid but little, very little but what has been an≈øwered an hundred times over, and with arguments much too powerful to be ≈øet a≈øide by him.</p>
            <p>I am ≈øorry your lot is ca≈øt among tho≈øe who are deeply tinctured with high-church principles. Such are always bigots them≈øelves, and zealou≈øly endeavor to make others ≈øo too. This was the ca≈øe among us in former years; but the≈øe high-flying notions are now almo≈øt ab≈øorbed in a more generous way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There are but few who dare openly profe≈øs their adherence to the≈øe tenets, whatever their private thoughts may be. 'Tis indeed high time they were univer≈øally eradicated out of men's minds, they are ≈øo ≈øen≈øele≈øs in them≈øelves, as well as contrary to the word of God.</p>
            <p>However, as the ca≈øe is circum≈øtanced with you, it may be well for you to take him to ta≈øk, and point out his weakne≈øs; which, as I imagine, you will find no difficult matter.</p>
            <p>It would be doing too much honour to him, for us both to be engaged in the di≈øpute with him: Though I believe it is in reality a di≈øpute with the combined clergy in tho≈øe parts. By the account I have of Mr. L. he is not equal to the performance that comes out in his name, however in≈øufficient it may be as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to either of us.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN I preached and publi≈øhed my di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe upon ordination, I had no thoughts of engaging in a controver≈øy. Providence had ca≈øt my lot in that part of Chri≈øt's vineyard, where there are ≈øundry epi≈øcopalians, inter≈øper≈øed among the people of my charge, as well as in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Though I never could find any ≈øcripture warrant, for the peculiarities that di≈øtingui≈øh that church from the re≈øt of the prote≈øtant world; tho' it has many defects in its orders, wor≈øhip and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and is con≈øiderably different from the plan laid down by our Saviour and his apo≈øtles, and followed by the primitive chri≈øtians in the next ≈øucceeding ages; yet as it appears to have the e≈ø≈øentials of religion, it has ever been my prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to treat its profe≈ø≈øors as chri≈øtian brethren, tho' mi≈øtaken in ≈øome points; agreeable to the apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic direction,
<q>Him that is weak in the faith receive, but not to doubtful di≈øputations.</q> A wrangling di≈øputatious temper among the di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, e≈øpecially among the mini≈øters of the Prince of Peace, is odious and unchri≈øtian. As the things in which we agree, are, by all allowed, to be of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater importance than tho≈øe in which we differ; how can that zeal be defended which ≈øpends it≈øelf only, or principally, about the latter, while the former are treated with comparative neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? Is it not much more becoming the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of chri≈øtians and mini≈øters of the go≈øpel, to lay a≈øide the≈øe bickerings, and unite our endeavours
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:031609_0004_0FED5A9894C517C8"/>in oppo≈øing the growing cau≈øe of infidelity and irreligon, and promoting the more important truths of our common chri≈øtianity? The≈øe are the principles agreeable to which I have ever treated our epi≈øcopal di≈ø≈øenters: And I challenge the whole party <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> produce an in≈øtance, in which I have ever begun a di≈øpute with them upon the controverted points, or attempted, publicly or privately, to prejudice them again≈øt their own wor≈øhip or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtry. I e≈øteem it a greater honour to promote the real intere≈øt of religion, than that of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular denomination; and, if I know my own hears, had much rather be the happy in≈øtrument of ≈øavingly converting one ≈øoul to Chri≈øt; than of making a thou≈øand pro≈øelytes, merely to the low de≈øigns of a party. It has ever given me pain, to ob≈øerve the prevalence of a contrary temper and conduct, in tho≈øe of any denomination, whether clergy or laity. How far this has been the ca≈øe with the epi≈øcopalians in the≈øe parts, would, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be deemed invidious in me to ≈øay. Sure I am, if I had not ob≈øerved too many in≈øtances of this kind; had I not been repeatedly ≈øolicited, to preach and publi≈øh upon the ≈øubject, as a nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary antidote again≈øt the effects of them; the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe I am now called upon to vindicate, never would have ≈øeen the light. In compo≈øing of it, I ≈øtudiou≈øly guarded again≈øt every thing offen≈øive; for I had no de≈øire to be drawn into a controver≈øy. Had I been di≈øpo≈øed to this, I could not have been at a lo≈øs for materials. It is well known, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the exorbitant, un≈øcriptural claims of their bi≈øhops, and the mean, ≈øervile ≈øubjection of the pre≈øbyters, in that church; there are ≈øome things in her articles, and in her wor≈øhip and di≈øcipline many more, which are, (at lea≈øt in our opinion) highly exceptionable. However naturally many of the≈øe things fell in my way, while writing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:031609_0004_0FED5A9894C517C8"/>this ≈øubject, I carefully ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed them; for my maxim was to act only on the defen≈øive, and endeavour, by ≈øcripture and rea≈øon, to vindicate our mini≈øterial authority from the perpetual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of the party. In the≈øe circum≈øtances, I had rea≈øon to conclude, that the mo≈øt ≈øanguine and zealous among them would not be offended, or look upon them≈øelves concerned to an≈øwer me, either from the pulpit or the pre≈øs. But no ≈øoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was the piece publi≈øhed, than the epi≈øcopa pulpits, here and in the neighborhood, re≈øounded with the old cry, "the power, the power;" and repeatedly rung over all the various changes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> epi≈øcopacy. And among the re≈øt, it was ≈øaid, Mr. L. often di≈øtingui≈øhed him≈øelf upon the topic, with ≈øingular pathos and zeal.</p>
            <p>IT was ≈øoon given out, that an an≈øwer to my piece would be publi≈øhed: But as no particular author was named, and the rumour abated; it was generally concluded, as they had no call to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the controver≈øy, the de≈øign was laid a≈øide. However, after a preparation of near three years, Mr. L. has ≈øeen fit to ≈øtep forth, and favor the public with the fir≈øt fruits of his pen, in what he is plea≈øed to call
<q>A defence of the epi≈øcopal government of the church, containing remarks upon two late noted ≈øermons, on pre≈øbyterian ordination.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT I was to expect, from ≈øuch an opponent, I was at a lo≈øs to determine; having never had a ta≈øte of his abilities for managing a controver≈øy. When the book came out, I read it with a good degree of attention; and was not a little ≈øurprized to find, that after ≈øo long preparation, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had ≈øo little to ≈øay, upon the two pieces he had
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:031609_0005_0FED5A9C57322028"/>≈øet him≈øelf to an≈øwer. As to Dr. Chauncy's, the Dr. ju≈øtly ob≈øerves, nineteen parts in twenty are pa≈ø≈øed over without a ≈øingle remark. And as to mine, whoever compares it with Mr. L's an≈øwer, will, I am confident, make much the ≈øame remark. Whether he has ≈øo fully ≈øucceeded, in tho≈øe parts he pretends to an≈øwer, mu≈øt be ≈øubmitted to the judgment of the public, to which I appeal.</p>
            <p>FOR the≈øe and ≈øuch like rea≈øons, it was judged at fir≈øt, that to attempt an an≈øwer was no ways nece≈ø≈øary. But as the party ≈øoon began to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in it, as an unan≈øwerable piece, and boa≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of great exploits done by it, in the addition of ≈øundry converts to the epi≈øcopal cau≈øe; it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally concluded, that ≈øomething ought to be wrote by way of reply. This, I hoped, would have been undertaken by Dr. Chauncy, as every way my ≈øuperior, e≈øpecially in his acquaintance with this controver≈øy. But as he has declined the ≈øervice, for the rea≈øons mentioned in his letter, prefixed to the≈øe ≈øheets; it of cour≈øe devolves upon me.</p>
            <p>As I am con≈øcious of no other motive in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, than a ≈øincere regard to truth, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt of our churches, which I really believe to be the intere≈øt of the Redeemer's kingdom; I ≈øhall endeavour fairly to examine <hi>every thing</hi> in Mr. L's book, that looks like an argument, and give it its due weight. For as it is truth rather than victory I aim at; ≈øo the former will ≈øhine brighte≈øt when placed in <hi>contra≈øt</hi> with every thing that oppo≈øes it; and as to the latter, he who ≈øhould challenge it for only <hi>nibbling</hi> at here and there a ≈øentence in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoni≈øt, mu≈øt I conceive, appear with a very ill grace. This, however, will make me more leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, than might otherwi≈øe be thought needful.</p>
            <p>ONE thing I think proper to premi≈øe.‚ÄîSince, notwith≈øtanding the caution u≈øed, both by the Dr.
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:031609_0005_0FED5A9C57322028"/>and my≈øelf, to avoid a controver≈øy with epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians, they have ≈øeen fit to engage in one; and will not ≈øuffer us even to defend our cau≈øe, when called upon ≈øo to do, without taking the alarm; I ≈øhall not look upon my≈øelf holden to ob≈øerve the like caution, in that re≈øpect, as I did in my ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. If therefore in the cour≈øe of this di≈øpute, I ≈øhould happen to treat them with le≈øs ceremony: If there ≈øhould occa≈øionally drop from my pen, any direct reflections, or free animadver≈øions, upon ≈øome very exceptionable and un≈øcriptural parts of their ≈øcheme, when they fall in my way, I reque≈øt the candid reader to impute it to the proper cau≈øe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>MR. L. has u≈øhered his "defence" into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic view, with a letter ≈øigned, S. I. Who this gentleman is, we are not concerned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. As he has ≈øeen fit to give us only the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial letters of his name, and left us to gue≈øs the re≈øt; he mu≈øt expect no more ceremony than any anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous writer, whatever honorary titles he may happen to be dignified with.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>OUR opponents, ≈øays he, have of late, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any provocation, been mu≈øtering up their old ≈øophi≈øms again≈øt the ancient epi≈øcopal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the church, which have been long ago abundantly an≈øwered over and over.</q> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the gentleman thinks all arguments again≈øt his ≈øcheme, de≈øerve the name of <hi>≈øophi≈øms.</hi> He ≈øhould remember however, that though to call an argument that pinches, by an ugly name, may be an ea≈øy method to get rid of it; yet in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the candid, a ≈øolid refutation would be more ≈øatisfactory. That our arguments are <hi>old,</hi> is readily granted; for ≈øo is truth: But that they are the wor≈øe or the weaker upon that account, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not. Nor does it appear that the≈øe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been all abundantly, I mean ≈øolidly <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered.</hi> To pretend to an≈øwer an argument, is one
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031609_0006_0FED5AB1AAFAEA18"/>thing; to do it effectually, another. The former, in the pre≈øent ca≈øe, we allow. The latter perhaps wants proof: We have only his bare word for it; and as he ≈øeems to be an intere≈øted per≈øon, the public, and not he, will be pre≈øumed the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt judge. But then,
<q>The≈øe ≈øophi≈øms have been mu≈øtered up again≈øt the <hi>ancient</hi> epi≈øcopal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the church.</q> Had he ≈øaid again≈øt the <hi>pre≈øent</hi> government of the church of England, as explained by ≈øome of her zealous ≈øons; the words would have read as well, and been more agreeable to truth. Every ≈øect, almo≈øt, is apt to boa≈øt of its antiquity; and if bare <hi>a≈ø≈øertions</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as proof, one has as good a claim to the honour as another. That the pre≈øent government of the church of England, is <hi>epi≈øcopal,</hi> none will deny: But that it is very <hi>ancient,</hi> at lea≈øt ≈øo <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> as ≈øome of its advocates pretend, is by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny denied. As to my≈øelf, I am fully per≈øuaded, that notwith≈øtanding all its high pretences to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; it is comparatively a mere novel, up≈øtart in≈øtitution. So far from being the true <hi>ancient</hi> epi≈øcopacy, that prevailed in the apo≈øtles times, and the ages next following; that it is, in many re≈øpects, diametrically oppo≈øite to it and de≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of it. This, I pre≈øume, will appear in the following pages.</p>
               <p>BUT after all, if we had attacked even the church of England, without <hi>provocation,</hi> it was doubtle≈øs wrong. This is a charge commonly brought by our epi≈øcopalians. Notwith≈øtanding the uncommon genero≈øity, with which they are treated in this country, and the ≈øingular indulgence of the ≈øtate towards them, above what was ever ≈øhewn to <hi>di≈ø≈øenters,</hi> in any part of the chri≈øtian world; they are often complaining of oppo≈øition and ill-u≈øage. At lea≈øt, if we will believe them, they never begin a controver≈øy. They are forced
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031609_0007_0FED5A8A8865BFF0"/>into it, in their own defence. This gentleman tells us,
<q>the≈øe opponents, (meaning, I ≈øuppo≈øe, Dr. Chauncy and I) have of late been mu≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. again≈øt the church, <hi>without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi>
                  </q> Mr. L. ≈øays,
<q>I am fully per≈øuaded, upon the ≈øtricte≈øt enquiry, it will be found, that there cannot be one ≈øingle in≈øtance produced, for thirty years pa≈øt, in which our clergy have begun the di≈øpute.</q>
                  <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Defence, p. 7.</note> And,
<q>When the church of England is <hi>attacked,</hi> her clergy ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe they ought to <hi>defend</hi> it.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 8.</note> His book is
<q>therefore called a <hi>defence,</hi> &amp;c. And this is the only rea≈øon that cau≈øes him to publi≈øh this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>
                  </q> But is this repre≈øentation hone≈øt? Are pre≈øbyterians ≈øuch quarrel≈øome neighbors, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be <hi>attacking</hi> the church of England? And <hi>beginning</hi> the controver≈øy with her, <hi>without provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Nothing le≈øs. The fir≈øt piece wrote upon the controver≈øy, in this country, was on the epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ≈øide. And the fir≈øt in this colony, by one with whom, I pre≈øume, S. I. is intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. What then can the≈øe gentlemen mean, by <hi>attacks</hi> upon the church of England? Had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Dr. or I, denied her the e≈ø≈øentials of a true church; had we di≈øputed the <hi>validity</hi> of her mini≈øtry;‚Äîpronounced a <hi>nullity</hi> upon her admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtrations;‚Äîranked her clergy among the ≈øons of <hi>Korah,</hi> or her members with <hi>heathen Jews</hi> and <hi>infidels;</hi> or had we <hi>directly</hi> attempted to expo≈øe any of tho≈øe many things, which are, at lea≈øt, highly exceptionable in her doctrines, di≈øcipline, orders, and wor≈øhip; they might, with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety ≈øound the alarm, and cry,
<q>an <hi>attack</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the church.</q> Every one knows, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the≈øe <hi>cants</hi> are, from a certain quarter. But is there any thing of this kind in the pieces Mr.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031609_0007_0FED5A8A8865BFF0"/>L. pretends to an≈øwer? Certainly nothing. They bravely <hi>defend</hi> our mini≈øtry, from the exceptions of the≈øe zealous advocates for epi≈øcopacy, who≈øe high-flying principles, lead them to anathematize all of our communion, and leave all the prote≈øtant world, but them≈øelves, to the uncovenanted mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God. According to the≈øe gentlemen, it ≈øeems, there can be no defence of pre≈øbyterian principles, however mode≈øt, without <hi>attacking</hi> the church of England. This is a great mi≈øtake. Let but the church of England, even in her pre≈øent form, be put upon her original and true footing;‚Äî let her re≈øt upon the foundation, which the fir≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and all her moderate and catholic ≈øons ≈øince, have fixed for her; I mean <hi>the civil authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King and parliament;</hi> and they never need fear being <hi>attacked</hi> by us. A <hi>defence</hi> of pre≈øbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ordination and government, will be no direct oppo≈øition to the church of England, in this view of it. Had there never been any higher claims for her, (and, to me, it is clear there never oughts) Had her ≈øons in this country, contented them≈øelves, with challenging for her, the honour of being a valuable branch of the reformation, and of having the authority in England, engaged for her e≈øtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhment and ≈øupport there; I am confident, "the annual lecture in Cambridge," at which Mr. L. is ≈øo much nettled, never would have had a being; nor the pieces he pretends to an≈øwer, have ≈øeen the light.</p>
               <p>BUT the grand ≈øecret no doubt is:‚ÄîThe cau≈øe of epi≈øcopacy is to be pu≈øhed in America, at all events. And, upon trial, this it ≈øeems, has been found the be≈øt expedient‚Äîto unhinge and perplex the minds of ignorant people,‚Äîto fill their heads with airy notions of the <hi>ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity</hi> of epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ordination, prejudice them again≈øt their own mini≈øters, as having no <hi>commi≈ø≈øion</hi> from Chri≈øt, no <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:031609_0008_0FED5A83C1788E70"/>to perform the divine offices of religion, and boldly pronouncing <hi>nullity</hi> upon all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtrations. This is the general ≈øtrain of all the pieces upon the controver≈øy, that have been wrote in this country. If this was not Mr. L.'s de≈øign, he had no call to engage in the di≈øpute. This, however, is no new art. All oppo≈øers of religion, have ever made their mo≈øt ≈øucce≈øsful attacks, through the ≈øides of its clergy. Thus did Korah, Dathan and Abiram. They fell upon Mo≈øes and Aaron, and denied their authority, as officers in God's church. "Ye take too much upon you." The ≈øcribes and phari≈øees did the ≈øame in their oppo≈øition to chri≈øtianity in its infancy. They "compa≈ø≈øed ≈øea and land to make pro≈øelytes," they attacked the divine author of the go≈øpel, and boldly que≈øtioned his authority, as a public officer in the church.
<q>By what <hi>authority</hi> do≈øt thou the≈øe things? And who gave thee this <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
                  </q> The apo≈øtle Paul met with the ≈øame treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Judaizing teachers, (who, by the way, were notable ≈øticklers for unin≈øtituted rites and ceremonies in religion,) traduced his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, denied his mini≈øterial authority, and in that way endeavoured to prejudice people's mind, and draw off a party to follow them. This laid him often, under the di≈øagreeable nece≈ø≈øity, of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating him≈øelf again≈øt ≈øuch a≈øper≈øions; as may be ≈øeen in his epi≈øtles. The grand topic of declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of papi≈øts, again≈øt prote≈øtants, has ever been this.
<q>You have thrown off the pope's authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ≈øeparated from the <hi>catholic apo≈øtolic</hi> church; you have therefore no <hi>authentic mini≈øtry,</hi> no <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid</hi> go≈øpel admini≈øtrations.</q> The ≈øame clamor was rai≈øed in England, by the non-jurors, again≈øt the church of England, at the revolution. And mo≈øt of us remember, how ≈øucce≈øsful the ≈øame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice has been, in the hands of our enthu≈øia≈øtic ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031609_0008_0FED5A83C1788E70"/>of this country, in the late times.‚ÄîBut to return.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>FOR ten years, ≈øays Mr. L. before this, the church of England and <hi>di≈ø≈øenters,</hi> lived in a peaceful ≈øtate: But ≈øince they have publi≈øhed ≈øo many things again≈øt that church, it has a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle di≈øconcerted the de≈øign of our clergy.</q> If the "de≈øign of their clergy" is to promote prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical godline≈øs, and make converts to Je≈øus Chri≈øt; I am at a lo≈øs to find any thing in the books he ≈øpeaks of, tending to <hi>di≈øconcert</hi> it. But if their grand <hi>de≈øign</hi> is, to convert <hi>pre≈øbyterians</hi> to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of <hi>prelacy,</hi> and make pro≈øelytes to the church of England, I don't doubt but that it has been a little, perhaps not a very little <hi>di≈øconcerted,</hi> by the publications afore≈øaid.‚ÄîHe adds,
<q>Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, as much as po≈ø≈øible, to live peaceably with all men.</q>‚ÄîPeace, without doubt, is a very de≈øirable thing; but if <hi>truth</hi> mu≈øt be the purcha≈øe of it, we beg to be excu≈øed. We ≈øhould heartily rejoice to find them, ever more di≈øpo≈øed to a <hi>peaceful</hi> conduct, than at pre≈øent they appear to be; and are not con≈øcious of any thing on our ≈øide, to make them otherwi≈øe. But if their <hi>de≈øigns are di≈øconcerted,</hi> by opening peoples eyes to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the truth; if their tempers are ≈øoured, and they become un≈øociable, and <hi>unpeaceful,</hi> by a bare detection of the weakne≈øs of their cau≈øe, and they are re≈øolved not to live in <hi>peace,</hi> unle≈øs we will give up all pretences to the character of mini≈øters and chri≈øtians, and, right or wrong, come over to their party; we mu≈øt plainly tell them, they hold their friend≈øhip too dear.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>THIS conduct of their mini≈øters, ≈øays S. I. to his client, has made it nece≈ø≈øary for us to write again, in defence of the church; and I am glad, and thank you, that you have undertaken this office, and ≈øo well acquitted your≈øelf in the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031609_0009_0FED5AE9136C1F48"/>of it.</q> How well Mr. L. has acquitted him≈øelf in this <hi>office,</hi> mu≈øt be left to the reader.‚Äî However, if all our arguments are but <hi>≈øophi≈øms;</hi> e≈øpecially if they
<q>have been long ago abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an≈øwered over and over by others;</q> 'tis no great purcha≈øe to do it again. But a ≈ømattering of logic will ≈øerve, to an≈øwer a <hi>≈øophi≈øm,</hi> and detect its fallacy. And if in the pre≈øent ca≈øe, this has been ≈øo often done before, ≈øome perhaps may be ready to doubt, whether Mr. L. has not acted the <hi>plagiary,</hi> and only publi≈øhed the works of others, in his own name. Be≈øides, if all our <hi>≈øophi≈øms</hi> have been ≈øo often, ≈øo abundantly an≈øwered before, what occa≈øion was there for doing of it again?‚Äî Not that I would detract from Mr. L.'s perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. It is really better than I expected from <hi>him;</hi> and, ≈øo far as he enters into the ≈øubject, as good, I imagine, as the cau≈øe will well admit. After all, I can hardly think he has done quite ≈øo much exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution with it, as his friend ≈øuppo≈øes. According to him, all our arguments ≈øtand no more chance, before the formidable artillery of this mighty champion, than mere cobwebs or puffballs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mouth of a roaring cannon.
<q>They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantly vani≈øh into du≈øt and ≈ømoke.</q>
                  <q>But no wonder: Since whatever plau≈øible appearance they make, they are but mere cavils.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THEIR chief appearance of ≈øtrength, he adds, lies in the promi≈øcuous u≈øe of the words, bi≈øhop and pre≈øbyter.</q> This gentleman mu≈øt allow me to tell him, he here labours under a great mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. If he had read the pieces he makes ≈øo free with, he mu≈øt have ≈øeen that we argue the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of pre≈øbyterian ordination, from the one general commi≈ø≈øion to mini≈øters in the go≈øpel. As this commi≈ø≈øion belongs to all Chri≈øt's mini≈øters, we think they mu≈øt be intitled to all the powers it contains; therefore to ordination, which is one of the≈øe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031609_0009_0FED5AE9136C1F48"/>We argue it, from all go≈øpel mini≈øters being ≈øucce≈ø≈øors to the apo≈øtles, in their ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and ≈øo po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of all the powers belonging to them, in that capacity, of which ordination is indubitably one.‚ÄîWe argue it, from there being but one kind, or order of mini≈øters, to be found in the New-Te≈øtament,‚Äîbut one ≈øet of qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations required,‚Äîone general work or bu≈øine≈øs a≈ø≈øigned,‚Äîand only one method of introduction into office pre≈øcribed for them all. Finally, we produce, as we think, plain and expre≈øs in≈øtances, from ≈øcripture, of ordination by pre≈øbyters, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ≈øo called, which is more than our opponents have ever been able to do, for epi≈øcopal ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though often reque≈øted ≈øo to do.</p>
               <p>'TIS true,
<q>the promi≈øcuous u≈øe of the words, bi≈øhop and pre≈øbyter in ≈øcripture</q> is one of our arguments, and, we think, a good one. For if the≈øe names were applied in common to all go≈øpel mini≈øters at that time; if every ≈øcripture pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was really a bi≈øhop then, we ≈øee no rea≈øon why it ≈øhould be otherwi≈øe now. At lea≈øt the in≈øtance he brings to convince us of our mi≈øtake; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that though bi≈øhop and pre≈øbyter were one office in the apo≈øtles times, yet they <hi>ought</hi> not to be ≈øo now; does not ≈øeem ≈øo happily cho≈øen to prove the point, though it ≈øerves well enough, to ≈øhew how the alteration was introduced into the chri≈øtian church, the motives leading to it, and the means u≈øed to accompli≈øh it.</p>
               <p>THE in≈øtance he produces is this.‚Äî<q>They might, ≈øays he, with ju≈øt the ≈øame rea≈øon, argue and conclude, that Pompey and Augu≈øtus were of the ≈øame office, becau≈øe they were both call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>imperatores;</hi> when all the world knows, that within 50 years, (as the ca≈øe hath often been with other words) a different ≈øet of ideas was
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031609_0010_0FED5A9F1D2BAAA8"/>annexed to that word from what it meant 50 years before: Which was plainly the ca≈øe, with the word, bi≈øhop, when the church came to be ≈øettled, &amp;c.</q> The truth of the fact he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to the Roman ≈øtate. I readily allow,‚Äî nor will I di≈øpute the propriety of the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It has indeed, in this in≈øtance, (as he ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ob≈øerves) fared with the chri≈øtian church, much as it did with the ancient Roman common-wealth. While Rome was free, and retained her happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican form of government; the term, <hi>impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> meant only an officer in the army, of equal authority with his brother officers of the ≈øame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. But when Julias Cae≈øar, that grand u≈øurper, not content with the original honours and powers of his office, as general; but fired with unbounded thir≈øt of dominion, found means to de≈øtroy the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient form of government, and en≈ølave his country; then he appropriated the title to him≈øelf and ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øors, and ≈øo the word, <hi>imperator,</hi> in proce≈øs of time, came to ≈øignify, one of ≈øupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>hers, both in the army and ≈øtate.</p>
               <p>AND has it not happened, even ≈øo, with the word, <hi>bi≈øhop,</hi> in the chri≈øtian church?

NOTHING of con≈øequence occurs in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of this letter, but what we ≈øhall meet with in the piece it accompanies, and which will be there con≈øidered. He indeed tells us
<q>they maintain</q> the ancient government of the church "was epi≈øcopal;" that Timothy was an in≈øtance of it at Ephe≈øus, and the apocalyptic angel anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp;c. &amp;c. To which he finally adds, the te≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the fathers, who, if we may believe him, were all upon their ≈øide of the que≈øtion: And then ≈øays;‚Äî<q>They, (the fathers) mu≈øt have as well known the form, in which the apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, under divine in≈øpiration, e≈øtabli≈øhed and left the church; as we now know how ours was, in Q. Elizabeth's time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>An≈øwer.</p>
               <p>IT is not true in fact, that the≈øe ancient fathers, had ≈øuch perfect knowledge of the original in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the church, or that their writings in this ca≈øe are ≈øo certainly to be depended upon, as his argument ≈øuppo≈øes. If their writings are a ≈øure guide for us in one ca≈øe, they are in another. But 'tis well known the≈øe ≈øame fathers maintained the doctrine of the millennium, and practi≈øed giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øacrament to infants; and moreover de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they received the≈øe things from the apo≈øtles them≈øelves. This they a≈ø≈øert as fully, as they do the doctrine this gentleman cites them to prove. And yet his church, and all others, for many hundred years, reject the te≈øtimony of the fathers in the afore≈øaid in≈øtances, as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the word of God. But further, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his a≈ø≈øertion to be true,
<q>that the≈øe writers knew as well what form of government prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the apo≈øtles times, as we do, what was the e≈øtabli≈øhment of the church of England in Q. Elizabeth's time;</q> yet this will not prove that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oce≈øan epi≈øcopacy is of divine right. This gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and other zealots of his party, a≈ø≈øert, that epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy 
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031609_0011_0FED5AD67103E1D0"/>in England, at the time of the reformation, was ≈øettled upon the foot of divine in≈øtitution.‚Äî Others, not only pre≈øbyterians, but many eminent and learned epi≈øcopalians, affirm the contrary:‚Äî They deny it has any pretence of divine right in its original e≈øtabli≈øhment, but re≈øts wholly upon the civil authority and acts of parliament, for its exi≈øtence in its pre≈øent form. Now both of the≈øe opinions can't be true. If then we can't, at this day, certainly know, upon what footing the church of England ≈øtood in the reign of Q. Elizabeth; we certainly cannot know from the writings of the≈øe fathers, what was the apo≈øtolic in≈øtitution of the church, even allowing that they knew it, as well as we do, what was e≈øtabli≈øhed by Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and her parliament: For, it ≈øeems, we are far from being agreed in that, and therefore don't certainly know it.‚ÄîBut what ≈øpoils the whole of this argument for epi≈øcopacy, is that it takes for granted a fact which is not true.
<q>The fathers te≈øtify in favour of dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of divine in≈øtitution.</q> I deny the fact. It is ≈øo far from being true, that any of the fathers of the two fir≈øt centuries, declare in favour of dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy, much le≈øs that this was the form of church government handed down to them from the apo≈øtles; that, on the contrary, their writings unanimou≈øly exhibit to view a form, diametrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppo≈øite to and ab≈øolutely de≈øtructive of, the pre≈øent dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy, that prevails in the church of England. This I propo≈øe to prove in its proper place, to which I refer the reader.</p>
               <p>HE goes on; <q>This was always <hi>my way</hi> of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.</q> An≈øwer.

HE adds,
<q>ju≈øt in the ≈øame way do our di≈ø≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neighbours, with us, very rightly argue the cau≈øe of infant bapti≈øm, and the fir≈øt day ≈øab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; only they have not near ≈øo many clear, inconte≈øtible facts, either of ≈øcripture or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, for them, as we have for epi≈øcopacy; ≈øo that they mu≈øt either give up <hi>them,</hi> or embrace <hi>that,</hi> or be ≈øelf-condemned, as incon≈øi≈øtent with them≈øelves.</q>‚ÄîI an≈øwer. There is, at lea≈øt in our opinion, much better evidence, both from ≈øcripture and antiquity, in ≈øupport of infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øm, and the fir≈øt day ≈øabbath; than for dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy. But if there were not, there is this material difference between us and them. They, from ≈øcripture and antiquity, are convinced, as they tell us, that dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy is of divine in≈øtitution, and therefore practice it. But then they virtually exclude all other chri≈øtians, from the benefits of the go≈øpel, by denying the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their clergy, and the validity of their admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtrations, and leaving them in the deplorable ≈øtate of heathen and infidels.‚ÄîWe, on the other hand, from the ≈øame te≈øtimonies, believe infant bapti≈øm, and the fir≈øt day ≈øabbath. We accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly practice them. But then,
<q>we have not ≈øo learned Chri≈øt,</q> as to think it our duty, either by our principles or practice, to unchurch and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri≈øtianize all who differ from us in the≈øe points: But, if they are otherwi≈øe qualified, cheerfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their mini≈øters into our pulpits, and their members to communion, in go≈øpel ordinances.‚Äî We are content to enjoy our principles, without taking upon us to damn all who differ from us.‚Äî Upon the whole then, we don't find our≈øelves greatly embarra≈ø≈øed with this powerful <hi>dilemma,</hi> in which he means to entangle us, in order to draw us over to the church. We really think, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding all he has ≈øaid, we may ≈øafely retain

               <p>HIS letter concludes with the≈øe words.‚Äî<q>Let us then faithfully adhere to the doctrine, gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and liturgy OF THE MOST EXCELLENT CHURCH OF ENGLAND, WHICH CERTAINLY ARE, AND HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE, THE MOST SCRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURAL, OF ANY NOW IN THE WORLD.</q>‚ÄîA high encomium! and if ju≈øt, abundantly ≈øufficient to recommend his beloved epi≈øcopacy to the good graces of all mankind.

               <p>MR. L. charges me with a mi≈øtake, in calling Mark an apo≈øtle
<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">P. 30.</note>. My words are,

A mi≈øtake how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I confe≈øs it was, and thank him for pointing it out. I ≈øhall now do him the ≈øame friendly office, in pointing out a few of his; ≈øome of which greatly affect the ≈øubject he is upon. The fir≈øt I ≈øhall notice is a general one that runs thro' his piece, as well as the letter prefixed to it; I mean, his calling tho≈øe of our communion in this country, <hi>di≈ø≈øenters.</hi> 'Tis pity, I think, the≈øe gentlemen don't con≈øider where they live, before they give them≈øelves ≈øuch airs. Not that I imagine there is any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful in the name, when properly applied, though doubtle≈øs this is their meaning. <hi>Di≈ø≈øenter</hi> is one, who differs from the e≈øtabli≈øhed religion of the country where he lives. I mu≈øt therefore
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031609_0013_0FED5A7D8BF4CE68"/>inform him, if he don't know it, that the term is merely <hi>topical.</hi> That in England, for in≈øtance, the ≈øame per≈øon who is a member of the e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed church there, con≈øequently no <hi>di≈ø≈øenter;</hi> let him but only pa≈øs the Tweed into Scotland, or cro≈øs the Atlantic, and fix in New-England, and he commences a very <hi>di≈ø≈øenter</hi> as any in Chri≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The rea≈øon is, in the former country, the epi≈øcopal per≈øua≈øion, in the latter, the pre≈øbyterian or congregational, is the religion by law e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This mi≈øtake, I do not pretend, greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the point in di≈øpute. It may tend however to give people's minds a wrong bias. At lea≈øt it is always be≈øt to call things by their proper names. And as Mr. L. as well as I, is a young writer, it may be a kindne≈øs to him ju≈øt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, that however weak and deficient his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, his readers will at lea≈øt expect of him propriety in point of diction.</p>
               <p>IN page 37, he is chargeable with another mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and that too expre≈ø≈øed in a manner, hardly con≈øi≈øtent with the character of a polite gentleman, upon which, 'tis ≈øaid, he pretty much values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf.‚ÄîWhat I intend is, his charging me with downright fal≈øehood and di≈øhone≈øty for a certain pa≈ø≈øage in my book.

<q>Mr. Welles, in P. 27, has the≈øe remarkable words. By bi≈øhops, they, (the church) mean, I hope, true ≈øcripture bi≈øhops, not merely creatures of the ≈øtate, of human in≈øtitution!</q> On which he very <hi>genteelly</hi> remarks.
<q>I mu≈øt be ≈øo free as to tell him, he did not hope any ≈øuch thing, ≈øo he <hi>knew</hi> the contrary to be true.</q> What he could find in the≈øe harmle≈øs expre≈ø≈øions to awaken his ire, (for he certainly was angry) or what induced him to cite them, and pa≈øs ≈øuch illiberal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious reflections upon them; I confe≈øs my≈øelf

                     <p>Of the ≈øame opinion were Dr. Edwards, and their celebrated Hooker. The former of which, delivers his own and Mr. Hooker's ≈øentiments, in the≈øe words,
<q>The judicious Mr. Hooker holds, that epi≈øcopacy may be abrogated; con≈øequently it is not of <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>apo≈øtolic</hi> right, but the <hi>political in≈øtitution</hi> of the church.</q>‚ÄîEdw. remains, 257.</p>

<q>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øhops, bi≈øhops, archdeacons, and other eccle≈øia≈øtical officers, have no manner of juri≈ødiction <hi>eccle≈øia≈øtical,</hi> but by, under and from his royal maje≈øty,‚Äî<hi>the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head</hi> of the church of England and Ireland, to whom, by holy ≈øcripture, all authority and power is wholly given, to hear and determine, all manner of cau≈øes <hi>eccle≈øia≈øtical.</hi>

                     <p>The ≈øame is declared in an act of parliament, made 1 Edw. VI. cap. 2.

But this gentleman plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells me it is no ≈øuch thing. Since therefore he mu≈øt be ≈øuppo≈øed to know be≈øt, and will needs have it ≈øo; I will grant I was mi≈øtaken, as to him in particular; though as to others of his party, he mu≈øt allow me to entertain the ≈øame charitable opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ≈øtill; at lea≈øt till they give me the ≈øame rea≈øon to alter it, as he has done in his ca≈øe. If this is not his meaning in <hi>the≈øe remarkable</hi> words of his; 'tis indeed difficult to ≈øay, what his meaning is.‚Äî They ≈øeem to have no meaning at all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (to u≈øe another of his courtly phra≈øes)
<q>they might have been left out, and his defence would have been as good as it is now.</q>

               <p>MR. L. ≈øeems to be di≈øplea≈øed with the <hi>length</hi> of my ≈øermon. In page 30 he has the≈øe words,
<q>Tho' he (Mr. Welle's) <hi>fleers</hi> about our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deacons; yet I believe it is really true, that Stephen preached as good a ≈øermon as Mr. Welle's <hi>divine right,</hi> &amp;c. though it was not ≈øo long.</q> I have examined the pa≈ø≈øage, to which he refers in this remark, but can find nothing that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031609_0015_0FED5AA694780938"/>looks like a <hi>fleer</hi> there. After giving an account of the in≈øtitution of deacons, Acts 6, beginning, and an≈øwering the arguments they bring for their preaching; I have the≈øe words,
<q>Since therefore it plainly appears, that the≈øe deacons, were in no ≈øen≈øe, go≈øpel mini≈øters, but expre≈ø≈øly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ≈øet apart to quite another ≈øervice; it undeniably follows that no order in the chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian mini≈øtry can be founded upon this in≈øtance; and con≈øequently, that their pretended order of preaching deacons, has no warrant‚Äîfrom the word of God.</q> Now what is there in the≈øe words, that looks like a <hi>fleer?</hi> It is true, I deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>preaching</hi> was any part of the ≈øcripture dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con's office; and if after I had proved it was not, I called it, a <hi>pretended order,</hi> &amp;c. I can ≈øee noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing criminal in it, nothing that looks like <hi>fleering.</hi> The order of preaching deacons in the church of England, is either a <hi>real</hi> and ≈øcriptural, or a <hi>pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and un≈øcriptural one. The former he knows we deny. He knows it was the very thing I was then di≈øproving; and if, when I had, as I thought, ≈øufficiently di≈øproved it, I called it a <hi>pretended</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I can ≈øee no rea≈øon he had to be offended. I hope he would not have me call it a <hi>real ≈øcriptural</hi> order of the mini≈øtry, when I did not believe it to be ≈øo, and had proved it not to be ≈øo.‚ÄîBut
<q>he believes it is really true, that Stephen preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as good a ≈øermon as mine, tho' it was not ≈øo long.</q> Po≈ø≈øibly he does; tho' why he believes it, he has not told us. Sure I am, the ≈øcripture, to which he ≈øo often appeals, furni≈øhes no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it. That indeed gives a lengthy account of this <hi>protomartyr,</hi> but ≈øays not a word about his <hi>preaching</hi> as I can find. 'Tis true it ≈øpeaks of his <hi>di≈øputing;</hi> but then Mr. L. I pre≈øume, will not pretend that all <hi>di≈øputing</hi> is <hi>preaching.</hi> He has <hi>di≈øputed</hi> again≈øt my ≈øermon; but he has not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly told us, he ever <hi>preached</hi> again≈øt it, tho' oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031609_0016_0FED5AC455E57BE8"/>≈øay he did at ≈øundry places and times. Wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er his <hi>≈øermon,</hi> upon the≈øe occa≈øions, was <hi>langer</hi> or <hi>≈øherter,</hi> whether it was <hi>better</hi> or wor≈øe than mine, as it is of little importance, I am not anxious to know. Be that as it will, I do not ≈øee what great rea≈øon <hi>he</hi> had to complain of the <hi>length</hi> of my ≈øermon; ≈øince long as it is, it has given him ≈øo little trouble. For all he profe≈ø≈øedly attempts to an≈øwer of it, is only my fir≈øt argument, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compri≈øed in little more than two pages, could not, one would think, give him any great pain.‚Äî Whether it was the <hi>length,</hi> or the <hi>≈øtrength</hi> of the other arguments, that di≈øcouraged him from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with them; as he has not ≈øeen fit to tell us, every one mu≈øt be left to conjecture for him≈øelf.</p>
               <p>THE pieces Mr. L. attempts to an≈øwer, had <hi>occa≈øionally</hi> mentioned "the right of people to choo≈øe their mini≈øters." This he has repeatedly remarked upon, tho' not directly connected with the main point; while ≈øundry arguments that were, are pa≈ø≈øed by unnoticed. What could be his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for this, is difficult to gue≈øs. Perhaps he tho't ≈øo long as people were left to claim and prize this invaluable privilege; all he could ≈øay upon his <hi>divine-right</hi> and <hi>be≈øt con≈øtituted-church,</hi> would be in≈øufficient to draw them away from a communion, where this priviledge is enjoyed, to one where it is utterly denied. He attacks Dr. Chauncy upon this head, and ≈øpends near two pages in endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to di≈øprove it; and, as if that was too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he falls upon it again in his remarks upon me. He demands of the Dr.
<q>Where we find in ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this to be declared a part of chri≈øtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</q> &amp;c. I pre≈øume, ≈øcripture pattern will ≈øatisfy for proof of this point, ≈øince it is all they <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> to bring for epi≈øcopacy, and much more than they are able to produce. And of this kind of proof there is plenty in ≈øcripture. From the go≈øpel hi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory it appears, that this was the univer≈øal prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

<q>author of the inquiry into the con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, &amp;c. of the primitive church,</q> ≈øuppo≈øed to be Sr. Peter King, afterwards lord chancellor, abundantly proves, from numerous te≈øtimonies, that this was the univer≈øal practice of the primitive church, for people to choo≈øe their own mini≈øters. And indeed, the contrary practice is ≈øo repugnant to rea≈øon, to all notions of liberty, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal cu≈øtom in all other ca≈øes, that, one would think, nothing but the highe≈øt degree of prejudice could reconcile people to it.

<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">P. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>How far Mr. L.
<q>has been able to under≈øtand this matter,</q> he mu≈øt know be≈øt. The <hi>defect of</hi> his under≈øtanding, it is not in my power to help. Whether it was for want of <hi>under≈øtanding</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> certain, I am, the account he gives of this affair is not true. According to the law of this colony, (and I ≈øuppo≈øe the ca≈øe is much the ≈øame in the re≈øt of New-England, where there is an eccle≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øtical e≈øtabli≈øhment) the right of choo≈øing a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øter, is declared to be, not in the heads of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies exclu≈øively; but in them and the members of the church, whether heads of families or not. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, this right is not founded, as he ≈øuppo≈øes, in the law of the colony, any more than the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any divine law, adopted by the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate. The <hi>obligation</hi> in one ca≈øe, and the <hi>right</hi> in the other, is founded in ≈øcripture. The civil law only recognizes the right, and protects peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the enjoyment and exerci≈øe of it. And all men acquainted with our eccle≈øia≈øtical con≈øtitution, know that we are ≈øo far from having any thing to do, with what he calls
<q>patrons, in each pari≈øh,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031609_0018_0FED5ADD37B85FB0"/>to choo≈øe the mini≈øter;</q> that mo≈øt people know nothing of the term, or what it ≈øignifies, and I hope, by experience, never may. The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, and all others of our people, who vote in ≈øociety-meetings for other purpo≈øes, have all free liberty to vote in the choice of a mini≈øter. And that they may act with di≈øcretion in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affair; they have opportunity to make tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the candidate while he is upon probation.‚Äî Was it then hone≈øt in Mr. L. to ≈øay,
<q>In the ≈øame way ≈øocieties, corporations and particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, become <hi>patrons</hi> in the church of England?</q> In that church, <hi>patrons,</hi> clerical or ≈øecular, choo≈øe the mini≈øters for the people. In ours, he is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen by the church and people them≈øelves. In the former the bi≈øhop, or ≈øome lay patron, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never ≈øaw the candidate, and is never to fit under his mini≈øtry, has the ≈øole power of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In the latter, he is elected by the votes of tho≈øe who have made trial of him, are to maintain him, and attend upon his admini≈øtrations. In our method, the law acknowledges the natural and ≈øcriptural right of the people in this important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and protects them in the enjoyment of it. But in theirs, in defiance of both, their mini≈øter <hi>is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded</hi> upon them without their con≈øent. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this view of the ca≈øe,
<q>that good gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, (as Mr. L. calls the Dr.) ≈øhould real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think their church, ≈øomewhat culpable in the matter of <hi>patrons;</hi>
                  </q> few people, I pre≈øume, "would greatly wonder at it," ≈øave he and tho≈øe of his party; and if, as he ≈øays,
<q>their church appears to him to ≈øtand clear of all blame in that matter;</q> it mu≈øt be owing, I think, to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and partiality in a very high degree.</p>
               <p>I FIND but one thing more, in Mr. L's book, proper for this ≈øection. And that is, the <hi>uncommon</hi> adverti≈øement tacked to the end of it. I have read it over ≈øundry times, but can't be certain I have
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031609_0018_0FED5ADD37B85FB0"/>hit upon his meaning after all. He talks much about <hi>con≈øequences;</hi> cautions his an≈øwerer again≈øt "falling upon <hi>con≈øequences,</hi>" and declares that he "has no concern with <hi>con≈øequences.</hi>" What he intends by them, is difficult to ≈øay. A <hi>con≈øequence</hi> in logic, is an e≈ø≈øential part of every good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But he can't mean this by his con≈øequences: For whatever they be, he places them in oppo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>arguments,</hi> for want of which, in confuting his book, they are ≈øuppo≈øed to be "fallen upon." And yet this or ≈øomething like it, mu≈øt be his meaning too; for he warns his antagoni≈øt again≈øt "flying from the ≈øubject," or what he has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in "his book" and "falling upon the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences.</hi>" But if this be his meaning, he need give him≈øelf no trouble in the ca≈øe, provided he has only been careful, "to advance" nothing but truth: For truth is ever con≈øi≈øtent with it≈øelf; and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but truth will follow from it, or be the <hi>con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of it, and this can do him no hurt.

               <p>I FULLY agree with our author;
<q>That it nearly concerns us to know who are the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mini≈øters in Chri≈øt's kingdom.</q> And am well plea≈øed with the method he has propo≈øed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this point, viz. "by an appeal to ≈øcripture and rea≈øon."
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>IN the mean time, let us attend to the ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations he thinks proper to make, previous to his entering upon this deci≈øion. His fir≈øt ob≈øervation is this,
<q>The whole body of di≈ø≈øenters, (pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians he means) affirm, that bi≈øhop and pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, in ≈øcripture, ≈øignify the ≈øame office: Yet they ≈øay, no in≈øtance is to be found there of an ordination, by any per≈øon unde, the name <hi>bi≈øhop:</hi> And if a pre≈øbyter is the ≈øame office, then there is none by a pre≈øbyter.</q>
                  <note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">ibid.</note> But now, who does not ≈øee the fallacy of this argument? He allows, with us, that bi≈øhop and pre≈øbyter in ≈øcripture, ≈øignify the ≈øame office; that mini≈øters were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øcuou≈øly called by both the≈øe names, in go≈øpel times. But then he holds, that the bu≈øine≈øs of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, &amp;c. ought not to lie in common, to all go≈øpel-mini≈øters; but to be confined to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar order, which in their church, are called bi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops. We, on the contrary affirm, that as bi≈øhop and pre≈øbyter, in ≈øcripture, ≈øignify the ≈øame office; the power of ordination belongs in common to all mini≈øters, and therefore ought not to be confined
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031609_0020_0FED5A804C69EAE0"/>to ≈øome few, under the title of bi≈øhops. To prove this, we ob≈øerve, that though we have ≈øundry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of ordination, in ≈øcripture, performed by mini≈øters, yet there is no ≈øingle in≈øtance of one ≈øo performed by them, under the name <hi>bi≈øhop,</hi> and yet to this, epi≈øcopalians appropriate the whole power of ordination. But Mr. L. ≈øays, if this be true, that there is no account in ≈øcripture of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion performed by any per≈øon under the name bi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op, then it will follow,‚ÄîWhat? Why "that there is none by a pre≈øbyter," that is, no in≈øtance of one performed by a pre≈øbyter. But does it at all follow, that becau≈øe the ≈øcripture mentions no ordination as performed by mini≈øters under their one title of bi≈øhops, therefore there is no in≈øtance to be found there of their ordaining under their other title, that of pre≈øbyters? Or thus, becau≈øe the ≈øcripture never calls mini≈øters by one of their common names, i. e. bi≈øhops, when acting in ordination; is it a nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence that it never calls them by their other common name, pre≈øbyters, when act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that bu≈øine≈øs? Is it not po≈ø≈øible that the ≈øame office in ≈øcripture, may be commonly denominated and known by either of the names, bi≈øhop or pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter indifferently, and yet only one of the≈øe names, con≈øtantly u≈øed and applied to him, when acting in the bu≈øine≈øs of ordination? But now this is what his argument proves, or el≈øe it proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The truth is, he has, either ignorantly or de≈øignedly, altered the terms in his ≈øyllogi≈øm, ≈øo that his conclu≈øion contains more in it than his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, which all logicians call, fal≈øe rea≈øoning.‚Äî His argument reduced to mode and figure, runs thus, <q>Bi≈øhop and pre≈øbyter in ≈øcripture ≈øignify the ≈øame office. No in≈øtance is to be found there of ordination by any per≈øon under the name of bi≈øhop.</q> This is his major and minor propo≈øition. His conclu≈øion is,‚Äî<q>Therefore there is no in≈øtance of an ordination performed
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031609_0021_0FED5A9422AB5DC0"/>by a pre≈øbyter.</q> Whereas, had he kept to the terms in his minor propo≈øition, his conclu≈øion mu≈øt have been,‚Äî"Therefore there is no in≈øtance of an ordination performed <hi>by any per≈øon under the name pre≈øbyter.</hi>" Had he done this, his readers would at once have ≈øeen the weakne≈øs and fallacy of his argument.</p>
               <p>IN England, bi≈øhop, and lord-≈øpiritual are ≈øy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous terms. Now ≈øhould I undertake to prove, that there is no account in the Engli≈øh hi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, of an ordination performed by a bi≈øhop, and in order to it, make u≈øe of this argument,‚ÄîBi≈øhop and lord-≈øpiritual ≈øignify the ≈øame office: But there is no account in hi≈øtory, of an ordination perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any per≈øon under the title of lord-≈øpiritual; therefore there is no account of one performed by a bi≈øhop; and from hence ≈øhould infer, the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of epi≈øcopal ordination; Mr. L. I pre≈øume would hardly allow the argument to be good.‚Äî And yet it is the ≈øame he has u≈øed in this ca≈øe, and full as conclu≈øive. However, weak as it is, it ≈øeems it wrought full conviction in his mind: For he tells us
<q>he is fully per≈øuaded, at that time in which the ≈øcriptures were wrote, none had power to ordain mini≈øters in Chri≈øt's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but tho≈øe only who <hi>in ≈øcripture,</hi> are called <hi>apo≈øtles.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Page 9.</note> But then what becomes of bi≈øhop Timothy? Mr. L. has ≈øpent a con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of his book in attempting to prove, the divine right of epi≈øcopacy, from the in≈øtance of Timothy bi≈øhop of Ephe≈øus. Yea it is the mo≈øt plau≈øible argument, and indeed the only thing in his piece that de≈øerves the name of an argument. But if
<q>none had power to ordain mini≈øters in Chri≈øt's kingdom, but tho≈øe only, who are <hi>in ≈øcripture</hi> called <hi>apo≈øtles,</hi>

Tho' therefore I might now fairly di≈ømi≈øs the controver≈øy, as decided in our ≈øavour by his own confe≈ø≈øion: Yet not to take advantage of this incon≈øi≈øtency of his, I ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider the argument when I come to it. In the mean time I intirely agree with him in what follows in this paragraph:
<q>That the bi≈øhops in the church of England, do not an≈øwer, to tho≈øe that are promi≈øcuou≈øly called, either bi≈øhops or pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in ≈øcripture.</q> I add, neither do they, to any order in≈øtituted in ≈øcripture. Dioce≈øan bi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, ≈øuch as obtain in that church, are ≈øo far from being of divine in≈øtitution, that they are doubtle≈øs <hi>mere creatures of the ≈øtate,</hi> what the go≈øpel knows nothing of.</p>
               <p>AND ≈øo I am ready to attend upon his next ob≈øervation, which is this,
<q>That di≈ø≈øenters (pre≈øbyterians he ≈øhould have ≈øaid) are not agreed among them≈øelves about the orders of the mini≈øtry,‚Äî≈øome holding to one order, oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to two, and others again to three, &amp;c.</q>
                  <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Page 9.</note> But what then? ≈øhall we mend the matter, in point of unity, or in the lea≈øt better our≈øelves, by going over to the church of England? By no means. Epi≈øcopalians are really as much divided in ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this re≈øpect, as tho≈øe he calls <hi>di≈ø≈øenters.</hi>‚Äî Thus ≈øome of them ab≈øolutely deny that any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular form of government or order, is e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ≈øcripture, but the whole is left to the civil magi≈øtrate.

                  </note> This has always been the opinion of the more moderate epi≈øcopalians in England; and therefore tho' they conform to the church of England, they do it, not as being of divine in≈øtitution, but as e≈øtabli≈øhed by the king and parliament. And others, with Mr. L. and his flighty brethren, a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øert the three orders of bi≈øhops, prie≈øts and deacons, as of divine appointment: The≈øe plead the ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute nece≈ø≈øity of epi≈øcopal ordination, and reject all the prote≈øtant world who are without it. I might add, that there have been other advocates for prelacy, who have pleaded, with equal zeal, for the ≈øeveral orders of acolyths, lectors, ≈øubdeacons, archdeacons, chirocpi≈øcopi, archbi≈øhops, patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and the Roman hierarchicks, for the pope, as Peter's ≈øucce≈ø≈øor, at the head of all.‚Äî<q>We may ≈øee then, (to u≈øe his own phra≈øe) the que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under debate, cannot be decided by the≈øe men; for they are not agreed among them≈øelves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT how does he prove "that di≈ø≈øenters are not agreed" in this point? Why he tells us, "≈øome never ordain their deacons," and the≈øe of cour≈øe
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031609_0022_0FED5AC6082DAC78"/>"hold, that Chri≈øt has appointed but one order, pre≈øbyters." But how does this follow? He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf ≈øuppo≈øes the bi≈øhop is a different order in their church, and appointed by Chri≈øt. And yet, as far as I can learn, he has properly no new ordination when appointed bi≈øhop, but only what they call a con≈øecration to the epi≈øcopal office. Though therefore ≈øome of our churches ≈øuppo≈øe, that ≈øince the civil magi≈øtrate now takes care of the poor, which, in times of per≈øecution, was the deacon's bu≈øine≈øs, there is no nece≈ø≈øity of a formal ordination to that office; it will by no means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a denial of his being an officer in the church, of diviner appointment. We all, I pre≈øume, are agreed that the deacon is an officer of divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, (though not in≈øtituted by Chri≈øt, as Mr. L. has it, but by his apo≈øtles:) And that, whether we ordain him or not. He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quite mi≈øtaken in affirming, that we hold to but one order of officers as of divine appointment.</p>
               <p>BUT then if ≈øome <hi>di≈ø≈øenters</hi> hold to but one, and others to two, there are others again, he tells us, "that hold to three orders of mini≈øters in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chri≈øt." And for this he quotes Mr. Calvin. But how came Calvin, pray, to be a <hi>di≈ø≈øenter?</hi> He was indeed a <hi>di≈ø≈øenter</hi> from the church of Rome: And (I hope) ≈øo is Mr. L. too. But from the church of England he never was a <hi>di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> for he never belonged to it. Our epi≈øcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, indeed, warmly contended, in years pa≈øt, that the church of England e≈øtabli≈øhment extends to America, and con≈øequently that all who refu≈øe to conform to it, are <hi>di≈ø≈øenters.</hi> But the highe≈øt ≈øticklers for uniformity among them, never, that I know of, pretended to carry the claim to <hi>Geneva,</hi> before Mr. L. It ≈øeems his head is ≈øo turned again≈øt <hi>di≈ø≈øenters,</hi> ≈øince he has renounced our communion, and become a prelate≈øt, that he is ready to fa≈øten the opprobrious character, upon every one, who happens to differ from him. Be≈øides, according
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031609_0023_0FED5AB7C97FCEF8"/>to him, Calvin was no di≈ø≈øenters; for he held to the three orders of "bi≈øhops, pre≈øbyters, and deacons." I have examined the place in Calvin's in≈øtitutions, from whence Mr. L. pretends to make his quotation, and boldly affirm there are no ≈øuch words there. The ≈øentence truly quoted, is this,
<q>As we have declared that there are three ≈øorts of mini≈øters commended unto us in ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ≈øo all the mini≈øters that the old church had, is divided into three orders.</q> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; not
<q>
                     <hi>bi≈øhops, pre≈øbyters</hi> and <hi>deacons,</hi> as add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our author; But the≈øe words: For out of the order of elders, were partly cho≈øen <hi>pa≈øtors and teachers;</hi> the re≈øt of them had the rule of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and correction of manners. To the <hi>deacons</hi> was committed the care of the poor, and the di≈øtributing the alms.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Calv. in≈øt. lib. 4. C. 4. ≈øec. 1.</note> This plainly ≈øhews what Calvin's judgment was: That be≈øides pa≈øtors and deacons, there was the office of rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elders, as practi≈øed in the church of Scotland. But now what is this to bi≈øhops, pre≈øbyters and deacons, as quoted by Mr. L.? This is not the only time, he has u≈øed the freedom with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors he pretends to quote, of making them ≈øpeak what they never intended.</p>

               <p>BEFORE I enter upon a vindication of the Dr's ≈øermon, from the exceptions of another, it concerns me to do him ju≈øtice, in one particular, in which I have, inadvertently, mi≈ørepre≈øented him my≈øelf.</p>
               <p>IN page 67 of my ≈øermon, I had the≈øe words;
<q>And although the above learned writer, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dr.) excepts Ignatius out of the number of the primitive writers in his account, and owns, that the epi≈øtles a≈øcribed to him, <hi>≈øpeak very fully in favour of dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy,</hi>
                  </q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>WHEN I wrote this ≈øentence, I had my mind upon what the Dr. ≈øays, in p. 71 of his ≈øermon: But upon reviewing the pa≈ø≈øage, I find, I mi≈øtook his meaning. His words are not
<q>that tho≈øe epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ≈øpeak very fully in favour of dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy:</q> But
<q>that they do, as certainly, as ≈øtrongly, and as con≈øtantly, <hi>di≈øtingui≈øh bi≈øhops from pre≈øbyters,</hi> as any of the writings of the third and fourth centuries.</q> Now all that the Dr. a≈ø≈øerts is, that the≈øe epi≈øtles <hi>point out a di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of order between bi≈øhop and pre≈øbyter:</hi> And upon reading what Mr. Boy≈øe has wrote, in his "clear account of the ancient epi≈øcopacy," in which he has every thing contained in the≈øe epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, relative to the ≈øubject; I am fully convinced, that the bi≈øhop de≈øcribed in the≈øe epi≈øtles, even in the pre≈øent ≈øtate of them, is very different from

               <p>As a direct proof of ordination by pre≈øbyters, the Dr. had mentioned, the in≈øtance of Saul and Barnabas being ≈øeparated to the work of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtry, by certain prophets and teachers, as record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Acts xiii. beginning. As this is ≈øo very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs and circum≈øtantial an account, of a ≈øeparation to the work of the mini≈øtry; as all the ≈øolemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, contained in ordination, are here ≈øo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly mentioned; and as this is ≈øaid to be done, not by apo≈øtles or bi≈øhops, but by the ordinary pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the church, here called prophets and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; Mr. L. ≈øeems to be at a lo≈øs what reply to make to it. He, at fir≈øt, ≈øeems to be doubtful as to the nature of this action; at a lo≈øs what name to give it. "If, ≈øays he, this was an ordination:" "If this was a <hi>real</hi> ordination, then," &amp;c. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he denies it to be an ordination.
<q>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is meant, ≈øays he, by this de≈øignation, it was not an ordination.</q>
                  <q>In truth this was not an ordination.</q>
                  <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">P. 11.</note> He found him≈øelf ≈øo pre≈ø≈øed with this in≈øtance, that he had no way to get rid of the argument, but by flatly denying it to be an ordination. And indeed, this was the only cour≈øe he could take to ≈øupport his ≈øcheme. For if this be once granted to be a real ordination, the indi≈øputable right of pre≈øbyters, to act in this bu≈øine≈øs, is firmly e≈øtabli≈øhed, and all pretences of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031609_0025_0FED5A856FD06310"/>confining it to a ≈øuperior order, mu≈øt be given up. I ≈øhall therefore offer a few ob≈øervations, to prove that this was, in fact, an ordination; and then make ≈øome remarks upon Mr. L.'s objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt its being con≈øidered as ≈øuch.</p>
               <p>Now by ordination, I conclude, is meant, a ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ≈øeperation, or ≈øetting apart to an office in the church, by ≈øuch as have authority to do it, and that, in the u≈øe of tho≈øe rites or actions, the ≈øcripture has appointed in this ca≈øe. The ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rites of ordination, are fa≈øting, prayer, and the impo≈øition of hands. In this way the ≈øeven deacons were introduced into office,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts vi. 6.</note> which Mr. L. owns to be an ordination. In the ≈øame way Timothy was ordained.
<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">1 Tim. iv. 14.</note> And in the ≈øame way he is directed to ordain others.
<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">1 Tim. v. 22.</note> And this has been the general method of introducing men into the mini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in all ≈øub≈øequent ages. But now, all the≈øe things concurred in the in≈øtance under con≈øideration. The per≈øons acting in it, were church officers of Antioch, <hi>"prophets and teachers."</hi> What they undertook to do, was to "<hi>≈øeperate</hi> Saul and Barnabas to the work of the mini≈øtry, among the gentiles." This was done by the direction of the holy Gho≈øt;
<q>≈øeperate me Barnabas and Saul to the work, where unto I have called them;</q> that is, to the work of the mini≈øtry, e≈øpecially among the gentiles,
<q>to whom they were now ≈øent.</q> The thing therefore to be done, beyond di≈øpute, was to ≈øeperate the≈øe two men to the work of the go≈øpel mini≈øtry. How this was done, the account informs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>;
<q>For when they had fa≈øted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they ≈øent them away.</q> As every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every circum≈øtance pertaining to an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is here ≈øo very particularly and expre≈ø≈øly found; if after all, this was not an ordination, I di≈øpair of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031609_0026_0FED5A8D54D78688"/>ever finding one, in ≈øcripture or any where el≈øe. And what ≈øtill further confirms the matter, if it needs further confirmation, is, that if I am not much mi≈øtaken, the apo≈øtle Paul him≈øelf acknowledges it to be ≈øo. In his in≈øcription of his epi≈øtle to the Romans, chap. i. 5.1. he has the≈øe words,
<q>Paul a ≈øervant of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, called to be an apo≈øtle, <hi>≈øeperated</hi> to the go≈øpel of God.</q> He here evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently de≈øigns to give him≈øelf, his true and prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er character, of an apo≈øtle, and mini≈øter of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. He therefore particularly mentions, both his <hi>call</hi> to the apo≈øtle≈øhip, and his <hi>≈øeperation</hi> to the go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel mini≈øtry. By the former, he mo≈øt likely means that immediate call from heaven, of which in Acts ix. Then it was he was <hi>called to be an apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> But we find nothing in ≈øcripture an≈øwering to this other part of his character, viz. his <hi>≈øeperation to the go≈øpel of God,</hi> unle≈øs it was this <hi>≈øeperation</hi> we are now con≈øidering. And it is worthy of remark, the word in both places is the ≈øame, both in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and al≈øo in our tran≈ølation. In Acts 13th,
<q>The holy Gho≈øt ≈øaid, APHORISATE, <hi>≈øeperate me Barnabas and Saul to the work whereunto I have called them.</hi>
                  </q> In Rom. i. 1. The apo≈øtle, ≈øays he, "was, APHORISMENOS, <hi>≈øeperated to the go≈øpel of God.</hi>" Does it not appear highly probable, that when the apo≈øtle wrote the≈øe la≈øt mentioned words, he had his mind particularly upon the action we are con≈øidering? I confe≈øs I ≈øee no other ≈øen≈øe in which they can be well interpreted. And if ≈øo, we have the te≈øtimony, even of the apo≈øtle him≈øelf, that this was, in fact, an ordination.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. L. objects,
<q>that if the≈øe proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets and teachers were pre≈øbyters, ≈øo were Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas and Saul. And if this was an ordination, they, who were before pre≈øbyters, were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ≈øuperior office; which, he ≈øays, is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing they contend for.</q> I an≈øwer. Tho' Saul, and po≈ø≈øibly Barnabas too, were in office, as
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031609_0026_0FED5A8D54D78688"/>apo≈øtles; yet there is no account, that either they or indeed any others, had been formally introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into office, as ≈øtanding mini≈øters in the church, by the impo≈øition of hands, till now. They, and the re≈øt of the apo≈øtles, had hitherto, exerci≈øed their mini≈øtry, principally among the Jews. But now, that the go≈øpel was to be ≈øent to the Gentiles, and churches gathered and ≈øettled among them, upon a plan which was to be perpetuated, after the times of in≈øpiration were over, even to the end of the world; it ≈øeemed good to the Holy Gho≈øt, to order, that they ≈øhould be ≈øet apart, by the ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn rite of ordination, as a ≈øtanding pattern for the≈øe future ages. This, as Dr. Chauncy ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was the opinion of a learned epi≈øcopal writer, Dr. Lightfoot.
<q>No better rea≈øon, ≈øays he, can be given of this pre≈øent action; than that the Lord did hereby, ≈øet down a platform of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining mini≈øters, to the church of the Gentiles in former times.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. l. p. 189.</note> This being the ca≈øe, it will by no means follow, that, "if this was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, they were ordained to a ≈øuperior office," as he ≈øuppo≈øes. Tho' they were in office before, they had been only "called to be <hi>apo≈øtles;</hi>" where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now, they were "<hi>≈øeparated</hi> to the go≈øpel of God," by ordination, that ≈øo they might, both have a public authentic character, and exhibit a pattern to be followed, in all ≈øucceeding ages. Had Mr. L's head been le≈øs crowded, with the un≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ideas of <hi>≈øuperiority</hi> and inferiority of orders in the mini≈øtry, he might have recollected, that even <hi>reordination</hi> it≈øelf, does not nece≈ø≈øarily "ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a man to a ≈øuperior office in the church." ‚ÄîHe doubtle≈øs knows ≈øundry of his brethren in America, who have been twice ordained: Once, "by the hands of the pre≈øbytery," according to ≈øcripture pattern, and then again by the bi≈øhop, after they conformed to his church: And yet I
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:031609_0027_0FED5AAE4C28D2D0"/>≈øuppo≈øe, he acknowledges them ≈øtill, as ≈øu≈øtaining no higher office, than that of pre≈øbyters. Tho' according to his argument, he ought, in all rea≈øon, to look upon them as dignitaries in the church;
<q>for who, (to u≈øe his own words) ever heard, that a pre≈øbyter was ordained, unle≈øs it was, to advance him to a higher ≈øtation in the church?</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT

It ≈øeems then, that it was "giving the right hand of fellow≈øhip:" For that is what was done in the in≈øtance to which he compares it. Now giving the right hand of fellow≈øhip, as it is a public declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ≈øign, that the per≈øon to whom it is given, is now received into a co-partner≈øhip of power and office with the givers, mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe that the per≈øons giving, are at lea≈øt, equal in power with him who receives it. Con≈øequently if what was now done, was, as he ≈øays, giving the right hand of fellow≈øhip to Barnabas and Saul, it will follow that the≈øe prophets and teachers were at lea≈øt equal in power to Barnabas and Saul. Since therefore, Mr. L. allows the ordaining power to the latter, it mu≈øt equally belong to the former, whether they did in fact exerci≈øe it at this time or no; and then the validity of ordination by pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters will of cour≈øe follow.</p>
               <p>AGAIN. If the≈øe two actions are, as he ≈øays, both of the ≈øame nature, then it will follow, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> the per≈øons acting in both were of the ≈øame office, or indued with equal power: But tho≈øe who gave the right hand, in Gal. ii. 9. viz. James, Cephas and John, were undoubtedly ve≈øted with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining power, for they were apo≈øtles: Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the prophets and teachers, who acted in the other in≈øtance, mu≈øt be ve≈øted with the ≈øame

               <p>MR. L. has one objection more to this in≈øtance of ordination. It is this,
<q>Whatever is meant by this de≈øignation, it was not ordination to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power Paul,‚Äîfor it is beyond all di≈øpute that Paul and Barnabas officiated as public mini≈øters of Chri≈øt long before this pretended ordination.</q>

                  </gap>d, it was as apo≈øtles, by virtue of their extraordinary call; not as ordinary min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øters, in the gentile church, of ≈øtanding continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by the impo≈øition of hands in ordination. Tho' therefore with re≈øpect to the former, "they were, as he ≈øays, <hi>apo≈øtles, not of men, neither by man;</hi>" yet in the latter ≈øen≈øe, they received their de≈øignation from men, as others now do, by the impo≈øition of hands in a proper ordination. Their "officiating as public mini≈øters before," by virtue of their extraordinary call, no more proves that this was not an ordination; than the eleven apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ≈øo officiating, by virtue of a temporary mi≈ø≈øion from Chri≈øt in his life time, will prove the commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, he gave them after his re≈øurrection, was no commi≈ø≈øion. Mr. L. allows that the commi≈ø≈øion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Mat. xxviii. 19. and John xx. 21, was that which authorized the apo≈øtles to act as min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øters. And yet we know that Chri≈øt ordained the twelve apo≈øtles, and ≈øent them forth to preach, long before he gave them this commi≈ø≈øion.
<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Matt. x. Mark. iii. 14.</note> If therefore the eleven apo≈øtles ≈øo officiating in Chri≈øt's life time, does not prove the commi≈ø≈øion he gave them after his re≈øurrection, to be no commi≈ø≈øion; neither will Barnabas and Saul's ≈øo officiating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, prove that this was no ordination.</p>
               <p>THIS objection indeed the Dr. largely con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and an≈øwered in his ≈øermon. He there ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that though, "Paul and Barnabas were before this, commi≈ø≈øioned mini≈øters of Chri≈øt;" yet this

<q>For the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ordination, is not that the ordainers ≈øhould commi≈ø≈øion per≈øons to do the work of the mini≈øtry. This is done by Chri≈øt.

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031609_0029_0FED5AE5B0FFFDB8"/>then they are no longer Chri≈øt's mini≈øters, but the bi≈øhop's who gave them commi≈ø≈øion, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they ought to preach, baptize, &amp;c. not in the name of Chri≈øt, but of the bi≈øhop, who≈øe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øters they are, and who gave them their authority.</p>
               <p>FURTHER, as Chri≈øt <hi>had all power in heaven and earth,</hi> and ≈øo was under no limitation as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe of this power in <hi>making officers</hi> in his church, but might, if he had ≈øeen fit, multiplied the≈øe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and, in≈øtead of two, appointed twenty, or two hundred different kinds or orders: So from this principle of Mr. L's, it will follow, that not only the apo≈øtles but their ≈øucce≈ø≈øors in office, to whom Chri≈øt has delegated this power of <hi>mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers,</hi> have the ≈øame unlimited authority al≈øo, in this re≈øpect as he had: That they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to any particular number of orders, in the exerci≈øe of this their <hi>office making</hi> power; but may appoint and e≈øtabli≈øh, as many different orders and degrees as they plea≈øe; and in≈øtead of three orders in the church, might have three hundred or three thou≈øand. For Chri≈øt had undoubtedly this power. And indeed this is the ≈øen≈øe of the Romi≈øh church upon this point. The pope, in virtue of his being ≈øucce≈ø≈øor to Peter, is, according to them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infallible, but is ve≈øted with all the plentitude of the power that Chri≈øt had, in this re≈øpect. And it is by this plentitude of power, with which he is ve≈øted, not only that he has con≈øtituted that great variety of orders, found among their clergy; but al≈øo rai≈øed tho≈øe they called bi≈øhops, above pre≈øbyters in the church. According to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of that church, bi≈øhops are ≈øuperior to pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, not by <hi>divine right,</hi> but merely as advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this ≈øuperior dignity by the plentitude of the pope's power.

               <p>THE truth of the ca≈øe is, tho≈øe words, "as my
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031609_0029_0FED5AE5B0FFFDB8"/>father hath ≈øent me, ≈øo ≈øend I you," on which our author founds the bi≈øhop's power of <hi>making officers</hi> in the church, have no direct reference to the power of ordination at all. They only imply, that as Chri≈øt received his commi≈ø≈øion immediately from the father; ≈øo he did immediately ≈øend them to di≈øciple all nations, and teach them whatever he had commanded. But this by no means implies, that whatever power Chri≈øt had him≈øelf, he inve≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his apo≈øtles with, or gave them the ≈øame author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and dominion in his church, that belonged to him.

               <p>HAVING thus vindicated Dr. Chauncy's notion of ordination, from Mr. L's exceptions, I am now prepared to an≈øwer the que≈øtions he has ≈øeen fit to propo≈øe.‚ÄîHe a≈øks, "how the ordainers are to know in the≈øe times, that Chri≈øt has commi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the≈øe men, as his mini≈øters, whom they let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mini≈øtry?"
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 14.</note>‚ÄîI an≈øwer.</p>
               <p>As the Dr. no where ≈øays that men are inve≈øted with Chri≈øt's commi≈ø≈øion, before ordination, as the que≈øtion ≈øeems to intimate: He ought rather to a≈øk, "how the ordainers are to know who are proper to be ordained, or ve≈øted with Chri≈øt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, and declared lawful mini≈øters?"‚ÄîAnd here the an≈øwer is ea≈øy. They are to know it by the candidate's profe≈ø≈øing an inclination to enter into the mini≈øtry, his being upon examination, found qualified for it, and, (in ca≈øe he is to take the charge of a particular church) his being cho≈øen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the church to take the pa≈øtoral charge of

               <p>AGAIN he a≈øks,

               <p>THUS I have endeavoured particularly to an≈øwer every objection brought again≈øt this in≈øtance of Paul's and Barnabas's ≈øeparation, and, I pre≈øume, ≈øufficiently proved it to be a real and proper ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. That it was ≈øo, was the declared opinion of Chry≈øo≈øtom, one of the fathers. He a≈ø≈øerts that "Paul was ordained at Antioch," and that this is the

But let it be called by what name it will, it is indubitably an expre≈øs and very circum≈øtantial in≈øtance, of per≈øons being ≈øeparated, and ≈øent forth to the work of the go≈øpel mini≈øtry, which is all the ≈øcripture means by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. And as this was confe≈ø≈øedly done, not by officers of a ≈øuperior character, not by apo≈øtles or bi≈øhops, but by teachers or pre≈øbyters, it mu≈øt be con≈øidered as a proper ≈øcripture pattern of pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian ordination, and a proof that ≈øuch ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is valid.</p>
               <p>I PROCEED now to con≈øider what Mr. L. has to ≈øay, upon the other in≈øtance of pre≈øbyterian ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in ≈øcripture, as mentioned by the Dr. viz. that of Timothy, 1 Tim. iv. 14.

                  </q> This, the Dr. mentioned, as an expre≈øs in≈øtance of ordination by pre≈øbyters, and very fully an≈øwered all the objections commonly urged again≈øt it by epi≈øcopalians. Nor do I find any material one added by Mr. L. He indeed tells us "the text ≈øays, Timothy was not ordained by

At the ≈øame time, it would have ≈øaved him the trouble of repeating that other objection, ≈øo particularly an≈øwered by the Dr. viz. that Paul was concerned in Timothy's ordination. The word <hi>gift,</hi> here ≈øaid "to be given to Timothy by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy," &amp;c. Mr. L. in≈øi≈øts, is the ≈øame in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal with that mentioned 2 Tim. i. 6, as given by the putting on of Paul's hands. The Dr. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it is. He moreover allows the ≈øame thing to be ≈øignified, in both texts, viz. the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Gho≈øt. And further, that the≈øe were communicated to Timothy by Paul's hands only. For after mentioning the text in que≈øtion, he ≈øays,
<q>The meaning of the words, compared with what is ≈øaid upon the matter in 2 Tim. i. 6, may be fully expre≈ø≈øed in the following para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phra≈øe,</q>‚Äî<q>Improve the gift of the Holy Gho≈øt, which I imparted to you, in an extraordinary

                  </q> In this paraphra≈øe is fairly and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically included, every thing contained in both texts, concerning Timothy's ordination, and the gift here ≈øaid to be imparted to him. The <hi>gift,</hi> in both places, ≈øignifies, the extraordinary HARISMETA or gifts of the Holy Gho≈øt. The≈øe, the Dr. allows were conferred by the impo≈øition of Paul's hands only, as mentioned in 2 Tim. i. 6. This was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>prophecy;</hi> that is, agreeable to, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence of the prophecies, which the apo≈øtle ≈øays 1 Tim. i. 18, went before concerning Timothy. Holy men prophetically ≈øpeaking by in≈øpiration, of him, as a fit per≈øon to receive this gift, and in con≈øequence, to be put into the mini≈øtry; to which ≈øervice he is here, in 1 Tim. iv. 14, ≈øaid to be ≈øeparated, by the impo≈øition of the hands of the pre≈øbytery, in ordination. This makes both the accounts, perfectly con≈øi≈øtent, which no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, perhaps, can do. To be ≈øure that given by Mr. L. is very far from doing it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as in the forementioned in≈øtance of Paul and Barnabas; ≈øo al≈øo in this of Timothy, he ≈øeems very loth to allow, that ordination is intended by the impo≈øition of hands. "If, ≈øays he, this was an ordination." Again. "If this was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then," &amp;c. It is ea≈øy to ≈øee, in both the≈øe in≈øtances, what were his rea≈øons for expre≈ø≈øing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf ≈øo doubtfully in the ca≈øe. If the≈øe were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be proper ordinations, he was fully ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all he could ≈øay, would be in≈øufficient to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the force of the argument, brought from them, in favour of pre≈øbyterian ordination. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he endeavours to per≈øuade his readers, that it is, at lea≈øt doubtful, whether ordination is the thing
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031609_0032_0FED5AC968104190"/>intended. But as the evidence in the ca≈øe is ≈øo full; as every thing included in ordination is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and expre≈ø≈øly mentioned, in the≈øe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, than in any others recorded in the New-Te≈øtament; and I may add, as there can certainly be found no in≈øtance of an ordination in the whole bible, if the≈øe are not allowed to be ≈øuch; Mr. L. ≈øeems not quite willing, after all, to hazard the i≈ø≈øue of the controver≈øy, upon a bare denial of this fact: But thinks it concerns him to ≈øhew, that if this was an ordination, yet it was not performed by pre≈øbyters. And the only argument he brings for the purpo≈øe, is, "that the word <hi>pre≈øbytery,</hi> here, does not ≈øignify a number of <hi>pre≈øbyters.</hi> His words are;
<q>It ≈øeems, the Dr. takes it for granted, that a pre≈øbytery means a number of pre≈øbyters only. Calling a number of pre≈øbyters, a pre≈øbytery, does not prove that St. Paul means the ≈øame, when he u≈øed the words.<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">P. 18.</note>
                  </q> He therefore concludes that "Paul was at the head of the≈øe elders to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitute them a pre≈øbytery, with power to ordain." If therefore I can prove, that the word PRESBUTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RION, a <hi>pre≈øbytery,</hi> always ≈øignifies, in the New-Te≈øtament, and other ancient writers, <hi>a number of pre≈øbyters only;</hi> then his whole objection again≈øt the Dr's interpretation of the≈øe words, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; and this in≈øtance of Timothy's ordination, will remain an inconte≈øtible pattern and proof of pre≈øbyterian ordination.</p>
               <p>Now the word PRESBUTERION is to be found but in two other places in all the New-Te≈øtament, in both of which it ≈øignifies "a number of pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only." The fir≈øt is Luke xxii. 66.
<q>And when it was day PRESBUTERION, <hi>the elders</hi> of the people and the chief prie≈øts and the ≈øcribes came together,</q> &amp;c. It is very evident the word here means a number of elders or pre≈øbyters only: It is ≈øo tran≈ølated; the <hi>elders</hi> of the people, the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031609_0032_0FED5AC968104190"/>≈øanhedrim or grand council of the Jews: Not including the chief prie≈øts, the ≈øcribes, or indeed any other officer of a ≈øuperior rank, as Mr. L. would have it in the other in≈øtance: The≈øe are al≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øly mentioned, and very particularly di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed in the account; the <hi>elders</hi> of the people, PRESBUTERION, and the chief prie≈øts and the ≈øcribes. Be≈øides, the very per≈øons who are here called by the collective name PRESBUTERION; in the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel place, Matt. xxvii. 1, are called by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or appropriate one, PRESBUTEROUS, (which ≈øhews the words are u≈øed ≈øynonimou≈øly) and they are there al≈øo di≈øtingui≈øhed from the chief prie≈øts or any other officers. It is therefore beyond all di≈øpute that the word <hi>pre≈øbytery,</hi> here means a number of elders only.</p>
               <p>THE other place, in which the word occurs, is Acts xxii. 5. There it is tran≈ølated, "the ≈øtate of the elders," that is, the body or company of pre≈øbyters. Here again they are particularly di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui≈øhed from the chief prie≈øt, or any other ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior officer; for he is particularly mentioned, and di≈øtingui≈øhed from the TO PRESBUTERION, the ≈øtate or body of elders.
<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Here it may be noted, that the pre≈øbytery or elders among the Jews, called PRESBUTERION or SANHEDRION, was their <hi>≈øupreme</hi> court of judicature.

                  </note> The word is frequently u≈øed by ancient eccle≈øia≈øtical writers, and always to ≈øignify a number of <hi>pre≈øbyters</hi> only. Numbers of quotations from the fathers, might ea≈øily be produced in proof of this. I ≈øhall adduce but one,

               <p>DR. CHAUNCY had therefore good right "to take it for granted, that a pre≈øbytery means, a number of pre≈øbyters only." And ≈øince this is the word u≈øed in this in≈øtance, it is a clear con≈øequence, that Timothy was ordained by a number of <hi>pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> and therefore that pre≈øbyterian ordination, is the true ≈øcripture ordination.</p>
               <p>NOR will it at all alter the ca≈øe tho' we ≈øhould grant that Paul joined with the pre≈øbytery in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy's ordination: For if he did, he acted, not as an apo≈øtle, but as a pre≈øbyter, of no more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than the re≈øt. For it is in this character only, that the per≈øons who impo≈øed hands are here ≈øaid to act: Plainly denoting that they acted as a <hi>pre≈øbytery;</hi> and con≈øequently, that the right of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is ve≈øted in ≈øuch a body, and in none el≈øe.</p>
               <p>HENCE it will follow, that what Mr. L. ≈øays

                  </note> is not true. It is not true "that a number of pre≈øbyters have no more power to ordain without a bi≈øhop, than the lower hou≈øe of a≈ø≈øembly have, to perform acts of legi≈ølation without the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or." So far from it, that <hi>pre≈øbyters</hi> and they only are ve≈øted with the power of ordination; and even when an apo≈øtle was joined with them, if that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the ca≈øe; he acted, not as an <hi>apo≈øtle,</hi> but as a <hi>pre≈øbyter;</hi> therefore the action is expre≈ø≈øly ≈øaid to be done by a con≈øi≈øtory of pre≈øbyters, as we have ≈øhewed above. But if it were not ≈øo: If it were true, as he ≈øays, that a number of pre≈øbyters have ju≈øt as much and no more authority, with or without a bi≈øhop, than the lower hou≈øe of a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have with or without the governor; ≈øtill it will be nothing at all to his purpo≈øe. For as the lower hou≈øe, can perform no act of legi≈ølation, without the governor; no more can the governor without them. The power of the latter, in this ca≈øe therefore, is at lea≈øt equal to the former. If then we allow this a parallel ca≈øe, it will indeed follow that pre≈øbyters have no power to ordain, without a bi≈øhop: But it will equally follow, that the bi≈øhop has no ≈øuch power without the pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

               <p>As another proof of ordination by pre≈øbyters, the Dr. ob≈øerved, "that be≈øides deacons, the ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mentions but one order of officers only, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øcuou≈øly called bi≈øhops or pre≈øbyters, therefore that the ordaining power mu≈øt belong to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der." In proof of this he added ≈øundry texts, and among others, Philip. i. 1, where the apo≈øtle, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈ø≈øing this church with its officers, makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of but two orders, <hi>bi≈øhops</hi> and <hi>deacons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN an≈øwer to this Mr. L. ≈øays, the≈øe bi≈øhops were the pre≈øbyters of this church; and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides them and the deacons, there was an apo≈øtle, viz. Epaphroditus, pre≈øiding over them in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>bi≈øhop.</hi> In proof of this he quotes chap. ii. 5, 25, where Paul ≈øays,
<q>I ≈øuppo≈øed it nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øend to you, Epaphroditus my brother, &amp;c. but your <hi>me≈ø≈øenger.</hi>

                  </q> In the original, he tells us, it is <hi>your apo≈øtle.</hi> Hence he infers, that in this church, were three orders of mini≈øters.</p>
               <p>ANSWER. Epaphroditus being <hi>≈øent</hi> to Philippi is no proof he was ≈øent there in character of a bi≈øhop. If ≈øo then Timothy mu≈øt have been their bi≈øhop al≈øo. For Paul ≈øays, "I tru≈øt in the Lord to <hi>≈øend</hi> Timothy unto you ≈øhortly," v. 24. But this would be, to have two bi≈øhops in this one church, which is utterly incon≈øi≈øtent with the epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ≈øcheme; according to which there can be but one bi≈øhop to one church. Neither will his
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031609_0034_0FED5ACD55E4DBC0"/>being called the Philippian's <hi>me≈ø≈øenger,</hi> prove that he was their <hi>bi≈øhop,</hi> or held any office in this church. I grant the word in the original is APOSTOLON, an apo≈øtle. This, however, in its common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appropri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ted ≈øen≈øe, means not a bi≈øhop, or indeed any church officer; but according to its original derivation, a <hi>me≈ø≈øenger,</hi> or one ≈øent. It is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ≈øo tran≈ølated, wherever it occurs in ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in its unappropriated ≈øen≈øe, ju≈øt as it is in this place. We meet with it in John xiii. 16, and 2 Cor. viii. 23. But as it is u≈øed in its unappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated ≈øen≈øe in both, ≈øo it is tran≈ølated, as here, not <hi>apo≈øtle</hi> but <hi>me≈ø≈øenger:</hi> But if it mu≈øt be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>apo≈øtle</hi> in this place, as Mr. L. contends, it mu≈øt al≈øo in the others, and wherever it occurs. And if this be the ca≈øe, John the bapti≈øt, and tho≈øe who were ≈øent to him from the phari≈øecs, mu≈øt be al≈øo acknowledged as apo≈øtles or bi≈øhops: For they are called APOSTELLMENOI, apo≈øtles, a word of the ≈øame theme and import with this. And therefore if this word mu≈øt always ≈øignify <hi>apo≈øtle</hi> or bi≈øhop, po≈ø≈øibly Mr. L. will find in ≈øcripture, an in≈øtance of a <hi>≈øhe-bi≈øhop</hi> or apo≈øtle: For Junia, which by many is ≈øuppo≈øed to be the name of a woman,<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Chry≈øo≈øtom, Theophylact, Occumenius, Origen, Hillary the deacon, Pelagius, Prima≈øius, Bede, Haimo, and Premigius read, not Junia, but Julia believing her to be a woman, as the learned Bloudel a≈ø≈øures us.</note> is ≈øaid with Andronicus, "to be chief among the <hi>apo≈øtles.</hi>"<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Rom. xvi. 7.</note> But the truth of the ca≈øe is: The word APOSTOLON is here u≈øed in its unappropriated ≈øen≈øe. Our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh bibles therefore rightly have it tran≈ølated, not apo≈øtle, but <hi>me≈ø≈øenger</hi> or one ≈øent. For ≈øo Epaph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roditus was. He had been <hi>≈øent</hi> by the Philippians to carry their bounty to Paul, as appears from chap. iv. 18. And therefore the apo≈øtle very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly calls him <hi>their me≈ø≈øenger.</hi> Again. Paul's calling Epaphroditus, <hi>your me≈ø≈øenger,</hi> plainly ≈øhews
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031609_0035_0FED5AE7623B7D20"/>that he was not an apo≈øtle in the appropriate ≈øen≈øe of the word. The apo≈øtles, as ≈øuch, are never called apo≈øtles <hi>of the churches,</hi> but of <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> who≈øe apo≈øtles or me≈ø≈øengers, they are, who gives them commi≈ø≈øion, and ≈øends them forth. Thus Peter and Paul, often call them≈øelves apo≈øtles of Je≈øus Chri≈øt,<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 1. 1 Cor. i. 1, &amp;c.</note> but they are never once called, <hi>your apo≈øtles,</hi> or the me≈ø≈øengers of the church.‚Äî Epaphroditus however is called a me≈ø≈øenger or apo≈øtle, not of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, but of the church: This plainly ≈øhews that he was not an officer in that church, but only a <hi>me≈ø≈øenger</hi> they had ≈øent, to carry money to Paul. Indeed it looks at lea≈øt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable, had he been their <hi>apo≈øtle</hi> or <hi>bi≈øhop,</hi> as Mr. L. pretends, that he ≈øhould be ≈øingled out by them for ≈øo inferior a piece of ≈øervice, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their alms to Paul; e≈øpecially, as they had a number of pre≈øbyters and deacons, whom they might have improved in this ≈øervice.</p>
               <p>FINALLY, had Epaphroditus been the bi≈øhop of this church, is it not ≈øtrange the apo≈øtle ≈øhould not mention him in his in≈øcription of his epi≈øtle to this church? He particularly mentions the <hi>bi≈øhops</hi> or pre≈øbyters, and deacons, but ≈øays not a word of any apo≈øtle. This neglect, mo≈øt certainly, Paul would not have been guilty of, had Epaphroditus been their bi≈øhop, as our author pretends. Upon the whole, the≈øe rea≈øons mu≈øt, I imagine, convince every impartial per≈øon, that he was not the bi≈øhop of Philippi, that there were but only the two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of bi≈øhops or pre≈øbyters, and deacons in this church, as the Dr. a≈ø≈øerted, and therefore his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for pre≈øbyterian ordination, from this text, ≈øtands good.</p>
               <p>MR. L's next in≈øtance of three orders, is the church at "Jeru≈øalem. We have clear evidence, he tells us, from ≈øcripture, that St. James re≈øided for twenty years together, with and over the pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031609_0035_0FED5AE7623B7D20"/>and deacons there."<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 20, 21.</note> For proof of this he refers to Acts, chapters vi. and xv. chap. xxi. 18, and Gal. i. 19.</p>
               <p>Two things, he ≈øays, he has proved from the≈øe texts. One, that the apo≈øtle James re≈øided for twenty years together in the church at Jeru≈øalem: The other, that he re≈øided with and <hi>over</hi> the pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and deacons of this church, during that time.‚ÄîLet us examine his proofs.</p>
               <p>As to the fir≈øt, it does indeed appear from the≈øe texts, that Paul found James at Jeru≈øalem, three ≈øeveral times, and at the di≈øtance of ≈øundry years one from another. But then, at two of the≈øe times, the ≈øame accounts ≈øay, Peter was there with him. And one of them mentions John as there al≈øo. If, then, from the≈øe two accounts it can be proved, that James was at Jeru≈øalem as bi≈øhop, during the term afore≈øaid; the ≈øame mu≈øt follow al≈øo as to Peter. This argument therefore either proves that both of them ≈øo re≈øided, or that neither did. But as they could not, in Mr. L's ≈øenfe, be both bi≈øhops of this church, the con≈øequence is plain, that nothing can be concluded from the≈øe two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that either of them were. All the proof then that remains as to this fact, is the ≈øingle cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance of his being found there by Paul, ≈øome years after. Acts xxi. 18. But as there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how long he re≈øided there, barely his being found there, I pre≈øume, will hardly be admitted a ≈øufficient proof of Mr. L's a≈ø≈øertion, that the time of his continuance was twenty years. Indeed, as James, by our author's conce≈ø≈øion was an apo≈øtle, there is not the lea≈øt degree of probability, much le≈øs any proof, that he re≈øided at Jeru≈øalem, or any other place, for any con≈øiderable time togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as his particular charge. So to do would have been utterly incon≈øi≈øtent with the apo≈øtolic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:031609_0036_0FED5AF645F52968"/>and the charge given to the apo≈øtles by Chri≈øt, <hi>"go teach all nations," "go into all the world,</hi> and preach the go≈øpel to <hi>every creature,</hi>" and ≈øo preach repentance and remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins <hi>among all nations,</hi> beginning at Jeru≈øalem."<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Matt. xxviii. 19. Mark xvi. 15. Luke xxiv. 47.</note> How the executing this large commi≈ø≈øion, could be con≈øi≈øtent with any of the apo≈øtles making Jeru≈øalem their ≈øtated re≈øidence, e≈øpecially for twenty years together, as Mr. L. a≈ø≈øerts, for my part I am unable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand. Wherefore without offering a word more upon this point, I freely ≈øubmit it to the candid reader to determine, whether the evidence Mr. L. has brought, to prove that James actually "re≈øid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twenty years together at Jeru≈øalem, is ≈øufficient to ≈øupport the fact." But if it ≈øhould be deemed to be, it will by no means follow, that he ≈øo re≈øided in character of a bi≈øhop, or as Mr. L. expre≈ø≈øes it, "with and over the pre≈øbyters and deacons there." This is the other thing he has here a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted, and for proof of it, he refers us to what he calls, "James's conduct in the ca≈øe St. Paul laid before him, Acts xv." I de≈øire the reader to turn to the place, and read the whole account, and then ≈øay, what there is in it to prove that James, any more than any of the re≈øt, that were pre≈øent at that council, was the bi≈øhop of Jeru≈øalem? Is it that he was at Jeru≈øalem at that time? So was Peter and John, and other apo≈øtles. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from this circum≈øtance bid as fair for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as he. Was it that James attended upon the council there? The ≈øame did the other apo≈øtles, yea and the elders and brethren too. Or was it that James gave his judgment, in the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the que≈øtion before them? This did all that were pre≈øent. And therefore when the decree was drawn up and publi≈øhed, it is expre≈ø≈øly ≈øaid to go forth in the name. "of the apo≈øtles, and elders
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031609_0036_0FED5AF645F52968"/>and brethren."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ver≈øe 23.</note> Or la≈øtly, was it that James in particular, ≈øpoke in the council, and declared his ≈øentiments concerning the ca≈øe in que≈øtion?‚Äî But the ≈øame did al≈øo ≈øundry of the re≈øt, as Peter, Barnabas and Paul. The≈øe are all particularly mentioned as ≈øpeaking and declaring their opinion upon the point in debate. Yea, as giving the ≈øame <hi>≈øentence</hi> or judgment, that James afterwards declared to be his. What right, I demand, then had Mr. L. to ≈øay, "that James's authority was <hi>deci≈øive</hi> in the ca≈øe," any more than that of Peter, Paul and Barnabas, who had given the ≈øame ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence before? Certainly none. Nothing therefore from this circum≈øtance, or indeed from any thing el≈øe, in the account, in favour of James's epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal relation to, and authority over this church, and its officers, but what equally appears in favor of the re≈øt. And ≈øince they could not all be bi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops of it, it is a plain ca≈øe that none of them are proved to be ≈øo; con≈øequently, that there were not three orders of officers in this church as Mr. L. has a≈ø≈øerted.</p>
               <p>HIS next attack upon the Dr. is for a≈ø≈øerting, "That the apo≈øtles as ≈øuch, were extraordinary officers, and had no ≈øucce≈ø≈øors," and then a≈øks "in what re≈øpects they were ≈øo?"<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Page 21.</note> I an≈øwer.

I would refer him for a more particular account of the di≈øtinctive character and qualifications of the app≈øtle≈øhip, to Mr. Boy≈øe's "ancient epi≈øcopacy," p. 253, &amp;c. To Dr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as quoted by him, p. 272, &amp;c. and "the ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-bi≈øhop, p. 26, &amp;c. In the mean time, as I ≈øhall have occa≈øion, more particularly to con≈øider this point, when I come to his remarks upon my ≈øermon, it may be ≈øufficient to ob≈øerve here, that Mr. L. does not pretend to prove bi≈øhops now-a-days, are indued with the≈øe extraordinary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, on which the <hi>apo≈øtolic</hi> character and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were founded; con≈øequently the former cannot ≈øucceed the latter in the exerci≈øe of the≈øe powers. He ≈øays indeed as to ≈øome of the≈øe qualifications, ≈øuch as, "the power of working miracles, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from place to place to plant churches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately ≈øent by Chri≈øt; that they were not <hi>peculiar</hi> to the apo≈øtles, for others at that time had the ≈øame." But now, what is this to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe? If they were not <hi>peculiar</hi> to the apo≈øtles, they were at lea≈øt <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> to the apo≈øtolic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to furni≈øh men for the duties of it. Tho' therefore ≈øome, cotemporary with the apo≈øtles, might have ≈øome of the≈øe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary qualifications, e≈ø≈øental to the apo≈øtolic office; yet as none can pretend to them now; the con≈øequence is undeniable, that none now can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ≈øucceed the apo≈øtles, in that part of their character and office, to which the≈øe extraordinary qualifications were e≈ø≈øential and ab≈øolutely nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary. Since therefore dioce≈øan bi≈øhops do not, cannot ≈øucceed the apo≈øtles, in that part of their character or office which was <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them; it belongs to him, if he would ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his ≈øcheme, to prove, that the apo≈øtles, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their <hi>ordinary</hi> powers, did in fact make a difference; committing a <hi>chief</hi> power to a ≈øupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior order, called <hi>bi≈øhops,</hi> and an <hi>inferior</hi> one to others, under the name of <hi>pre≈øbyters.</hi>

THIS is what he next attempts to do.‚Äî<q>What we a≈ø≈øert, ≈øays he, is that the apo≈øtles did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a chief power to a ≈øuperior order, then called <hi>apo≈øtles.</hi>

               <p>ANSWER. As to, at lea≈øt three of the four here mentioned, neither the texts he has quoted, nor indeed any other in ≈øcripture, proves them to be apo≈øtles, in the <hi>appropriate</hi> ≈øen≈øe of the word. As to Epaphroditus, it has been already proved that he was no apo≈øtle, but only a me≈ø≈øenger of the church of Philippi, ≈øent to carry their contribution to the apo≈øtle Paul; an errand not over and above apo≈øtolical.‚ÄîAs to Titus, he is no where, in ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, called an apo≈øtle in any ≈øen≈øe whatever. The text Mr. L. quotes to prove him ≈øo, is this,

                  </q> It ≈øeems Mr. L. thought Titus mu≈øt needs be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle; becau≈øe he found the word, APOSTOLOI, <hi>me≈ø≈øengers,</hi> in the ≈øame ver≈øe, in which Titus is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But unhappily for him, it is not Titus, but the <hi>brethren</hi> that went with him, who are called APOSTOLOI, <hi>me≈ø≈øengers.</hi> Titus is particularly di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui≈øhed from them in the former part of the ver≈øe, as Paul's partner and fellow-labourer, and not of the number of the brethren who are called APOSTOLOI, <hi>me≈ø≈øengers,</hi> in the latter part of it. But if he was not: If he was, as Mr. L. ≈øuppo≈øes, of the number of the≈øe APOSTOLOI <hi>me≈ø≈øengers;</hi> it would
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031609_0038_0FED5AF2E221B390"/>be nothing to his purpo≈øe: For it is abundantly evident, from the context, that the word APOSTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOI is here u≈øed, not in its appropriate ≈øen≈øe, to ≈øignify an officer in the church; but in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and unappropriated one, meaning barely a <hi>me≈ø≈øenger,</hi> or one ≈øent. For it is evidently on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being <hi>≈øent</hi> to Corinth to receive their collections, and carry them to Jeru≈øalem, and nothing el≈øe, that the≈øe per≈øons are called APOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOLOI, me≈ø≈øengers of the churches. If therefore Epaphroditus was no <hi>apo≈øtle,</hi> much le≈øs was Titus, who is never once called by that name, in any ≈øen≈øe of the word what≈øoever. And tho' Mr. L. tells us "he de≈øigned to prove Timothy to be one;" yet as we find nothing of that kind done in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of his book; 'tis probable, upon ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thought, he was di≈øcouraged in the attempt. Since therefore he has dropt him out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we have a right to do the ≈øame, and ≈øo there remains only Barnabas to be con≈øidered.</p>
               <p>AND, it is readily granted he is called an apo≈øtle in Acts xiv. 14. But until it is proved that he <hi>derived</hi> his apo≈øtolic power from the apo≈øtles; barely his being called an apo≈øtle, will not prove his a≈ø≈øertion,
<q>that the apo≈øtles did communicate a chief power to a ≈øuperior order called apo≈øtles.</q> All that is proved from this text, is that "Barnabas was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle." How he came to be ≈øo, or from whom he <hi>received</hi> his "chief power" and ≈øuperior character as an apo≈øtle, the text is intirely ≈øilent; nor can it be collected from any thing Mr. L. has ≈øaid. If his being here mentioned with Paul, ≈øignifies that he was ve≈øted with the ≈øame ≈øuperior office and character as Paul was; no doubt he received his apo≈øtolic commi≈ø≈øion and authority, in the ≈øame immediate way, and from the ≈øame fountain, as Paul did. How that was, he him≈øelf has told us. For he was
<q>an apo≈øtle, not of men, neither by
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031609_0038_0FED5AF2E221B390"/>man, but by Je≈øus Chri≈øt and God the father</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. i. 1.</note> At lea≈øt till the contrary is proved from ≈øcripture, we have a right to conclude this was the ca≈øe: Con≈øequently, that the apo≈øtles did not
<q>thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ordinary powers of their office, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating to ≈øome more, to others le≈øs, and ≈øo con≈øtituting the two orders of bi≈øhops and pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</q> as our opponents pretend. I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now with propriety, I pre≈øume, take leave of this argument in the words of Dr. Chauncy.
<q>If the apo≈øtles did thus communicate the≈øe powers, in a different degree, committing to ≈øome more, to others le≈øs, and ≈øo con≈øtituting two orders in the mini≈øtry; it is what we may rea≈øonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ≈øee evidenced. The new-te≈øtament is open. If it contains any ≈øuch evidence, let it be produced. We imagine it contains clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the contrary, and that we have given ≈øuch evidence.

               <p>IF this an≈øwer will not ≈øatisfy Mr. L. I will give him another, in the words of a prote≈øtant in an≈øwer to a demand of the like kind from a papi≈øt. It is as follows.
<q>When Arius, Ne≈øtorius, and ≈øuch like heretics aro≈øe; they violently broke out of the church, and for≈øook all communion. And when Mahomet came from without, he vi≈øibly a≈ø≈øaulted all chri≈øtianity. But the <hi>papacy</hi> bred ≈øilently, as a gangrene in the church within. That cockatrice was long a hatching in the ≈øhell, before it did appear. It was a ≈øecret departure from the truth, cau≈øed by errors ≈øtolen into the church, <hi>≈øen≈øim, ≈øine ≈øen≈øu,</hi> in≈øen≈øibly and unawares: Whence appears the difference between open he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øy and clande≈øtine apo≈øtacy.

               <p>OR if this account ≈øhould be thought of too late a date, I will refer him to that given by Jerom, one of the fathers.

               <p>I HAVE ≈øometimes heard it remarked, indeed, as a fort of incon≈øi≈øtency in the church of England, to di≈øcover ≈øuch a partial affection to that of Rome, as to allow of their orders as valid while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tho≈øe of all prote≈øtant churches; and boa≈øt ≈øo much of a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion through that church, which in their homilies they call "a filthy old withered harlot, and ≈øo far from being of the nature of a true church, that for more than nine hundred years before the reformation, nothing could be more." This, however, Mr. L. denies. They did not, he ≈øays, derive either their power, or chri≈øtiamity from Rome. "The Briti≈øh church flouri≈øhed, he tells us, many hundred years‚Äîbefore the go≈øpel took place in England." I an≈øwer:‚ÄîThat chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity was early introduced into England, is not denied. Who fir≈øt preached it there, is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. 'Tis ≈øtill more ≈øo in what form, whether pre≈øbyterian or epi≈øcopalian, that church was fir≈øt ≈øettled. If Paul was the fir≈øt who brought the go≈øpel to Britain and planted chri≈øtianity there, as many writers ≈øay; it is pre≈øumed, that ≈øince he him≈øelf was ordained by pre≈øbyters, that was the form of ordination and government he would e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabli≈øh there.

               <p>BUT if this had not been the ca≈øe: Had it been, as his argument ≈øuppo≈øes, that there was a di≈øtinct ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of bi≈øhops kept up in Wales, in a direct line from the ancient Briti≈øh bi≈øhops, even till the reformation; this will afford him no manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as to the pre≈øent clergy of their church.

<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031609_0042_0FED5ABC355657B8"/>Welch bi≈øhops was concerned in the con≈øecration of Parker, and yet from him all the bi≈øhops in the church of England ever ≈øince mu≈øt derive their ≈øucce≈ø≈øion. The fact was truly this. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the reformation under Henry VIII. all the bi≈øhops, abbots and priors in England, (Fi≈øher bi≈øhop of Roche≈øter only excepted) complied with it, as far as it was then carried.<note n="*" place="bottom">Burn. eccl. hi≈øt. abridg. vol 1, page 106.</note> This therefore, could not be the time Mr. L. ≈øpeaks of, "when all that were ordained at Rome, refu≈øed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the reformation, and returned to Rome from whence they came." For at this time none returned to Rome; and but one in the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, refu≈øed to comply with the changes that were made. By the reformation, therefore, he mu≈øt mean, the revival of it in Queen Elizabeth's reign. Then indeed, all the bi≈øhops in the kingdom, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Kitchen of Landaff, refu≈øed to comply with it and were turned out. None of them, however, "returned to Rome, as he a≈ø≈øerts, ≈øave one only, and but three left the kingdom, viz.

B. 8, p. 58.</note> This is con≈øiderably ≈øhort of the number <hi>fourteen,</hi> mentioned by Mr. L. Now this being the ca≈øe, that all the bi≈øhops in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not only of England, but Wales too, except one, were deprived; where will he go to make out a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion for their clergy, from the old Briti≈øh bi≈øhops? They were all, ≈øave one, deprived, and a new ≈øucce≈ø≈øion begun in Parker, from whom all the bi≈øhops ever ≈øince, mu≈øt derive their claim. Unle≈øs therefore, he can prove, that Parker was con≈øecrated by the de≈øcendants of tho≈øe "ancient Briti≈øh bi≈øhops," his pretended ≈øucce≈ø≈øion from them, is inevitably overthrown. But to the utter de≈øtruction of his ≈øcheme, ≈øo it happened, that Parker, (from-whom all the clergy of the church
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031609_0043_0FED5AEAC65863C0"/>of England, both bi≈øhops and pre≈øbyters, ever ≈øince, derive their ≈øucce≈ø≈øion) was con≈øecrated, not by any of the bi≈øhops of Wales, but by four Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh bi≈øhops, who had been con≈øecrated in king Edward's time, had been deprived in the reign of Queen Mary, and had never been re≈øtored. For the men who con≈øecrated Parker, were Barlow, formerly bi≈øhop of Bath and Wells, Scory of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che≈øter, Coverdale of Exeter, and Hodg≈økins fu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan of Bedford.<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Ful. ch. hi≈øt. B. 9, page 60.</note> But none of the≈øe had been bi≈øhops of Wales. It is true the writ of Parker's con≈øecration, named Kitchen of Landaff for one. But it is equally true that he never appeared to a≈ø≈øi≈øt at the con≈øecration, and ≈øo it was performed without him by the four above named. Where then, I repeat it, will Mr. L. make out his ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, through the line of the old Briti≈øh bi≈øhops? If he was ≈øo unacquainted with hi≈øtory, as not to know that there was no manner of foundation for ≈øuch a pretence, he was unqualified to write upon the ≈øubject, and ought not to have meddled with it. If not, he has de≈øignedly impo≈øed upon his readers, and ought "to retract."</p>
               <p>THE truth of the ca≈øe is, no hi≈øtory of the Briti≈øh church furni≈øhes the lea≈øt foundation, even of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for ≈øuch a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion. Bi≈øhop Burnet ≈øays, that the reformers in England, expre≈ø≈øly allowed "that England received the faith from tho≈øe ≈øent from Rome by pope Gregory the great, i. e.

                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:031609_0043_0FED5AEAC65863C0"/>And tho' I don't imagine there is any great prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of an unbroken ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, even in that line, yet it mu≈øt be ≈øought there, or no where. 'Till therefore Mr. L. brings us ≈øome better authority for one, through the old Briti≈øh bi≈øhops, than his bare a≈ø≈øertion; he mu≈øt expect it will be treated with that contempt, ≈øuch a vi≈øionary enthu≈øia≈øtic ≈øcheme de≈øerves.</p>
               <p>I CALL this notion of an uninterrupted ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, and the ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of it to render go≈øpel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration valid, a <hi>vi≈øionary enthu≈øia≈øtic</hi> ≈øcheme. It is ≈øo even when traced in any line. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the fact is ≈øo ≈ømall, and the probability, or rather evidence of an interruption, ≈øo great, that a man mu≈øt renounce the common principles of credibility, and act by an implicit faith, to give in to it, or at lea≈øt to lay any great weight upon it. But to be very confident of it, and that in a line where it is ab≈øolutely certain it is not to be found, argues, if po≈ø≈øible, a greater degree of weakne≈øs and credulity than what the mo≈øt vi≈øionary enthu≈øia≈øts are influenced by. And is not this even the ca≈øe with our author? For though he di≈øclaims a ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion through the Romi≈øh church and lays the whole ≈øtre≈øs upon one thro' the old Briti≈øh bi≈øhops, which never had any exi≈øtence, ≈øave in a heated imagination, he is ≈øo confident of the truth of it, that he tells us, "we have as good evidence that their clergy derive their authority, by an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ≈øucce≈ø≈øion from the apo≈øtles, (meaning thro' the line afore≈øaid) as we have of the de≈øcent of all mankind from Adam by ordinary generation."<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Page 26.</note> The highe≈øt evidence to which, even Mr. Beach, pretended in this ca≈øe, and that in a line too, which bid much fairer, than the romantic one of our author, was only to put it upon a level, with that of the Levitical prie≈øthood in the family of Aaron.

If the faith of the advocates of this doctrine, continues thus increa≈øing, we may expect it will ≈øoon grow up to full a≈ø≈øurance; and that the next ≈øtickler for uninterrupted ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, will put the evidence of it upon a par with that of our exi≈øtence.</p>
               <p>LET us however, examine Mr. L's proof: And here let it be noted, that we have the mo≈øt clear and expre≈øs ≈øcriptural evidence of our natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcent from Adam, and therefore are ab≈øolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it.<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">See Gen. i. 27, &amp; ii. 22. Mal. ii. 15.10. Acts xvii. 26.</note> The ≈øame he tells us, we have for the uninterrupted ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of their clergy from the apo≈øtles. Let it be al≈øo remembered, that this ≈øucce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion mu≈øt be in a line of bi≈øhops as ≈øuperior to pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for he calls it "a regular ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of the <hi>epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power,</hi>" "an apo≈øtolic ≈øucce≈ø≈øion," and "a ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion of the go≈øpel mini≈øtry in the three orders." Barely a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion in the line of <hi>pre≈øbyters</hi> will not ≈øuffice. For we have ≈øuch a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion up to their bi≈øhops, and yet he denies us to be the mini≈øters of Chri≈øt. Now the argument by which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove his ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, is this. Chri≈øt's promi≈øe to his mini≈øters, contained in his commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, in Mat. xviii. 20, mu≈øt have failed unle≈øs there has been ≈øuch a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion as he pleads for, that is, in a direct line of bi≈øhops as a ≈øuperior order in the church. But why mu≈øt the promi≈øe have failed, unle≈øs there has been <hi>≈øuch</hi> a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion? There is nothing in the commi≈ø≈øion, limiting the promi≈øe to ≈øuch a ≈øuperior order: Not the lea≈øt hint of the in≈øtitution of ≈øuch an order. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion is but one, and therefore one order only is in≈øtituted by it. But if there were two, or ten, it would make no alteration: Since the promi≈øe is not limitted to any one in particular, a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion in either of them would an≈øwer all the ends of fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031609_0044_0FED5AD49FA33288"/>the promi≈øe. Mr. L. him≈øelf allows that this promi≈øe belongs to pre≈øbyters.<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 29.</note> If ≈øo, then a continuation of the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion in the line of pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, would as effectually ≈øerve the accompli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promi≈øe, as one in the line of bi≈øhops: Con≈øequently, if it has been continued in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the promi≈øe is fully accompli≈øhed, even tho' it has been broken or interrupted in the latter; and therefore his argument from the promi≈øe, in ≈øupport of a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion in the line of bi≈øhops, is by his own confe≈ø≈øion, intirely defeated.</p>
               <p>THE truth is, as the commi≈ø≈øion ≈øuppo≈øes but one order in the mini≈øtry, the utmo≈øt that can be argued from the annexed promi≈øe, in favour of a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, even of any kind, is that there ≈øhall be a <hi>mini≈øtry</hi> continued in the church, to the end of time. How, or in what manner mini≈øters ≈øhall be introduced, whether in a regular unbroken fine of ≈øucce≈ø≈øion or not, whether by a ≈øuperior or inferior order of mini≈øters, yea whether by the officers of the church or the brethren, as the commi≈ø≈øion is wholly ≈øilent upon this head, ≈øo nothing relative thereto can be concluded from it. And although from other texts it appears, that it belongs, not to the private brethren, but to mini≈øters to ordain; yet for aught appearing in the commi≈ø≈øion it≈øelf, a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of mini≈øters, even by lay ordination, would have as effectually ≈øecured the accompli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promi≈øe, as one by pre≈øbyters, yea or bi≈øhops them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>THUS his bold a≈ø≈øertion "that we have the ≈øame evidence for the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion he pleads for, as we have for our de≈øcent from Adam, finally comes to this." For one we have the certain, indubitable, repeated, expre≈øs te≈øtimony of infallible ≈øcripture, which is evidence of the highe≈øt kind. For the other, we have only his forced interpretation of a particular text, which is no evidence at all.</p>

BUT if ≈øcripture will not ≈øupport his confidence in this point, perhaps he thinks hi≈øtory will. For he tells us "there can be no in≈øtance produced from all eccle≈øia≈øtical hi≈øtory, of any one man's being owned, by the church univer≈øal, as a bi≈øhop, who was not ordained by another bi≈øhop, or by an officer in the church ≈øuperior to a pre≈øbyter."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 26.</note> 'Till this is done, he thinks "it unrea≈øonable to di≈øbelieve the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion in the three orders." This argument for a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, is the univer≈øal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the church, that there has, in fact, been ≈øuch a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion. Now the fact here a≈ø≈øert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is either true, or it is not true. If it is not true in fact, that there has been any ≈øuch univer≈øal acknowledgment, in favour of a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, which is doubtle≈øs the ca≈øe; then his argument founded upon ≈øuch acknowledgment is at once de≈øtroyed.

<q>The ≈øum of the argument, he tells us, is this: Chri≈øt, at fir≈øt, did appoint a certain number of men with power to ≈øend others: The church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal never could be induced to receive officers, unle≈øs they were ordained by ≈øuch officers, as Chri≈øt appointed to ordain; therefore there has been a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of ≈øuch officers, as Chri≈øt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at fir≈øt, which are apo≈øtles, or, as they have been ≈øince called, bi≈øhops.

CHRIST did at fir≈øt ≈øay unto Peter, "unto thee I commit the keys of the kingdom," &amp;c. "The church univer≈øal never could be induced to ≈øubmit to an authority Chri≈øt had not in≈øtituted;" but the church univer≈øal, for many hundred years, did in fact ≈øubmit to the pope, as Peter's ≈øucce≈ø≈øor and the vicar of Chri≈øt; therefore the pope's ≈øupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, &amp;c. is of divine in≈øtitution. Or thus:‚Äî Chri≈øt did at fir≈øt appoint the ≈øacrament of his ≈øupper, to be admini≈øtered to the proper ≈øubjects of it: The church univer≈øal never could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to depart from Chri≈øt's appointment, in this re≈øpect: But the church univer≈øal did in fact, for a long time practice giving the ≈øacrament to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; therefore this practice was no departure from Chri≈øt's in≈øtitution. Whether this "evidence will be ≈øufficient to ≈øilence the ≈øpirit of party," in any who ≈øhould happen to di≈øpute the pretended au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his holine≈øs, the pope, or the lawfulne≈øs of giving the ≈øacrament to infants, I will not take upon me, ab≈øolutely, to determine.

               <p>I HAVE been thus long upon the point of a ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion, not that the defence of the ≈øermons I am vindicating, is concerned in it; for neither of them ≈øay any thing about it.

<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Page 28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER.‚ÄîIf by <hi>apo≈øtolic office,</hi> he means the office the apo≈øtles ≈øu≈øtained, as ordinary mini≈øters in the church; I readily grant that the commi≈ø≈øion in Mat. xxviii. did con≈øtitute them apo≈øtles, and that their office, in this ≈øen≈øe of it, is to continue to the end of the world. But if by <hi>apo≈øtolic office,</hi> he means their office as <hi>apo≈øtles,</hi> properly ≈øo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, con≈øidered in their extraordinary character, I deny that it was to be continued, and affirm there is nothing in the words he pretends to quote from me, that will infer ≈øuch a conclu≈øion. 'Tis true I ≈øaid, and ≈øtill ≈øay, "that the promi≈øe of Chri≈øt's pre≈øence to the end of the world, annexed to the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031609_0048_0FED5ADB89EA4CB0"/>commi≈ø≈øion, was made, not to the <hi>per≈øons</hi> of the apo≈øtles, but to their <hi>office.</hi>" But as what? Not as apo≈øtles, but as I there expre≈øs it, "as mini≈øters in Chri≈øt's church," i e. ≈øtanding ordinary mini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I al≈øo ≈øaid, "that is the commi≈ø≈øion, and the only one, we have any account of, that Chri≈øt gave his apo≈øtles." But then I added, "in virtue of which they were impowered to act <hi>as mini≈øters in his church,</hi>" i. e. as ordinary ≈øtanding mini≈øters, as the whole connexion of my di≈øcour≈øe ≈øhewed. Had Mr. L. thus quoted my words at large, every reader would have ≈øeen the weakne≈øs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion he pretends to draw from them. They are ≈øo far from giving any countenance to his notion of, "a continuation of the <hi>apo≈øtolic office</hi> as ≈øuch; that on the contrary, they very expre≈ø≈øly di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh between <hi>this,</hi> and their ordinary character, and very clearly ≈øhew, that it was the latter, and not the former, that was to be perpetuated, and in which they were to have ≈øucce≈ø≈øors to the end of time. This, I pre≈øume, is ≈øufficient to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my words from this con≈øequence he pretends to draw from them.</p>
               <p>BUT, ≈øays Mr. L. "the con≈øequence (meaning from my words) is plainly this; that the commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion con≈øtituted them apo≈øtles, or el≈øe that they acted as apo≈øtles without any commi≈ø≈øion."</p>
               <p>I ANSWER:‚ÄîThis is by no means a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence neither. Had I ≈øaid, as he has imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly quoted me, "that this is the only commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion we have any account of, that Chri≈øt gave his apo≈øtles," and had added nothing further, it would indeed have followed, not as he ≈øays, "that they acted without any commi≈ø≈øion;" but that, for aught appeared in ≈øcripture, they acted without any. The≈øe two conclu≈øions are very different.‚Äî The ≈øcripture gives no account of the ordination of Silas, Apollos, Epaphroditus, &amp;c. I tru≈øt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he him≈øelf will not from hence conclude that
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031609_0048_0FED5ADB89EA4CB0"/>they acted as mini≈øters without any commi≈ø≈øion or ordination. But then he well knew, that when I ≈øaid, "this is the only commi≈ø≈øion," &amp;c. I meant the only one they received <hi>as ≈øtanding go≈øpel mini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> inve≈øted with an office to be perpetuated.‚Äî This di≈øtinction was fully expre≈ø≈øed in the clau≈øe he has ≈øeen ≈øit to ≈øuppre≈øs, viz. "in virtue of which they were impowered to act as mini≈øters," &amp;c.‚Äî His conclu≈øion therefore, "that this commi≈ø≈øion con≈øtituted them apo≈øtles, or el≈øe they acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a commi≈ø≈øion," no ways follows. For altho' as <hi>≈øtanding ordinary mini≈øters,</hi> they had no other commi≈ø≈øion, yet they might have <hi>as apo≈øtles.</hi> It was in the former view I ≈øpake of them, not in the latter. Certainly they were called apo≈øtles long before this commi≈ø≈øion was given, even upon their being called by Chri≈øt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. x. 2.</note> Paul was called and commi≈ø≈øioned to be an <hi>apo≈øtle,</hi> and acted as ≈øuch, long before he received ordination as <hi>a ≈øtanding ge≈øpel mini≈øter.</hi> The commi≈ø≈øion of the apo≈øtles as ≈øuch, as extraordinary officers, was in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way; by an immediate call from heaven. As apo≈øtles, they were all with Paul "not of men, neither by men, but by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and God the Father.<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Gal. i. 1.</note> When it was they received <hi>this</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, whether upon their fir≈øt call, as ≈øome ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, or at the day of Pentico≈øt, as others think, is perhaps difficult certainly to determine. As their <hi>apo≈øtolic office,</hi> properly ≈øo called, was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and temporary, there was no occa≈øion the commi≈ø≈øion, impowering them thereto, ≈øhould be particularly recorded in ≈øcripture. This was given to them <hi>in per≈øon;</hi> and as they were to have no ≈øucce≈ø≈øors in it, none el≈øe had any concern with it. But as <hi>≈øtanding ordinary mini≈øters,</hi> they were to have ≈øucce≈ø≈øors to the end of time; and therefore it was nece≈ø≈øary their commi≈ø≈øion, in this charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ≈øhould be particularly recorded; for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031609_0049_0FED5AF49341E6B0"/>their ≈øucce≈ø≈øors as well as them≈øelves. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find, this commi≈ø≈øion is in fact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded: 'Tis that we have been con≈øidering: 'Tis that to which the promi≈øe is annexed of Chri≈øt's pre≈øence to the end of the world; and the ≈øame concerning which I a≈ø≈øerted in my ≈øermon, "that it is the only one, we have any account of, which Chri≈øt gave to his apo≈øtles, in virtue of which they were improved to act as <hi>ordinary</hi> mini≈øters in his church." And for this purpo≈øe, no doubt it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that it might be a ≈øtanding commi≈ø≈øion, impowering, authorizing and directing, all the true mini≈øters of Chri≈øt to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>OUR author's next remark is to this purpo≈øe,‚Äî that while I am proving from one commi≈ø≈øion, that one order only of mini≈øters can be virtuated by it, I my≈øelf, in effect, allow two, and ≈øo defeat my own argument: For he ≈øays, I call the apo≈øtles in one place, <hi>extraordinary officers,</hi> and in another, <hi>ordinary ones,</hi> and yet the≈øe are both impowered by one commi≈ø≈øion; hence he concludes that I am "refuted by my≈øelf."<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Page 28, 29.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I ANSWER, had he hone≈øtly cited the pa≈ø≈øage he pretended to quote from me, the weakne≈øs of this conclu≈øion of his would have been obvious at fir≈øt view. 'Tis true I ≈øpeak of the apo≈øtles, as ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the twofold character or office, of apo≈øtles, and ordinary go≈øpel mini≈øters. But then it is equally true that I ≈øpeak only with re≈øpect to the <hi>latter,</hi> when I ≈øay, "this is the commi≈ø≈øion and the only commi≈ø≈øion we have any account of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from Chri≈øt." This di≈øtinction and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation I fully enough expre≈ø≈øed, in the pa≈ø≈øage from which he quotes the≈øe words, though he has ≈øeen fit to ≈øuppre≈øs it by a partial and imperfect quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such acts may help to ≈øupport a bad cau≈øe: A good one has no need of them. Will it at all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that becau≈øe the apo≈øtles, con≈øidered <hi>ordinary</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:031609_0049_0FED5AF49341E6B0"/>mini≈øters of Chri≈øt, are impowered by this one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral commi≈ø≈øion, that they mu≈øt as <hi>extraordinary</hi> officers al≈øo be impowered by the ≈øame? If it will not, then there is no force at all in Mr. L's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion from my argument, as though it allowed of two orders being impowered by one and the ≈øame commi≈ø≈øion. As there is nothing expre≈ø≈øly ≈øaid, or even implied in this commi≈ø≈øion, of more than one order to be impowered by it; not the lea≈øt intimation, that the powers it contains are to be divided, and the whole given to one order, and part only to another; and finally, as it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent to ≈øuppo≈øe, that two or more officers, the one ≈øuperior, the other ≈øubordinate, ≈øhould be vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated and appointed by one and the ≈øame commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, we may I think, fairly conclude, that one order of go≈øpel mini≈øters, and only one, is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and impowered by this commi≈ø≈øion; con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that all the powers contained in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion belong to that one order, and that of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination among the re≈øt. I pre≈øume therefore, my argument from the one commi≈ø≈øion, ≈øtill ≈øtands good, notwith≈øtanding all Mr. L. has ≈øaid again≈øt it.</p>
               <p>I HAD ≈øaid in my ≈øermon, "that the apo≈øtles in their extraordinary character, had no ≈øucce≈ø≈øors." This Mr. L. calls "a bold a≈ø≈øertion," and demands "what evidence I had produced to ≈øupport it."<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Page 29.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. As the a≈ø≈øertion is a negative, had no evidence been produced, it would hardly have de≈øerved the epithet of "bold." According to the rules of argumentation, the proof lies upon tho≈øe who affirm a fact, not upon tho≈øe who deny it. Had Mr. L. however, carefully read over the page in my ≈øermon, from whence he pretends to quote the pa≈ø≈øage, he mu≈øt have ≈øeen the evidence he demands. My words are the≈øe,
<q>It mu≈øt be remembered that the apo≈øtles ≈øu≈øtained a twofold
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031609_0050_0FED5AAFF9F15FC0"/>character; the one extraordinary as apo≈øtles, the other ordinary as go≈øpel mini≈øters. In their extraordinary capacity, they were immediately called by Chri≈øt. Were ≈øent forth by him to be witne≈ø≈øes of his re≈øurrection.‚ÄîWere endowed with extraordinary gifts of the Holy Gho≈øt, the knowledge of tongues, the power of di≈øcerning ≈øpirits, and of working miracles. They were not limitted to any particular place, one more than another, for the exerci≈øe of their mini≈øtry; but had the whole world a≈ø≈øigned them as their charge; and being under the infallible guidance of divine in≈øpiration, they had the ≈øuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and government of all the churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, until the canon of ≈øcripture ≈øhould be full, and compleat rules given for that purpo≈øe in the word of God. In this they had no ≈øucce≈ø≈øors, but this part of their office expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them≈øelves: For as there is now no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion for the≈øe extraordinary powers, ≈øince the ≈øcripture is ≈øufficiently atte≈øted, its canon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, and every thing nece≈ø≈øary for the in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and government of the church, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly revealed; ≈øo there are no men ≈øince the times of the apo≈øtles, who can lay any claim to the≈øe extraordinary and miraculous powers; and therefore none can pretend to be ≈øucce≈ø≈øors to them in that part of their <hi>character</hi> which was founded on the≈øe powers.</q>‚ÄîThis was the ≈øen≈øe in which I a≈ø≈øerted "the apo≈øtles had no ≈øucce≈ø≈øors," and the≈øe the rea≈øons I a≈ø≈øigned for ≈øuch a≈ø≈øertion; and to me they appear conclu≈øive. As this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary character of the apo≈øtles had its ri≈øe in the extraordinary circum≈øtances, attending them, and was founded in the extraordinary powers be≈øtowed upon them, it mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily have cea≈øed, if the circum≈øtances and powers have cea≈øed, on which it was founded; but that the latter have cea≈øed, Mr. L. will not deny: For whatever powers they
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031609_0050_0FED5AAFF9F15FC0"/>claim for their bi≈øhops, the pretended ≈øucce≈ø≈øors of the apo≈øtles; I think that of working miracles is not one of them. If he can produce any in≈øtance of that kind ≈øufficiently authenticated, they ≈øhall be properly noticed; if not, he mu≈øt not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, if people look upon the claim a little a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuming, nor pretend the "a≈ø≈øertion is more bold" than true, if the right to a≈ø≈øume the character ≈øhould happen to be denied.<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">
                     <p>This a≈ø≈øertion "that the apo≈øtles as ≈øuch, have no ≈øucce≈ø≈øors, which Mr. L. calls "an opinion which has nothing to ≈øupport it but the prejudices of education," is no way peculiar to pre≈øbyterians. The learned Spanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, though a zealous prelati≈øt, in his di≈øpute with the papi≈øts again≈øt the Pope's ≈øupremacy as Peter's ≈øuce≈ø≈øor, maintains that the apo≈øtolic character is founded in an in mediate call, the gift of tongues, and power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, and is not perpetuared.
<q>Let the Pope, ≈øays he, now de≈øcend from the capitol. Let him, as did the apo≈øtles, declare that he has the gift of tongues divinely infu≈øed. Let him bring vi≈øibly the gifts of the Holy Gho≈øt from heaven. Let him work like the apo≈øtles, ≈øuch illu≈øtrious miracles, and then we ≈øhall yield that he has <hi>apo≈øtolic authority.</hi>
                        </q> He adds.
<q>They are much deceived who would bring the apo≈øtles down to the order of particular bi≈øhops. They were not at all called apo≈øtles, on the account that they were bi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, and con≈øequently, apo≈øtle and bi≈øhop are quite different things.</q>

OUR author's next attack upon this argument of the one commi≈ø≈øion, is from the order of deacons, whom the apo≈øtles, he ≈øays, by virtue of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, con≈øtituted and ordained.

But as <hi>apo≈øtles,</hi> as divinely in≈øpired, and under the infallible gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Holy Gho≈øt, they had power to do it. And in this capacity, and this only, they act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they in≈øtituted this office. As therefore, it was not in virtue of, or by power derived from the general mini≈øterial commi≈ø≈øion, that this office of deacons was in≈øtituted; ≈øo there can be no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument brought from their appointment, in proof of two or more offices virtuated by this commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion; con≈øequently, my argument, "that where there is but one commi≈ø≈øion, one order only can be virtuated or impowered by it," ≈øtill ≈øtands good.</p>
               <p>I READILY allow "the office of deacon, to be
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031609_0052_0FED5AFF9D517288"/>inferior to that of <hi>apo≈øtle.</hi>" I grant "it is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in which the power of ordination is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded." And if it will plea≈øe him, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede too, that they may in a general ≈øen≈øe, be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "mini≈øters in Chri≈øt's church." But then, as they are ≈øo, not by virtue of the general commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion given to mini≈øters as <hi>mini≈øters of the word and ≈øacraments;</hi> but by the expre≈øs appointment of the apo≈øtles, acting in their <hi>apo≈øtolic</hi> character; this will afford no argument in favour, either of his preaching deacons, or of his notion that two or more orders are impowered by this one commi≈ø≈øion. ‚ÄîLet him ≈øhew in this commi≈ø≈øion, or el≈øewhere, as particular an account of the appointment of their two orders of bi≈øhops and pre≈øbyters, as we can produce of the in≈øtitution of deacons. Let him produce as expre≈øs warrant for deacons preaching, from the account of their fir≈øt in≈øtitution, as we have for that of pre≈øbyters, in the general mini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial commi≈ø≈øion; and we will readily allow their ≈øcheme of dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy to be warranted by ≈øcripture: 'Till then, he mu≈øt not be offended if people call it by its true and proper name, an un≈øcriptural ≈øcheme that has no countenance from the word of God.</p>
               <p>BUT he tells me, that I undertook to prove the right of people to choo≈øe their own mini≈øters, from the in≈øtance of deacons being cho≈øen by the church. "Now, ≈øays he, if the≈øe deacons were mini≈øters, it proves that there was more than one order of mini≈øters at that time: If they were not, it does not prove the point for which he brought it."<note n="¬ß" place="bottom">Page 30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Deacons being called mini≈øters in a general ≈øen≈øe, agreeable to the original import of the word DIACONOS, will not prove them to be mini≈øters in the ≈øen≈øe of the commi≈ø≈øion, that is, <hi>mini≈øters of the word and ≈øacraments.</hi> If ≈øo, Mr. L. mu≈øt admit of a <hi>fourth</hi> order into their prie≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031609_0052_0FED5AFF9D517288"/>viz. that of ≈øhe-mini≈øters: For the apo≈øtle calls Phoebe a <hi>mini≈øter,</hi> (DIACONON) "of the church of Cenchrea."<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Rom. xvi. 1.</note> Con≈øequently, calling deacons <hi>min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øters</hi> in this <hi>general ≈øen≈øe,</hi> will not prove "that there was more than one order of mini≈øters, <hi>in the proper ≈øen≈øe,</hi> at that time." And yet their being mini≈øters in this general ≈øen≈øe, that is, officers or ≈øervants of the church, and as ≈øuch, cho≈øen and elected by the church, affords a good argument in proof of the church's right to choo≈øe her own of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in general, and con≈øequently tho≈øe who are to mini≈øter in the word and ≈øacraments in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. This in≈øtance therefore, of the deacons elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the church does as effectually "prove the point for which I brought it," as if they had been mini≈øters in the mo≈øt ≈øtrict and appropriate ≈øen≈øe of the word. Thus my arguments for but one order of go≈øpel mini≈øters, ≈øtand, I tru≈øt, fully vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated from this cavil al≈øo.</p>
               <p>THOUGH deacons, in the general ≈øen≈øe above, may be called mini≈øters, yet 'tis plain from their original in≈øtitution they never were de≈øigned to be mini≈øters of the word. The occa≈øion of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and the bu≈øine≈øs they were appointed to do, is there expre≈ø≈øly ≈øaid to be, "to ≈øerve ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,"
<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts vi. 1‚Äî4.</note> and that with a ≈øpecial expre≈øs view that the apo≈øtles being relea≈øed from this care; might be at liberty to pur≈øue their proper work, to "give them≈øelves to prayer and the mini≈øtry of the word." Who can once imagine then, that preaching is any part of the deacons bu≈øine≈øs? That when the apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles found, that "≈øerving tables" was incon≈øi≈øtent with and too much for the mini≈øters of the word, and accordingly in≈øtituted the order of deacons to ea≈øe them of that burden, they ≈øhould neverthele≈øs devolve the whole burden of both upon the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons they had appointed? The apo≈øtles them≈øelves were not ≈øufficient for both; but the deacons whom
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:031609_0053_0FED5B08B115A4B0"/>they appointed, it ≈øeems were, if the doctrine of <hi>preaching deacons</hi> be true. When the deacon is employed in his proper work, I know no body that "de≈øpi≈øes him" (as Mr. L. complains.) It is an honorable office in the church, and ought to be ≈øo e≈øteemed. But when he leaves his bu≈øine≈øs, and becomes "a bu≈øy body in other mens matters;" when he invades an office the ≈øcripture never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned him, and pre≈øumes to preach as a mini≈øter of the word; if he is not to be <hi>de≈øpi≈øed</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, mo≈øt certainly he ought to be <hi>rebuked</hi> for his ra≈øhne≈øs and pre≈øumption.</p>
               <p>IN my argument from the one commi≈ø≈øion, I had the≈øe words. "Who hath a right to divide the powers Chri≈øt has evidently connected in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, and give the whole to one order of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øters, and but half to the other; or rather to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a new order of officers in the church which the go≈øpel knows nothing of?" From the≈øe la≈øt words Mr. L. attempts to prove, that I have cut my≈øelf off from a regular ordination. For if either the bi≈øhops or pre≈øbyters in their church, are this "new order which the go≈øpel knows nothing of;" as we derive our ≈øucce≈ø≈øion from the bi≈øhops of their church, by whom our fir≈øt mini≈øters in this country were ordained, we mu≈øt, he ≈øuppo≈øes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it from this new order, and therefore our ordinations mu≈øt be null.<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Page 31.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. When any officers in Chri≈øt's church, in addition to the powers granted them in the go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, engro≈øs and exerci≈øe tho≈øe which do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, they are ≈øo far forth "a new order which the go≈øpel knows nothing of." This I take to be the ca≈øe with dioce≈øan bi≈øhops. They ingro≈øs and monopolize the whole power of ordination and government, which the go≈øpel leaves, in common, to all go≈øpel mini≈øters. In doing this, they u≈øurp a power, which does not belong to them, and in
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031609_0053_0FED5B08B115A4B0"/>the exerci≈øe of this u≈øurped power, are "an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the go≈øpel knows nothing of." This, however, does not nullity tho≈øe actions, which the go≈øpel impowers them to perform. Now one of the≈øe is ordination. Though therefore, in <hi>ingre≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole power of ordination,</hi> &amp;c. to them≈øelves, they act as "a new order of which the go≈øpel knows nothing of," becau≈øe they have no right ≈øo to do; yet barely in <hi>ordaining,</hi> they are an order which the go≈øpel owns, becau≈øe, by the go≈øpel, they have a right to ordain. Again, when an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of officers, from principle, neglect a part of the duties of their office, and which their commi≈ø≈øion obliges them to do; they are ≈øo far forth; "a new order which the go≈øpel knows nothing of." This is the ca≈øe of the pre≈øbyters in the epi≈øcopal church. Con≈øidered as ≈øet apart to the mini≈øtry by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are lawful go≈øpel mini≈øters. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered as abridging them≈øelves of one half of the powers that belong to them, as living in a ≈øtate of ≈øervile ≈øubjection to the bi≈øhop by their oath of canonical obedience; and preaching, not in virtue of Chri≈øt's commi≈ø≈øion, but the bi≈øhops licence; they are merely of human in≈øtitution, a "new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the go≈øpel knows nothing of." But until it is proved, that an officer's pretending to claim and exerci≈øe a power which he has not, de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troys and nullifies the power which he lawfully has; Mr. L's con≈øequence, as to the unlawfulne≈øs of my ordination, will by no means follow. If a ju≈øtice of the peace ≈øhould pretend to engro≈øs all the authority of his brother-ju≈øtices in a whole county, 'tis plain in ≈øo doing, he would be an officer which the law knew nothing of. This, however, would not invalidate tho≈øe acts, which, as a ju≈øtice, the law impowered him to do. The Pope, with his impious and un≈øcriptural claim of infallibility and univer≈øal dominion, over the whole
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031609_0054_0FED5B055287D5E0"/>chri≈øtian church, I hope Mr. L. will allow, is an officer which the go≈øpel knows nothing of: And yet he, and all other advocates for uninterrupted ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, mu≈øt derive it from him, or upon their own principles, they can have no claim to the mini≈øterial character. However therefore this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his, might move one to pity its wealt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. I find nothing in it to make us "a≈øhamed of proper bea≈øting in the mini≈øterial authority we have received."</p>
               <p>IN page 28 of my ≈øermon, I argued, that as a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and ju≈øtice of the peace being different of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, mu≈øt be impowered by different commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, ≈øo if there were different degrees of office in the go≈øpel mini≈øtry, we might rea≈øonably expect different commi≈ø≈øions, authorizing them to the≈øe offices.</p>
               <p>TO this Mr. L. replies, that a governor, by virtue of the king's commi≈ø≈øion, can authorize a ju≈øtice of the peace and other officers, and ju≈øt ≈øo the apo≈øtles, by virtue of their commi≈ø≈øion from Chri≈øt, "can authorize men of different orders to act in Chri≈øt's name."<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Page 32.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Though a governor can authorize a ju≈øtice and other officers which the laws of the king or con≈øtitution have appointed, yet he can create no new officer in the ≈øtate. So in the other ca≈øe. Though the apo≈øtles could ordain ≈øuch officers as the go≈øpel had appointed, yet they could make no new ones, different from, or in addition to tho≈øe which the laws of Chri≈øt's kingdom, and the go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel con≈øtitution have e≈øtabli≈øhed. We know it was agreeable to the go≈øpel con≈øtitution, that they ≈øhould appoint the office of deacon; becau≈øe they have in fact done it. Be≈øides this, we read of no other order appointed by them. If there be any, it belongs to our opponents to produce them.‚Äî When Chri≈øt a≈øcended, he left only his eleven apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031609_0054_0FED5B055287D5E0"/>in commi≈ø≈øion; all of one order, all equal in power. Had two or more orders been nece≈ø≈øary in the go≈øpel mini≈øtry, he "who was faithful in all his hou≈øe," would certainly have appointed them, or left orders with his apo≈øtles to do it. As he has not; as neither he nor his apo≈øtles have in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, except deacons, any more than one order or officers in the go≈øpel church, 'tis a certain con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence there are no other. And therefore Mr. L's plea, from what the apo≈øtles were "impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to do in authorizing different orders," is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpo≈øe. What they were "impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to do," we mu≈øt judge from what they have in fact done. And as, in fact, they have, be≈øides deacons, appointed no other order, we may ≈øafely pre≈øume they were not impowered by Chri≈øt to appoint any other. As to the three orders which he ≈øays, they appointed in the church of Jeru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, it has already been con≈øidered and refuted, and his a≈ø≈øertion proved to be groundle≈øs.</p>
               <p>HIS next attack upon me, is for ≈øaying, "that pre≈øbyters have a right to govern the church."‚Äî This, he ≈øays, "I labour hard to prove."<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Page 32.</note> 'Tis true I mentioned this occa≈øionally, and, I think, ≈øufficiently proved it, without any "hard labour." He him≈øelf allows them ≈øome power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. "That they have a right, in ≈øubordination to "their apo≈øtle or bi≈øhop, to govern their own flocks."<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Page 32.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. What kind or degree of government, the mi≈ø≈øionary of Norwalk, as a <hi>≈øimple</hi> pre≈øbyter, pretends to, or what manner of di≈øcipline he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øes over the <hi>flock</hi> there, I am not able to ≈øay. This, however, I can ≈øay, that if he exerci≈øes any di≈øcipline at all, as a ruler in the church, it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out book. The canons of his church and the rules of his order, having allowed nothing of this kind to him, but re≈øerved the whole affair to his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. If therefore he ≈øhould pre≈øume to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:031609_0055_0FED5B0A667A72D8"/>any ≈øuch power, and take it upon him to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline any of his unruly <hi>flock,</hi> "I can't ≈øay, (to u≈øe his own words to me) how they will reli≈øh the≈øe high claims of his." If he ≈øhould ever attempt any thing of this kind;‚Äî"unle≈øs he does it under the ≈øpecious pretence of oppo≈øing <hi>pre≈øbyterians,</hi>"‚Äî "and his people ≈øhould once come to be cool, he mu≈øt take a great deal of pains, and u≈øe much art, to bring them tamely to ≈øubmit to this his claim of authority over them."</p>
               <p>FOR the direct proof of the pre≈øbyters right of government, the reader is referred to the latter part of this, and the next ≈øection. In the mean time there is one ≈øentence more in this paragraph, which de≈øerves a remark. It is this:‚Äî"If he will allow our bi≈øhops, the ≈øame power over the pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, that the apo≈øtles exerci≈øed over their pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, we will contend for no more in their behalf."</p>
               <p>ANSWER. 'Tis granted the apo≈øtles exerci≈øed authority over tho≈øe he calls pre≈øbyters, in the age in which they lived. But the ≈øame did they al≈øo, over tho≈øe be calls bi≈øhops; particularly over Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus. If this then is any argument in proof of three orders in the church, in proof of the bi≈øhop's authority over the pre≈øbyter now, it equally proves the nece≈ø≈øity of four orders, and will as effectually e≈øtabli≈øh the authority of the Pope over all other bi≈øhops, as it will theirs over pre≈øbyters. But the authority the apo≈øtles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øed over other go≈øpel mini≈øters, whether pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or bi≈øhops, or by whatever name they were called; they did it, not as ordinary mini≈øters of the church, not as an order to be perpetuated; but as apo≈øtles, as officers divinely in≈øpired, &amp;c.‚Äî When therefore Mr. L. can prove his bi≈øhops, to have the ≈øame immediate mi≈ø≈øion, miraculous powers, infallible guidance, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which con≈øtituted the apo≈øtolic character and ≈øuperior au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; it will be then time enough for him to make, and us to grant the above demand.</p>

MR. L. next imputes to me an argument, for ≈øupport of our ordination, that I never u≈øed. He ≈øays "I take a great deal of pains to prove, and often repeat it, that the power of the apo≈øtles, to ordain and govern, was not expre≈ø≈øed, but only implied in their commi≈ø≈øion."
<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Page 32, 33, 34.</note> "This, he ≈øays<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> I do in order to prove that the fir≈øt mini≈øters of this country had power to ordain, though no ≈øuch power was expre≈ø≈øed, in the commi≈ø≈øion they received from the bi≈øhops that ordained them."<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Page 32, 33, 34.</note> Though I never thought of this argument he here frames for me, yet as he advanced ≈øome things in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon it, which may tend to mi≈ølead the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive, it may be proper to make a few ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon what he here offers.‚ÄîHe fir≈øt tells me, that to the account of the commi≈ø≈øion in Mat. xxviii.

               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Great weight. I am ≈øen≈øible, is laid by the advocates for prelacy, upon the≈øe words of our Saviour, "as my father hath ≈øent me," &amp;c. The warm patrons of epi≈øcopacy, pretend here to find, the bi≈øhops exclu≈øive right to the power of ordination, &amp;c. Though by what logic, is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to ≈øay. Papi≈øts, from the ≈øame text, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ≈øacrifice of the ma≈øs. For as God the Father ≈øent Chri≈øt to offer a ≈øacrifice for lin; ≈øo Chri≈øt ≈øent his apo≈øtles, and they others, to offer the ≈øacrifice of the ma≈øs, that is, the real fle≈øh and blood of Chri≈øt in the ≈øacrament of the ≈øupper. So that the≈øe words will prove almo≈øt any thing and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:031609_0056_0FED5B344B718CD8"/>every thing. Now though I don't conceive the mini≈øterial commi≈ø≈øion, to be contained in the≈øe words, but rather in tho≈øe of Matt. xxviii. Yet if it will gratiry Mr. L. I am willing, for once, to allow it; to allow the commi≈ø≈øion to be collected from both. But then I don't ≈øee what ≈øervice it will be to his cau≈øe. For though the power of <hi>government</hi> is rather more particularly expre≈ø≈øed, in John's account than tho≈øe in Matthew's; <hi>the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power,</hi> about which we are contending, is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as clearly expre≈ø≈øed in Matthew as in John: Of rather, it is expre≈ø≈øed in neither. However, tho' the commi≈ø≈øion in Matthew, ≈øays nothing expre≈ø≈øly about ≈øending others; yet the promi≈øe of Chri≈øt's perpetual pre≈øence, annexed to the commi≈ø≈øion, nece≈ø≈øarily ≈øuppo≈øes it, as I ≈øhewed in my ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; con≈øequently the ordaining power is fairly implied in the commi≈ø≈øion. But the utmo≈øt that can be pretended in John's account, is barely as implication of ≈øuch power. Mr. L. ≈øuppo≈øes that the power "of ≈øending others," is expre≈ø≈øed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>

               <p>ANSWER. If there is but one mini≈øterial commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, as has been proved, then all who are lawfully ordained, are ve≈øted with this commi≈ø≈øion, and all the powers it contains, of which ordination is one,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031609_0057_0FED5B246F02DDC8"/>let the intention of the ordainers be what they will. The bi≈øhops, who ordained our fir≈øt mini≈øters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, I hope, to make them lawful mini≈øters of Chri≈øt, and inve≈øt them with his commi≈ø≈øion; and moreover, u≈øed words ≈øufficiently expre≈ø≈øive of ≈øuch intention. If they did not do this in our ca≈øe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they, I pre≈øume, in that of Mr. L. and his brethen: They are therefore not lawful mini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Chri≈øt, not being ve≈øted with his commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion. But if this was done in the ca≈øe of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was equally ≈øo in that of the former; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently they were ve≈øted with Chri≈øt's general commi≈ø≈øion and with all the powers of it, and tho≈øe of ordination and government among the re≈øt.</p>
               <p>As a proof of but one order in the mini≈øtry, I mentioned, in my ≈øermon, the elders of the church of Ephe≈øus, Acts xx. and ≈øaid, "the intire gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and government of the church was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the≈øe elders, without any mention of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>IN the fir≈øt place,‚ÄîI find this power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contained in the <hi>name,</hi> by which the≈øe elders are there called. The apo≈øtle expre≈ø≈øly calls them

                  <hi>our≈øelves.</hi> He tells them they were made, EPISCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POUS, bi≈øhops, over this church, and that by the Holy Gho≈øt. This name includes in it the power of rule or guidance. It is rendered, by the be≈øt lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cographers, by <hi>epicopus,</hi> bi≈øhop, <hi>in≈øpector,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpector, <hi>prae≈øes,</hi> a pre≈øident or chief ruler. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it is the very name that epi≈øcopalians have appropriated to the highe≈øt order of their clergy, the bi≈øhops; and that as peculiarly expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive of the power of government or chief rule.‚Äî If therefore their bi≈øhops, as ≈øuch, are ve≈øted with the power of government, the≈øe elders are al≈øo; for they are expre≈ø≈øly called <hi>bi≈øhops;</hi> and were made ≈øuch even by the Holy Gho≈øt. Doubtle≈øs the Holy Gho≈øt, in making them bi≈øhops, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them the whole power of bi≈øhops, and this of government among the re≈øt. Mr. L. allows, tho≈øe who are made bi≈øhops, by other bi≈øhops in their church, or even by the grand <hi>pontiff</hi> at Rome, to be inve≈øted with the power of governing the church. But to the≈øe bi≈øhops at Ephe≈øus, who were made ≈øuch by the Holy Gho≈øt; he will not allow any ≈øuch power. How partial is this, to ≈øay no more? This power of government therefore is included in the very <hi>name</hi> by which the≈øe elders are called.</p>
               <p>AGAIN. It is included, and that expre≈ø≈øly, in the charges the apo≈øtle gives them. The words are, "to <hi>feed</hi> the flock of God, POIMAINEIN.

What the poor gentleman's <hi>amazement</hi> aro≈øe from, whether from the overbearing lu≈øtre of the evidence he oppo≈øed, or from what other cau≈øe; ≈øure I am, he has gro≈ø≈øly perverted the meaning of this text, by ≈øo confidently a≈ø≈øerting, that <hi>nothing concerning the government</hi> of the church, is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; when that is the very thing the apo≈øtle gives them in charge; and that by a word as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øive of it, as perhaps, any in the New-Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>THE whole of what our author calls "his direct proof of epi≈øcopacy," turns upon "the directions given by the apo≈øtle to Timothy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with his charge to the elders of Ephe≈øus." "There are ≈øome things, ≈øays he, given in charge to the≈øe elders, in common with Timothy: Such as,‚Äîto take heed to them≈øelves and to their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine," &amp;c.

Fort hey, he allows, received charges and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the apo≈øtle, though not ≈øo <hi>many</hi> and <hi>important</hi> as Timothy did. But the≈øe, whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele≈øs he owns were proper bi≈øhops, received no ≈øuch charges. Either therefore he mu≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the epi≈øcopal character of James, Epaph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roditus, &amp;c. and give up his argument for epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy thence ari≈øing; or el≈øe he mu≈øt allow the≈øe elders of Ephe≈øus to the bi≈øhops, and ≈øo give up his pre≈øent argument; or finally, which will amount to the ≈øame, mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe Timothy to be ≈øupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to both, and, by divine right, an arch-bi≈øhop, a prince, apo≈øtle or Pope. Nay further, as there
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031609_0061_0FED5B5519170CC8"/>are no ≈øuch particular directions and <hi>important</hi> charges, in ≈øcripture, given, even to the twelve apo≈øtles them≈øelves, as are here given to Timothy, it mu≈øt follow, from this argument, that Timothy was ≈øuperior even to them. And that although he received his directions and charges from the apo≈øtle Paul, he was neverthele≈øs Paul's ≈øuperior: For we no where find ≈øuch particular directions and <hi>important</hi> charges given even to him, as are here given to Timothy. Thus this argument for Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>othy's ≈øuperior power and character, while it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives the Ephe≈øian bi≈øhops of pa≈øtoral authority, at the ≈øame time cuts off all others mentioned in ≈øcripture, even the apo≈øtles not excepted, from any claim to the powers of ordination and government.</p>
               <p>THERE is no way, I conceive, to get clear of this difficulty, upon his ≈øcheme, but only by ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing, that though the apo≈øtles had not the≈øe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular directions given them that Timothy had, yet all the powers that belong to the pa≈øtoral or epi≈øcopal function are included in their general commi≈ø≈øion given them by Chri≈øt, and this is ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to con≈øtitute them proper bi≈øhops.

They al≈øo were ve≈øted with the powers included in the mini≈øterial commi≈ø≈øion given by Chri≈øt, and be≈øides, had a particular charge given by the apo≈øtle, which, as I ≈øhall ≈øhew anon, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily ≈øuppo≈øed the≈øe powers. Either therefore this argument intirely cuts off the apo≈øtles, and all others mentioned in the go≈øpel, from any claim to the powers of ordination and government, and leaves.

               <p>THIS power therefore mo≈øt certainly they had.

<pb n="125" facs="unknown:031609_0063_0FED5B3BC8357C78"/>given to them, as in that given to him. Be≈øides, Timothy him≈øelf was certainly ordained by ≈øuch elders, as has been already proved, and therefore the≈øe elders had the ≈øame power to ordain.</p>
               <p>AND as to "the one ≈øolemn charge more" ≈øo very remarkable, mentioned by our author as given to Timothy, viz. "of keeping the commandment till the coming of Chri≈øt," ≈øince he him≈øelf tells us "that this is of like nature with the promi≈øe to the apo≈øtles, <hi>that Chri≈øt would be with them to the end of the world;</hi>" it is evident from what he expre≈ø≈øly allows el≈øewhere, that this mu≈øt belong to the≈øe pre≈øbyters, equally with Timothy, even upon ≈øuppo≈øition Timothy was their ≈øuperior.‚Äî For, ≈øpeaking of this promi≈øe, he ≈øays; "though it might with more propriety be confined to the apo≈øtolic office, than to the other, i. e. that of pre≈øbyters; yet we allow that it extends to <hi>both,</hi> as <hi>both</hi> are to continue to the end of time." As this charge therefore is what he calls, when applied to Timothy, "a charge, not merely per≈øonal, but ≈øuch as had relation to the office he ≈øu≈øtained;" and as this, according to him, "is <hi>peculiar</hi> to tho≈øe officers of Chri≈øt, who have power to con≈øtitute other officers in the church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>" it undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from his own conce≈ø≈øion, that the≈øe elders, even though inferior to Timothy, had power to con≈øtitute or ordain other officers in their church; "for to <hi>their</hi> office, he tells us, was the promi≈øe and charge given, as well as to that of the apo≈øtles, ≈øince both are to continue to the end of time;" con≈øequently the≈øe elders, having his <hi>own</hi> charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri≈øtic of tho≈øe who had power to con≈øtitute others, mu≈øt be inve≈øted with the power of ordaining by his own conce≈ø≈øion: And ≈øo upon his own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, pre≈øbyterian ordination is ≈øcriptural, "and, to u≈øe his own words, the di≈øpute is at an end."</p>
               <p n="4">4. THAT Timothy could not be the bi≈øhop of Ephe≈øus, left there with ordaining power, &amp;c. is
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:031609_0064_0FED5B5C5ACBCD60"/>evident from Mr. L's own definition of an officer ve≈øted with that power. For he tells us "that at the time in which the ≈øcriptures were wrote, none had power to ordain mini≈øters in Chri≈øt's kingdom, but tho≈øe only who are in <hi>≈øcripture</hi> called <hi>apo≈øtles.</hi>" Again:‚Äî"Let it be carefully remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that tho≈øe who were commi≈ø≈øioned to ≈øend others, were called <hi>apo≈øtles</hi> in the time when the New-Te≈øtament was penned."<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Page 10.</note> This then, with him, is ab≈øolutely <hi>e≈ø≈øential</hi> to the character of tho≈øe who had power to ordain at that time, viz. that they are in <hi>≈øcripture</hi> called apo≈øtles. But now Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy is no where in ≈øcripture called an apo≈øtle, and therefore, according to his own definition, could not be left at Ephe≈øus with power to ordain. Pity it is he had not thought of this. It would have ≈øaved him all the learned labour of his "direct proof of epi≈øcopacy." And though it would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of the plea≈øure of tho≈øe confident tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, with which the conclu≈øion of it is orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and robbed him of the applau≈øe which his zealous admirers lavi≈øh upon this part of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance more e≈øpecially; yet, in the judgment of the impartial, "his book would have been as good as it is now, though not quite ≈øo long."</p>
               <p>BUT perhaps he will endeavour to prove, for he told us he de≈øigned it, though it ≈øhould ≈øeem, he afterwards forgot his promi≈øe, "that Timothy was admitted to the apo≈øtolic office." But if he was, why is he never called an apo≈øtle? Paul fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently joins him with him≈øelf, in the in≈øcription of his epi≈øtles.

'Tis true he ≈øoon left Baerea, and followed Paul to Athens. Acts xvii. 15.

And in the ≈øecond epi≈øtle, which was written not long after the fir≈øt, it is mo≈øt probable, from chap. iv. ver≈øe 12, that he had left Ephe≈øus already: But if he had not, 'tis certain he then left it; for the apo≈øtle there calls him away to Rome, and ≈øends Tychicus, another evangeli≈øt to Ephe≈øus. 2 Tim. iv. 9, 12; 21.

But it would be tedious to follow him, in all
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031609_0066_0FED5B120BB49CD0"/>his travels to ≈øo many different places. Enough has been mentioned of his unfixed, itinerant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, to ≈øhew he was an evangeli≈øt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be a fixed re≈øident officer in any church. The ≈øame might be ≈øhewn as to Titus, whom epi≈øcopalians make to be bi≈øhop of Crete, barely becau≈øe the apo≈øtle, for ≈øome ≈øhort time, left him there for certain purpo≈øes. There is the cleare≈øt evidence from ≈øcripture, that they were both of them impowered in the work of the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli≈øts. And as this was utterly incon≈øi≈øtent with their ≈øu≈øtaining a relation to any particular church, as their fixed pa≈øtors or bi≈øhops, 'tis a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence they did not ≈øu≈øtain ≈øuch relation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all our author has argued in ≈øupport of epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, from the≈øe directions given to Timothy, is nothing to his purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As the ≈øcripture is wholly ≈øilent as to this notion of Timothy's epi≈øcopal care of Ephe≈øus; ≈øo there is nothing in any of the ancient fathers to ≈øupport this opinion, but much to the contrary.‚ÄîDr. Whitby, who was well read in the fathers, confe≈ø≈øes, as I ≈øhewed in my ≈øermon, "that as to the great controver≈øy, whether Timothy and Titus were indeed bi≈øhops, the one of Ephe≈øus, the other of Crete, he could find nothing of this matter in any writer of the fir≈øt centuries, nor any intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they bore that name." He adds indeed, "that this defect is abundantly ≈øupplied by the concurrent ≈øuffrage of the fourth and fifth." "But the≈øe, as Dr. Chauncy ju≈øtly ob≈øerves, were times too far di≈øtant from Timothy and Titus, to be relied on for the truth of this fact; e≈øpecially, as in the≈øe times they had greatly departed from the ≈øimplicity of the go≈øpel."<note n="*" place="bottom">Dud. Lec. page 51.</note> And if Mr. L's quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from Iraeneus be true, this ≈øilence of the fathers for 300 years, c√≥ncerning the fact in que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a certain evidence it never did exi≈øt. Irae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus's
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031609_0066_0FED5B120BB49CD0"/>words, as quoted by our author, are,‚Äî"We can reckon tho≈øe bi≈øhops who have been con≈øtituted by the apo≈øtles, and their ≈øucce≈ø≈øors, all the way to our time. We have the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of the bi≈øhops, to whom the apo≈øtolic church was committed in every place."<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Page 51.</note> Now ≈øince, Iraeneus lived in the ≈øecond century; if they had in his time, as he declares, "the true ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of bi≈øhops in <hi>every</hi> church, and yet in there is nothing to be found of Timothy and Titus the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion for Ephe≈øus and Crete, as Dr. Whitby a≈ø≈øerts; 'tis an undeniable con≈øequence that they never were bi≈øhops of the≈øe churches, let the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in following ages ≈øay what they will to the contrary.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, it is evident from eccle≈øia≈øtical hi≈øtory, that the apo≈øtle John was at Ephe≈øus, and <hi>re≈øided</hi> there for a con≈øiderable time after Paul's departure thence, and after the writing the fir≈øt epi≈øtle to Timothy, on which his pretended epi≈øcopacy over that church is founded.

Con≈øequently all attempts to prove epi≈øcopacy from this argument are to no purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. AND la≈øtly, we need not recur to eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hi≈øtory for proof of this point. The ≈øacred ≈øcriptures abundantly prove, that not Timothy, but the elders of Ephe≈øus, were the true and only <hi>bi≈øhops</hi> of this church. This is evident from the account given of them in Acts xx. 17, 36. Before this. Paul had been ≈øucce≈øsfully labouring for near three years in and about Ephe≈øus. Great numbers
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031609_0067_0FED5B2EAC3B45D0"/>had been converted to the faith. A flouri≈øhing church gathered, and elders ordained. And now that the apo≈øtle was about to leave them, never to ≈øee them more; as one deeply concerned for them, ≈øince he could not vi≈øit the church in per≈øon, he ≈øends for the elders of it, preaches his farewell ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them, and gives him his la≈øt directions and charge, in a mo≈øt ≈øolemn and moving addre≈øs.‚ÄîIn all which there is not one word mentioned, or the lea≈øt hint given, of ≈øetting a <hi>≈øingle</hi> per≈øon over them as their bi≈øhop. So far from this, the whole government of the church is expre≈ø≈øly committed to <hi>them</hi> and them only, in a ≈øtate of equality. And what is remarkable, though Timothy was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly now pre≈øent, not a ≈øingle word is ≈øaid of his relation to this church. No directions are given to <hi>him</hi> as the governor of it, nor the lea≈øt hint mentioned to the≈øe elders, to con≈øider and obey him as their ≈øuperior: But <hi>they,</hi> the elders, are the only per≈øons mentioned as the appointed offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in it. They are expre≈ø≈øly called its <hi>bi≈øhops;</hi> yea are declared to be appointed ≈øuch by the Holy Gho≈øt. The care and guidance of the church, in all things, is committed to them, and they are, in the mo≈øt ≈øolemn manner, charged to ≈øeed, teach, <hi>rule and govern</hi> it, as its only proper pa≈øtors or bi≈øhops. And what puts the matter beyond di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, they are commanded to do this with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs view to prevent the future di≈øorders which the apo≈øtle fore≈øaw, were about to ari≈øe in this church, by "grievous wolves, men ≈øpeaking perver≈øe things," "thru≈øting them≈øelves in," "to draw away di≈øciples after them." This is the expre≈øs rea≈øon a≈ø≈øigned for giving this charge. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, they are commanded to <hi>watch,</hi> to <hi>rule</hi> and govern the flock committed to their care, and exerci≈øe that authority, which, as its proper pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or bi≈øhops, they are ve≈øted with, in warning their people again≈øt tho≈øe grievous wolves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:031609_0067_0FED5B2EAC3B45D0"/>the≈øe gain≈øayers, or by exerci≈øing their pa≈øtoral authority, in way of di≈øcipline; to put to ≈øilence the≈øe corrupt teachers. But now how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øi≈øtent will all this appear, if they were not the pa≈øtors, but only the ≈øubject pre≈øbyters of this church, as our author affirms? What propriety, in giving them, and them only, this ≈øolemn charge, when they had no power, no authority to comply with the mo≈øt e≈ø≈øential branches of it? How ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurd, to direct them in the government and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of this church, both as to private members and corrupt teachers, when they could exerci≈øe no authority over either, and at the ≈øame time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to omit Timothy, to whom, and only whom, upon the epi≈øcopalian ≈øcheme, the whole of this bu≈øine≈øs belonged? The ≈øuppo≈øition is ridiculous. It de≈øtroys the whole force of the apo≈øtle's rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and renders his di≈øcour≈øe quite impertinent.</p>
               <p>THE apo≈øtle, no doubt, had a tender concern for the future welfare and good government of this church. He had long pre≈øided over it in per≈øon. He was now taking his final leave of its officers, never to ≈øee them more.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 25.</note> The elders under≈øtood him in this ≈øen≈øe. They took leave of him, as their apo≈øtolic father, in a manner mo≈øt tender and affecting, with many tears. "Sorrowing mo≈øt of all for the words which he ≈øpake, that they ≈øhould ≈øee his face no more."<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Ver. 38.</note> This then was the proper time, to provide for the future gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this church and its officers; to provide a <hi>≈øingle</hi> per≈øon to ≈øucceed him in the government of it, had this been the ≈øcripture model, as our opponents pretend. Had this been the go≈øpel plan, certainly Paul would not have concealed it from the≈øe elders, e≈øpecially at ≈øuch a time as this. He called them to record, "that he was pure from the blood of all men," "that he had kept back nothing that was profitable for them, nor ≈øhunned
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031609_0068_0FED5B07044EC880"/>to declare unto them, the whole coun≈øel of God."<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Ver. 20, 26, 27.</note> And then immediately adds, "that the Holy Gho≈øt had made them the <hi>fixed</hi> over≈øeers, <hi>bi≈øhops</hi> or pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this church," without ≈øo much as hinting that any one was to pre≈øide over them. Had <hi>epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> "been profitable to them," the apo≈øtle mu≈øt have known it. Had it been any part of the "coun≈øel of God," he mu≈øt have told them ≈øo; for he "kept back nothing of that." Now was the proper time to have done it when he was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them his la≈øt, his parting directions. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before, nor now, does he mention a word of any ≈øuch thing. On the contrary, he expre≈ø≈øly commits to the≈øe pre≈øbyters, in a ≈øtate of parity, the whole government of this church, which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øhews, that dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy was no part of "the coun≈øel of God," and therefore not of divine in≈øtitution.</p>
               <p>IN this view of the ca≈øe, the <hi>directions</hi> given to Timothy, while at Ephe≈øus, (if indeed he was there when he received them) will nothing weaken the force of this conclu≈øion: And yet on them, the whole ≈øtrength of Mr. L's argument depends.‚ÄîFor, granting he was there, when he received the≈øe epi≈øtles; yet all ≈økillful chronologi≈øts agree, they were wrote, long before the convention of Paul, and the elders at Miletus; and mo≈øt probably, before the church of Ephe≈øus was ≈øettled according to go≈øpel order, with pre≈øbyters appointed in it. If this was the ca≈øe, the <hi>directions</hi> mu≈øt be ≈øent to Timothy, for there was no other officer to whom they could be ≈øent. His ≈øtay, however, at Ephe≈øus, was but ≈øhort at the longe≈øt. He was ≈øoon called away by the apo≈øtle, and there is no account that he ever returned. If he did, it could not be as their bi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op; for this office was conferred upon the elders, by the expre≈øs direction of the Holy Gho≈øt. Ve≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this office, the apo≈øtle found them, when
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:031609_0068_0FED5B07044EC880"/>they met him at Miletus; and in full po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it, he left them, when he took his final leave of them, never to ≈øee them more. Judge then, who is to be credited in this ca≈øe; our author, who ≈øays the≈øe elders were only ≈øimple pre≈øbyters, without any pa≈øtoral authority in this church; or the apo≈øtle, who expre≈ø≈øly charges them, to exerci≈øe ≈øuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the government of it!‚ÄîMr. L. who confidently a≈ø≈øerts, that Timothy was their only bi≈øhop, to whom they and the church of Ephe≈øus were ≈øubjected, as their ≈øingle pa≈øtor or over≈øeer; or St. Paul, who a≈ø≈øures us, that the≈øe were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Holy Gho≈øt, in parity, the <hi>over≈øeers</hi> or <hi>bi≈øhops</hi> of this whole flock!‚Äî"Look into the ≈øcriptures. Judge for your≈øelves. If what I have advanced, is not fact, it may be ea≈øily expo≈øed. If it is an undeniable truth, it is a truth of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, if religion be ≈øo."</p>
               <p>I AM now prepared for a few remarks upon ≈øome ≈øelect pa≈ø≈øages in this part of Mr. L's defence, which will conclude this ≈øection.</p>
               <p>HE enquires,‚Äî"If the elders of Ephe≈øus had power to ordain and govern, what need of <hi>≈øending</hi> Timothy there?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 43.</note> 
                  <hi>leaving</hi> him there, he ≈øhould have ≈øaid.‚ÄîI an≈øwer,‚Äî</p>
               <p>IT does not appear from ≈øcripture, that this church had any ≈øettled pa≈øtors at this time. But if it had, they needed the divine directions concerning ordination and government, contained in the≈øe epi≈øtles to Timothy, as much as we do at this day. And who more proper to receive, and put them in execution, than an evangeli≈øt, an extraordinary officer, and a faithful companion of Paul? But till he can prove that Timothy was le≈øt there, as a re≈øident pa≈øtor over that church, as fully as I have, that the elders were, this will be no ≈øervice to his cau≈øe. Barely his being <hi>≈øent to</hi> Ephe≈øus, will not prove this. If ≈øo, Tychicus al≈øo was their
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031609_0069_0FED5B3D776BA328"/>bi≈øhop, for he was ≈øent there as well as Timothy. And upon the ≈øame principle, Timothy mu≈øt have been bi≈øhop al≈øo of Corinth, The≈ø≈øalonica, Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, &amp;c. for to all the≈øe was he ≈øent as well as to Ephe≈øus. This would be to make him a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati≈øt</hi> as well as a <hi>non-re≈øident,</hi> and exhibit a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat idea of modern epi≈øcopacy.‚ÄîAgain,‚Äî</p>
               <p>HE demands a proof from facts recorded in ≈øcripture, "that <hi>mere</hi> pre≈øbyters, in virtue of their office as ≈øuch, did ordain officers in the church of Chri≈øt."<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Page 46, 47.</note>‚ÄîAn≈øwer.</p>
               <p>IF by <hi>mere</hi> pre≈øbyters, he means, ≈øuch as tho≈øe in his church, profe≈ø≈øedly ≈øubjecting them≈øelves to bi≈øhops, and di≈øclaiming all pa≈øtoral authority in ordination and government; none will pretend to prove from ≈øcripture that ≈øuch ever did ordain.‚ÄîAnd good rea≈øon for it. The ≈øcripture knows of no ≈øuch order. But if he means ≈øcripture-pre≈øby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ≈øuch as tho≈øe at Ephe≈øus; pre≈øbyter-bi≈øhops, ≈øuch as Timothy and Titus were directed to ordain; I have already proved, ≈øuch pre≈øbyters did in fact ordain, and that by virtue of their office. Of this ≈øort were tho≈øe, who ordained Paul, Barnabas and Timothy, as I have already proved, <hi>by expre≈øs facts recorded in ≈øcripture.</hi> And what is more:‚ÄîThe ≈øcriptures plainly ≈øhew, that none but ≈øuch ought to ordain; they being the only mini≈øters, author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized by Chri≈øt's general commi≈ø≈øion, and ve≈øted with all the powers it contains.</p>
               <p>WHAT he quotes from Mr. Beach, re≈øpecting our fir≈øt mini≈øters, who were ordained by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh bi≈øhops, is no valid objection again≈øt this, even allowing that there was no expre≈ø≈øed inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either in the ordainers, or ordained, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the power of ordination. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt, not the intention of the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is what conveys the power in ordination, as I ≈øhewed in my ≈øermon. I now add:‚ÄîThe≈øe fir≈øt
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031609_0069_0FED5B3D776BA328"/>mini≈øters of New-England were ordained, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, in the ≈øame manner as Mr. L. and his brethren were. Either therefore he is no mini≈øter of Chri≈øt, not being ve≈øted with his commi≈ø≈øion in ordination: Or if the words u≈øed in his ordination, were ≈øufficiently expre≈ø≈øive of ≈øuch inve≈øtiture, in his ca≈øe; they were equally ≈øo in that of our mini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; con≈øequently, they were cloathed with all the powers the commi≈ø≈øion contains, of which that of ordination is confe≈ø≈øedly one.</p>
               <p>As to the other part of this objection, the oath of canonical obedience; though it is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, that this, as he affirms, includes in it "a ≈øolemn promi≈øe never to ordain others;" yet allowing it did, ≈øuch promi≈øe, being evidently ≈øinful, can't be binding upon con≈øcience, but is <hi>ip≈øo facto</hi> null and void. A number of the Jews bound them≈øelves by ≈øolemn oath, "not to eat or drink till they had killed Paul."<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xxiii. 12.</note> If this oath was binding, it was their duty to keep it; con≈øequently, murder is a duty. For the murder of Paul or of them≈øelves, was a nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence of their keeping this oath. But if it was not binding in this in≈øtance, no more was it in the ca≈øe he ≈øuppo≈øes, con≈øequently the objection is of no force.</p>
               <p>MR. L. ≈øays,‚Äî"Nothing is now claimed by our bi≈øhops, but the very ≈øame that St. Paul gave in charge to Timothy.

HIS fir≈øt <hi>extract</hi> is, from that truly <hi>ancient apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic father,</hi> arch-deacon Echard of England, who flouri≈øhed about A. D. 1699. But what purpo≈øe this <hi>extract</hi> is de≈øigned to ≈øerve, the reader mu≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine for him≈øelf, for I am not able to help him.</p>
               <p>HIS next is from Eu≈øebius. He, I own, is one of the <hi>fathers;</hi> but far from being an <hi>ancient</hi> one: For he lived in the fourth century. And as he him≈øelf tells us, in his hi≈øtory, "that he could trace no foot≈øteps of any going before him, only in a few narratives,"<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Lib. I. cap. 1.</note> there is little dependence upon what he ≈øays, of things ≈øo remote from his time. However, the pa≈ø≈øage quoted is this:‚Äî"St. John, being by Domitian's death, relea≈øed from bani≈øhment, returned, and took the care of the church of Ephe≈øus; and upon the invitation of the neighbouring <hi>churches, who had enjoyed only the mini≈øtry of pre≈øbyters and deacons,</hi> he went to them, and con≈øecrated bi≈øhops," &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. L's def. page 49, 50.</note> I have carefully examined the pa≈ø≈øage in Eu≈øebius, Mr. L. refers to; but find it very different from what he has quoted. None of the words, ≈øet down in italics, are to be found in the original. The pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage truly rendered, is as follows. Speaking of John, he ≈øays,‚Äî"After the tyrant's death, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Ephe≈øus; and being invited ≈øo to do, went al≈øo among the neighbouring nations, where he appointed bi≈øhops, e≈øtabli≈øhed regular and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat churches, electing to the clerical office whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever the Holy Gho≈øt pointed out for the ≈øame."<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Eu≈øeb. eccl. hi≈øt. Lib. III. cap. 23.</note> Though I will not charge Mr. L. with di≈øhone≈øty, in thus pretending to quote from Eu≈øebius, what is not to be found in him; ≈øince 'tis po≈ø≈øible he might not have <hi>lei≈øure to con≈øult the original,</hi> but taking the tran≈ølation upon tru≈øt, ≈øet down the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage as he found it, in ≈øome epi≈øcopal writer; yet every one mu≈øt ≈øee, the words added, in Mr. L's
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:031609_0071_0FED5B4B85A9B500"/>quotation, intirely alter the ≈øen≈øe of the pa≈ø≈øage, and make it evident it was done, by <hi>≈øomebody,</hi> to favor epi≈øcopacy, and impo≈øe upon the unlearned reader. With the addition of the words,‚Äî"who had enjoyed only the mini≈øtry of pre≈øbyters and deacons;" the pa≈ø≈øage does indeed <hi>≈øeem</hi> to favour the doctrine of three orders in the mini≈øtry; but let it be read without this corrupt addition, and then let the intelligent reader judge, what it is to Mr. L's purpo≈øe; or whether any other eight lines, taken at random, from Eu≈øebius, or any other author, will not as effectually prove epi≈øcopacy, as the≈øe here quoted? Stripped of this addition, the pa≈ø≈øage mentions but one officer, viz. a bi≈øhop in the≈øe churches; and as that, in ≈øcripture, means the ≈øame as pre≈øbyter, by his own conce≈ø≈øion, it can be nothing to his purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p>HIS next quotation is from Irenaeus,‚Äî"That Polycarp was con≈øtituted by the apo≈øtles in A≈øia, <hi>bi≈øhop</hi> of the church at Smyrna." An≈øwer:‚ÄîSt. Paul, who≈øe authority is at lea≈øt equal to that of Irenaeus, tells us, "that the Holy Gho≈øt con≈øtituted the elders of Ephe≈øus, <hi>bi≈øhops</hi> of the church of Ephe≈øus." If therefore Polycarp's being calle I bi≈øhop, proves him ≈øuch in Mr. L's ≈øen≈øe of the word; the≈øe elders mu≈øt be ≈øo too. But then what becomes of his main argument for prelacy, from Timothy's being bi≈øhop of Ephe≈øus? Or if he ≈øtill denies the≈øe elders to be bi≈øhops, though they are called ≈øo, the ≈øame he mu≈øt do as to Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp's. And ≈øo this <hi>extract</hi> fails him al≈øo.</p>
               <p>BUT he tells us, the de≈øign of Irenaeus was to prove a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of apo≈øtolic doctrines, "but his argument is equally good in favor of a ≈øucce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of bi≈øhops." And this, he ≈øays, will prove "that bi≈øhops were ≈øuperior to pre≈øbyters." An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer:‚ÄîNot till he proves there were, be≈øides the≈øe here called bi≈øhops, any pre≈øbyters in that church for them "to be ≈øuperior to." Irenaeus, in
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:031609_0072_0FED5B182697F970"/>the pa≈ø≈øage quoted, mentions but one order only. This <hi>extract</hi> therefore, is ≈øo far from helping Mr. L's ≈øcheme of three orders, that it is wholly in favour of our's which has but one.</p>
               <p>THE ≈øame an≈øwer al≈øo will ≈øerve, for his three next <hi>extracts</hi> from Irenaeus. As there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in either of them, of more than one order, viz. bi≈øhops, nor the lea≈øt hint given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any other; it mu≈øt be pre≈øumed, that Irenaeus knew of none, but ≈øuch bi≈øhops or pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters as are mentioned in ≈øcripture. Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the doctrine of three orders, and Mr. L's dioce≈øan bi≈øhop, was a ≈øtranger in the time in which this father lived. I ≈øhall only ju≈øt add:‚ÄîThat Mr. L's <hi>tran≈ølator,</hi> has again ≈øerved him ill. For in the fir≈øt of the≈øe quotations the words of Irenaeus, as recited by Eu≈øebius, are not "that Clement is he of whom mention is made Philip. iv. 3," as Mr. L. has it; but "that Linus is he, of whom Paul makes mention in his epi≈øtle to Timothy."<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Eu≈øeb. eccl. Hi≈øt. lib. v. cap. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>HIS next <hi>extract</hi> is from Jerom,‚Äî"Quid facit except√° ordinatione, epi≈øcopus, quod pre≈øbyter non facit?" "What can a bi≈øhop do, except ordination, that a pre≈øbyter may not do? Had Mr. L. an≈øwered this que≈øtion, according to his own principles, the reader would, at once, have ≈øeen, how very little it was to his purpo≈øe. For is there nothing in the church of England, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation excepted, but what is common to the pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter and bi≈øhop? Certainly there is Mr. L's bi≈øhop can confirm, hold ≈øpiritual courts, exerci≈øe di≈øcipline, &amp;c. But is a pre≈øbyter allowed to do tho≈øe? Nothing le≈øs. But Jerom does not even in≈øinuate, that <hi>ordination</hi> belongs only to the bi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op, by <hi>divine right.</hi> And had Mr. L. read the epi≈øtle, from whence the≈øe words are taken, he mu≈øt have ≈øeen, that the whole ≈øcope of it is to
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031609_0072_0FED5B182697F970"/>prove, that in the apo≈øtles times, bi≈øhop and pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter were the ≈øame, both in name and office.‚ÄîThis he a≈ø≈øerts, in ≈øo many words, and proves it from the ≈øame texts and topics, as are u≈øed by pre≈øbyterians at this day; and then goes on to ≈øhew, how, when, and upon what occa≈øion the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church was altered afterwards. "That one was afterwards cho≈øen, who ≈øhould be ≈øet over the re≈øt, he tells us, was done as a remedy again≈øt ≈øchi≈øm."<note n="¬ß" place="bottom">Hieron. Epi≈ø. ad Evagr. Tom. II. p. 109.</note> When therefore he u≈øes the words Mr. L. has quoted, he evidently does it to ≈øhew "what was the practice of the church <hi>in his time;</hi>" not what prevailed in that of the apo≈øtles. 'Tis pity Mr. L. will not be at the pains of reading the fathers <hi>him≈øelf.</hi> It might, perhaps, ≈øave his friends many a blu≈øh upon his account.</p>
               <p>THE next church he mentions, as upon the epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal model, is that of Antioch. "In this, he tells us, was a number of believers, whom the apo≈øtles, Paul, and Barnabas, "took the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of for ≈øome time." Strange! Two bi≈øhops in one church at once! How different the <hi>modern</hi> epi≈øcopacy from the <hi>ancient!</hi> Formerly one church could boa≈øt two bi≈øhops, and both apo≈øtles. But their <hi>≈øucce≈ø≈øors,</hi> it ≈øeems, have made ≈øuch improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the prelatic art, that one bi≈øhop now will ≈øerve for more than an hundred. This mu≈øt be ancient epi≈øcopacy inverted. However, this was not the ca≈øe long. "Paul and Barnabas, he ≈øays, were ≈øoon ≈øucceeded by Peter." What, Peter bi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op of Antioch! We tho't he had been metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan of Rome. But this was not long. "Euodius ≈øoon takes his place; to whom ≈øucceeded Ignatius;" who≈øe epi≈øtles, we are told, contain the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del and marrow of modern epi≈øcopacy. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly our author is longer upon this favourite pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, than all the re≈øt of the fathers; though I
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:031609_0073_0FED5AFCDB313E20"/>think he gives us but one or two <hi>extracts</hi> from him, and them but ≈øhort.<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 52, 53.54, 55, 56.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As to the epi≈øtles a≈øcribed to Ignatius, Mr. L. mu≈øt know, if he has read Dr. Chauncy's ≈øermon, that they lie under very ≈øtrong ≈øu≈øpicions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, or at lea≈øt of great adulteration and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This the Dr. largely ≈øhews in his appendix, and offers ≈øuch arguments in ≈øupport of the charge, as makes it, at lea≈øt very highly probable, if not certain this was the ca≈øe. The≈øe, Mr. L. does not attempt to an≈øwer. He indeed tells us, "that bi≈øhops Beveridge and Pear≈øon have fully confuted, Me≈ø≈ørs. Daille, L'arroque, and all others, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have advanced again≈øt the≈øe epi≈øtles."‚ÄîAnd I can tell him "that L'arroque undertook to an≈øwer Beveridge and Pear≈øon, as appears by a manu≈øcript found among his papers, in which he had made great progre≈øs; but at the <hi>de≈øire</hi> of ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral per≈øons, who <hi>leaned too much to be epi≈øcopal cau≈øe,</hi> he did not fini≈øh this reply."<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Nov. Rep. Lit. Tout. l. Art. 5, p. 56, 57.</note> A victory obtained by ≈øuch arts as the≈øe, can do no great honour to the conquerors.

               <p>BUT if we ≈øhould allow the≈øe epi≈øtles to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, they will really make nothing in favour of dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy, but much again≈øt it. 'Tis true, they frequently mention bi≈øhops, pre≈øbyters, and deacons: But then it is equally true, that the bi≈øhop de≈øcribed in the≈øe, was e≈ø≈øentially different from the dioce≈øan one. The "Ignatian bi≈øhop" pre≈øided over but one ≈øingle church, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more than a congregational bi≈øhop, or pa≈øtor of a particular church: Whereas the dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øan one, pre≈øides over many ≈øcores or hundreds of congregations. Again,‚Äîthe former had much the ≈øame authority over his pre≈øbyters, as the rector
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031609_0073_0FED5AFCDB313E20"/>of a pari≈øh, in the church of England, has over his a≈ø≈øi≈øtant curates, who are not pretended to be of a different order, but have <hi>radically</hi> the ≈øame power with the rector: But the church of England bi≈øhop, is a≈ø≈øerted to be a different order from the pre≈øbyter; by divine right, ≈øuperior to him, and ve≈øted with the ≈øole power of ordination and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. A few <hi>extracts</hi> from the≈øe epi≈øtles will ≈øerve to prove this. "Let all follow the bi≈øhop as Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and the pre≈øbyters, as the apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles."‚Äî"Let none do any of tho≈øe things which belong to the church without the bi≈øhop."‚Äî"Where the bi≈øhop appears, let the multitude, or congregation be."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ignat. Epi≈øt. ad Smyrn. ≈øec. 8, page 37.</note> "If the prayer of one or two have ≈øo much efficacy, how much more the prayer of the bi≈øhop, and the whole church?

But it is impo≈ø≈øible for a modern dioce≈øe, con≈øi≈øting of ≈øome hundreds of congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to attend divine ≈øervice in one place.</p>
               <p>AGAIN:‚ÄîIt is plain, from the≈øe epi≈øtles, that the ≈øacraments were not to be admini≈øtered, but in the pre≈øence of the bi≈øhop. "Let that euchari≈øt be accounted valid which is celebrated in the bi≈øhop's pre≈øence, or by his permi≈ø≈øion; where the bi≈øhop appears, let the multitude be;‚Äîit is not lawful without the bi≈øhop, either to baptize or to

               <p>HE adds:‚Äî"In≈øtead of ≈øupporting this denial from the fathers, the Dr. has quoted the opinion of the moderns."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 60.</note> Mr. L. is quite mi≈øtaken in the de≈øign of the≈øe quotations. They were bro't only to ≈øhew, that in the ages po≈øterior to the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond century, and even after the e≈øtabli≈øhment of epi≈øcopacy, it was far from being indubitably clear, that this e≈øtabli≈øhment, and the practice upon it, had taken place upon the foot of a <hi>divine right.</hi>‚Äî And in this view there are none, I imagine, ≈øave Mr. L. and his party, but what will think them pertinent and conclu≈øive.</p>
               <p>IN an≈øwer to the Dr's demand "of an example of epi≈øcopal ordination within the two fir≈øt centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries," Mr. L. in≈øtances in the ordination of Titus by St. Paul."
<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Page 61.</note> But pray how came he by the knowledge that Paul ordained Titus? He affirms it, and that is all. If he had any proof, why did he not produce it? Sure I am, the ≈øcripture affords him none. But if it did, how will this prove he did it in the <hi>capacity</hi> of a bi≈øhop? Paul him≈øelf was ordained by pre≈øbyters: No doubt then he acted as a pre≈øbyter in ordaining Titus, if he acted at all.

               <p>ANSWER:‚ÄîThe≈øe directions given to Titus, no more prove him to be bi≈øhop of Crete, i. e. of a ≈øuperior order to the elders he was to ordain; than like directions given to Peter, prove him to be ≈øuperior to the other apo≈øtles. Be≈øides, tho≈øe

But if he was, how does this prove that he him≈øelf received epi≈øcopal ordination? This, if I under≈øtand it, is Mr. L's argument: Titus him≈øelf was a bi≈øhop; therefore, he was ordained by one, or had epi≈øcopal ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But how does this follow? Paul and Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, he allows, were bi≈øhops: And yet, it has been proved, and that from ≈øcripture, that they were both ordained by pre≈øbyters.

               <p>AN example of epi≈øcopal ordination, not from ≈øcripture, but from the fathers of the two fir≈øt centuries, was what was demanded. Mr. L. ≈øays he could produce many.

               <head>SEC. IX. <hi>Examination of Mr.</hi> L's <hi>appeal to the fir≈øt reformers for his divine right of epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi>‚Äîfrom page 61 to 65.</head>
               <p>IN both the pieces Mr. L. undertook to an≈øwer, it was ob≈øerved, that this doctrine "of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable divine right of epi≈øcopacy," was a ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the fir≈øt reformers, even in the church of England. This was done with a view to expo≈øe the bigotry of tho≈øe anathematizing zealots, the modern ≈øons of that church, who, like Mr. L. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church and unchri≈øtianize all the prote≈øtant world but them≈øelves. Sundry te≈øtimonies were adduced, from the fir≈øt reformers and latter writers of the church of England, both bi≈øhops and others, to prove that this was not the doctrine of that church, at the time of the reformation, and many years after.‚ÄîThat though for <hi>rea≈øons of ≈øtate,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the epi≈øcopal ≈øettlement in England; yet they did not look upon it to be of divine right, or ≈øo e≈ø≈øential as to nullify all ordinations, unle≈øs tho≈øe performed by bi≈øhops, in their ≈øen≈øe of the word. And it was particularly ≈øhewed, that the fir≈øt who publicly maintained that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable anti-chri≈øtian doctrine, was the famous arch-bi≈øhop Laud, of papi≈øtical and per≈øecuting memory; and that he was publicly rebuked by his ≈øuperior for ≈øo doing.</p>
               <p>MR. L. declares him≈øelf of the ≈øame principles, and undertakes to defend them, by an appeal to the fir≈øt reformers. Let us examine his proofs.</p>
               <p>HIS fir≈øt is from arch-bi≈øhop Cranmer, in the≈øe
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:031609_0083_0FED5B4150902878"/>words, "We read not that any, not being a bi≈øhop, hath, ≈øince the beginning of Chri≈øt's church, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a prie≈øt." If by bi≈øhop, is here meant a congregational bi≈øhop, all pre≈øbyterians will agree, that none but ≈øuch have power to ordain: But then it will be nothing to Mr. L's purpo≈øe.‚ÄîBut if a dioce≈øan bi≈øhop is intended, then all that Cranmer can be ≈øuppo≈øed to mean is, that the bu≈øine≈øs of ordaining has been confined to ≈øuch bi≈øhops, not as ≈øolely ve≈øted with that power by the law of Chri≈øt; but only by human appointment, and the cu≈øtom of the church. For bi≈øhop Burnet a≈ø≈øures us, that Cranmer's opinion was,‚Äî"That bi≈øhops and prie≈øts, were at one time, and were not two things, but one office, in the beginning of Chri≈øt's religion."
<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Hi≈øt. Refor. Vol. I. collec. page 223.</note> If they had one office, they had one and the ≈øame power: All therefore, that Cranmer intends is, that this work of ordination, which was originally common, had been, by the cu≈øtom of the church, appropriated to bi≈øhops. This interpretation makes Cranmer con≈øi≈øtent, whereas Mr. L's involves him in a plain contradiction.</p>
               <p>HIS next <hi>extract</hi> is from bi≈øhop Jewel, in the≈øe words,‚Äî"We believe that there be divers degrees of mini≈øters in the church, whereof ≈øome be dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, ≈øome prie≈øts, ≈øome bi≈øhops." That Jewel here only a≈ø≈øerts a matter of fact, or what were the officers then in the church, not a matter of right, or what ought to be by divine in≈øtitution, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what he ≈øays in his apology. Speaking of the various degrees of the clergy in Jerom's time, he ≈øays,‚Äî"Chri≈øt appointed not the≈øe di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of orders from the beginning."‚Äî"This is the thing <hi>we defend,</hi> St. Jerom ≈øaith, let bi≈øhops under≈øtand, they are in authority over prie≈øts, more by cu≈øtom, than by order of God's truth. A prie≈øt is the ≈øame with a bi≈øhop; they are both one thing, and the churches were at fir≈øt, governed by the
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031609_0084_0FED5B639AD48BA8"/>common advice of prie≈øts."
<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Apol. part. 2, c. 3.</note> This plainly ≈øhews that in the pa≈ø≈øage quoted by Mr. L. he does not mean to declare his <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>divine right</hi> of three orders; but only to a≈ø≈øert a matter of fact; and ≈øo is no proof that Jewel owned the divine right of epi≈øcopacy.</p>
               <p>BUT Mr. L. ≈øuppo≈øes, this is proved to be the doctrine of the reformers, from the preface to the book of ordination. "It is evident to all men diligently reading the holy ≈øcriptures, &amp;c.‚Äîthat there have been the≈øe <hi>three</hi> orders of mini≈øters," &amp;c.
<note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Page 63.</note> Upon which he ob≈øerves,‚Äî"It mu≈øt be evident to any man of common ≈øen≈øe, that the reformers, who compo≈øed this preface, believed the three offices of bi≈øhops, prie≈øts and deacons, to be of divine right, or none of them to be ≈øo; for they as po≈øitively a≈ø≈øert that all are, as that one is." An≈øwer:‚ÄîThey do not a≈ø≈øert that this one is. This preface only a≈ø≈øerts a matter of fact; that there had been ≈øuch orders from the apo≈øtles times. It does not declare that the≈øe three orders are of divine unalterable right:‚ÄîNor does it determine what kind of bi≈øhops were from the apo≈øtles times, whether dioce≈øan, or only parochial. And if Me≈ø≈ørs. Hoadly and Ollyffe, two epi≈øcopal divines, may be allowed to under≈øtand the ≈øen≈øe of this a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øertion, as well as Mr. L. it will be nothing to his purpo≈øe. Mr. Ollyffe in his an≈øwer to Mr. Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ≈øpeaking of this very preface, ≈øays,‚Äî"The propo≈øition of this rubrick is formed or expre≈ø≈øed, with as great a degree of latitude or moderation, as ever could be expected, from an epi≈øcopal church. <hi>It ≈øaith nothing of divine right or appointment.</hi> That is Mr. Calamy's addition, as Mr. Hoadly well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerves. It ≈øaith nothing of the di≈øtinction of their powers and officers; or whether they have been eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in every church or no: But only, that from the apo≈øtles times, there have been the≈øe orders,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:031609_0084_0FED5B639AD48BA8"/>&amp;c.‚ÄîFrom which, the mo≈øt that can be inferred is, that in ≈øuch churches where there has been need of them, or occa≈øion for them all, there have been three ≈øuch ranks of mini≈øters, for the government and in≈øtruction of Chri≈øt's church, from the times of the apo≈øtles; which yet by Mr. Calamy's leave, <hi>does not prove a divine appointment</hi> of all, (however otherwi≈øe it may appear to him) there having been other things, in the apo≈øtles days, which yet, for all that, are not allowed to be of divine appointment." Here we ≈øee Mr. L's uncharitable interpretation of this preface, as though it meant to nullify all ordinations, ≈øave tho≈øe of the epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal kind, ≈øtands expre≈ø≈øly condemned, by two celebrated divines of his own church. As their interpretation is more charitable and chri≈øtian-like, than Mr. L's; I pre≈øume every per≈øon of candor will judge it the true one; and con≈øequently, that his argument, founded on ≈øuch a ≈øtingy interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, can't be admitted as proof, that the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable compilers of this preface, were of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and ≈øchi≈ømatical principles.</p>
               <p>THOUGH they here ≈øpeak of three orders in the church, yet they no where ≈øay, that bi≈øhops are by divine right, ≈øuperior to pre≈øbyters:‚ÄîNor is there the lea≈øt intimation, that they looked upon all ordinations to be null and void, unle≈øs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a bi≈øhop. For though they ≈øay "no man ≈øhall be accounted a lawful bi≈øhop, unle≈øs admitted according to the form there pre≈øcribed;" yet this is expre≈øily limitted <hi>"to that church of England."</hi> All therefore that can be meant by this, is no more than a declaration, who they will allow to be accounted <hi>lawful bi≈øhops of the national church of England:</hi> But this is no proof that they believed the divine right and ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy, or accounted tho≈øe churches to have no valid mini≈øtry and ordinances, that are without it, as Mr. L. does. The contrary of this,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031609_0085_0FED5B5148FBA6F0"/>is undeniably evident from their practice, as I ≈øhall ≈øhew.</p>
               <p>OUR author's la≈øt argument, to prove that the <hi>reformers</hi> were of his uncharitable ≈øentiments, in this point, is taken from the 3d, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th, canons of their church, which he has quoted at large.
<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Page 63, 64, 65.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As the canons of the church of England, as they now ≈øtand, were compo≈øed at ≈øundry times; at periods far di≈øtant one from another; ≈øome in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, ≈øome in that of King James, &amp;c.‚ÄîMr. L. ≈øhould have told us which cla≈øs, tho≈øe he has quoted belonged to: For if they were among the number of tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øed in King James's reign; they can't be ≈øaid to exhibit the ≈øentiments of the <hi>fir≈øt reformers,</hi> who had no hand in making them, being dead many years before. As he has not ≈øeen fit to do this, I might ju≈øtly forbear any further notice of them, as being noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purpo≈øe of his argument.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, allowing they were of the fir≈øt cla≈øs, they will by no means prove, that the compilers of them believed the unalterable divine right of epi≈øcopacy, and denied the validity of pre≈øbyterian ordination. The ≈øub≈øtance of them is, (for they are too long to tran≈øcribe) "that if any per≈øon ≈øhould deny the church of England to be a true church, or declare her government by bi≈øhops, &amp;c. to be anti-chri≈øtian, or repugnant to the word of God, or upon that account, or any other, ≈øeparate him≈øelf from her communion, he ≈øhall be <hi>ip≈øo facto</hi> excommunicated." But now there is nothing in the≈øe canons, that will prove the authors of them believed dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy, to be of unalterable divine right. They might think it to be <hi>lawful,</hi> though not expre≈ø≈øly of <hi>divine in≈øtitution;</hi> much le≈øs that it was <hi>ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary</hi> to the being of the church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="unknown:031609_0085_0FED5B5148FBA6F0"/>
As to the <hi>charity</hi> of ≈øuch excommunicating, anathematizing canons, I mu≈øt leave it to the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Mr. L. and tho≈øe of his ≈øtamp: For as to my≈øelf, I utterly de≈øpair of ≈øucceeding in any attempt of that kind. Americans, ble≈ø≈øed be God, have hitherto been unacquainted with ≈øuch <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> canons. Their fulminations in this land, are heard, only like the di≈øtant thunders of the <hi>vatican.</hi> ‚ÄîHad not Mr. L's zeal for epi≈øcopacy, got the better of his prudence, I ≈øhould have judged he would have been more tender of the reputation of his <hi>be≈øt con≈øtituted</hi> church, than thus to expo≈øe her nakedne≈øs, by bringing to view the≈øe <hi>notable</hi> canons, in a country where they are ≈øo little known. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his de≈øign was to let us know what we are to expect, if the ≈øcheme for ≈øending bi≈øhops to Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, erecting ≈øpiritual courts, &amp;c. in the colonies, ≈øhould take place.‚ÄîBut to return:‚Äî</p>
               <p>THE above remarks, I tru≈øt, make it ≈øufficiently clear, that it cannot be proved, either from the preface to the book of ordination, or from the canons, or indeed from any thing el≈øe Mr. L. has quoted, that the reformers were of his ≈øentiments, as to the divine right of epi≈øcopacy. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the epi≈øcopal church, as e≈øtabli≈øhed by the king and parliament, as what they tho't <hi>lawful,</hi> though not <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> in it≈øelf, or of any ≈øcriptural or divine appointment.‚ÄîThat they did not look upon it as of divine in≈øtitution, is evident,‚Äî</p>
               <p n="1">1. FROM their <hi>expre≈øs declarations,</hi> both ≈øingly, and in a collective capacity. I have had occa≈øion already to cite ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages from bi≈øhops Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Jewel, in which they expre≈ø≈øly a≈ø≈øert it, as their judgment, "that bi≈øhop and pre≈øbyter, in ≈øcripture, is one and the ≈øame." The bi≈øhop of St. A≈øaph, Therlby, Redman and Cox, declared them≈øelves of the ≈øame opinion. Bi≈øhop Morton, in his catholic apology, declares, "that the power of order and juri≈ødiction, which the papi≈øts a≈øcribe
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031609_0086_0FED5B4E83FE27E0"/>to bi≈øhops, doth, <hi>by divine right, belong to all other pre≈øbyters.</hi> And particularly, that, <hi>to ordain,</hi> is their <hi>ancient right.</hi>"
<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Cited by Mr. Boy≈øe, Anc. Epi≈øco. page 12.</note> Bi≈øhop Bedel ≈øays, "that a bi≈øhop and pre≈øbyter are all one, as Jerom proves from ≈øcripture and antiquity."

               <p>THESE things, I mentioned in my ≈øermon, to which Mr. L. has made no reply. I now ≈øubmit it to the candid reader, whether it is po≈ø≈øible to ≈øuppo≈øe, that men who could expre≈øs them≈øelves in this manner, were of Mr. L's principles, "that dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy is of divine right," "and that all ordinations by pre≈øbyters, are a mere nullity."</p>
               <p>MR. L's letter-writer, S. J. tells us,‚Äî"the ≈øentiments of the fir≈øt reformers, are not to be learnt from ≈øome tran≈øient expre≈ø≈øions of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, but from their public acts." I have here produced in≈øtances of both, in which, as indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, and as public bodies, they give their te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for the ≈øcriptural divine rights of pre≈øbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ordination and government, in terms, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs and po≈øitive, as can well be conceived.‚Äî From the≈øe te≈øtimonies it evidently follows, that epi≈øcopacy was not e≈øtabli≈øhed in England, at the time of the reformation, upon the foot of <hi>divine right;</hi> but only as a form of government, ≈øuited to the civil in≈øtitution of the ≈øtate by which it was e≈øtabli≈øhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS fact further appears from the <hi>practice</hi> of the church of England, con≈øequent upon ≈øaid e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabli≈øhment. It is not denied that there have been ≈øome particular members of that church, all along, from the <hi>pontificate</hi> of arch-bi≈øhop Laud, to the pre≈øent day, who, like Mr. L. have e≈øpou≈øed this uncharitable doctrine <hi>of the divine right</hi> of epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and the invalidity of all mini≈øterial authority and go≈øpel admini≈øtrations, where this is wanting. But that this is not the <hi>doctrine of the church of England,</hi> appears from her repeated practice to the contrary, in admitting mini≈øters to officiate in that church, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In the ≈øame reign, Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Martin Bucer, and P.

               <p>Now is it not abundantly evident from the≈øe <hi>facts,</hi> that the church of England, <hi>as ≈øuch,</hi> is not of Mr. L's principles, as to the point in debate?

               <p>AGAIN:‚ÄîThe ≈øame was done, A. D. 1707, by the act of <hi>union,</hi> whereby England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were united into one kingdom.

               <p>IN this part of his work, our author pretends to give us ≈øundry <hi>extracts</hi> from the foreign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants: Not indeed to prove, that the≈øe foreign churches are of the epi≈øcopal kind. This he knew was impo≈ø≈øible: But though they are pre≈øbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans them≈øelves, yet that they do not allow our ordinations to be valid. Now, granting his quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from Calvin, Beza, Le Mayne, &amp;c. to be genuine; which, con≈øidering the freedom he u≈øes with other authors, is at lea≈øt very doubtful; they will by no means prove that the≈øe men denied the validity of ordination, even among the di≈ø≈øenters in England. What they ≈øeem to blame the old puritans for, is their ≈øeparating from the e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed church of England, not for maintaining pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian principles. Be≈øides, it is well known what arts were u≈øed in them times, by the ≈øticklers for uniformity, to ≈øolicit the opinion of foreign prote≈øtants in their favour, and get them to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance the ≈øeparation. "About this time, ≈øeveral letters pa≈ø≈øed, between the Engli≈øh divines, on both ≈øides, and ≈øeveral learned foreigners.‚Äî Matters were fal≈øely repre≈øented to them, and great arts were u≈øed, on the <hi>bi≈øhops</hi> ≈øide, to prevent ≈øuch per≈øons writing, who they found would not write in their behalf; and what they thought made for them, they publi≈øhed to the world in way of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:031609_0089_0FED5B4302DBBC38"/>The foreigners were told, that unle≈øs they complied with the things enjoined, they mu≈øt let in the papi≈øts to ≈øupply the cures. Several foreigners therefore dreading that, and hoping the≈øe things would ≈øoon be altered, ≈øpake more favorable of them than they de≈øerved."
<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Pierce's Vind. page 68.</note> Moreover, the≈øe foreign divines knew, that epi≈øcopacy was ≈øettled in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, not as of <hi>divine right,</hi> but only by <hi>civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> Having this view of the Engli≈øh hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, they might think it more advi≈øable for their brethren in England, to ≈øubmit to it, than to go into a ≈øeparation <hi>barely upon this account.</hi> For it is only on account of <hi>this,</hi> that they are, in Mr. L's quotations, ≈øuppo≈øed to ≈øeparate, and for which they are blamed. Whereas this was but one thing, among many, that cau≈øed the ≈øeparation. But what bu≈øine≈øs had Mr. L. with the di≈ø≈øenters of England? The pieces he attacks, undertook the defence of the New-England mini≈øtry, not that of the di≈ø≈øenters in England. There was no need of it. This has been repeatedly and ≈øucce≈øsfully done by many able writers of their own. Particularly by Me≈ø≈ørs. Baxter, Calamy, Pierce, and more lately the di≈ø≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gentlemen in an≈øwer to Mr. White. Be≈øides, who does he mean by "the di≈ø≈øenters in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?" If he intends New-England; bating a few anabapti≈øts and quakers, I know of no di≈ø≈øenters, ≈øave tho≈øe of his communion. Epi≈øcopacy never was e≈øtabli≈øhed here, though its oppo≈øite is, to the no ≈ømall mortification of our author and company. If therefore, the foreign divines had ≈øuch a regard to peace, as to advi≈øe their pre≈øbyterian brethren in England not to ≈øeparate, even from an epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal church, by law e≈øtabli≈øhed: Who can ≈øuppo≈øe they would not condemn Mr. L. and party, in ≈øeparating from the <hi>e≈øtabli≈øhed pre≈øbyterian churches</hi> here, and becoming <hi>epi≈øcopal di≈ø≈øenters?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031609_0090_0FED321A2CCEA078"/>to come to the que≈øtion, as he has ≈øtated it; that is, "whether our ordinations in this country are allowed to be valid by the foreign prote≈øtants?" In an≈øwering of it I will pur≈øue his method, and "examine their public con≈øtitutions, their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral practice, and their private ≈øentiments."</p>
               <p n="1">1. FROM the <hi>public con≈øtitutions</hi> of the foreign prote≈øtants, it is evident even to demon≈øtration, that they do and mu≈øt approve of our ordinations as <hi>valid.</hi> If they allow their own to be valid, they mu≈øt for this plain rea≈øon allow ours to be ≈øo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe their con≈øtitutions, at lea≈øt ≈øo far as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is concerned, are preci≈øely the ≈øame with ours.

I tru≈øt; need not be told that our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ≈øtrictly pre≈øbyterian, agreeable to our con≈øtitution: But the ≈øame is the con≈øtitution of the foreign churches. "The prote≈øtant churches abroad, ≈øays Mr. Boy≈øe,

               <p>Now can there be a more full and convincing
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:031609_0091_0FED5B44B2049890"/>evidence, of the≈øe foreign churches allowing of the validity of our ordination, than this univer≈øal agreement and te≈øtimony of their public con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this point? Mr. L. and tho≈øe of his ≈øtamp, though they renounce our ordinations, yet allow of tho≈øe performed in the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> church. The rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the principles of the papi≈øts, in this re≈øpect, are the ≈øame with theirs. Epi≈øcopacy is the doctrine of the church of Rome; the church of England therefore allow their ordinations to be valid, as being the ≈øame with her own. But now, with an evidence beyond exception it appears, that all the foreign prote≈øtants are ≈øtrictly of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as to the ordaining power; from whence it undeniably follows, that they mu≈øt allow and approve of our ordinations, as valid, becau≈øe they are the very ≈øame as are pointed out, in all their confe≈ø≈øions of faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS point is al≈øo evident from the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal <hi>practice</hi> of the foreign churches. All the Dutch churches throughout the united provinces, the prote≈øtant churches in France, tho≈øe of Geneva and the prote≈øtant cantons in Switzerland, &amp;c.‚Äî are utter ≈øtrangers to bi≈øhops, both name and thing. All their clergy are upon a level; all equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øing the power of ordination, and every other branch of mini≈øterial authority. And as to tho≈øe prote≈øtant churches which have officers they ≈øtile bi≈øhops, ≈øuperintendants or ≈øeniors; they are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than ≈øtanding moderators, pretending to no ≈øuperiority, by divine right, over their breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. "All the≈øe churches, ≈øays Dr. Stillingfleet, acknowledge no ≈øuch thing as the <hi>divine right</hi> of epi≈øcopacy, but ≈øtiffly maintain Jerom's opinion, of the primitive equality of all go≈øpel-mini≈øters."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Iren. page 411.</note> ‚ÄîNor can they do otherwi≈øe; having at bottom no other than pre≈øbyterian ordination among them: For Luther, Calvin, Bucer, Melancthon, Bugenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:031609_0091_0FED5B44B2049890"/>&amp;c.‚Äîand the fir≈øt reformers and founders of the≈øe churches, who ordained mini≈øters among them, were them≈øelves pre≈øbyters and nothing el≈øe.</p>
               <p>THIS again clearly proves, that they do in fact allow our ordinations to be valid; for they are the ≈øame with theirs. Theirs are performed by pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, pa≈øtors, by divine right, all in a ≈øtate of equality: The ≈øame al≈øo are ours. If therefore, they allow their own, they mu≈øt allow ours, which are the ≈øame. And that this is the ca≈øe in fact, is evident from particular in≈øtances of their practice. In Holland, tho' they allow a liberty of con≈øcience to tho≈øe of other denominations, yet no mini≈øters are ≈øupported by the public, but tho≈øe of their own profe≈ø≈øion: But it is an undoubted truth, as I am informed, that they do in fact ≈øupport one or more Scotch pre≈øbyterian mini≈øters, ju≈øt as they do their own. This plainly ≈øhews, that they look upon the pre≈øbyters in Scotland, as their brethren, of the ≈øame church with them≈øelves, and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably proves, that they allow of their ordination, and con≈øequently of ours in this country, which is the ≈øame. The Dutch churches therefore in Europe, beyond di≈øpute allow the validity of our ordinations. In America the ca≈øe is the ≈øame.‚Äî Here there are ≈øundry Dutch churches, originating from, and upon the ≈øame con≈øtitution, with the reformed prote≈øtant churches in Holland. The≈øe allow the validity of our ordinations. A number of years ago, a young gentleman of Dutch extract, came to New-Haven, and was ordained by our mini≈øters, at the College there, as a mini≈øter for the Dutch churches in the county of Albany.‚Äî This, as my author tells me, was done by order of the cla≈ø≈øis in Holland. The Rev. Mr. Woo≈øly, who was ordained by a number of Connecticut mini≈øters, over the church and congregation of Southold, on Long-I≈øland; after he left that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and removed to his plantation, in Oy≈øter-Bay,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:031609_0092_0FED5B21AFA91878"/>preached and admini≈øtered the ≈øacrament, in a Dutch church in that town, for twenty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The ≈øame did the Rev'd Mr. Ketteltas ≈øince. He was ordained mini≈øter of Elizabeth-Town, by the pre≈øbytery in New-Jer≈øey. After he left that people, at the invitation of ≈øundry Dutch churches in Queen's-County, Long-I≈øland, he officiated as their mini≈øter for ≈øome time. The ≈øame gentleman is now improved in the mini≈øtry, in the French prote≈øtant church in the city of New-York. Now the≈øe are ≈øo many expre≈øs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, in which our ordinations have been, in fact, acknowledged and allowed to be valid by the foreign prote≈øtant churches. And yet in direct oppo≈øition to this inconte≈øtible evidence, in the very face of the≈øe ≈øtubborn and ob≈øtinate facts, Mr. L. has the a≈ø≈øurance, ≈øhall I call it?

               </p>
               <p>WHEN Chri≈øt a≈øcended, he left the eleven apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, the only mini≈øters of his church; all ve≈øted with the ≈øame commi≈ø≈øion, all equal in power. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by this commi≈ø≈øion they went forth,‚Äî preached the go≈øpel, planted churches, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained mini≈øters in them; ve≈øted them with the ≈øame commi≈ø≈øion they them≈øelves bore. No ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is to be found of their fixing ≈øome in a ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, others in a ≈øubordinate ≈øtation. The min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øters they ordained, were all of one order, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øcuou≈øly called bi≈øhops, pa≈øtors, or elders. As the general commi≈ø≈øion is but one, ≈øo one method of introduction into office, one ≈øet of qualifications in order to it, one work or bu≈øine≈øs for them when introduced, and one only, is to be found in the word of God. This was the order fixed by Chri≈øt, and followed by his apo≈øtles. They invariably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to that divine maxim of the great head of the church,‚Äî"call no man your ma≈øter upon earth, for one is your ma≈øter in heaven, even Chri≈øt, and all ye are brethren." This was tran≈ømitted to the primitive chri≈øtians, and ob≈øerved in the pure≈øt and earlie≈øt ages of the church. A defection from this original <hi>parity,</hi> 'tis granted, pretty ≈øoon aro≈øe.‚Äî "The my≈øtery of iniquity began to work," even before the apo≈øtles were dead. A thir≈øt of domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and eccle≈øia≈øtical pre-eminence, early oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated among≈øt the mini≈øters of the meek and lowly JESUS. This increa≈øed from le≈øs to more, till "<hi>that</hi> man of ≈øin, the ≈øon of perdition, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth him≈øelf above all that is called GOD, or is wor≈øhiped," got him≈øelf fairly mounted upon the ≈øeven-headed bea≈øt, and en≈ølaved all chri≈øtendom with his u≈øurped dominion. From this yoke of anti-chri≈øtian tyranny, when great part of Europe
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031609_0094_0FED5B6A438EC058"/>was happily delivered, by the glorious light of the reformation, the ancient <hi>parity</hi> among mini≈øters, generally took place. By far the greate≈øt part of the prote≈øtant churches, recurred to the original ≈øcriptural plan of pre≈øbyterian order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And where in any in≈øtance, as in England, they adopted the epi≈øcopal mode, it was not under any pretence of divine right, but wholly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the form of government in the ≈øtate.</p>
               <p>THE above facts are indubitably clear, from ≈øcripture, and eccle≈øia≈øtical hi≈øtory, ancient and modern. On the≈øe facts the rea≈øonings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øions are founded, contained in the foregoing pages. For the truth of the facts I appeal to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic writings afore≈øaid. For the ju≈øtne≈øs of the rea≈øonings and conclu≈øions deduced from them, the candid reader is now to determine.</p>
               <p>IF dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy be of divine right, it is certainly contained in ≈øcripture. If it be of ≈øuch va≈øt importance, as is pretended, it mu≈øt be very clearly and expre≈ø≈øly revealed there. Doctrines of importance, truths e≈ø≈øential to religion, are not left to be collected barely from dark hints and doubtful expre≈ø≈øions; but are clearly revealed, and often repeated, in various modes of diction, "that he who runs may read them." But is this the ca≈øe with dioce≈øan epi≈øcopacy? The warme≈øt advocate for it, I pre≈øume, will not pretend it is. All that the learned labor of its able≈øt champions has hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto been able to produce, is barely ≈øome dark hints and doubtful expre≈ø≈øions, which a fruitful inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may turn to favour it; but the≈øe capable of a more rational interpretation upon the contrary ≈øcheme. And yet to this point of <hi>doubtful di≈øpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> the mo≈øt e≈ø≈øential doctrines and expre≈øs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of our holy religion, it ≈øeems, mu≈øt be made a ≈øacrifice. That men fulfil their promi≈øes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their covenant obligations, and religiou≈øly regard their ≈øolemn vows, is not only one of the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:031609_0095_0FED5B665E1468B0"/>fir≈øt dictates of natural religion; but very expre≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and repeatedly enjoined in the word of God. ‚ÄîBut when men, who have ≈øolemnly dedicated them≈øelves to the mini≈øtry in our churches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their ordination vows, and take epi≈øcopal orders: When profe≈ø≈øors among us, who ≈øolemnly promi≈øed and covenanted before God, angels and men, to walk in communion with us, rend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves oft, and join the epi≈øcopal ≈øeparation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of the divine right of epi≈øcopacy, who does not ≈øee that <hi>doubtful points</hi> are preferred to <hi>po≈øitive precepts;</hi> and that more weight is laid upon the former, than the latter? If this is not to ≈øub≈øtitute "mint, ani≈øe, and cummin, in≈øtead of the weightier matters of the law," 'tis indeed hard to ≈øay what is. And after all; what is gained, in point of <hi>valid mini≈øtry and or dinances?</hi> Why truly, upon their own principles, ju≈øt nothing at all. If our mini≈øters have no power, then our admini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations are invalid, our bapti≈øms a mere nullity. Tho≈øe therefore who have been baptized in our churches, are in a ≈øtate of mere heatheni≈øm, let them conform to what church they will. As this is the ca≈øe with mo≈øt of their mini≈øters in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they mu≈øt, upon this principle, be ≈øo far from being the only regular mini≈øters, that they are not even vi≈øible chri≈øtians; and in≈øtead of being the only per≈øons impowered to di≈øpen≈øe go≈øpel admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtrations, they have no right even to partake of them them≈øelves. Con≈øequently all they pretend to baptize, are ≈øtill in a ≈øtate of heatheni≈øm, and ≈øo all their mini≈øters and churches, as well as ours, in the ≈øame wretched and deplorable condition.‚Äî Who can ≈øuppo≈øe ≈øuch doctrines as the≈øe, are to be found in the bible? Who can imagine, claims and principles, productive of ≈øuch ≈øhocking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences, have any warrant from the go≈øpel of Chri≈øt? A moment's cool reflection, methinks, might ≈øhew their ab≈øurdity, and give a check to
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:031609_0095_0FED5B665E1468B0"/>the advocates of them, in their warme≈øt career of <hi>pro≈øelyting</hi> zeal. Verily, gentlemen, a little more con≈øi≈øtency of principle and conduct here, would not be ami≈øs. Let us fir≈øt ≈øee you concerned to ≈øecure for your≈øelves, a valid bapti≈øm: Then it will be time enough to pre≈øs us with the argument of your only valid mini≈øtry.

               <p>IF Mr. L. or any other, will ju≈øt remove the≈øe difficulties, and favour us with a ≈øolid, ≈øcriptural and thorough refutation of the foregoing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it will be kindly received, and properly noticed.
