            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Publick having been lately enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with a very dark and partial Account of this <hi>New Method</hi> of receiving the <hi>Small Pox;</hi> and this Account being given as is pretended, from the very Letters of Dr. <hi>Timonius</hi> and <hi>Pylarinus;</hi> it is thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and fitting to lay before the Publick this following <hi>Abſtract</hi> of what thoſe <hi>Learned Gentlemen</hi> have ſaid of this Practice. But becauſe the <hi>Gentleman</hi> who only hath theſe Letters by him, refuſes now to lend them; the Account here following is chiefly taken from a known <hi>Letter</hi> written by a Learned Gentleman of <hi>Boſton</hi> to the Worthy Phyſicians of the Town.</p>

               <head>A Faithful Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts in the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Tranſactions.</head>
               <p>I. OUR firſt Communication comes from Dr. <hi>Emanuel Timonius,</hi> a Renowned Fellow of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> (well known to ſome in <hi>Boſton,</hi> who alſo actually knew the Truth of the matter of Fact now going to be related,) who writes from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>December</hi> 1713. And he informs to this Effect; The practice of procuring the <hi>Small Pox</hi> by a ſort of <hi>Inoculation,</hi> has been introduced among the <hi>Conſtantinopolitans</hi> by the <hi>Circaſſians,</hi> and <hi>Georgians,</hi> and other <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> for about Forty Years. At the firſt the People were cautious and afraid; but the <hi>Happy Succeſs</hi> on <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi> of Perſons for Eight Years now paſt has <hi>put it out of all ſuſpicion.</hi> The Operation
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002206_0004_0FDACBFB9830EAB8"/>
has been performed on Perſons of all Ages, both Sexes, differing Temperaments, &amp; even in the worſt Conſtitution of the Air; and <hi>none that have uſed it ever died of the Small Pox,</hi> tho' at the ſame time, it were ſo malignant, that at leaſt <hi>half the People died,</hi> that were infected with it in the Common way.</p>
               <p>They that have this <hi>Inoculation</hi> practiſed on them (he ſays) are ſubject unto very <hi>Slight Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,</hi> and hardly ſenſible of any Sickneſs, nor do what <hi>Small Pox</hi> they have, ever leave any Scars or Pits behind them.</p>
               <p>They make choice of as Healthy a Young Perſon as they can find, that has the <hi>Small Pox</hi> of the beſt ſort upon him, on the Twelfth or Thirteenth Day of his Decumbiture. With a Needle they prick ſome of the larger <hi>Puſtules,</hi> and preſs out the Matter coming from them into ſome convenient Veſſel of Glaſs (or the like) to receive it, which ought firſt of all to be waſhed very clean with warm Water. A convenient quantity of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being thus collected, is to be ſtop'd cloſe, and kept warm in the boſom of the Perſon that carries it (who ought rather to be ſome <hi>other Perſon,</hi> than what viſited the Sick Chamber for it, leſt the Infection of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> be convey'd in the <hi>Garment,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Bottle,</hi> and the intended Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be hurt by the <hi>Infection</hi> being firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002206_0005_0FDACBFD1C5A8798"/>
another way, and ſo it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed as ſoon as may be to the Perſon that is waiting to be the Patient.</p>
               <p>The Patient being in a warm Chamber, is to have ſeveral ſmall Wounds made with a Surgeon's Three edged Needle, or with a <hi>Lancet,</hi> in two or more Places of the Skin (the beſt Places are in the Muſcles of the <hi>Arm</hi>) till ſome drops of Blood follow: And Immediately let there be dropt out a drop of the Matter in the Glaſs, on each of the Places; and mix'd well with the Blood that is iſſuing out. The Wound ſhould be covered with half a Walnut ſhell, or any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Veſſel, and bound over that the matter may not be rub'd off by the Garments for a few Hours; And now let the Patient (having Fillets on the Wounds,) keep Houſe, and keep warm, and be careful of his Diet; The Cuſtom at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is to abſtain from Fleſh and Broth for Twenty Days or more. They chuſe to perform the Operation either in the beginning of <hi>Winter</hi> or <hi>Spring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Small Pox</hi> begins ſooner in ſome than others, and with leſſer Symptoms in ſome than others; but with <hi>happy Succeſs in all.</hi> Commonly Ten or Twenty <hi>Puſtules</hi> break out; here and there One has no more than two or three; Few have a <hi>Hundred.</hi> There are ſome, in whom no <hi>Puſtules</hi> riſe, but in the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002206_0006_0FDAC8B992C396C0"/>
Places where the Inciſion was made: And here the <hi>Tubercles</hi> will be purulent: Yet even <hi>Theſe</hi> have never had the <hi>Small Pox</hi> afterwards, tho' they have Cohabited with Perſons hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. No ſmall Quantity of Matter will run for ſeveral Days from the Places of the <hi>Inſciſion.</hi> The <hi>Pocks</hi> ariſing from this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are dried up in a ſhort time; and fall off, partly in thin Skins, and partly vaniſhing by an inſenſible waſting.</p>
               <p>The Matter is hardly ſo thick a <hi>Pus</hi> as in the common <hi>Small Pox,</hi> but a thinner kind of <hi>Sanies,</hi> whence it rarely Pitts, except at the Place of the Inſciſion, where the <hi>Cicrtrices</hi> are never worn out, and where the matter is more of the common ſort.</p>
               <p>If an <hi>Apoſtem</hi> ſhould break out in any (which is more frequent in Infants) yet there is no fear, for 'tis heal'd ſafely by Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>They ſcarce ever uſe the matter of the Inſcitious Small Pox to ſerve the Deſigns of a new Inſcition. The <hi>Inoculation</hi> being tryed on ſuch as have had the <hi>Small Pox</hi> before, it had no effect at all on them. Dr. <hi>Timonius</hi> affirms, that he <hi>never yet obſerved any bad Conſequence</hi> of the Practice, which now ſo many do come into.</p>
            </div>

               <p>II. SINCE this Communication from Dr. <hi>Timonius,</hi> there came to the ROYAL SOCIETY a further, from an Eminent Perſon whoſe Name is <hi>Jacobus Pylarinus;</hi> the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Conſul at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and who appears to have had no knowledge, of what had been written by the former. It is Entituled, <hi>A New and Safe Method of Exciting the Small-Pox by Tranſplantation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Gentleman obſerves, That this <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Invention</hi> was firſt found out, not by the Learned Sons of Erudition, but by a Mean, Coarſe, Rude ſort of People, for the <hi>Succour of Mankind</hi> under and againſt one of the moſt <hi>Cruel Diſeaſes</hi> in the World. It was rarely if ever uſed among People of Quality, until after the beginning of the preſent Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. A Noble <hi>Groecian</hi> then in diſtreſs for his Four little Sons, leſt the <hi>Small Pox</hi> might bereave him of them, conſulted with him about uſing the <hi>Inoculation</hi> upon them. At firſt, his Ignorance of the Matter, made him decline giving any Advice upon it; But a <hi>Groecian Woman</hi> who was a notable <hi>Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi> happening to come in, while they were diſcourſing of the Matter, told them ſo much about it, that the Experiment was reſolved on. The Woman managed in her way, upon all the Four Sons. The Three Younger, all of which were under Seven Years of Age, felt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002206_0008_0FDACC0197BB68B0"/>
a very <hi>gentle Illneſs,</hi> had very <hi>few Puſtules,</hi> and in about a Week all Fever and Hazard was over with them. The Eldeſt, about Eight Years old, was taken with a malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: and (tho' he had not many Puſtules) narrowly eſcaped with his Life. <hi>Pylarinus</hi> imputes this, to an <hi>Atrabiliarious,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Humourous &amp; Unhealthy Conſtitution of the Lad, and a neglect of uſing ſuch <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Expiation</hi> of his Body, as they had been adviſed unto. But upon this <hi>Happy Succeſs,</hi> it was wonderful to ſee, what a <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of People of Faſhion</hi> preſently followed the Example. So that at this Day <hi>every one does</hi> without any Heſitation, and with all the ſecurity imaginable, practice the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation;</hi> except here and there a few Cowards that are afraid of their Shadows. Indeed, the <hi>Turks</hi> whoſe Faith in Fate, is as we know, and who are a more Indocible ſort of Animals, <hi>do not yet</hi> much come into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pylarinus,</hi> inſtructed by his Greek Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, directs to take, a <hi>Proper Seaſon</hi> for the Inſcition. She would uſe it only in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but he thinks the <hi>Spring</hi> may do as well.</p>
               <p>The Fermenting <hi>Pus</hi> muſt be taken from the mature Puſtules of a good Sort, in a Young Perſon of a good Conſtitution, kept Warm in a cloſe Vial, and haſtened unto the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002206_0009_0FDACC031A1C6AF0"/>
The Air of the Chamber muſt be kept very Temperate. The Greek <hi>Operatrix,</hi> prick't more places, and leſs fleſhy ones than <hi>Pylari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> approved of; with an oblique ſtroke pricking the Places, with an Iron, or Golden Needle dropping, and thruſting the <hi>Pus</hi> into the Wound; and ſo binding all with Fillets. Her way was thus to prick the <hi>Forehead,</hi> the <hi>Chin,</hi> both <hi>Cheeks,</hi> both <hi>Wriſts,</hi> both <hi>Inſteps.</hi> This was doubtleſs overdoing. <hi>Pylarinus</hi> affirms that ſome have done the Buſineſs, with <hi>no more than One</hi> little Inſciſion in the Arm, and it has done very well. [So it has been with ſuch <hi>Africans,</hi> as have ſhown us the Marks of their Inoculation.]</p>
               <p>They muſt not keep their Beds more than is neceſſary. <hi>Wine, Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Broth</hi> muſt be laid aſide.</p>
               <p>The Ferment comes into Action in ſome ſooner than in others. Uſually the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> (as far as it may be called ſo,) appears on the <hi>Seventh-Day;</hi> ſometimes on the very <hi>Firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Symptoms prove <hi>Remiſs</hi> or <hi>Intenſe</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various Conſtitutions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The <hi>Small Pox</hi> proves of the <hi>Diſtinct Sort;</hi> and there will be but few of them; it may be Ten, or Twenty; rarely a <hi>Hundred.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>I. LET it be conſidered, That theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications come from Great Men, and Perſons of Great Erudition and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are addreſs'd unto very Eminent Perſons. Let it be alſo conſidered, that with the Approbation of the ROYAL SOCIETY (as Illuſtrious a Body as are in the World) their Secretary the celebrated Dr. <hi>Halley,</hi> has publiſh'd theſe things, as worthy to come into the notice of Mankind.</p>

II. There is at this Time a conſiderable Number of <hi>Africans</hi> in this Town, who can have no Conſpiracy or Combination to cheat us. No body has inſtructed them to tell their Story. The more plainly, brokenly, and blunderingly, and like Ideots, they tell their Story, it will be with reaſonable Men, but the much more credible. For <hi>that theſe</hi> all agree in <hi>one Story;</hi> 
                  <q>That abundance of poor Negro's die of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> till they learn this <hi>Way;</hi> that People take the Juice of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and <hi>Cut the Skin,</hi> and put in a drop; then by'nd by a little <hi>Sick,</hi> then few <hi>Small Pox;</hi> and no body dye of it: no body have <hi>Small Pox</hi> any more.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have a clear Evidence, that in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> where the Poor Creatures dye of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in the common way like Rotten Sheep, a Merciful GOD has taught them a <hi>wonderful Preſervative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a <hi>Common Practice,</hi> and is is attended with <hi>Succeſs.</hi> I have as full Evidence of this, as I have that there are <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> And I don't know why 'tis more unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to learn of <hi>Africans,</hi> how to help againſt the <hi>Poiſon</hi> of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> than it is to learn of our <hi>Indians,</hi> how to help againſt the <hi>Poiſon</hi> of a <hi>Rattle-Snake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Is it poſſible to conceive, that this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſhould continue among People <hi>Forty Years</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002206_0012_0FDACC079A890B88"/>
together, and grow more and more into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and at laſt be put out of all <hi>Suſpicion,</hi> and yet that there ſhould be any Truth in the Reports of People's <hi>dying</hi> under the <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> or being liable to the <hi>Small Pox</hi> after it? Had Peoples Limbs periſhed, or had they been liable to the Small Pox after it, we may be ſure, a few Examples would have put an end to the Practice <hi>Forty Years</hi> ago. Good Readers, Judge calmly, and like reaſonable Men.</p>
               <p>IV. The Author of theſe <hi>Abridgments</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd them unto thoſe, who had the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> in their Hands; and therefore it cannot be thought, that it was not as <hi>Faithful a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> as he could make of the matter; But it having been inſinuated, that there might be a more full and perfect Relation, The Author deſires it, and I deſire it my ſelf, That the Accounts given in the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions</hi> be permitted by the Owner to come abroad, and be publiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d <hi>Word for Word,</hi> that <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Men</hi> may ſee <hi>with their own Eyes,</hi> the true ſtate of the Caſe.</p>
               <p>V. It might be eaſy for me to make Anſwers to the Scurrilous things lately Publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and ſatisfy the Publick of the <hi>Falſhood</hi> and <hi>Baſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs</hi> in them. But I think it rather becomes a conſiderate Man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline <hi>fooliſh Contentions;</hi> eſpecially at a time, when there is <hi>a grievous Calamity</hi> upon us,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002206_0013_0FDACC0965E825B8"/>
that calls us (inſtead of railing at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to Unite in Prayers to Almighty GOD, for His Mercies to us. And therefore if any think to go on with their <hi>Calumnies &amp; Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> I ſhall not think fit to take any Notice of them. What I do (I hope as it has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done) will <hi>vindicate it ſelf</hi> with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Thought and Probity.</p>
               <p>VI. I have made my <hi>Experiments</hi> with all the <hi>Diſadvantages</hi> that can be imagined, on <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Young,</hi> on <hi>Strong</hi> and <hi>Weak,</hi> on <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> on <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Black,</hi> and in the <hi>worſt Seaſon</hi> of the Year; and on <hi>greater Numbers,</hi> than I judge proper (conſidering the unaccountable Rage of unadviſed People) to mention; But more than <hi>twice Seven,</hi> I can aſſure you; and it has ſucceeded well in all, even beyond Expectation.</p>
               <p>VII. We are yet but <hi>Learners;</hi> and hope through Experience to grow more expert in our Practice. In <hi>ſome</hi> of my <hi>Experiments</hi> hitherto, I have found the <hi>Fever</hi> ſomewhat more <hi>intenſe</hi> for a few Hours before the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> and the Number of the <hi>Puſtles</hi> to be ſomewhat more than uſual in the <hi>Levant.</hi> Whether this be from the <hi>Seaſon of the Year,</hi> or our <hi>Different Climate,</hi> or our <hi>high way of Living,</hi> or our want of more <hi>Experience</hi> I cannot ſay, till I ſee further. But Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence declares things to fall out <hi>for the main,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002206_0014_0FDACC0A9743CF80"/>
juſt as the Renowned TIMONIUS and PYLARINUS have related. And I have hitherto by the Bleſſing of GOD been able with eaſe to manage what <hi>Fever</hi> my Patients have had, and have never done any thing, but what every body knows is done in other common Fevers. Upon the firſt <hi>Eruption</hi> this <hi>Fever</hi> abates and goes off, the Patients grow ſo eaſy, that one has much ado to keep them in the condition of Patients. They have not the leaſt Touch of that <hi>Second Fever,</hi> which People generally dye of in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way. The <hi>Puſtules</hi> are <hi>very few</hi> in ſome; in others, they are two or three <hi>Hundred,</hi> but at the worſt, nothing to what is uſual in the ordinary way of Infection. They quickly dry away. The Patients are abroad again, ſooner than they who are infected in the common way; and they are on all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts as well as they were before.</p>
               <p>The Sores of the Inciſion digeſt and heal as well as any other common Sores do, and if they ſhould grow angry or trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, a very little Skill and Medicine will ſerve to cure them. From all I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeen, there can be no more ill conſequence of them, than from a sore Finger neglected.</p>
               <p>We are informed that there is now and then, but very rarely, a little Abſceſs in ſome Emunctory of the Body: but we have met with no ſuch thing in our Practice, and we
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002206_0015_0FDACC0C16566240"/>
think when ſuch did, or may happen, that it was, or may be from neglect or want of Skill in the Practitioner: nor have our Patients hitherto had the Boils or other Swellings which are common in the ordinary Small Pox, ſo much leſs is the Blood and other Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces corrupt in this, than the ordinary way. Now to form a Cry of the <hi>Plague</hi> on this occaſion, as if the Practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

that yet appears, here is a Diſcovery, that is a great <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to <hi>Mankind,</hi> and ſhould be thankfully receiv'd: A way to defend our ſelves againſt a dreadful and a deadly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, by <hi>over ruling the way</hi> of it's coming at us, when we ſee 'tis coming. Many <hi>Lives</hi> might be ſaved, ſome <hi>Time</hi> alſo, and ſome <hi>Charge,</hi> (which <hi>ſome it may be, conſider</hi>) and the Health of the Town much ſooner reſtored; if the Practitioners and the People in the Town would come more into this Practice.</p>
               <p>The other <hi>Clamours</hi> and <hi>Bugbears</hi> having been conquered, all that now remains is this: The <hi>People</hi> will <hi>have the Small Pox again.</hi> The only Anſwer that need be given is this; we have never yet <hi>credibly heard any Inſtance</hi> thereof. And thoſe, who have paſſed under the <hi>Inoculation</hi> or <hi>Tranſplantation,</hi> are every Day viſiting, and attending the Sick; with all the aſſurance and ſafety that can be. Some will confidently affirm, that to their Knowledge a Man may have the <hi>Small Pox a Second Time</hi> in the common way. And yet this hinders not the Encouragement of them who have had it once to be no more afraid of catching it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſe of Conſcience</hi> diſtreſſes many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Good People. The Caſe in ſhort we take to be this. <q>Almighty GOD in His great Mercy to Mankind, has taught us a <hi>Remedy,</hi> to be uſed when the dangers of the <hi>Small
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002206_0017_0FDACC0F16903AD8"/>
Pox</hi> diſtreſs us; upon the uſe of which <hi>Medicine,</hi> they ſhall in an ordinary way be ſure not to have it ſo ſeverely as in the other way, and conſequently not to be in ſuch danger from this dreadful Diſtemper, and alſo to be delivered from the terrible <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> which many of them who reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Diſtemper do ſuffer for it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether a Chriſtian may not employ this <hi>Medicine</hi> (let the matter of it be what it will) and humbly give Thanks to God for His <hi>good Providence</hi> in diſcovering of it to a miſerable World; and humbly look up to His Good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (as wedoin the uſe of any other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine) for the ſucceſs of it? It may ſeem ſtrange, that any wiſe Chriſtian cannot anſwer it.</p>
               <p>And how ſtrangely do Men that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Phyſicians</hi> betray their <hi>Anatomy,</hi> and their <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as well as their <hi>Divinity</hi> in their invectives againſt this Practice? For in the Firſt place, they make a mighty buſtle about <hi>Malignant filth</hi> infus'd into the Maſs of Blood, &amp;c. as if there were no Difference between injecting a quantity of ſome poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Matter in ſome large <hi>Blood Veſſel,</hi> and that of applying a <hi>Drop</hi> outwardly to the <hi>Scarified Skin,</hi> which when we conſider ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be only a drop of that which our Skins are fill'd with when we are full of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and a conſiderable part of which
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002206_0018_0FDACC1096BC34A8"/>
is return'd into the Blood again, and yet the Sick does very well. And further, when this Drop is apply'd to a Perſon who has had the <hi>Small Pox</hi> before, and altho' it enters, and is receiv'd by Nature in ſuch, as well as others, as I have experienc'd, yet nature is able to caſt it off without the Phyſicians help; and that agrees with what our Author <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> tells us; that when it has been try'd on ſuch as have had it before, it has had no effect. Secondly, And as to their <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that the People <hi>will have it again,</hi> this is a wonder to me; when I ſee the Fever produc'd as is neceſſary to ſeperate and caſt out the <hi>Pocky matter,</hi> and that they have a fair <hi>Pock</hi> or <hi>Puſtule,</hi> and this capable of Infecting and producing the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in the ordinary way on others, and to the ſame Degree, this renders it with me beyond all doubt, that they who have had it once thus in this way, are as well ſecur'd from having it again, as thoſe who have had it favourably in the other way, which hath been prov'd by thoſe that have had but one or two Puſtules. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Experience has alſo confirmed it in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of Inſtances. But what makes this Practice ſo valuable to us, in my Opinion is, that we ſhall eſcape the Violence, Rage and Hazard that we are expos'd to in the <hi>common way;</hi> except we are infected before,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002206_0019_0FDACC12187B0F30"/>
as we are certain poor Mrs. <hi>Eſther Webb</hi> was—And even <hi>there</hi> we may hope that the Sores of the Inſciſions may help to carry off the Morbifick matter, and ſave the Patient; for this Perſon is recovered, altho' ſhe had one of the worſt Sort that ever was known. And much more on this Head might be ſaid, why this way of <hi>Infection</hi> is more ſafe and eaſy, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat of the <hi>Common way,</hi> but this may ſuffice for the preſent.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Divinity,</hi> they would limit God in His Bleſſing of ſome one or other particular part, or particle of His lower Creation, us'd by the Phyſician or Surgeon to prevent, moderate, alter, or cure a Diſeaſe in their Patient; the which I never yet heard was denied the Phyſician or Surgeon to uſe as aforeſaid by God or Man.</p>
               <p>But for this I refer my ſelf to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Quaeries.</p>

               <p>I. IF it ſhould be ſo that the Compaſſion of GOD to His Creatures, ſhould Enlighten us with the Knowledge of a <hi>Sweat</hi> or a <hi>Purge,</hi> that would <hi>Certainly,</hi> or but <hi>Probably</hi> ſecure us from ever taking the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> I <hi>Enquire,</hi> Whether any People would be ſo very fooliſh, as to judge it <hi>Unlawful</hi> to take ſuch a Remedy. Or, would not every Wiſe Man think, that all the <hi>Days of a whole Year,</hi> were too few to be turn'd into <hi>Days of Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> for the Diſcovery of ſuch a Bleſſing to a Miſerable World? Let the matter of the <hi>Sweat</hi> or <hi>Purge</hi> be what they will; 'Tis all one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>III. It is Objected, That you <hi>Preſume upon Providence</hi> in this Eſſay for the Prevention of the <hi>Small Pox;</hi> for <hi>you don't know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ſhall ever have the Small Pox, or no.</hi> I Anſwer, But what if it be as likely that I ſhall have it, as it is that my Houſe will take Fire, when my Neighbours an Inch and half off, is in Flames. <hi>Pray, ſit ſtill, my Neighbour, your Houſe is not yet on Fire: The Almighty can preſerve it.</hi> But I Enquire, whether this Objection will not lie againſt all the <hi>Preventive Phyſick</hi> in the World?

               </p>
               <p>IV. The Objection here is, I <hi>make my ſelf Sick, when I am Well.</hi> But I again ſay, Will any Man decry all <hi>Preventing Phyſick,</hi> as Unlawful?

ſuch a Malady. Many have Died of a <hi>Vomit.</hi> It is not yet known, that any <hi>one ever Died</hi> of the Operation, that is now ſo cavil'd at. To ſay that our SAVIOUR's words, <hi>The whole need not a Phyſician,</hi> forbid all <hi>preventing Phyſick,</hi> is a groſs abuſe of them.

               <p>V.
