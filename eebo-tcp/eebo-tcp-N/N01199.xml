            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

THE ANSWER OF <hi>Peter Sonmans,</hi> To an Addreſs preſented to your Excellency, by the Houſe of Repreſentatives, dated <hi>March</hi> 18. 1708.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it Pleaſe your Excellency.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEfore I proceed to ſay any thing, in Anſwer to the ſaid Addreſs, I muſt humbly beg leave to return my hearty thanks, for the right your Excellency does in permitting me to juſtify my ſelf from the many falſe Accuſations contained therein; which I chearfully undertake, in conſideration of my own Innocence, and your Excellencys juſtice in ſhewing ſo great a readineſs to hear both partys, which tho' moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the diſcovery of the truth, the Mannagers &amp; Contrivers of that Addreſs, did not intend ſhould be allowed me, as plainly appears by the Prayer thereof.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>My Lord,</hi> muſt ſeem a very extraordinary Proceeding, that an Aſſembly, which ought to take all imaginable care of preſerving the Liberties and Properties of her Majeſtys Subjects, and Supporting the Courts of Judicature, ſhould be induc'd to declare me guilty of <hi>Illegally uſing the power I am cloathed with, to the great hurt of ſeveral of her Majeſties Subjects, and if tolerated, will be of evil Example, and render their Liberties and Properties precarious; and at the diſpoſal of every Magiſtrate who will make his Will, and not the Law, the rule of his Actions,</hi> while they themſelves tranſgreſs the fundamental Rules of Juſtice, and of Liberty and Property, in condemning me unheard, and praying your Lordſhip to do the ſame.</p>
            <p>How ill grounded and untrue their charge is, your Excellency will eaſily diſcover, and whether the Promoters of this Addreſs unwarrantably uſe the truſt repoſed in them to the <hi>evil example</hi> of the Province, whether they <hi>render the Liberties and Properties of the Subjects precarious,</hi> when they condemn without Proof, when they ſet themſelves up as a Supream Court to hear and determine all ſuch things as the Law in its ordinary
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001431_0002_0FB2F33D4629E568"/>courſe hath provided for, and take Cognizance of ſeveral matters that are already before ſome of the Courts, and muſt there be tryed, tho' they have not ſo much as the Power of adminiſtring an Oath to any one they examine? Or I, that have, to the utmoſt of my ability, endeavoured to keep up the Authoriy of the Courts, and never judged, much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned any before Examination and a full hearing, thereby endeavouring <hi>to preſerve the Liberties and Properties of her Majestys Subjects from being precarious,</hi> and have always ſet Juſtice, and the Laws, (as far as I knew them, being no Lawyer) before me as a Rule to govern my actions, and not my Will, as is aſſerted.</p>
            <p>The Addreſs tells your Excellency, That <hi>having examined into the truth of ſeveral Complaints made againſt me, do find &amp;c.</hi> thereby intimating that <hi>ſeveral Complaints</hi> have been made: when by their own Votes and Report, not any Complaint, and but one Petition from perſons ſummon'd to ſerve upon a grand Inqueſt for the Counties of <hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Summerſet,</hi> at a Court of Seſſions held at <hi>Amboy</hi> the 8th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, appears to have been preſented to them; by the prayer of which Petition, the Petitioners only deſired the ſaid Counties in General, and themſelves in particular, <hi>might be relieved from ſome pretended unpreſidented Proceedings, and unjust Fines,</hi> (as the ſaid Petition did ſtile them) <hi>impoſed upon them by that Court,</hi> which Fact, if they had been as true, as indeed they are not, only related to what happened at that Court, without ſo much as mentioning any other Complaint. This Petition being referred to a Committee, that Committee, as I am adviſed, could, nor ought not to have cognizance of any other matter, or thing, than what was referred to them, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the ſubject matter thereof: But the Committee taking upon themſelves to go beyond the ſubject Matter and Prayer of that Petition, into affairs of quite another nature, which were neither referred nor mentioned to them, is wholly unpreſidented and unwarrantable.</p>
            <p>But to demonſtrate the unaccountable Proceedings of the Committee, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to your Lordſhip; your Excellency will pleaſe to remark, That Mr. <hi>Willocks,</hi> the chief of the ſaid Petitioners, becauſe I deſired him to take the Oaths appointed by ſeveral Acts of Parlaiment, in the room of the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before I would admit him to ſerve on the ſaid Grand Inqueſt, which he refuſed, was permitted to arrogate to himſelf the liberty of being chief Mannager and Examiner at the ſaid Committee.</p>
            <p>The Addreſs further intimates to your Excellency, <hi>That they are ſorry, that I, who have the honour of being of the Queens Council, and do not want ſufficient Abilities for her Service, ſhould by my imprudent Conduct, lay them under a neceſſity of ſo publick a Complaint againſt me.</hi> I am as little obliged to the promoters of the Addreſs for that honour, as for their Complement, becauſe the firſt was by ſome of their Members, or their Friends, oppoſed as much and as long as it could, and the laſt only uſed to aggravate the Crimes they would charge me with. The neceſſity they lay under of ſo publick a complaint, an impartial Judge will find difficulty to diſcern, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuppoſing all they ſay true, (the contrary of which I have no doubt the whole Province believes) they are things of that nature that the eſtabliſh'd Courts ought, and only can Judge of them, where accuſed, as well as the Accuſer muſt be legally heard, and the Evidences on both ſides duly weigh'd
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001431_0003_0FB2F33EADA3B358"/>and conſidered, ſo that <hi>imprudent Conduct,</hi> not to give it a worſe term, may more truly be turned upon the Mannagers of the ſaid Addreſs than me.</p>
            <p>They would perſwade your Excellency in the next place: <hi>That they cannot be ſo much wanting to the Country they repreſent, as to be ſilent in a Cauſe that ſo juſtly requires their Conſideration.</hi> The ſaid Addreſſors, <hi>My Lord,</hi> might have cleared this point, with mentioning but one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, or other inſtance made to them by the Country, the neglect of which could give the leaſt ground for ſuppoſition that they are <hi>wanting to the Country they repreſent,</hi> or required their conſideration, ſo particularly, that without it no remedy could be had. But not one complaint being made againſt me, ſave that one Petition, before mentioned, the Country and I have more reaſon to be heartily ſorry, that ſome Members among the Repreſentatives have ſo far indulged their own private Reſentments, and betrayed the truſt repoſed in them, to engage a whole Aſſembly in revenging a particular Picque, the more ſince my lawful Endeavours to recover thoſe juſt Rights and Dues, which they have torn from me, only occaſion that Picque; ſuch Proceedings, I am fully convinced, your Excellency will never countenance, but on the contrary, that your Lordſhip will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage by ſuch proper methods as are conſonant to your Lordſhips great Wiſdom and Juſtice, all thoſe, who, under colour of preſerving the Queens Honour, and performing their Duty to their Country, endeavour to uſe the Power allowed them, only to make both a Party to and aſſiſting in the Injurys they have done.</p>
            <p>Being ſenſible that my Anſwer to the Addreſs will oblige me to treſpaſs too much upon your Lordſhips time, I will paſs over many juſt Remarks, which might be made upon it, &amp; confine my ſelf, as much as is poſſible, to what is immediately conducing to my juſtification. Wherefore, I only deny, and ſo paſs over the groundleſs Accuſation, that thoſe <hi>Arbitrary meaſures</hi> (as the ſaid Addreſs is pleaſed to ſtile them) <hi>with which the late Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Lord</hi> Cornbury <hi>ſo much abounded, were very much owing to my Counſel, I being one of the perſons on whoſe advice his Lordſhip very much relyed;</hi> becauſe the ſaid Addreſs it ſelf, ſtiles it only Belief and Conjecture. What Arbitrary meaſures my Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi> uſed, are to me utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and if any ſuch were, how little they can affect me, I leave to your Excellencys conſideration, ſince I had not, until laſt <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the honour of ſitting in her Majeſtys Council, nor indeed much of his Lordſhips, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, beſides, wholly incapable of adviſing a Nobleman of his many extrordinary Qualifications and great Sagacity.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing the Addreſs particularly accuſes me with, is, <hi>That procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the arreſting of Mr.</hi> John Barclay <hi>on</hi> Whitſunday <hi>laſt, coming out of Church from the Sacrament,</hi> which ſaid Addreſs affirms, <hi>is a manifeſt breach of the Peace, and contrary to the Laws in that caſe made and provided.</hi> Here the Mannagers of the Addreſs prevailed upon the Repreſentatives to aſſume to themſelves an abſolute uncontroulable Power of determining what is a <hi>breach of the Law.</hi> But allowing that it was a <hi>breach of the Peace,</hi> it is not a Crime of ſo high a nature, but any inferiour Court, nay, a ſingle Juſtice of the Peace by a law of this Province, might examine into, and puniſh it, without troubling your Lordſhip, which is evident not only from every days practiſe, but even from the Proceedings which have ſucceeded that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001431_0004_0FB2F34178E85FE8"/>Crime, ſome of the ſaid Committee having already perſwaded the ſaid <hi>Barclay</hi> to arreſt Dr. <hi>Arents</hi> (who took him) for his alledged miſtake, and found an Indictment againſt him, for his preſumed breach of the Law. But I have no doubt of ſeeing that Fact juſtified, becauſe I am ſure its common in <hi>England,</hi> where I never heard ſuch a caſe queſtioned; which is thus:)</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Barclay</hi> refuſing to anſwer a Bill filed in Chancery againſt him, after the time he had prayed, and was allowed him, elapſed, ſtood all the Contempts of the ſaid Court for above a year, moſtly ſheltering himſelf your Exellencys Goverment of <hi>New-York,</hi> at length a Commiſſion of Rebellion was ſealed againſt him, directed among others, to the ſaid Dr. <hi>Arents,</hi> which I delivered to him on the <hi>Saturday.</hi> He asked me, if he might execute it on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> if he ſhould chance to ſee him? I told him, he might, being no common Proceſs, but a Commiſſion under the broad Seal of the Province to anſwer the Queen as a Rebel; accordingly <hi>Arents</hi> took him, after he was come out of the Church. If I erred in my Opinion in a point of Law, which is the utmoſt can be made of this Article, being no Lawyer, I cannot ſuppoſe your Excellency will take that to be ſo great a crime, as to deſerve <hi>ſuch publick Cenſure.</hi> I do not believe any Gentleman, tho' a Barriſter, was ever before ſo treated, if he miſtook in a point of Law, which is not yet determined I did.</p>
            <p>But indeeed, one would think the cloſe of this Article pen'd by a <hi>Papiſt</hi> or Non-Juror, ſuch large Priviledge is given to the Altar, which if allowed, tends to protect Murtherers, Robbers or any Felones from being taken, if they Preſume but to come to the Lords Table.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Article ſays, <hi>I took from one</hi> John Brown <hi>his Horſe, without aſſigning him any reaſon for it, and detains him to this day.</hi> Surely your Excellency will not judge this a matter of that moment or conſequence <hi>to lay the Aſſembly under a neceſſity of ſo publick a Complaint, and that they ſhould be wanting to the Country they repreſent, if they ſhould be ſilent in a cauſe that ſo juſtly requires their conſideration, &amp;c.</hi> but on the contrary, that ſo trivial and mean a thing, is fitter for a Juſtice of Peace, or at moſt, that Court where <hi>Brown</hi> has been adviſed to ſue me, than your Excellencys Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it ſerves to increaſe the number of Articles for them, and to convince your Lordſhip, what pains the promoters of the Addreſs have been forced to take, how low and much beneath the Dignity of an Aſſembly, they are obleg'd ſtoop, to find ſeeming Accuſations: To which I ſhall not trouble your Excellency with any further Reply, ſave that its untrue in all its parts, That I never took the Horſe, detain'd, or have, or have had him in my Cuſtody, but lay the Proof upon them, before that Court where they have commenced their Action againſt me. This I could eaſily manifeſt to your Excellency, but judge in too inconſiderable for your Lordſhips notice; beſides, it might be prejudicial to me, in my neceſſary defence in its proper place.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, I cannot omit giving your Excellency another evident Demonſtration of the Unreaſonableneſs of the Addreſs, in miſrepreſenting this matter on bare ſuggeſtion, either of ſome of the ſaid Committee, or elſe their cheif Mannager, Mr. <hi>Willoks,</hi> for the which Miſrepreſentation there is as little foundation, even in the Report of the Committee it ſelf, or what <hi>Brown</hi> ſaid at the Committee, as the committee had warrant to meddle with the whole buſineſs, which was not referred to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001431_0005_0FB2F3434B6870D0"/>The Addreſs ſays, <hi>Sometime after the poor Man</hi> (Brown) <hi>had commenced an Action againſt me to recover, if poſſible, his Beaſt unjuſtly detained from him, one</hi> Reeves <hi>complained againſt one</hi> Mellin <hi>a Taylor,</hi> &amp;c. inſinuating, and ſo timing the matter, as if I had treated <hi>Brown</hi> ſeverely on the account of his carrying away <hi>Melin,</hi> to revenge the ſuit which he, the ſaid <hi>Brown</hi> had commenced againſt me. Whereas the Reverſe is true; for the matter of <hi>Mellin</hi> was long before <hi>Brown</hi> arreſted me. <hi>Melins</hi> affair happening in <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>Browns</hi> Writ bears teſt in <hi>May</hi> Court, but was not ſealed until <hi>July,</hi> nor had I any notice of, or was arreſted upon it until <hi>September</hi> following; from whence its evident, that <hi>Browns</hi> action againſt me for the Horſe, might be the effect of <hi>Browns</hi> reſentment for being committed, but could never be any reaſon for my committing him, as is inſinuated.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to the matter it ſelf about <hi>Mellin.</hi> Your Excellency will here ſee the temper of ſome of the Leading Members of the Aſſembly, whoſe Rancor carries them ſo far beyond their Reaſon, that they ſtate the facts different from, nay, repugnant, not only to the Report of the ſaid Committee, but alſo prevert what was ſaid by the perſons they examined, of which I ſhall give your Excellency four particular Inſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſaid Addreſs ſays, That <hi>one</hi> Revees <hi>complained against one</hi> Mellin <hi>a Taylor, for detaining a Coat of</hi> Reeves <hi>which I was pleaſed to call Felony, and was going to commit</hi> Mellin <hi>for Fellony.</hi> The Report is, That I iſſued my Warrant to the Conſtable to bring <hi>Mellin</hi> before me, <hi>upon</hi> John Revees <hi>his complaining of Fellony againſt ſaid</hi> Millen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ndly,</hi> The Addreſs goes on, <hi>Tho'</hi> Mellin <hi>proved, &amp;</hi> Reeves <hi>afterwards confeſt;</hi> Mellin <hi>only detained the Coat he had made, till</hi> Reeves <hi>ſhould pay him for the making of it.</hi> This being joyned to the fore-going, it is to be taken, that this Proof of <hi>Mellin,</hi> and confeſſion of <hi>Reeves,</hi> were at the Examination. But the Report, and what was ſaid, is quite otherwiſe (<hi>viz.</hi>) That I committed the ſaid <hi>Brown</hi> into the Sheriffs Cuſtody, where he remained until Bailed out, <hi>altho'</hi> Reeves <hi>afterwards declared, that the ſaid</hi> Mellin <hi>had not ſtole the Coat, before pretended, but detained it for his pay.</hi> From whence its evident that this declaration of <hi>Reeves,</hi> if any ſuch was, happened after <hi>Reeves</hi> was bailed out, and not at the Examination before me; and its plain, by the Report, from what <hi>A. Hudy</hi> ſaid, and the Addreſs it ſelf confeſſes, that it was ſome time before <hi>Brown</hi> was bailed; neither is there one word in all the Report, that <hi>Mellin</hi> proved that he detained the Coat for want of payment for making it; all which much alters the ſtate of the caſe; for when the matter was under examination before me, I could take no notice of diſcourſe that happened many days after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly</hi> The Addreſs tells your Excellency, <hi>That</hi> Mellin <hi>finding there was no contending with abſolute Power, found a way to eſcape from me, and was ſet over to</hi> Statten-Iſland <hi>by the aforeſaid</hi> Brown, <hi>who was altogether ignorant of what had happened.</hi> The Report is, <q>At the deſire of <hi>Mellin, John Brown</hi> carried him to <hi>Statten-Iſland,</hi> and <hi>Brown</hi> told Committee, that he knew <hi>Mellin</hi> was in trouble.</q> So that not one word of <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> nor any thing that appears like it, can be gathered either from the Report, or what was declared to the Committee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001431_0006_0FB2F34687195E18"/>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> The Addreſs ſets forth, <q>Upon which <hi>Sonmans,</hi> to gratifie his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, contrary to Law, commits ſaid <hi>Brown</hi> to Goal, and when the Sheriff had admitted him to Bail, he uſed many Threats to him for his ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ordering him to take him back again, telling him he would throw up his Commiſſion and go to <hi>York,</hi> and deſire my Lord to ſend Souldiers to Rule them; Which Threat, and Fear of being governed by Martial Law, induced the Sheriff to take him into Cuſtody again, and keep him in Priſon till my Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi> was pleaſed to allow he might be admitted to Bail.</q> The Report is only thus, <q>But the next day he committed <hi>John Brown,</hi> which after ſome time, he, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sheriff, admitted to be bailed out; at which <hi>Sonmans</hi> was very angry, and ſaid, he would go to <hi>York</hi> to my Lord, and throw up his Commiſſion, and deſire my Lord to ſend Souldiers to Rule them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Your Excellency ſees that here is no mention of any Threats, nor any Command of mine to take him into Cuſtody again, much leſs does the Sheriff ſay one word, That the Threats, or fear of being govern'd by Martial Law, induced him to take the Man again in Cuſtody, or that he could not be bailed until my Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi> was pleaſed to allow it, who, I believe, was never applyed to about it: This is all an Addition of the Contrivers of the Addreſs.</p>
            <p>The next Sentence in the Addreſs, is, <q>This Proceeding, as it was moſt unlawful and unjuſt, ſo it tended not only to render her Majeſties Subjects intirely depending on my Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> or thoſe he thought fit to honour with Magiſtracy, but to create in the Minds of People an averſion to her Majeſties juſt and mild Government, when by a humor, a Gentleman of the Council could Dragoon them at pleaſure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here, <hi>My Lord,</hi> The Mannagers of the Addreſs prevail upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, to take upon themſelves, again, an abſolute Power of aſſerting that Proceedings are moſt Unlawful and Unjuſt, when, in truth, they know not what the Proceedings are; for a learned Judge tells us, <hi>Examination without an Oath, is but looſe Diſcourſe.</hi> So, upon looſe diſcourſe, and that without hearing what the other ſide has to object to that looſe diſcourſe, the Promoters of the Addreſs impoſe upon the Repreſentatives, to judge of the Lawful or Unlawfulneſs, and Juſtice or Injuſtice of the Actions of the Officers of the Government. Whether this be aſſerting and protecting the Liberties and Properties of the Subject, or rendring them precarious, your Excellency will eaſily judge?</p>
            <p>How any thing, even the Addreſs, much leſs the Report ſays, can have the tendency by the Addreſs mentioned, I confeſs, I underſtand not, nor how thereby Her Majeſties Subjects are intirely made depending on my Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> or thoſe he thought fit to honour with Magiſtracy. If <hi>Brown</hi> was uneaſy under his Commitment, why did he not move for a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> as the Law directs, and ſo obtain his liberty, which my Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> nor any other Magiſtrate, neither could or would have diſobeyed. What they mean by <hi>a Gentleman of the Council could Dragoon them at pleaſure,</hi> I proteſt I under ſtand not. The Addreſſers certainly deſigned not that Reflection upon me, because they and their Chief Mannager, Mr. <hi>Willoks,</hi> very well know that I had not the honour of ſitting at that Board until ſome Months after; beſides, not any Soldiers under
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001431_0007_0FB2F349515C61B8"/>that denomination, were ever here, that I know of; Nor indeed can I ſee the leaſt pretence for that extravagant Expreſſion, taking the fact in as bad a ſence as the Mannagers of the Addreſs, themſelves, would gladly have it underſtood, ſince the moſt it amounts to, even then is that I ſaid, I would deſire ſuch a thing, but that I ever did deſire it, appears not.</p>
            <p>But that your Excellency may be fully informed, l will preſume to relate the fact truly, purged from the Gloſſes put upon it. <hi>Reeves</hi> having taken <hi>Mellin</hi> with his Wife, as Inmates into part of his Houſe, complained to me, that he miſſed ſundry things, particularly ſome <hi>Rum,</hi> Wool, working Tools, and laſtly a Coat, <hi>Mellins</hi> had made for him, which <hi>Reeves</hi> had worn ſeveral times. That he the ſaid <hi>Reeves</hi> being gone to work, <hi>Mellin</hi> had feloniouſly taken this Coat, and carried it to another houſe, where he and his Wife had retired, without giving him any the leaſt notice. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding <hi>Millins</hi> had taken the Coat, he believes he might alſo have taken ſome of the other things; therefore prayed a Warrant againſt him, (which I granted.) When both appeared before me, <hi>Reeves</hi> took his Oath to his Complaint, and produced ſome Witneſſes, which affected <hi>Mellin</hi> as to the Wool: <hi>Mellin</hi> for his defence alledged, that he had made the Coat, confeſt the taking it out of the Houſe when <hi>Reeves</hi> was abroad, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it away. I asked, if ſince he had made the Coat, he had not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to <hi>Reeves,</hi> and whether <hi>Reeves</hi> had not many times worn it? If he had demanded payment of <hi>Reeves,</hi> and given him notice, that if he was not paid for the making he would take it in pawn? <hi>Mellin</hi> confeſt he delivered it to <hi>Reeves,</hi> and that <hi>Reeves</hi> had worn it, but could not prove he had either demanded payment for making, or given him notice, that he would ſecure the Coat if he was not paid. As to the Wool, and other things, he only anſwered, he knew nothing of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without making any reply to what the Evidences ſaid relating to the Wool. I then told him, I muſt commit him. Whilſt I was writing the Mittimus, I gave the Conſtable charge of him, who let him eſcape, altho' I called to him expreſly, that I ſhould require him at his hands. Preſently after, I was informed, upon Oath, That <hi>John Brown</hi> had carried ſaid <hi>Mellin</hi> over a Cannoe to <hi>Statten-Iſland,</hi> tho' <hi>Brown</hi> was told the whole matter. Whereupon I ſent a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for <hi>Brown;</hi> being come before me, I asked him ſome Queſtions about this affair, but he refuſed to make any direct Anſwer; whereupon I told him, he muſt find Sureties to appear, and anſwer at the next Seſſions; which he abſolutely refuſed; and putting his Arms on his ſide, turned about ſhort, and bid ſome of the Company get him horſe, he would ride to Goal in ſtate. I then committed him.</p>
            <p>The next day, being told, That the Sheriff had taken upon himſelf to bail <hi>Brown,</hi> though commited as an acceſſary to Felony; I went to <hi>Woodbridge</hi> to inform the Sheriff of his Error, and warn him of the Inconveniencies he might ſuffer thereby. At the entrance into the Town, I met <hi>Brown,</hi> with the Conſtable and another returning to <hi>Amboy.</hi> I enquired the reaſon thereof? The Conſtable told me, The Sheriff had accepted of Bail I anſwered, That the Sheriff could not do that; and commanded the Conſtable to bring <hi>Brown</hi> back before me; which, though often repeated, the Conſtable utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do. I went into the Town; ask't the Sheriff, by what Authority he bailed a Priſoner ſo committed? He told me, There were three Men bound
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001431_0008_0FB2F34AB3C5CCA8"/>in One Thouſand Pound a piece to deliver <hi>Brown</hi> to him again, whenever he ſhould be demanded. I advis'd him to demand him preſently; related to him what had happened with the Conſtable, adding, That I would complain to my Lord of this Contempt, which if he would not direct to be proſecuted, I would lay down my Commiſſion, for that it was to no purpoſe to keep it, if I could not be obeyed; and if People could not be ruled by the Laws, or the Civil Magiſtrate, my Lord muſt ſend down Soldiers to compel them. The Sheriff, ſenſible of his Error, ſent for <hi>Brown</hi> again, and kept him until he thought fit to apply to the Secretary to be bailed, who immediately bailed him, without any direction or allowance of my Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> who, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, was never ſpoke to about the Bailment, as is inſinuated by the Addreſs. I indeed complained to his Lordſhip of the Diſobedience of the Conſtable, whom my Lord directed to be bound over, and the Grand Jury have found the Indictment againſt him. <hi>Mellin</hi> was afterwards taken up, but ſoon bailed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Attorney General preferred an Indictment to the Grand Jury againſt him laſt <hi>November</hi> Court, the Names of four Witneſſes being upon the back of the ſaid Indictment, who were alſo Sworn; but the ſaid grand Jury, of which Mr. <hi>Royce</hi> (the Chair-man of this Committee) was Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) were pleaſed never to Return the ſaid Indictment into the Court, nor ſo much as ſent for one of the Witneſſes. Your Lordſhip will now judge whether my procedure is Unlawful and Unjuſt: I humbly conceive, if a Juſtice of Peace is not protected in the Execution of his Office, but is ſuffered to be Affronted, his Commands diſobeyed, and thoſe he thinks fit to Commit, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away out of the Government, that excellent Conſtitution, which has provided ſo uſeful an Officer, will ſoon be loſt.</p>
            <p>But here I muſt again take Notice to your Excellency, That ſuppoſing every thing in this Article alledged, was true, its not of that nature to lay the Repreſentatives under a Neceſſity of ſo publick a Complaint, Or that they ſhould be wanting to the Country they repreſent, if they were ſilent, much leſs that it ſo juſtly requires their Conſideration; foraſmuch as I am adviſed, That the matter no way concerns them, becauſe the utmoſt the whole Charge can amount to, is, That I wrongfully committed <hi>Mellin</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> which if I did, they had their Remedy, in the ordinary courſe of the Law, before the eſtabliſhed Courts, without preſuming upon your Lordſhips time, who cannot, if they are wronged, adjudge them any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, but muſt at laſt leave the matter to be determined by the Law.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Accuſation is in a Caſe depending <hi>between the Queen and Mr</hi> John Harriſon, <hi>upon an Information exhibited by the Attorney General, he the ſaid</hi> Sonmans <hi>endeavoured to perſwade the Sheriff to pack a Jury,</hi> as the Addreſs untruly relates. The Report, and what the Sheriff ſaid at the Committee, being quite otherwiſe. I know not what the Addreſs means. The Sheriff ſaid (according to the Report of the Committe) That it was upon a Tryal of <hi>John Harriſon,</hi> at a Supream Court at <hi>Burlington,</hi> in a Cauſe depending between the ſaid <hi>Sonmans</hi> and <hi>Harriſon.</hi> So here the Cauſes differ. And in truth, I cannot make any Anſwer to it, ſince I know nothing of the Matter. I had no Cauſes depending between <hi>Harriſon</hi> and my Self, that could come on, or were ready for Tryal at that Court at <hi>Burlington:</hi> If it was a Cauſe of the Queens, <hi>I</hi> had no buſineſs with it,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001431_0009_0FB2F34C4B5BAF30"/>nor was acquainted with any ſteps taken, in order to bring it to Tryal, much leſs to pack a Jury; wherefore I abſolutely deny the Charge, nor know any thing of the Fact, Cauſe or Time. I confeſs, I have many times adviſed the Sheriff to be careful to get good Juries, and not to impannel any he thought Partial, or inclining to any Party; nor am ſenſible that I have therein committed any fault; tho', with ſubmiſſion, <hi>I</hi> think the ſaid Repreſentatives would have done well, and had reaſon enough to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the Reaſon how ſuch ſtrange both Grand and Petty Juries have been impannelled of late, who have all along gone directly contrary to the Charge given them by the Court, and the fulleſt Evidence that could be; and whether ſome others have not pack't Juries to their own purpoſe, which has occaſioned ſome Preſentments and Verdicts to go accordingly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth Article</hi> is repreſented to your Excellency as a great Inſtance of my Injuſtice and Partiality, but will, I doubt not, appear as much to my Advantage, as now it ſeems the contrary, when it is truly related. The Fact, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is thus: <hi>Michael van Vechten</hi> (who, of the two mentioned in this Article, is more my Friend and Acquaintance than <hi>Alexander Walker</hi>) arreſted <hi>Walker</hi> for 130 <abbr>l.</abbr> in the Court of Common Pleas, in which Court there is a ſtanding Rule, <hi>That all Writs ſhall be ſigned by the Party himſelf, or his Attorney.</hi> The Writ was not ſigned by ſaid <hi>Van Vechten,</hi> but by Mr. <hi>Gorden,</hi> who was not at that time allowed to practiſe as an Attorney. Mr. <hi>Gorden</hi> appeared for the Plantiff, <hi>Van Vechten;</hi> the Attorney General for the Defendent, <hi>Walker.</hi> The Cauſe being called, Mr. Attorney General for the Defendant, moved, that the Writ might abate, becauſe it bore Teſt in the Vacation, and was not ſigned by <hi>van Vechten</hi> or his Attorney, as the Rule required. Being ſenſible that Mr. <hi>Gorden</hi> watched for an opportunity of Complaint againſt me, altho' he was not allowed to plead, I ſuffered him to ſay all he could for his Clyent, only told him, He ought not; but however, gave way to his Pleading. After a long Debate <hi>I</hi> gave Judgment, That the Writ ſhould abate, becauſe it bore Teſt in the Vacation; which is certainly a good Reaſon for Abatement. The Defendant thereupon made out his Bill of Coſts, which, as the Ordinance allows, I taxed, tho' I cannot remember the Sum; but be it what it will, <hi>I</hi> dare maintain my Taxation, by the Ordinance then in force. As to what the Addreſs ſays, Where a Writ of the Plantiffs abates, no Coſts ought to be paid: All former Practice in this Province Confutes ſuch an Aſſertion. And that the unfairneſs of the Addreſs may more plainly appear, <hi>I</hi> muſt add, That by the Oath of the Judge of ſaid Court, I ought not to give Counſel or Advice to either Party; yet the Addreſs accuſes me for not doing that, when it tells your Excellency in the ſame Article, <hi>That another Writ ſigned in the ſame manner as that was, met with no Objection from me, but was allowed of.</hi> There was indeed another Cauſe called, between <hi>Jacob Arents</hi> Plantiff, and <hi>Robert Mellin</hi> Defendant, both who appeared in Perſon; The Plantiff moved for a Rule to oblige the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to plead to his Declaration, but the Defendant made no exception to the Writ, which <hi>I</hi> never ſaw, nor indeed was it my buſineſs to look after it. From whence its evident, That except <hi>I</hi> had ſeen the Writ, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Oath, been of Council for the Defendant, <hi>I</hi> could not make any Exception to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:001431_0010_0FB2F34DB2EFC3B0"/>But that the Partiality of the Addreſs, and particularly of Mr. <hi>Gorden,</hi> who only ſpoke to this matter before the Committee, may appear to your Excellency as clear as the Sun at Noon, <hi>I</hi> muſt beg your Excellency will be pleaſed to obſerve, That at at the very laſt Court of Pleas held at <hi>Amboy,</hi> the 11th of <hi>March,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gorden</hi> pleaded in Abatement for the Defendant to this very Writ they accuſe me of paſſing without being ſigned by the Party, for that it was not ſign'd by the Party, according to the Rule of the Court; but before the Court gave Judgment, agreed to put in an iſſuable Plea. <hi>I</hi> told Mr. <hi>Gorden,</hi> if they had not agreed, <hi>I</hi> muſt have given Judgment for the Defendant, becauſe the Reaſon pleaded for Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was good.</p>
            <p>Before I paſs from this Article, I muſt beg leave to repreſent to your Excellency, That what ever the matter of Facts, here charged, are, they are not ſuch as belong to the Repreſentatives, nor obliges them to ſuch extraordinary Proceedings, ſince if I have erred, the party injured could and may yet have his Remedy at the eſtabliſhed Courts, and not by ſuch unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidented Methods.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> Article Complains of my <hi>refuſing to bind</hi> Alexander Walker <hi>to the Peace, on pretence, That I was immediately going out of Town on your Lordſhips buſineſs, tho' I ſtaid in Town part of the next day;</hi> which Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I utterly deny; no regular Complaint being ever made to me. I confeſs, that on <hi>Sunday,</hi> about three of the Clock in the afternoon, as I was ſitting at Dinner, and then juſt going out of Town, Mr. <hi>Gorden</hi> told me a ſtory to the purpoſe in the Addreſs ſet forth; to which I anſwered, that I was to go out of Town as ſoon as I ſhould riſe from the Table, that I ſhould be back at night, and go away next morning early, therefore adviſed him to apply to ſome other Juſtice of the Peace, which he promiſed to do. But I muſt alſo inform your Excellency, that nothing of what Mr. <hi>Gorden</hi> ſaid appeard to me, Himſelf confeſt it, all Hear-ſay; he was neither the Party hurt, or threatned to be hurt, had not ſeen any body hurt, or heard any threatned, nor ſhewed me any Authority or requeſt from the grieved Party, if any there was, for what he did, much leſs made or offered to make Oath, as the Law requires, that any thing he ſaid was true, or that any body was in any danger or fear; and all Examinations, without Oath, are but looſe diſcourſe, upon which no Juſtice can anſwer the binding any one over. And I have much reaſon to believe, the matter of fact was otherwiſe than Mr. <hi>Gorden</hi> reported, for tho' I returned at night, and went not out of Town until Ten the next morning, I heard nothing of Mr. <hi>Gorden,</hi> or the Preſons he pretended to appear for.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Article relates to my own private particular Affairs: that matter is already brought before the Supream Court, where it muſt have its determination, wherefore ſhall not trouble your Excellency with any other anſwer, then, that I deny the fact. Tho' I cannot omit obſerving to your Excellency that this cannot be any inſtance of my <hi>rendring the Liberties and Properties of her Majeſties Subjects precarious,</hi> nor a Crime of that nature, <hi>as lays the ſaid Repreſentatives under a neceſſity of ſo publick a Complaint.</hi> Which if the ſaid Repreſentatives ſhould neglect, they ſhould be wanting
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001431_0011_0FB2F34F464DD4A0"/>to the Country they repreſent, ſince the meaneſt Court in the Province has power to take notice, and puniſh any ſuch crime, when its proved before them. The whole matter is of ſo mean and inconſiderable a nature, that the Mannagers of the ſaid Addreſs ought to bluſh when they trouble your Lordſhip with ſuch triffles; its a hard caſe when an Aſſembly are forced to ſtrain the truſt repoſed in them, to ſo great a degree, only to gratify the private revenge of a few of their Members.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> Article is of a piece with the former, to which I ſhall therefore only anſwer, That I utterly deny the facts, for which ſome of the Members of the ſaid Repreſentatives preſented me; that I have much reaſon to believe the Grand Jury themſelves did not believe what they brought in; but were impoſed upon and over born by ſome, who never minded the Oath they had taken, and that thoſe Indictments are Falſe, Scandalous and Malitious, invented for a handle to fling dirt, which plainly appears in their being ſo laid and contrived, that the main accuſations can never come regularly to be tryed, the ſham Indictment being found by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt not of the place where the fact is alledged to be committed.</p>
            <p>I may boldly affirm to your Excellency, that I am not conſcious of any guilt, which can make me fear any honeſt Grand Jury, that will be bound by the Oath they take, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that they ſhall not preſent any body for hatred or malice, or excuſe any for fear, favour or Affection) nor have ever after an unpreſidented manner hindred the Grand Inqueſt from doing their Duty at the laſt, or any other Court.</p>
            <p>What I did at the laſt Court of Seſſions at <hi>Amboy,</hi> the 8th of <hi>March,</hi> your Excellency has been pleaſed to approve of, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to admit any to ſerve upon the Grand Inqueſt, who refus'd to take the Oaths to the Queen, as by Law required. This, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is what the Mannagers of the Addreſs are pleaſed to call <hi>Hindring a Grand Inquest from doing their Duty, after an unpreſidented manner;</hi> Tho' I may more truly ſay, That the ſaid Inqueſt being led by Mr. <hi>Willocks,</hi> who publickly declared, he would not take the Oaths, and was pleaſed to term it, <hi>Taking the Lords Name in vain,</hi> did, after an unpreſidented manner, with-draw from, and not attend the ſaid Court, as they ought to have done. The Reaſon of which, and why the Sheriff did not ſummons another Grand Jury, as he was commanded, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the ſaid Repreſentatives, or at leaſt ſome of them, know beſt, there being but too much Reaſon to believe, that whole matter was ſo ordered by ſome Members of the Repreſentatives, who being conſcious of the Riots and Breaches of the Peace they had lately been guilty of, were juſtly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of their Crimes, and would not eſcape due Proſecution. How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſome of the Repreſentatives have been of tolerating <hi>evil Examples,</hi> How Anxious to preſerve the <hi>Liberties and Properties of the Subjects from being precarious;</hi> Whether they have been <hi>wanting to the Country they repreſent;</hi> Whether they have been <hi>ſilent in a Cauſe that might juſtly require their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration;</hi> and laſtly, Whether they protect thoſe that publickly ſtand up in Defiance againſt many Acts of Parliament? I ſhall leave to your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencys juſt Considerations, when your Excellency ſhall pleaſe to reflect, that all this Accuſation is only becauſe I would oblige a Grand Jury-man to take the Oaths, which, it ſeems, is ſo great a Crime, in the Eyes of many of the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001431_0012_0FB2F3522AD19FC8"/>Representatives, that it <hi>lays them under a Neceſſity of ſo publick a Complaint againſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Eighth</hi> and <hi>laſt Article, I</hi> ſay, and confeſs, That in four Criminal Cauſes depending before, and tryed this laſt Court of Seſſions at <hi>Amboy, I</hi> did not admit a <hi>Quaker</hi> to ſerve on the Jury, which I have no doubt but your Excellency will be pleaſed to approve of, for the following Reaſons,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I never heard, by any Inſtruction of her Majeſty, the <hi>Quakers</hi> were admitted to be upon Jurys. I have heard, and do believe, that an Inſtruction to the purpoſe following, may have been given, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas we are informed, that divers of our good Subjects inhabiting thoſe Parts, do make a Religious Scruple of Swearing; and by reaſon of their refuſing to take an Oath in Courts of Juſtice, and other Places, are or may be liable to many Inconveniencies, Our Will and Pleaſure is, that in order to their eaſe, in what they conceive to be matter of Conſcience, ſo far as may be conſiſtent with good order and Government, you take care, that an Act be paſſed in the General Aſſembly of our ſaid Province, to the like effect as that paſt here in the <hi>Seventh</hi> and <hi>Eighth</hi> year of his late Majeſties Reign, Entituled, <hi>An Act that the Solemn Affirmation or Declaration of the People called</hi> Quakers <hi>ſhall be accepted inſtead of an Oath, in the uſual form;</hi> and that the Law be tranſmitted to Us, and Our Commiſſioners for Trade and Plantations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>But, with ſubmiſſion, <hi>I</hi> humbly conceive this ſo far from allowing them to ſerve upon any Jury, that it does not ſo much as direct that they ſhall have the benefit of the Act there mentioned; but on the contrary, from the very words, it plainly appears, that her Maieſty gave no direction againſt that Law, nor allowed, much leſs directed that they ſhould have the eaſe by that Law given them, but that they are, or may ſtill be liable to the many Inconveniencies in this Province, to which they were expoſed in <hi>England</hi> before that Act was made; for, if otherwiſe, what Reaſon can be aſſigned for theſe words in the Inſtruction, <q>Our Will and Pleſure is, that in order to their Eaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you take care that an Act be paſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Likewiſe, theſe fore-going, <q>And by reaſon of their refuſing to take an Oath in Courts of Juſtice, and other Places, are or may be liable to many Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe even by that Inſtruction, whereby Her Majeſty has been graciouſly pleaſed to admit the <hi>Quakers</hi> to bear and ſhare in ſeveral Offices in this Goverment, nothing is contained, as I am adviſed, that can be conſtrued to extend to permitting them to ſerve on Juries; which will plainly appear to your Excellency from the Inſtruction it ſelf, which I have heard, and do believe, may be in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And whereas we have been farther Informed, that in the firſt ſettlement of the Government of our ſaid Province, it may ſo happen, that the number of Inhabitants fitly qualified to ſerve in our Council, and in the General Aſſembly, and in other places of Truſt or Profit there, will be but ſmall, It is therefore our Will and Pleaſure, that ſuch of the ſaid People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as ſhall be found capable of any of thoſe Places or imployments,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001431_0013_0FB2F3555D2FF450"/>and accordingly be elected or appointed to ſerve therein, may upon their taking and ſigning the Declaration of their Allegiance to us, in the form uſed by the ſame People here in <hi>England,</hi> together with a Solemn Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the true diſcharge of their reſpective Truſts, be admitted by you into any of the ſaid Places or Imployments.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From which words in the Preamble, <hi>We have been informed, that in the firſt Settlement of the Government,</hi> it is plain that that Inſtruction took its riſe only from Information: Againſt the truth of which, I ſhall not trouble your Excellency with any arguments here, tho' the contrary, I am aſſured of from many good hands. But, <hi>my Lord,</hi> here is not one word of being admitted <hi>to ſerve on Juries,</hi> in the whole Inſtruction; it ſeems to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the Council, General Aſſembly and other Places of Truſt or Profit, under which denomination that of <hi>a Jury-Man,</hi> as I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, cannot well be accounted.</p>
            <p>Beſides, your Excellency will pleaſe to Remark, That the Preamble gives the Reaſon of this Inſtruction, <hi>viz. That in the firſt Settlement it may ſo happen, that the Number of Inhabitants fitly qualified to ſerve,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>will be but ſmall.</hi> It is therefore plainly intimating, That if there were a ſufficient Number to ſerve, that Inſtruction would not have been given. Now, <hi>My Lord,</hi> in this Cauſe complained of, a ſufficient Number to ſerve were impan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled; ſo that, at beſt, an Officer may err in admitting a <hi>Quaker,</hi> but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (with ſubmiſſion) if he does not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3rdly,</hi> Becauſe the laſt Clauſe, but one, of the Act of the 7 &amp; 8 of <hi>William</hi> the 3d, mentioned by her Majeſties Inſtructions, and recommended to be paſt here, in order to the caſe of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in expreſs words forbids it; which, for the more certainty, <hi>I</hi> ſhall preſume to trouble your Excellency with, and are theſe:
<q>Provided, and be it Enacted, That no <hi>Quaker</hi> or reputed <hi>Quaker,</hi> ſhall, by virtue of this Act, be qualified or permitted to give Evidence in any Criminal Cauſes, or <hi>ſerve on any J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RY,</hi> or bear any Office or Place of Profit in the Government, any thing this Act to the contrary in any wise notwithſtanding.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Concluſion of the ſaid Addreſs is ſo very extraordinary, that I would not any way alter it, but ſhall repeat the words, <q>Were there no more to be ſaid againſt him than his being indicted for Perjury and Adultry, we humbly conceive would juſtifie what we are to deſire of your Lordſhip, a Perſon of that Character being a ſcandal to her Majeſties Council; and we believe your Excellency will think it a Reflection on the publick Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration to continue him in that Station; We therefore pray, that your Excellency would remove him from your Preſence, her Majeſties Council, and from all Places of Truſt and Profit in this Province.</q> So That the ſaid Repreſentatives in very plain Terms deſire your Excellency, <hi>firſt,</hi> To Condemn me unheard, or before any thing is proved againſt me, upon their bare Affirmation, as a Scandal to her Majeſties Council, and that it will be a Reflection on the Publick Adminiſtration to continue me in that Station. Therefore, <hi>2dly,</hi> with the ſame juſtice, they pray your Excellency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Execution, <hi>viz.</hi> To Remove me from your Excellency's Preſence. Her Majeſtys Council, and from all Places of Truſt and Profit in this
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001431_0014_0FB2F3576A9DC658"/>Province. I hope your Excellency will pleaſe to Pardon me, if I ſay, This Deſire and Prayer of the ſaid Repreſentatives is directly contrary to the Liberties and Properties of the Subject, to the expreſs words of the Great Charter of <hi>England,</hi> The Petition of Right, the many other ſubſequent good Laws, that in all Reigns have been Enacted for the benefit of the Queens Subjects, and only to be equalled under a <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; therefore the moſt Unjuſt and Unreaſonable that evere were made.</p>
            <p>For, were nothing to be ſaid againſt the Form and Subſtance of the ſaid Indictment, as much there is; were they found (as a Grand Inqueſt ought to be) by impartial unprejudiced Men, the contrary of which is evident, the chief Men being known to be my profeſſed Enemies, becauſe I have many Demands on them in Civil Cauſes, had they been brought into the Court in the uſual manner, which they were not, but in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod altogether ſtrange, or had they been without any manner of other Objection, yet even then, your Excellency knows, they are only a bare Affirmation, to which the Party never had any Opportunity of being heard, much leſs making any Defence. For which reaſon the Law directs, That the Party ſhall be ſummoned, not to be judged, much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but heard, that Time and Opportunity may be given him to make his Defence and invalidate the Evidence, which may have been Wrongfully or Maliciouſly given againſt him. But this bare Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall, by the Deſire of the Addreſſers, who ought to be the moſt careful Protectors of the Liberties of the Province, as far as the Law directs, nay, to make new Laws to help the Defects of the former, if Occaſion requires it, be deemed ſo full a Conviction and Proof, that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Execution shall follow upon it.</p>
            <p>By this Rule, <hi>My Lord,</hi> any Gentleman who has the honour of ſerving the Queen, or any other Officer of the Government, shall be Turned out, Ruined in his Reputation (which ought to be dearer to him than his Life) and treated as a high Criminal, Convicted without being heard, or any Proof againſt him, whileſt his only Crime is, that a few leading Men, tho' his known Enemies, have Intereſt enough with a Sheriff to be returned on a Grand Inqueſt.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>My Lord,</hi> the matter of this Addreſs is yet more extravagant; for all Examinations of the Grand Inqueſt are upon Oath, but much of what I am charged with, in the ſaid Addreſs, is only upon a bare Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given, without the Life of an Oath, or any thing elſe to oblige the Relator to ſpeak the Truth, mannaged by one, who publickly refuſes to give any aſſurance of his Allegiance to the Queen, or Fidelity to the eſtabliſhed Government. And for ſeveral other Charges, they do not by the Report of the Committee, or any other Proceedings of the Aſſembly, appear to have been ſo much as told the ſaid Repreſentatives, but muſt be things framed by the Mannagers of the Addreſs.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency will be pleaſed to Remember, what a learned and juſt Judge has left as a ſtanding Rule, viz. <hi>That all Queſtions and Tryals, where Witneſſes are examined, the Examination is upon Oath by the Law, by all our Books, Statutes, and every days Practice; Examination without an Oath is but looſe Diſcourſe.</hi> Yet the Promoters of the ſaid Addreſs,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001431_0015_0FB2F358E5E4DDE0"/>prevail upon the Repreſentatives, to take upon themſelves a much greater Power than the Houſe of Commons it ſelf ever claimed, <hi>viz.</hi> not only of Examining, but Condemning, and praying Execution. Whereas the Houſe of Commons, even in Impeachments for High-Treaſon, High Crimes and Miſdemeanours, never pray any farther, but that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Impeached may be put to anſwer for all and every of the Premiſes, and that ſuch Proceedings, Examinations, Tryals and Judgments may be upon every of them, as is agreeable to Law and Juſtice. The ſame Judge ſays, in another place, <hi>Magna Charta, The Petition of Right, and other good Laws of the Land, ordain, That Mens Tryals ſhould be by the eſtabliſhed Laws, and not otherwise; That they are the very words of the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuance of which, Lords, upon Impeachments of the Houſe of Commons, are tryed before the Houſe of Lords, and if the ſaid Houſe of Commons find reaſon to accuſe a Commoner, they proceed not to condemning, and addreſſing that he may be removed from all his Places of Truſt and Profit, but that direction may be given, that he be proſecuted, in order to his acquitting and diſcharging himſelf of the Crimes laid to his charge, if he can, or elſe of being legally convicted; which Proſecution muſt be by the eſtabliſhed Laws, which Laws the Act of the <hi>twelf and thirteenth</hi> of <hi>William</hi> the 3d, for the further Limitation of the Crown and better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the the Rights and Liberties of the Subiects, ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>are the Birth Right of the People of England.</hi> I ſhall not need to trouble your Excellency here with a relation of what happened on the occaſion of the Impeachments of the Houſe of Commons, againſt my Lord <hi>Oxford,</hi> my Lord <hi>Sommers,</hi> my Lord <hi>Portland,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> and that the Houſe of Lords reſolved ſo, and did Addreſs his late Majeſty, that his Majeſty would be pleaſed not to paſs any Cenſure upon their Lordſhips, until after their Lordſhips ſhould be tryed upon the ſaid Impeachments, and Judgment be given according to the uſage of Parliament and the Laws of the Land, becauſe your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency being a Member of that Noble Houſe, and preſent at moſt of thoſe Proceedings, muſt be better acquainted with them, than I can, and will not fail of making due Reflections thereon.</p>
            <p>But contrary to all this, the ſaid Addreſs prays your Excellency, as I ſaid before, to Condemn me, nay, go on to Execution, without any ſuch Examination, before any Tryal by the eſtabliſhed Laws, without any legal Evidence, before being heard, and all in a ſummary way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Judicial Proceedings whatſoever.</p>
            <p>How far the Adviſers of the Addreſs, by this Concluſion, and indeed the whole Addreſs juſtly entitules them to the ſeveral Crimes of <hi>Illegally uſing the Power they are cloathed with,</hi> to the great hurt of her Majeſties Subjects, giving an <hi>Evil Example,</hi> and rendring <hi>Liberties and Properties precarious,</hi> and at the diſpoſal of every Aſſembly, that ſhall make Envy and Spleen, and not the good of their Country, the Rule of their Actions; whether they, by their unpreſidented ways, lay not themſelves under the Neceſſity of publick Cenſure? Whether they are not wanting to the <hi>Country they repreſent,</hi> when they thus endeavour to make it a Party to the Injuries they do, and neglect Matters that iuſtly concern the whole Province's Wellfair? Whether they break not through all Laws, abuſe their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001431_0016_0FB2F35A64948468"/>Subiects, tho' in conſiderable Offices? Whether they deſerve not Publick Reproof, that thus uſe the Places they ſit in, ſo contrary to the <hi>end for which they are ſent?</hi> Whether this does not tend to render <hi>her Majesties Subjects entirely Depending</hi> on the Caprice of a Party in an Aſſembly, and <hi>Create in the Minds of People an Averſion to her Majeſties just and mild Government,</hi> when ſome leading Men in an Aſſembly can Diſplace any of the Council at their Pleaſure, without being allowed to ſpeak for himſelf, or having the Accuſation proved againſt him? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they encourage not Grand Inqueſts to Neglect doing their Duty, and diſcourage Magiſtrates from tendring the Oathes to the Queen and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, preſcribed by ſundry Acts of Parliament? And, <hi>laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not <hi>Defeat her Majeſties good Intentions to her</hi> Quaker <hi>Subjects, and render her Government uneaſy to the People of that Perſwaſion,</hi> when they neglect paſſing an Act as the Queen directs, and endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, That they may act contrary to Law? I ſay, how far the Adviſers to this Addreſs ingroſs to themſelves theſe ſeveral Crimes, with which they unjuſtly endeavour to load me, I ſhall ſubmit to your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencys judgment, and that of all judicious Men.</p>
            <p>And altho' I might now cloſe my Anſwer, with juſtly turning their Concluſions upon the Mannagers of this Addreſs, by retorting, That <hi>were there no more to be ſaid againſt them,</hi> than their Attribtrary, Unjuſt and Illegal Concluſions; I humbly conceive it would juſtify what I could deſire of your Excellency, Perſons of that Principle, and who hold thoſe Tenets, being unfit to repreſent a Province, it might be believed, your Excellency would think it <hi>dangerous for the publick Safety</hi> to continue them in their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and I ſhould pray, that your Excellency <hi>would remove them from your preſence, their places in the Aſſembly, and from all Places of Trust and Profit in this Province.</hi> I ſay, tho' I might juſtly finiſh with this, yet I will not preſume ſo far, or any way to direct or preſcribe to your Excellency, much leſs follow an example, which, I think deſerves to be avoided; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I trouble your Excellency with any further Remarks on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſidented, unwarrantable, unjuſt and unreaſonable Requeſt of the ſaid Addreſs, nor take upon me to recount the Numberleſs Pernicious Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, that muſt neceſſarily flow from ſuch proceedings, ſince they are too obvious to eſcape the meaneſt, much leſs your Excellencys Obſervation.</p>
            <p>But for that the matters and things in the ſaid Addreſs contained, are either no Crimes, or falſe in fact, or miſerably miſ-repreſented, and if any Faults be committed, tho' I muſt inſiſt upon it, that not any appears to your Excellency, by the ſaid Addreſs, they are ſuch as are and muſt be regularly tryed before the Eſtabliſht Courts, according to the known Laws of her Majeſtys Kingdoms, and the Cuſtom of ſaid Courts, and cannot be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or tryed any other way; and for preventing the many ill and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable conſequences that muſt needs attend ſuch uncommon and illegal ways of ſcandalizing all Officers, but eſpecially thoſe that have the honour of being of her Majeſtys Council, to whom ſome Civility and Reſpect is or ought to be done, I humbly pray, that the ſaid Addreſs may make no impreſſion upon your Excellency, but be utterly diſregarded, and that your Excellency will be pleaſed, ſo effectually to diſcountenance ſuch new and unpreſidented Methods of villifying Officers of the Government, particularly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001431_0017_0FB2F35E80F42BD0"/>thoſe whom her Majeſty has thought fit to honour with a Place, in her Majeſtys Council, that I may in ſome ſort be juſtified thereby, and receive all the ſatisfaction the nature of ſuch an Addreſs will bear, and to your Excellency in your Wiſdom and Juſtice ſhall ſeem meet; which is humbly ſubmitted to your Excellency's Judgment.</p>

               <p>THat in obedience to our Duty, and to manifeſt our readineſs to ſerve her Majeſty and our Country, we did all appear at the opening of the ſaid Court, and anſwer each of us to our reſpective Names, as we were

                  <hi>Robert Mellin</hi> before him upon <hi>John Reeves</hi> complaining of fellony againſt ſaid <hi>Millen</hi> which afterwards, at the deſire of ſaid <hi>Mellin, John Brown</hi> carried him over to <hi>Statten Iſland,</hi> at which <hi>Sonmans</hi> was diſpleaſed and Committed the ſaid <hi>Brown</hi> into the Sheriffs Cuſtody, where he remained until Bailed out, altho <hi>Reeves</hi> afterwards declared, that the ſaid, <hi>Mellin,</hi> had not ſtole the Coat, before pretended, but detained it for his pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam Hudey,</hi> Sheriff, ſaith, That <hi>Sonmans</hi> told him, That complaint was made to him, againſt <hi>Mellin,</hi> on which complaint he would commit: him into his Cuſtody, but the next day he committed <hi>John Brown,</hi> which after ſome time he admitted to be bailed out, at which ſaid <hi>Sonmans</hi> was very Angry, and ſaid he would go to <hi>York</hi> to my Lord, and throw up his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and deſire my Lord to ſend Souldiers to rule them. And further ſaith, That upon Tryal of <hi>John Harriſon</hi> at Supream Court at <hi>Burlington,</hi> in a cauſe depending between ſaid <hi>Sonmans</hi> and <hi>Harriſon, Sonmans</hi> told him, that he had need to ſummons a good Jury, and that <hi>John Harriſon</hi> being Captain, there was none on their ſide <hi>Boundbrook</hi> fit to ſerve, but he could adviſe him of a Jury of good men, all in his way, which he accordingly gave him a Liſt of ten or eleven men, which were all Dutch men.</p>

               <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
               <p>THat divers of the Free-holders of this County being duly ſummoned to attend, the Court of General Seſſions held at <hi>Amboy</hi> on the eight
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001431_0020_0FB2F364F85BEEC8"/>Inſtant, to ſerve upon the grand Inqueſt, for this &amp; the County of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> did appear at ſaid Court, and anſwered to their Names as they were called.</p>
               <p>That <hi>George Willocks</hi> being impannelled as Fore-man of the ſaid Inqueſt, coming to be ſworn, was asked by your Petitioner. Whether he had taken the Oaths to the Queen appointed by ſundry Acts of Parliament? to which Mr. <hi>Willocks</hi> gave no direct anſwer, but objected againſt the Authority of the ſaid Court of Seſſions to adminiſter ſaid Oath.</p>
               <p>That the ſaid Court of Seſſions being very well aſſured of their Authority to adminiſter ſaid Oaths, and informed, that ſaid <hi>Willocks</hi> had never taken them, ordered their Clerk to get the Rolls, in which ſaid Oaths were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in order to tender them to ſaid <hi>Willocks;</hi> but ſaid <hi>Willocks</hi> then poſitively declared, if the Rolls were there, he would not take them, for that he would not take the name of the Lord in vain; and that he having attended and anſwered to his Name, ſhould or did not think him. If obliged to attend ſaid Court any longer, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>The Clerk not having ſaid Rolls, the ſaid Court of Seſſions prayed the Secretary to lend them the Rolls he had, but the Secretary making ſome objections thereto, the ſaid Court adjourned to three a Clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, in order to procure the old Rolls belonging to this County, or new ones.</p>
               <p>That the ſaid old Roll not being to be found, your Petitioner immediately employed the Door-keeper of the Council to prepare new ones, which, notwithſtanding the utmoſt diligence, could not be in a readineſs until about ſix in the evening.</p>
               <p>That immediately after the ſaid Rolls were tranſcribed the ſaid Court opened again, and the ſaid perſons ſummon'd, to attend, as aforeſaid, were again called upon, but not one attending or anſwering to their Names, the ſaid Court reſolved not to proceed (as indeed they ought to have done) to fine ſaid Defaulters, becauſe they would not be deemed too ſerve, but adjourned until the next day at nine a Clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>That the ſaid Court opened again, according to their adjournment, and called over the Pannel, but only one anſwered ſaid Call, altho divers were about the Court: whereupon ſaid Court ſeeing their Authority oppoſed in a very-high degree, proceeded to fine the ſaid Defaulters according to Law.</p>
               <p>That notwithſtanding the great lenity of ſaid-Court, the ſaid <hi>George Willocks</hi> with fifteen others of the ſaid Defaulters, have preſented a very Scurrelous, Malicious and Scandalous Petition againſt your Petitioner, to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, a Copy of which is hereunto annexed: the allegations of which are not only falſe in fact, but likewiſe very opprobrious and injurious to your Petitioner, who could not in duty act otherwiſe then he has done.</p>
               <p>That your Petitioner not being conſcious of any guilt, is not afraid of any Indictments, except ſuch as meer Malice or Envy, without any ground or poof, where partys are Judges, can ſuggeſt, of which nature thoſe are in the Petition mentioned, and writ by the own hands of ſaid <hi>Willocks</hi> tho' not of that Inqueſt: That ſuch Proceedings and Affronts are wholly unpreſidented, highly diſhonouring Her Majeſtys Government, tending to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001431_0021_0FB2F36729B59108"/>the great encouragment of Non-Jurors, ſubverting the very being and Authority of Courts, and diſcouragement of the Judges and Juſtices of the reſpective Courts from doing their duty. <hi>Your Petitioner therefore humbly prays,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That your Excellency and the Honourable Council will be pleaſed to put an effectual ſtop to ſuch ſeditious Practices, and order ſuch ſuitable ſatisfaction to your Petitioner, and qive ſuch further directions as your Excellency in your great Wiſdom ſhall judg proper and neceſſary.</p>

                  <hi>JAcob Arents</hi> of <hi>Amboy,</hi> Practiſer of Phyſick, Aged about 36 years, being ſworn upon the holy <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> of Almighty God, maketh Oath, that That on or about the 15th day of <hi>March</hi> laſt, he this deponent was twice ſummon'd to attend a Committee of the Houſe of Repreſentatives by one <hi>Cutler,</hi> who, this Deponent was informed, and believes, was Door-keeper to the ſaid Houſe, and told this Deponent, That he was commanded by the Committee to fetch him. Whereupon this Deponent attended the Committee, and was there examined by <hi>George Willocks</hi> (who this deponent is informed, and verily believes, was not one of the Repreſentatives, but a Petitioner to the Committee) touching the taking of <hi>John Barclay,</hi> whom this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent ſaith, he took on or about the 23d day of <hi>May,</hi> 1708. by virtue of a Commiſſion of Rebellion iſſued out of the Court of Chancery, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him by <hi>Peter Sonmans</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> under the Seal of the Province, in which this deponent was named the firſt Commiſſioner.</p>
               <p>And this deponent further ſaith, That ſome time in the ſaid Month of <hi>May,</hi> he this deponent heard one <hi>John Reeves</hi> make a complaint to Mr. <hi>Sonmans,</hi> That one <hi>Mellin,</hi> a Taylor (to whom and his Wife) <hi>Reeves</hi> had let part of his houſe, had left his houſe when he was gone out, and taken with them a Coat which the Taylor had made for <hi>Reeves,</hi> and he had worn ſeveral times; That he miſt ſeveral other things out of his houſe, to wit, ſome Rum, wooll and working Tools, which he ſupected <hi>Mellin</hi> and his Wife might have taken, whereupon prayed Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> to grant him a Warrant to bring <hi>Mellin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, which Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> having granted, <hi>Mellin</hi> was brought before him, who examined him upon <hi>Reeves</hi> Complaint. That <hi>Millin</hi> confeſt the taking of the Coat when <hi>Reeves</hi> was from home, and that <hi>Reeves</hi> had ſeveral times worn it. That ſome witneſſes, particularly one <hi>Elizabeth Sharp</hi> gave ſome evidence relating to Wool, which <hi>Reeves</hi> ſaid he miſſed and was brought to ſpin, or work up ſome other way, by <hi>Mellins</hi> Wife, to one <hi>Mary Arents;</hi> but that <hi>Mellin</hi> ſaid he knew nothing of that matter. That Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> told <hi>Mellin</hi> he muſt commit him, but while Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> was writing the mittimus, <hi>Mellin</hi> was going away, which being told Mr. <hi>Sonmans,</hi> he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Conſtable that he ſhould take care of <hi>Mellin,</hi> being committed to his charge, or words to that effect. But that the Conſtable nevertheleſs ſuffered <hi>Mellin</hi> to eſcape, and that one <hi>John Brown</hi> carried him to <hi>Statten-Iſland,</hi> whereupon Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> iſſued out a Warrant to bring <hi>Brown</hi> before him, but that <hi>Brown</hi> would make little anſwer to ſeveral Queſtions put to him about his conveying <hi>Mellin</hi> away. That Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> told <hi>Brown</hi> he muſt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001431_0022_0FB2F368A514B4D0"/>find ſurety to appear, and anſwer it the next Quarter Seſſions, which <hi>Brown</hi> refuſed, and putting his Arms on his ſide, asked ſome of the company for a Horſe, and ſaid, he would ride to Goal in ſtate.</p>
               <p>That the next day this Deponent rid with Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> to <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> that at the entrance into the Town, they were met by the Conſtable and <hi>John Brown,</hi> upon which Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> commanded the Conſtable ſeveral times to bring <hi>Brown</hi> back into the Town, before him, but that the Conſtable did not do it. That this deponent with Mr. <hi>Sonmans,</hi> went to the Sheriff, whom <hi>Sonmans</hi> asked, how he came to Bail <hi>Brown?</hi> That the Sheriff ſaid, he had three Men bound in one Thouſand Pound, a peice for <hi>Browns</hi> appearance when he ſhould demand him. Upon which Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> adviſed the Sheriff to ſend for him again immediately, for that he could not anſwer what he had done, and related to him how diſobedient the Counſtable had been, of which Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> ſa id, he would complain to my Lord, and pray that he might be proſecuted for it. That this Deponent afterwards heard that <hi>Brown</hi> remained in the Sheriffs Cuſtody until he was bailed out.</p>
               <p>And this deponent further ſaith, That on or about the 9th of <hi>January</hi> laſt this deponant was at dinner with Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> about three of the Clock in the afternoon, being to go with Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> to viſit a ſick perſon as ſoon as they ſhould riſe from the Table, that juſt before Dinner was over, Mr. <hi>Gorden</hi> came and told Mr. <hi>Sonmans,</hi> that he had heard that <hi>Alexander Walker</hi> had beat his Wife, and threatned or attempted to kill his Wifes Son, one <hi>Iohn <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> told him, he was ſorry to hear it, but that he was juſt going out of Town, ſhould be back at night, therefore deſired Mr. <hi>Gorden</hi> to apply to ſome other Juſtice, if the matter required haſte. That Mr <hi>Sonmans</hi> and this Deponent went out of Town immediately after, returned in the evening, and that Mr. <hi>Sonmans,</hi> went out of Town again next morning about ten; but that Mr. <hi>Gorden</hi> nor any other made any application upon that Subject after the firſt to Mr. <hi>Sonmans,</hi> that this Deponent ever heard of, tho' he was with Mr, <hi>Sonmans</hi> all the while. And further this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſaith not.</p>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Preſident of the Seſſions, Whether he had taken the Oaths to the Queen appointed by ſundry Acts of Parliament, in the room of the Oath of Allegance and Supremacy? To which Mr. <hi>Willocks</hi> made little anſwer, but objected againſt the Authority of the Court to Adminiſter ſaid Oaths. That the Court Ordered this Deponent to get the Parchment

That this Deponent not having the Rolls, the Secretary was deſired to lend his, but the Secretary making ſome objections to that, the Court adjourned to three of the Clock in the after-noon, to procure the Rolls afore-ſaid; but that notwithſtanding the utmoſt diligence, they could not be got really until about ſiix of the Clock in the evening.

               <p>ON Search of the Docquet of Cauſes depending in the Supream Court of her Majeſtys Province of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> I find a Writ was iſſued out that bore Teſt in <hi>May</hi> Term, 1708. of one <hi>Iohn Brown</hi> againſt <hi>Peter Sonmans,</hi> but was not ſealed in the Office till <hi>September</hi> 1708. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in <hi>November,</hi> 1708. and that ſome conſiderable time before the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſaid Writ I and Mr. <hi>John White,</hi> had, on the firſt application made to us, admitted the ſaid <hi>John Brown</hi> to bail, and certified the Recognizance into the Supream Court.

               <p>I do alſo further Certifie, That I bayled the ſaid <hi>Brown,</hi> without ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting his Excellency the Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi> with the ſame, nor know I of any application made to him on this matter.</p>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> but had been ſome time afore turned out by him.
