            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>DOUBTLESS the deſign of this text now appears to the greater part of this aſſembly. It is eaſy work to oppoſe enemies, but to oppoſe friends—to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe brethren and ſiſters, diſciples of our glorious Lord, is one of the moſt difficult employments in the world: but every bible truth is precious, and plead for it we muſt, though oppoſed by a Calvin, a Flavel, an Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or by all the ſaints on the earth. Let us then attend to the paſſage in view, and conſider what bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is, and who are the ſubjects of it.</p>
            <p>The enquiry may be, 1. What is baptiſm? It is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament wherein our immerſion in water repreſents our being buried with Chriſt to the world, and riſing to newneſs of life; and alſo the burial of our bodies, and their reſurrection at the laſt day. Chambers' dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry explains the word baptiſm, which the Engliſh read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may peruſe at his leiſure. When baptiſm was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the apoſtolic age, we read of their repairing to places where there was much water. Philip and the Eunuch firſt came unto a certain water, and then we read, not that they went back and came to it again; but, that they went down <hi>into</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">The Greek word EIS ſometimes means <hi>to,</hi> but moſt naturally <hi>into;</hi> baptized often means <hi>waſhed,</hi> but moſt naturally <hi>immerſed;</hi> and the moſt natural ſenſe of a word, muſt always be preferred to one leſs natural, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things being equal.</note> the water, both Philip and the Eunuch, and he <hi>baptized</hi> him. Hence believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028518_0003_0FD9323F35F34F50"/>are ſaid to be buried with Chriſt in baptiſm, and to be baptized for the dead. <hi>If the dead riſe not, why are they then baptized for the dead?</hi> Why do they embrace an ordinance, the very deſign of which is to repreſent the reſurrection when chriſtians are buried in and riſe out of the water. What a lively emblem it is of our being buried with Chriſt, and riſing at the laſt day! This canons be ſaid of ſprinkling—and accordingly not ſprinkling, but baptiſm was almoſt the univerſal prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the chriſtian church for many centuries, and has bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent moment. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is a Greek word and if the Greek <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation do'nt know the meaning of their own words we may well enquire who does? But after all, it may be ſaid, it is a needleſs, burdenſome, fooliſh practice: We anſwer, perhaps this was one great reaſon, why it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">
                  <desc>••••••</desc>
               </gap>ſated. Every follower of Chriſt muſt become a fool for his ſake, and deny himſelf. Are you my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſays Chriſt, if ſo, do you ſubmit to this ordinance —this image of ſelf-denial, which ſhall render you fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh in the view of the world.<note n="*" place="bottom">Further information reſpecting baptiſm may be obtained from Mr. Foſter's divine right of immerſion, and Mr. Baldwin's anſwer to Mr. Worceſter.</note> Muſt not that ordinance be wiſely contrived, which ſerves to keep out of the church the proud, and thoſe who are loth to expoſe themſelves for the cauſe of Chriſt.<note n="§" place="bottom">To ſome eyes this may appear like a cenſorious intimation: but the ſentence need not be viewed in ſuch a light. Our paedobaptiſt brethren fee not as we do; but it is not becauſe they are more proud or ſelfiſh than we are.</note> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Who are the ſubjects of baptiſm? The text is the anſwer—<hi>Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized—</hi> "and their infants too" faith the word of man; but what ſaith the word of the Lord? Where is the chapter, or verſe, or ſentence, or member of a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which commands ſuch a practice, or affords an
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028518_0003_0FD9323F35F34F50"/>example of it? To ſay it is not expreſsly forbidden will by no means excuſe the practice. Beads, croſſes, and a thouſand other popiſh fooleries, are no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly forbidden in ſcripture; but the queſtion is are they commanded? Ancient Iſrael was reproved no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> only for doing what was forbidden, but for doing what was not commanded. <hi>They did that which I commanded them not, ſaith the Lord, neither came it into my mind.</hi> 'But though there be no expreſs command for the practice, you ſay, yet we have conſequential evidence in its ſavor.' Let us then inquire for it. If there be ſuch conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial evidence, it muſt depend on the truth of three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. Infants are viſibly in the new covenant— baptiſm is in the room of circumciſion—there were three families in the apoſtolic age, one of which at leaſt had an infant or ſome other perſon baptized on the ground of the faith of the head of the family. All the arguments which are eſteemed concluſive by more than thirty authors who have written on the ſubject in Europe and America, depend on the truth of theſe three propoſitions: all that is ſaid reſpecting the covenants, the olive-tree, the kingdom of heaven, the diſcipleſhip of infants and their intereſt in the promiſe, &amp;c. reſts on the truth of one or other of theſe three propoſitions<note n="§" place="bottom">If infants are not viſibly in the new covenant, they are not viſible diſciples, not viſible ſubjects of the kingdom of heaven, nor viſibly graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the olive, nor viſibly intereſted in the promiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 39. nor vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly holy in the new covenant ſenſe. This will doubtleſs be granted.</note> ſo that if theſe fail, all fails and the point muſt be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered. More might be ſaid to manifeſt this, but probably it will not be denied. All we have to do then is to enquire whether theſe three propoſitions are true.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Are infants viſibly in the new covenant? No! for this plain reaſon—they cannot appear to be in it, and they are not viſibly ſuch as they cannot appear to be. I will make a new covenant with the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028518_0004_0FD932429ABE7B38"/>(ſaith the Lord) not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt: for this is the covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael after thoſe days, faith the Lord, I will put my laws in their mind, and write them in their hearts: and— they ſhall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, ſaying know the Lord: for all ſhall know me, i. e. all with whom I make this new covenant ſhall know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt: for I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and their iniquities will I remember no more. How plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this ſhews that none can be really in the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant but really gracious perſons. All ſhall know me, (ſpiritually) for I will be merciful to their unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and their ſins and iniquities will I remember no more. And as none can be really in the new covenant but really gracious perſons, ſo none can appear to be in the new covenant, but thoſe who appear to be gracious, and, as appearance and viſibility are of the ſame import, whatever appears is viſible, and whatever is viſible can appear. There cannot be a viſible object, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not appear; and no perſon can be viſibly in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, while he cannot appear to be in that condition. Therefore if the infants of believers, as ſuch, are viſibly in the new covenant, then they appear to be really in it. If infants are really in the new covenant, they are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born again; and conſequently if they are viſibly in the new covenant, they are viſibly born again; and if they are viſibly born again, then they can appear to be born again, certainly. There may be viſibility of that of which there is no exiſtence, but there cannot be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of that which there can be no appearance.<note n="*" place="bottom">The terms viſibility and appearance, with their variations, are here uſed in a ſenſe which Dr. Hemmenway's late ingenious Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the church, calls <hi>improper</hi> and <hi>leſs proper,</hi> and which doubtleſs is ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith relation to <hi>his</hi> proper ſenſe, or the natural force of the words; but not with relation to this ſubject, as well as many others, unleſs it is Improper to uſe ſuch terms in writing as men commonly uſe, learned or unlearned. 'Propriety or congruity of language (ſays Dr. Edwards) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly on uſe.' The natural force of the above terms, was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs no more unknown to preſident Edwards, than to Dr. Hemmenway, and yet with an eye to the common uſe of them, the preſident ſays, 'vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and real are words which ſtand related to one another, as the words real and ſeeming, true and apparent.' Among the learned and unlearned it is certainly a common, intelligible, and conſequently on the whole, a very proper way of ſpeaking, to ſay that a perſon may <hi>appear</hi> to be what he is not—that a perſon may <hi>appear</hi> to be a ſincere friend, and may <hi>appear</hi> to be a good man: That there may be ſuch an <hi>appearance</hi> both of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things as admits of doubtful reality.—But though in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning the church, the doctor ſays that all viſibility is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—that 'if we have not light enough to aſcertain the reality of a ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed object, there is not enough to make it viſible. Yet in his book on the nature and ſubjects of baptiſm, on which the late performance is prof-ſſedly conſtructed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſeamed to think that poſſibility would anſwer for viſibility. That we may have light enough to render a ſuppoſed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject viſible without aſcertaining the reality or even the probability of it. For in page 34 he ſays "if we ſuppoſe the character of believers is given to little ones themſelves, it will make no difficulty: for as it cannot be denied that young children may have the ſeeds of grace and faith in them ſo being members of the church, they are in the account and acceptation of the church, believers according to their capacity, and may be ſo term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even as we term them rational creatures before the proper exerciſe of their rational fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ulties plainly appears." Surely the doctor muſt mean that they are in ſome degree viſible believers in the account of the chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, for how can infants be ſuch in their account and acceptation as they do not appear to them to be in the leaſt degree. Here then is viſible grace and faith in thoſe who only <hi>may</hi> have grace and faith; here is a viſible object. without our having light enough to aſcertain its reality, or even probability.—Accordingly (in page 51) he ſays expreſsly that believers' children are viſibly heirs of ſalvation. If poſſibility of faith is the viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it, then the poſſibility of unbelief is the viſibility of that alſo. If infants are viſible believers, becauſe they <hi>may have</hi> the ſeed of grace,— then they are viſible unbelievers becauſe they <hi>may have</hi> the contrary.

That there is not one to an hundred of the infants of believers ſanctified from the womb, will doubtleſs be granted; allowing then a fifth part of them to die in infancy, there muſt be a probability of eighty to one that any particular infant of a believer is in a graceleſs ſtate; but there is not one in five hundred of them born without rational faculties. Therefore when the doctor ſays that infants may be termed believers, even as we term them rational creatures;—he might as well ſay they may be termed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, while we have a probability of eighty to one that they are not believers, even as we term them rational creatures, while we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of five hundred to one that they are rational creatures. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctor's repreſentation here, infants are believers and heirs of ſalvation, not certainly, nor probably; but very improbably and viſibly.

Does that which is born of the fleſh appear to be ſpirit in the eye of chriſtians, judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of the goſpel?—no; ſaith the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; "That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; and that which is born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit." That which is born of the fleſh, even of believers, is fleſh; for, "neither becauſe they are the ſeed of Abraham, are they all children, (ſays Paul) but in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called—<hi>that is,</hi> they which are the children of the fleſh theſe are not the children of God. True, the child of a believer is in a ſenſe holy to him, and ſo is the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving conſort. The unbelieving wife is ſanctified to the huſband, elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy. i. e. The believer has a lawful and ſanctified injoyment of his wife and child. They are holy to him as all things are which he has occaſion to enjoy: for to the pure, all things are pure; and nothing to be refuſed, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>received with thankſgiving: for it is <hi>ſanctified</hi> by the word of God and prayer. The goſpel has removed the ceremonial uncleanneſs of Ezra's time. But neither the unbelieving wife, nor child of a believer is holy in the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028518_0005_0FD932458BCAAD40"/>new covenant ſenſe: if they were, their hearts would be holy; or if they were viſibly holy in this ſenſe, their hearts would be <hi>viſibly</hi> holy in the ſenſe already explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and to confirm this ſenſe, hear preſident Edwards: "Viſibility is a relative thing, and has relation to an eye that beholds.' Real ſaints are thoſe who are ſo in the eye of God, viſible ſaints are thoſe who are ſo in the eye of man—that is, in the eye of man's mind, which is his judgment or eſteem; and nothing ſhort of <hi>apparent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability or probable exhibition</hi> can amount to viſibility in the eye of man's reaſon or judgment. God has given to man the eye of reaſon and the eye of a chriſtian, which is reaſon ſanctified and enlightened by a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of love.—But it implies a contradiction to ſay that that is viſible to the eye of reaſon, which does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear probable to reaſon.

                  </gap> has not yet appeared. 2. Another reaſon, and which is the foundation of the former, is this—"That real holineſs and ſalvation are ſecured to children of believers, by the covenant into which the parents enter with God, as it reſpects their children if the parents faithfully keep covenant and fulfil what they profeſs and promiſe reſpecting their children, when they ofter them in baptiſm. The parent in this tranſaction profeſſes to devote his child to Chriſt, and promiſes, that if be and his child ſhall live, to bring it up for Chriſt. And Chriſt as the other party in this covenant tranſaction, viſibly receives the child, as belonging to him, and on the condition which the parent profeſſes and promiſes to perform, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to bleſs the child, and beſtow ſalvation upon it. Therefore ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are viſibly ſaints, and numbered among the ſaved: for the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and engagements of the parents are to be relied on by the church— and that they will fulfill their promiſes reſpecting their children. But in this tranſaction, if the parent makes any promiſe at all, what muſt be promiſe ſhort of perfect faithfulneſs?—and if this muſt be the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>, how can it be relied upon by the church, ſo as to view the infant among 'the number of the ſaved.' But ſuppoſe ſome great degree of faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be the condition, for the fulfilment of which, the promiſe of the parent might be relied upon by the church; would not the promiſe of Chriſt annexed to this degree of faithfulneſs be compleatly fulfilled, if the children of ſuch parents were converted at 20, 40, or 60 year. of age. Of ſeveral things the church are quite uncertain: they know not whether the parent will live; or if he does, whether he will be faithful to his child; or if he is, whether he will be faithful enough to ſecure the child's ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or if he ſhould <hi>arrive</hi> to ſuch a degree of faithfulneſs, they are ſtill wholly in doubt of the time when the promiſe ſhall be fulfilled, whether next month, the next year, or the next age. Therefore, allowing there be ſuch a connexion as the doctor ſuppoſes, what a poor reaſon it affords to the church to view the child as really holy, and among the number of the ſaved. Whenever a viſible believer offers his child in baptiſm, the language of Chriſt to the church, according to the doctor's repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this.—"<hi>To one of theſe two ſorts of perſons from whom thoſe are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, who are to be ſaved O my people, this child belongs.

               </gap> ſuch matters of the new covenant. Infants being once in covenant, ſay ſome, when were they ever cut off? This queſtion muſt be anſwered by another. Infants being once in the covenant of Sinai, when were they ever cut off? Infants were as really in the covenant of Sinai, as in that of Abraham, but no ſcripture has expreſsly cancelled that article of the Sinai covenant which admitted them. But 'the Sinai covenant was aboliſhed' you may ſay,—ſo it was, as far as it reſpected the temporal ſeed, the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral land, and temporal rights, and ſo was the covenant of Abraham, and neither of them was aboliſhed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled by the law or goſpel, as far as they had refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt and ſpiritual bleſſings. The ſpirituality of both theſe covenants, is everlaſting. The Abraha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic covenant, was included in the covenant of Sinai; as the learned Grotius has juſtly obſerved. Every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, every command, every bleſſing of the covenant of Abraham, is found in the covenant of Sinai. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in particular, was conſidered by Chriſt as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the law of Moſes—'Ye on the ſabbath-day circumciſe a man that the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> might not be broken.' And the covenant of Sinai was no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the native Hebrews than the covenant of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham. Therefore the latter being included in the former, both waxed old and vaniſhed away together; while the ſpiritual bleſſings which they both promiſed, were more clearly exhibited than ever by the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The atonement of Jewiſh prieſts typified and promiſed the atonement of Chriſt and ſpiritual bleſſings: and the covenant of Abraham typified and promiſed the new covenant and its ſpiritual bleſſings.—Yet the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jewiſh prieſts was one thing, and the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt was another—and the covenant of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was one thing, and the new covenant was another. The covenant of Abraham had a two-fold aſpect; to the natural ſeed promiſing temporal bleſſings, and to the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028518_0008_0FD9324DD85779D0"/>ſpiritual feed promiſing ſpiritual bleſſings. When the Lord ſays to Abraham, 'I will be a God to thee &amp; to thy feed,' &amp;c. the meaning is I will be a God to thee and to thy natural ſeed in a temporal ſenſe, and a God to thee and thy ſpiritual ſeed in a ſpiritual ſenſe—giving cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to the former, and heaven to the latter. Of the ſame nature are the covenants of Levi and David. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe covenants are ſo many different covenants of promiſe, to which no doubt the apoſtle refers, when he tells the Epheſians that they had been aliens from this commonwealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe. But the new covenant has no ſuch double aſpect—and here again is a wide difference between the latter and the former.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it appears that an infant may belong to Chriſt's kingdom on the earth, and yet not belong to his viſible kingdom. Chriſt in reality, has but one goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel kingdom, into which none enter but they who are born again; and this real kingdom is partly in heaven, and partly on the earth—'of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.' Chriſt's real church does not really conſiſt of two ſorts of perſons, the one his friends and the other his enemies. His real church is really one bread and one body, and ſo his viſible church is viſibly one bread and one body:—conſequently no one can be properly of his viſible kingdom, who is not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly of his real kingdom. But of this viſibility infants are incapable, as already ſhewn, and therefore cannot properly belong to Chriſt's viſible kingdom:—yet ſome of them doubtleſs belong to his real kingdom.— For 'of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven' ſaith our Lord. q. d. There are ſome infants who belong to my real kingdom; they are born again, which ſhows that all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are capable of receiving my bleſſing. Therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028518_0008_0FD9324DD85779D0"/>not.' The text is plain enough, if we do not make dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties where there are none.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence learn the inconſiſtency occaſioned by infant memberſhip. If infants are members of the church, they ſhould be treated as ſuch. They muſt receive the Lord's ſupper, as once they really did, from the third to the twelfth century.<note n="‖" place="bottom">But it is ſuppoſed this paſſage, 'let a man examine himſelf,' &amp;c. plainly excludes infants from this ſacrament. But doctor Hemmen way tells us, that when Chriſt declares "no one can be his diſciple, unleſs he deny himſelf and take up the croſs," he ſpeaks to <hi>adults,</hi> not to <hi>infants;</hi> and hence infers (page 37) that infants may be diſciples without taking up the croſs. So here! will make the ſame evaſion. Paul ſpeaks to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dults, not to infants, and, 'do this in remembrance of me,' was ſpoken to adults, not to infants. <hi>Infants</hi> may thee partake without ſelf-examination.</note> When they arrive to years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have a right to a ſuffrage in the church, in ſhort, to all the privileges of church members. When they offend, they muſt ſuffer the diſcipline and cenſure of the church; all theſe things are neceſſary to render our practice conformable to infant memberſhip. But, as the ſtate of mankind is and has been, who cannot foreſee the invincible difficulties which this conſiſtency would introduce. Many excommunications muſt take place yearly, or elſe the church would be very ſoon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; yea, the beſt of diſcipline would not prevent this corruption. Mere moraliſts are not chriſtians, and the children of the fleſh being more numerous, would naturally prevail and carry the ſuffrage againſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſpirit. Iſhmael and Iſaac lived together in the ſame family, through all the ages of the Jewiſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, but not very peaceably. The child of the fleſh mocked and perſecuted the child of the ſpirit, 'till wrath came on him to the uttermoſt. But what ſaith the ſcripture 'caſt out the bond-woman and her ſon;" and keep them out too; if not, if we re-admit them, a quarrel in the family or the corruption of it, will be the certain conſequence. Therefore infant memberſhip. Inſtead of being a great privilege, as many would have us believe, is a great diſadvantage to the church—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028518_0009_0FD9324F5B3B3100"/>to theſe infants themſelves, when they come to years: and one great reaſon why this diſadvantage don't now appear plainly, is becauſe they who practice infant memberſhip, proceed in a conſtant courſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency. Infants are received into the church, and as they grow in years, they grow out of it again. One part of their practice contradicts the other, and ſo all goes on in peace and quietneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence it appears that the Jewiſh church was not in all reſpects the ſame with the gospel church. There ſeems to have been a ſort of perſons in the Jewiſh church, which muſt not be received into the goſpel church—Such are infants, who were in covenant and were an holy ſeed, but they muſt not be received into the goſpel church, as already has been ſhewn. And there is a ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons admitted by the goſpel church, which were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Jewiſh church, ſuch are eunuchs, who were never circumciſed, nor allowed to enter into the congregation of the Lord. The olive tree (Rom. xi.) ſo often oppoſed to what is now advanced, is thus natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally explained by Mr. Glaſs—'ſeeing Iſrael after the fleſh became a people by virtue of the promiſe of Chriſt to their fathers, as their ſeed, Chriſt that ſeed, as he ſtood in that promiſe, was the root from whence they grew; and ſo they became a holy people, according to their natural and fleſhly connection with that root. This, the ſame root into which the Gentiles are grafted. The Jews could no more have place in the root, but by faith now the promiſed ſeed was come to bleſs the nation, through faith.' Therefore all, who now really ſtand in the root, ſtand there by real faith; and all who are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in it, are there by viſible faith; of which, as now proved, infants are incapable. We have further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this inference from a paſſage in the genuine epiſtle of St. Barnabas, written in the apoſtolic age. 'But let us go yet further (ſays he) and inquire whether this people (the goſpel church) be the heir, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>WE are now come to the ſecond propoſition. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is in the room of circumciſion. How does this appear? The text commonly made uſe of to prove it, is that in Col. ii. 11. "In whom alſo ye are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt." The circumciſion of Chriſt, ſome ſay, means here the water baptiſm of Chriſtians; but why ſo? Is there no other way to explain it?—Yes, there is, and without tautology too. The circumciſion of Chriſt rendered him a debtor to keep the whole law. By it he freely obligated himſelf to become the end of the law for righteouſneſs to very one who believeth. Therefore it may be properly ſaid that we receive the ſpiritual circumciſion, by the circumciſion of Chriſt. Paul here firſt tells us what the chriſtian circumciſion is,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028518_0010_0FD93250CB3DA7B0"/>made without hands; then he deſcribes it more fully, "in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh'; and then he tells us by whoſe means it is, "by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt." Now we find no tautology in all this. The verſe is plain enough, quite eaſy to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. It ſpeaks of circumcision, not of water-baptiſm; and we had better let it ſtand as it is, and ſpeak for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Bible don't ſo often ſpeak one thing and mean another, as our errors naturally lead us to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. But it is ſaid that chriſtians are called 'the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion'. Go then and offer ſacrifice or ſomething <hi>in the room of it,</hi> for chriſtians are called the prieſthood too. If it could be only proved that baptiſm ſucceeds circumciſion <hi>in all reſpects</hi> the inference would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable that baptiſm ſhould be applied to <hi>ſome</hi> infants. But how far is this from being the caſe. Circumciſion rendered them debtors to keep the whole ceremonial law; it was not performed till the eigth day: it was not applied to female children, nor to eunuch children, if their parents were ever ſo pious. It was the token of a different covenant from that of baptiſm, as already has been ſhewn. Circumciſion was the ſeal of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's faith—a ſure teſtimony from God that his faith was counted for righteouſneſs; that he was a fit perſon to be a father of the faithful, circumciſed or uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. But baptiſm is not thus the ſeal of Abraham's faith, nor of any other man's faith. Now what ſhall we think of circumciſion and baptiſm—do they look alike? do they reſemble one another very much? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for a minute that baptiſm does ſucceed circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in ſome reſpects, what warrant have you to baptize infants till the eighth day? What warrant have you to baptize female children? What warrant have you to baptize eunuch children? If baptiſm be in the room of circumciſion, why did the apoſtles never make uſe of it as an argument for the abolition of circumciſion?

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ried for any thing which appears to the contrary, and the brethren in her houſe were comforted. The houſe of the jailor belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but infants cannot believe—for faith comes by hearing; and the houſe of Stephanus addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the miniſtry of the ſaints, but infants cannot addict themſelves to the miniſtry of the ſaints. In ſhort their argument amounts to this;—there were three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities baptized, and there were infants among them:—Why? becauſe infants are apt to be in-houſes. Alſo the characters of theſe families now mentioned, admit that no perſon in them was baptized, but on the ground of his own faith. And after all, the argument from theſe families proves too much, and therefore not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough—It proves that, when the head of a family be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, the whole houſe muſt be baptized, old or young virtuous or profane.</p>
            <p>Thus it is manifeſt, that neither of the three propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions appears to be true.—Infants are not viſibly in the new covenant: baptiſm is not in room of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and there appears not to have been one family in the apoſtolic age, which had an infant or any other perſon baptized on the ground of the faith of the head of the family.

Auſtin ſays that the baptiſm of infants is what the church has always had, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways held.

Strange! did he never hear of Ternillian? did he never hear of the Manichees? And as for Auſtin, we hear he maintained it to be lawful to tell lies for the good of the church. But granting he meant the truth, he might take it only from Origen, who, nearly in the middle of the third century, ſays, 'the church received a tradition from the apoſtles to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter baptiſm to infants.' But exorciſm, ſufflation, trine, immerſion, bowing to the eaſt, and the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eaſter, all exiſted in that day, and ſome of them by tradition from the apoſtles, as evidently, if not more ſo, than infant baptiſm. It may be well known how exceedingly inclined ſuperſtition was in that day to ſhelter itſelf under the wing of apoſtolic tradition. Therefore, if that early account of tradition in favor of infant baptiſm will warrant the practice of it, the ſame will warrant other ſuperſtitions alſo.

The contention was furious, and the effect was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of the eaſtern churches. Now if it was ſo difficult within twenty years from the apoſtles to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what tradition was truly received from them, how are we to find out at this day what tradition was truly apoſtolical?

Why did the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles neglect it? why did Ignatins neglect it, in all his ſeven devout epiſtles? why was this uſeful exhortation, and every thing elſe which can even imply infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, wholly omitted by Polycarp, Clement, Barnabas Hermas, Juſtin, and in all that large volume of Irene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us againſt hereſies. In ſhort, by every chriſtian writer of the two firſt centuries. They mention the baptiſm of adults very frequently, but of the other there is not a word, not a whiſper in any author of thoſe times Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, chriſtian, heathen, ſacred or profane: all is ſilence profound, not only in the bible, but every where elſe (except now and then ſomething which ſtrongly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the contrary) till the third century; and then it was a long time before the practice can be proved to have been univerſal, if it ever became ſo at all. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, ſon of Helena, a zealous chriſtian, was not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized till he was thirty years old; and Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, ſon of a chriſtian miniſter and educated by him, was not baptized till he came to years. He himſelf once entirely oppoſed the practice, aſſerting expreſsly that children ſhould not be baptized till they are three years old.' And, as both he and his father were influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential characters in the church, it is utterly improbable that they ſhould be alone in this affair; the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is violent that there were whole ſocieties in that
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028518_0014_0FD9325E4D2C96D0"/>day of the ſame opinion. The council of Carthage however decreed the practice (it exiſted before, but was never decreed by a council till that time) as well as the time of it, as appears from the teſtimony of Strabo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by their own reſult.</p>
            <p>Such was the ſtate of this matter in the earlieſt times<note n="‖" place="bottom">And now approaches that long and dark night of popery. Few, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few of the baptiſt perſuaſion are any more heard of for ſeveral ſtupid ages, as our opponents have ſo frequently and very juſtly obſerved. All the world practiced infant baptiſm, and (in other reſpects not at all reſembling our preſent poedobaptiſt brethren) wondered after the beaſt. A little before the middle of the twelfth century, our poedobaptiſt hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans inform us, that ſome ſmall degree of light appeared, but they ſay it was ſoon extinguiſhed by the barbarous cruſades, which deſtroyed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed the bearers of it all over Europe. About the year 1130 Dr. Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menway ſays 'that a ſmall ſect of anabaptiſts appeared; but it ſoon dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled to nothing." And then all the world baptized infants again, as our opponents have juſtly obſerved, and wondered till the 15th. century; and then again appeared the light and the Lollards, and knowledge and the brabe defenders of pure worſhip in Bohemia. But the reformation which ſhould be remembered with gratitude forever, was enjoyed about a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury after, and ſpread far and wide by the inſtrumentality of Felix Mans, Conrad Grebel, Mennon Simonis, Calvin, Luther and others. Yet ſome of thoſe reformers, in oppoſition to the tyranny of that age, ſeem to have tranſgreſſed the limits of order in Munfter and Amſterdam—'Oppreſſion will make a wife man mad.' Queſtion: 'Was it not cruel in the poedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts of that time, to treat the leader of that unhappy people ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, and grieve ſo many faints in the Netherlands?"

                  </gap>el queſtion this is! Innuendo how unbecoming our polite age! our poedobaptiſt brethren are not accountable for what was done in Munſter or the Netherlands. There were poedobaptiſts in the world long before the cruel death of John of Leyden. And no deno nination of chriſtians ſince the third century (if the appearance of adulation may be pardoned) have excelled them in the production of characters conſpicuous for huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, benevolence and piety.</note> and accordingly a number of learned and pious poedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts have ingenuouſly owned what is now advanced Dr. Taylor ſays, 'that there is a tradition to baptize in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, depends but on two witneſſes, Origen and Auſtin, and the latter having received it from the former, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſolely on a ſingle teſtimony, which is but a pitiful
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028518_0014_0FD9325E4D2C96D0"/>argument to prove a tradition apoſtolieal.' Mr. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a warm advocate for the cauſe againſt M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> antiquity, was forced to this generous acknowledgment, 'I will confeſs (ſaid he) that it was long before all were agreed, either as to the time or neceſſity of baptizing infants." Vives, one of the moſt learned men of his time, in his commentary on St. Auſtin's <hi>City of God,</hi> ſays 'None were baptized of old but thoſe who not only knew what the myſtical water meant, but deſired the ſame.' Mr. Daille tells us, 'that in ancient times, they often deferred the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of infants, as appears (ſays he) from the hiſtory of Conſtantine, of Conſtantius, of Theodoſius, and Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian, in Gratian, and alſo from the orations and homilies of Gregory Nazianzen and St. Baſil on this ſubject, and ſome of the fathers too, have been of opinion that it is fit it ſhould be deferred; whence it is that they (the papiſts) cannot endure the mention of it at this day, and would abhor the man who ſhould attempt to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the practice.' Walifrid Strabo, who flouriſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 750, and made the hiſtory of the church his ſtudy, and who doubtleſs read ancient manuſcripts, which are now loſt, ſays 'In the firſt times the grace of baptiſm was wont to be given only to thoſe who had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to that matority of mind and body, that they could know what were the benefits of baptiſm, but afterwards, chriſtians underſtanding original ſin, and leaſt their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould periſh without the means of grace, had them baptized by the decree of the council of Africa, for which purpoſe godfathers and godmothers were invented." The ſame is owned by Bohemeus, Ribera, Grotius, and ſeveral others. What could tempt all theſe le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

2. Hence learn the neceſſity of gratitude to God, and charity to our fellow chriſtians. If what has been oppoſed be an error, it is certainly an error of the moſt learned and pious, if we may judge the tree by its fruit. Behold the infinite kindneſs of him who giveth to all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally who are upright in heart, and upbraideth us not with our follies. Let us beware then that we upbraid not each other: bear one another's burdens and ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the law of Chriſt.<note n="¶" place="bottom">Cloſe communion with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and the refuſal of the deſk with our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, may be accounted for without attributing either of them to the want of true charity. Charity is love; and the more love any chriſtian has, the more precious in his view with be every apparent goſpel truth. Hence he is grieved to ſee that which his charity has tendered ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to him trampled in the duſt, eſpecially by a friend and brother— Conſequently the more charity he has, the more he is grieved, and the expreſſion of his grief, proper or improper, will naturally follow.

Hence appears the difference, great as that of heaven and earth, between the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God's people, and the catholiciſm of our <hi>age of reaſon,</hi> which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers no ſpiritual truths in our glorious goſpel, and looks down on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chriſtian profeſſion, on the Bible, and on the heavens with equal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and contempt.</note> Labour to find out the very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant diſtinction between ſentimental difference, and perſonal enmity. Take care how you open your lips <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the terms <hi>hireling, prieſtcraft, ſcribes and phariſees,</hi> &amp;c to pleaſe the charitable deiſts, and reproach the true ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. Beware of ridiculing or ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king contemptuouſly of the practice, which has now been oppoſed, or of any thing elſe which any of our fellow chriſtians eſteem ſacred. Conſidering our own frailty of mind, and how very common it is for men wandering in the wilderneſs of error to be full of vain confidence that the path of truth is before them. There is a wide difference between this vain confidence of the proud hypocrite, and that full, but humble perſuaſion of the truth, which diſpoſes the true chriſtian to contend
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028518_0015_0FD9325FD6FA7A10"/>earneſtly for it. Therefore while we contend, let us ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the things which make for peace, earneſtly praying for that glorious day, when the bright beams of Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel's glory ſhall illuminate and harmonize the whole Iſrael of God, and there ſhall be no more a prickling bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or grieving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
