            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>

            <p>MANY and great are the changes which come to paſs in the natural and moral world; and as far as they fall under our view, are carefully to be regarded. Such as are of a ſingular nature, which ſeldom happen, and are intereſting to us, in our ſeveral relations and particular connexions, deſerve ſpecial notice.</p>
            <p>Religious combinations are the more import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. Mutual duties are incumbent on all the members; and none more ſo than thoſe between Paſtor and Flock, Miniſter and People. Changes, therefore, among them, call for a wiſe and relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious improvement. Serious and ſolemn reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will become all in that relation, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who have long been ſo, who have ſeen a variety of changes in the courſe of providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:025379_0003_0FCEDA3E989434B0"/>
As I have ſtood in the relation of Paſtor to the Flock of GOD in this place, for about thirty years; and half a century, or fifty complete years, have rolled away ſince I was firſt introduced into that ſacred office, though not now in the relation of Paſtor, yet, on ſuch an occaſion, would willingly call up your attention to matters of the greateſt importance to thoſe who attended my miniſtry, and eſpecially to myſelf.</p>
            <p>The words which have been read, will afford matter of inſtruction, counſel, caution, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to thoſe in that relation; how they ſhould conduct, what they may reaſonably expect, and the happy conſequences to them that are faithful.</p>
            <p>Let us attend a little ſeriouſly; and may the bleſſed ſpirit of CHRIST aſſiſt and influence both ſpeaker and hearers to a right improvement of what may be delivered, that our preſent meeting may not be loſt time to any of us.</p>
            <p>Our text was penned by Paul, the Apoſtle and Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, who ſtood in ſome particular relation to the Church in Corinth. He and they had mutual concerns with each other in that relation.</p>
            <p>Having founded a Church there, and ſpent a year and a half in preaching the Goſpel there, he left them and travelled elſewhere. But hearing of things amiſs, he wrote to them, to inſtruct and direct them; and alſo to vindicate his character from divers imputations, charged upon him by the falſe apoſtles, and to defend himſelf and apoſtleſhip againſt ſome that brought both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and it into diſgrace and contempt. He had
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025379_0004_0FCEDA3F8DBDD668"/>
been greatly admired, approved of, and careſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but now finds his intereſt in their affections cooling: They had not the ſame good opinion of him as formerly. Though they had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by his miniſtry, and greatly profited, yet now it ſeems they were uneaſy and diſſatisfied, and charged him with faults and miſtakes that he had never committed. Probably his plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and faithfulneſs in his friendly reproof and counſel, was the occaſion. Be that as it may; it greatly grieved and affected this good man. He was much troubled and afflicted; and he vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates his innocency, profeſſes his integrity, and appeals to them that they <hi>had</hi> acknowledged him, and had no reaſon to do otherwiſe <hi>now,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they would acknowledge him, and that he ſhould be the occaſion of <hi>their rejoicing,</hi> as he doubted not that they would be of <hi>his, in the day of the</hi> LORD JESUS. <hi>As alſo you have acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye alſo are ours, in the day of the</hi> LORD JESUS.</p>
            <p>Our Apoſtle believed that he himſelf ſhould be approved of in the great reckoning day, and that ſome of them would then be the crown of his rejoicing, and he of theirs. By <hi>day of the</hi> LORD JESUS is intended ſome ſpecial and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable day. The day of the final judgment is ſuch a day. It is the winding up and fitting all things for eternity. It is the great and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day of the LORD. As mankind will have ſomething to do on that day, great are the events of it. Our Apoſtle had it in his view, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded his chriſtian Corinthians of it. He and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025379_0005_0FCEDA4114BD5380"/>
they ſtood in ſome ſpecial relation; they had ſpecial connexions; and the tranſactions of that day, would, in ſome reſpects, be otherwiſe to them than to others.</p>
            <p>There is a debt of reciprocal duty, love, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem, due from Goſpel Miniſters to their People in this world. They have opportunity of doing and receiving good from each other; they are therefore often to meet together for ſolemn ſocial worſhip. There are peculiar duties and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges between them: And they muſt meet one another before CHRIST'S tribunal, at the day of judgment. Their preſent meeting will be very different from that.</p>
            <p>Here they meet often; there is occaſion for it; it is neceſſary, a commanded duty, to meet from Sabbath to Sabbath, and at other times, for the worſhip of GOD, and the ſervices of the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary; and they meet to part and meet again. Here they meet to attend the uſe of means for the awakening of ſinners, and the comfort of ſaints; for the inſtructing of the ignorant, and reſolving, the doubting; for the healing of difficulties, and ſettling of controverſies; alſo for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the divine rule, that ſaints may be quickened to greater diligence in the ways of godlineſs, and better prepared for eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In the great day of accounts it will be otherwiſe. There will then be no uſe of means to effect any change in perſons' ſtate. The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will remain under the guilt of ſin, and the ſaint happy and bleſſed forever. All things will be ſettled for eternity. Here they remain, many
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025379_0006_0FCEDA4339E8FF38"/>
times, unſettled, and little notice taken of the means uſed for their ſafety. In the great day of accounts the end of their meeting will be very different: To give up an account of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards one another in that relation. Miniſters <hi>watch for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as thoſe who muſt give an account.</hi> They are Ambaſſadors for CHRIST, and muſt render to him an account of their embaſſy; what they have done; what reception they have met with; what ſucceſs they have had; and how the matter ſtands between their Maſter and them: And this will be done, in the preſence of their People, before the great JUDGE.</p>
            <p>Faithful Miniſters will give up an account with joy, concerning thoſe who have given them a kind entertainment. Thoſe who have acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged them in their office, ſhall be the occaſion of great joy. <hi>We are your rejoicing, even as ye are ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, faithful Miniſters will give an account of the ill treatment they have met with, from any who have not acknowledged them, but have ſlighted and deſpiſed them, miſuſed and abuſed them, and diſregarded the meſſages brought to them: They will witneſs againſt ſuch to their confuſion and condemnation.</p>
            <p>On the other hand: If Miniſters have been unfaithful, and betrayed the truſt repoſed in them; if they have neglected the duty of their office; their people will riſe up againſt them, and be ſwift witneſſes to their everlaſting perdition.</p>
            <p>This is one end of their meeting. Another is, that the LORD JESUS may judge between them,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025379_0007_0FCEDA44157E2AB0"/>
and ſettle all diſputes that have ſubſiſted between them here. It ofttimes happens that controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ariſe between Miniſters and their People: Sometimes to a very great degree, and of long continuance. Sometimes the fault is on the one part, and ſometimes on the other, and ſometimes in both. Sometimes theſe diſputes are decided in this world, and ofttimes by party and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and ofttimes remain undetermined. But in the great day of accounts there will be a full, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, juſt, and upright deciſion; and then it will be known who is in the right, and who is in the wrong. All controverſies will be ſettled forever.</p>
            <p>And then they will receive ſentence, in the preſence of each other, according to their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here. Juſtice will then take place upon all perſons. He who has done well ſhall be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he who has done ill ſhall be condemned. <hi>Every man ſhall then receive the reward of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faithful Miniſters ſhall be abundantly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>They that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteouſneſs, as the ſtars forever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they who have received them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of their meſſages, and given a cordial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to the offers of the Goſpel, as made to them, ſhall be amply rewarded alſo.</p>
            <p>Such a Miniſter and People ſhall be each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's <hi>joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of the</hi> LORD JESUS.</p>
            <p>On the other hand: Do any ill treat the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of CHRIST; refuſe to hearken to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025379_0008_0FCEDA47CC3E9520"/>
their meſſages delivered in their Maſter's name, and by his order; do they deſpiſe and reject them: will <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not receive them, but refuſe to hear their word, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for them. And,</p>
            <p>If Miniſters prove themſelves unfaithful, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecters of the work and buſineſs of their office, betrayers of their Maſter's cauſe, imbibe corrupt principles, or purſue ill practices, the righteous Judge will deal out in anger and fiery rebukes. The blood of ſouls, loſt through the unſkilfulneſs and unfaithfulneſs of the watchman, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at his hands.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſuggeſted, we learn the near relation and connexion between a Miniſter and the People of his charge, and the reciprocal duties incumbent upon each of them.</p>
            <p>Natural relations, as parents and children, are near, intimate, and intereſting; and there is a ſpecial debt of care, love, eſteem, and kindneſs, due from them. Civil connexions oblige the parties to particular duties. Every relation has its burdens and comforts: But none equal to thoſe in a religious character; and that between Paſtor and People is the more intimate.</p>
            <p>The Paſtor is to feed the Flock; the Shepherd to take care of the Sheep; the Steward is to regard the ſtate of his Houſehold: Miniſters have great concerns with their People; and they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny concerns with them. The duty is recip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:025379_0009_0FCEDA4ACBA1EBA8"/>
Miniſters are the Ambaſſadors of CHRIST, and to pray their hearers, in his ſtead, to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to GOD. So that their office is an office of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and honour. They are to be reſpected and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured by their People; their miniſtrations are to be attended upon; and the doctrines of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as diſpenſed by them, carefully regarded. They are to be viewed as the meſſengers of the LORD of Hoſts.</p>
            <p>Goſpel Miniſters are under the ſtrongeſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to faithfulneſs. They are to preach the Goſpel; keep cloſe to their commiſſion. The Apoſtles did ſo: <hi>Our exhortation was not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, nor of uncleanneſs, nor of guile; but as we are allowed of GOD, to be put in truſt with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, even ſo we ſpeak, not as pleaſing men, but</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>Let Miniſters then, and the People of their charge, know and fulfil the ſeveral truſts repoſed in them.</p>
            <p>That they ſtand in a ſpecial relation, we have already conſidered; that there are duties of the greateſt concernment, is alſo evident; and that events, of the laſt importance, under GOD, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the faithful diſcharge of their truſt, is alike manifeſt. They muſt meet together in the day of judgment, and give account to the Chief Shepherd, how they have conducted here; and there will be ſomething ſpecial in the affairs of the judgment relative to them, from what it is towards others.</p>
            <p>Now it is of the laſt importance to the intereſt of CHRIST'S kingdom, and eſpecially to their ſouls' ſalvation, that they be faithful to GOD, and

to the truſt repoſed in them, and that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſeveral duties incumbent upon them.</p>
            <p>Let Miniſters then ſee to it, that they be men of GOD. This is of infinite importance with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to themſelves. They muſt take heed to themſelves, as they would not be caſtaways; and to the Flock committed to their charge, as they would be <hi>pure from the blood of all men.</hi> If any are loſt through their neglect, their blood will be required of them. And that none may, through their faulty neglect, they muſt be men of learning, judgement, ſeriouſneſs, patience, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and of exemplary holineſs. They need to be men of integrity, truth, and righteouſneſs; men of wiſdom; ſkilful in the affairs of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; full of affection towards the ſouls of men, and of long ſuffering towards all men. They ought to watch for ſouls; ſeek all opportunities for their ſafety; do good to all as they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and willingly <hi>give no offence, that the miniſtry be not blamed: But in all things approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves as the Miniſters of</hi> CHRIST.</p>
            <p>So our Apoſtle did. He could appeal to GOD, to his conſcience, to his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and to all the people, in the ſeveral places where he had preached, that he preached the truth, plain truth, and neceſſary truth. And his life was a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of his preaching.</p>
            <p>Happy for thoſe Miniſters, thus animated and influenced, to conduct in ſuch an holy, exampla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wiſe, and prudent manner.</p>
            <p>Let People alſo ſee how they conduct towards their Miniſters. They ſhould treat them with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025379_0011_0FCED9E424FB3190"/>
kindneſs; ſpeak highly of their office; view them as the Ambaſſadors of CHRIST. They ſhould be ready and willing to receive the truths of the Goſpel from their lips; acknowledge them as lights of the world; give their meſſages a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial entertainment; and remember, when they have to deal with them, they have to deal with CHRIST'S meſſengers, and that they muſt meet them in the great reckoning day, and give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how they have heard and received, how they have attended and regarded, or how they have rejected and deſpiſed, the calls and invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the counſels and inſtructions, the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and reproofs, which have been ſet before them.</p>
            <p>Certainly faithful Miniſters, in the wiſe and prudent diſcharge of their office, deſerve a kind reception, a welcome entertainment, and not to be reproached and vilified.</p>
            <p>Says holy Flavel, "Your reſpect to them is founded upon their office and employments for you. They watch for your ſouls: Dare any of you watch for their halting, for their ruin? They bring glad tidings: Shall they return with ſad tidings to him that ſent them? They publiſh peace: Shall they be rewarded with trouble? O ungrateful world! what a ſtrange challenge was that, <hi>Which of all the prophets have not your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſecuted?</hi> The office of the miniſtry ſpeaks the abundant love of GOD to you; your abuſe of it ſpeaks the abundant malignity of your hearts towards him. It was a ſad proteſtation of Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah againſt an ungrateful people; <hi>Shall evil be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025379_0012_0FCEDA500C247D70"/>
recompenſed for good? For they have digged a pit for my ſoul. Remember, that I ſtood before thee, to ſpeak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.</hi>"</p>
            <p>LET us proceed to bring theſe matters home to <hi>ourſelves,</hi> and ſee what intereſt we have in them. It is of vaſt importance that we be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed, our conſciences awake, and we wiſely improving theſe alarming truths.</p>
            <p>My brethren and my friends, you who are of this Chriſtian Society, who generally and ſtatedly have attended the worſhip of GOD in this place; you who were once the People of my charge, how often have ſome of us met, in our former houſe, in this relation! How often have I ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the word of GOD to ſome of you! counſelled and inſtructed, aſſiſted and directed you, in the affairs of religion! How often have I adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the holy ordinances of the Goſpel to ſome of you, as the People of my charge.</p>
            <p>About thirty years rolled away, whilſt I ſtood in the relation of Paſtor to the Church and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in this town; during which time I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſerve your beſt intereſts, according to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> capacity. I ſpent the prime of my life, and the beſt of my days, in labouring for your good; and, <hi>through much infirmity</hi> (at leaſt as to ſome of the time) <hi>preaching the Goſpel unto you.</hi> For <hi>I was with you in weakneſs, and in fear, and in much trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to thoſe of you who were the firſt, and after builders up of this ſociety, and did contiune with me
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025379_0013_0FCEDA518ACFCAB0"/>
in my miniſtry, how often have we met together! Sometimes in kind, friendly viſits, for cultivating good neighbourhood, and ſtrengthening affections.</p>
            <p>How often have I been with ſome of you in your days of trouble and diſtreſs, when a cloud was drawn over your tabernacles, you filled with bitterneſs, and made to drink the wine of aſtoniſhment: When ſickneſs ſeized you; when death brake in upon you; when ſome of your deareſt friends, and ſweeteſt enjoyments, were removed from you; when diſtreſs and anguiſh were ready to everwhelm you! I then endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to adminiſter relief and comfort to you, and gave you the beſt inſtructions and counſels that I was capable of. And you have been with me when I myſelf was <hi>the man</hi> who ſaw <hi>affliction by the rod of</hi> GOD'S <hi>wrath; when he led me, and brought me into darkneſs, and not into light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been with many of you in private, in converſing with you reſpecting the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concerns of your ſouls, to lead and aſſiſt you in your ſolemn publick engagements, when you covenanted with GOD and his People, in publick manner.</p>
            <p>How often have I been with ſome of you, in our former houſe, for the worſhip of GOD, and an attendance upon the ordinances of the Goſpel, that by them we might be quickened and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, ſtabliſhed and ſtrengthened, in the ways of godlineſs!</p>
            <p>What pleaſure and ſatisfaction did it yield, when the bonds of friendſhip were ſtrengthened; when the peace and comfort of the community was
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025379_0014_0FCEDA55F69D4AF0"/>
greatly promoted; and eſpecially when the power and grace of CHRIST were manifeſted, his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence and kind influences abundantly diſplayed! What pleaſant, comfortable meeting to ſome of us, (I appeal to your conſciences whether you have not ſometimes found it ſo) when you ſat under the ſhadow of CHRIST'S or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and found the fruit of them ſweet to your taſte; when GOD ſpake peace to your ſouls, and let in divine light and joy into your hearts!</p>
            <p>Thus I have been with ſome of you, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grace given me, I cared for you in my preaching; I ſtudied to find <hi>out acceptable words, even words of wiſdom,</hi> and kept nothing back which I judged would be profitable for you.</p>
            <p>Thus, I ſay, we have met together, ſome few of us, at leaſt, for the ſpace of about thirty years; though but few for that period; the greater part not half that term; and ſome of you for a few years only. But now ſuch opportunities are at an end, never to return again, in the character and connexion of Paſtor and Flock. That relation is now diſſolved. Full twenty years have rolled away ſince. And verily ſuch opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of meeting were at an end, as to many of my charge, before my diſmiſſion. For death, and a removal of habitation, had greatly changed the People of my charge. Only two of the firſt fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies remained, with both their heads living, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; and thirteen members of the church were removed, moſtly by death; and above forty perſons that were or had been heads of families. Their days were numbered before my paſtoral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025379_0015_0FCEDA56CB4A84A8"/>
to you ceaſed. O, how ſwift are the wings of time to haſten us into the inviſible world! Our natural, civil, and religious connexions will ſoon ceaſe. We are all haſtening into eternity.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs my day of life will ſoon be ended! The graves are ready for me! I am now in the ſeventy third year of my age, and labouring under many and growing infirmities. Shortly, very ſhortly, this month, which has often ſpoken to you the words of life, will be filled with gravel; theſe eyes, that now ſee you, cloſed in death; this hand, which has adminiſtered the water of holy baptiſm, to a great number of you, will be withering in the rotting grave; this body locked up in that <hi>houſe appointed for all living;</hi> and the ſpirit aſcend to the SUPREME JUDGE, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the deeds done in the body. How ſolemn the thought! How affecting the conſideration! How worthy of attention! I ſhall then have no more concern with any of you in this world; and perhaps ſome of you who have been the People of my charge, may be ready to think we ſhall never have concern with each other again. But, dear brethren, let us remember, that after all, there will be another meeting, and in another manner, and for other purpoſes; to give up an account how we have conducted towards each other in the relation of Paſtor and People. Let us think of the awfulneſs and ſolemnity of that day, when all things will be ſettled for eternity. Let us lay in for a happy meeting then, that it may be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of pleaſure and ſatisfaction, of joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Let us therefore now review our paſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025379_0016_0FCEDA5AC4693A08"/>
conduct, and ſee what has been amiſs; repent, and reform. Let us know our preſent temper; that it be agreeable to the divine will. And let our future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and conduct be holy and without blame.</p>
            <p>Many things have been out of place, I doubt not, in our various relations and connexions, and many things amiſs in this.</p>
            <p>When I view my own conduct, as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and ſee the many defects and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures; the many miſtakes and imprudencies; and the many culpable deficiencies; and then think of appearing before the SUPREME JUDGE, in the great audit day, how is my heart ſoftened, and my ſoul filled with ſhame and bluſhing! And were it not that the blood of JESUS was ſhed for the Prieſthood, as well as the Congregation, confuſion would cover me: But I deſire to be ſprinkled with that blood, and found under the REDEEMER'S wings, and look for pardon, relief, and ſafety, through him. May I be <hi>your rejoicing, in the day of the</hi> LORD JESUS.</p>
            <p>And you, my brethren, the children of GOD, who have been enlightened by his word, and quickened by his SPIRIT; who have taſted the ſweets of divine ordinances, as adminiſtered by me; and have been built up thereby, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life, and have been comforted; you will be led to bleſs God for his goodneſs, and ſtill love the means of inſtruction, and ſeek for further ſatisfaction and conſolation.</p>
            <p>You who are members of this Church, and have covenanted with GOD and one another, will be pleaſed to remember the bonds of the covenant
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025379_0017_0FCEDA5C2BE820A8"/>
are ſacred, and may not be eaſily broken without ſin. You will therefore be prevailed upon, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil them with care and diligence.</p>
            <p>You who have received the initiating ſeal by baptiſm, as adminiſtered by me; (and, how many of that number! more than ſixty of them in fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies!) you, my young friends, will conſider that you are bound to the ſervice of GOD, and ſtand in a particular relation to this Church; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you to fulfil your baptiſmal engagements, and walk circumſpectly. You will not ſuddenly nor eaſily be removed from your belief of the validity of your baptiſm.</p>
            <p>You who have attended with us, and purpoſe, as well as are bound, to attend the publick worſhip, and the publick ordinances, in this place, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by your preſent Paſtor, will endeavour to attend with diligence and conſtancy; will deſire to gain inſtruction and further inſight into the great truths and duties of our holy religion, and to be built up a ſpiritual houſe, to offer to GOD ſpiritual ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, acceptable by JESUS CHRIST. You will, therefore, earneſtly deſire to experience the power of divine grace, the pleaſures of the divine life, and the joys of the ſaints; and will ſtrive to live and act, at all times, agreeable to the rules of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>If any have been careleſs ſouls, and yet remain ſo, let them know, it will be a dreadful meeting in the day of judgment, if they remain in their ſins, and unconcerned for the divine honour.</p>
            <p>And may awakened ſouls ſee to it that they do not ſtifle convictions; that they are built upon the rock CHRIST; that they take up with noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025379_0018_0FCEDA5D9A35DE90"/>
ſhort of heavenly grace; with nothing ſhort of an heart moulded into the temper of CHRIST; with nothing ſhort of a goſpel faith, and goſpel holineſs.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay more? I have already treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed upon your patience. Love to your ſouls, whoſe happineſs I earneſtly deſire now, as well as when I ſtood in the paſtoral relation, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained me.</p>
            <p>Though it is more than time I had done, yet I know not how to diſmiſs the ſubject, until I have offered ſomething to the Congregation at large; to this whole Society.</p>
            <p>Great are the changes that have happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, ſince my firſt appearing as a Miniſter of the Goſpel. Fifty complete years have rolled away. On ſuch an occaſion ſuffer me to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and hold up to view, ſome few of the <hi>remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables</hi> which have taken place.</p>
            <p>On January 9, 1740<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you were incorporated into a town<note n="*" place="bottom">Holden was originally Worceſter, north half; It had its name to perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate the memory of the Hon. Samuel Holden, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of London, a great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to theſe Churches.</note>, then few in number, about twenty families. Since which time how are you increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! now about one hundred and ſeventy: And by the late cenſus you were found to be one thouſand and ſeventy ſeven perſons. At firſt your increaſe was ſlow; little alteration for the term of five years; but, afterward, the increaſe much more; for, at the end of ten years, your number of fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies was fifty five. For the ſecond ten years, the increaſe in families was small, only ten. The laſt ten years of my miniſtry, the increaſe was forty one. The whole number, at my diſmiſſion,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025379_0019_0FCEDA5F41BC7158"/>
about one hundred and ſix families. Not more than five or ſix of the fifty five, with both their heads, are living among us. There had been ſix hundred and forty two births; about three hundred and thirty were males, and about three hundred and ten were females: The increaſe of males about thirty. There have died two hundred and fourteen perſons; about eighty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the age of two years; and more than half un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the age of five.</p>
            <p>The number of the baptized, by me, about five hundred and twenty: And ſince, by your preſent Paſtor, four hundred and twenty nine. So that there has been almoſt a thouſand baptiſms.</p>
            <p>The Church, when firſt embodied, conſiſted of fourteen males. In the firſt ten years of my min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, it increaſed to more than ſixty members; of which number there were more males than females, about thirty two of them new members; the reſt from other Churches: In which time of ten years, there died nine females, and not one male. Six perſons had been diſmiſſed to other Churches.</p>
            <p>At the end of twenty years the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of about ſeventy five members, and when I was diſmiſſed, of eighty ſix; thirty eight males; forty eight females. The Church now conſiſts of thirty three males, and forty ſix females. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thirty years of my miniſtry there had been fifty four removed from us, ſome by diſmiſſion to other Churches, but moſtly by death.</p>
            <p>Seventy one perſons have owned the covenant, under my adminiſtration, and a like number un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your preſent Paſtor's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:025379_0020_0FCEDA62DD25A3B0"/>
There was a remarkable ſickneſs about ſeven years after my ſettlement: Twenty two perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And about ſix years after, the year after the great earthquake, a raging diſtemper carried off about forty five perſons in a ſhort time, moſtly young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perſons and children.</p>
            <p>Soon after my leaving the Miniſtry among you, you were religiouſly concerned to have the Goſpel Miniſtry reſettled among you; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two years rolled away, found, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſettled, your preſent Paſtor.</p>
            <p>May his days be much longer, and his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try much more ſucceſsful, than his predeceſſor's.</p>
            <p>You have alſo lately erected and finiſhed this ſpacious and well ornamented houſe, for the publick worſhip. May the glory of it be as much greater than the glory of the former houſe, in the beſtowment of ſpiritual bleſſings, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, of divine grace, in and with divine ordinances, as it is more magnifical.</p>
            <p>And now what ſhall I ſay? Will you, my aged fathers and friends, wake up: Ariſe and trim your lamps: Be in earneſt to give glory to GOD, <hi>before your feet ſtumble upon the dark mountains?</hi> The ſhadows of the evening are ſtreched out to a great length, as to ſome of us. The ſun is near down. The graves are ready for us. A very few ſands in the glaſs. Let us be thankful that GOD has ſpared us, when ſo many of our ancient friends and acquaintances are gone before us; and divers of late. Six of a religious character. The moſt of them were among the firſt builders up of the ſociety, and lived in it more than forty
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025379_0021_0FCEDA644ED90298"/>
years. We have often taken <hi>ſweet counſel</hi> with them, and gone <hi>to the houſe of</hi> GOD <hi>in company:</hi> But we ſhall ſee their faces here no more. It becomes us to cry with the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Help,</hi> LORD, <hi>when the godly ceaſe, and the faithful <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from among the children of men!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The widows and the fatherleſs have greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased of late. Many are the mourners that go about the ſtreets. There are at leaſt twenty four widows in the ſociety, and not more than one widower. Four younger perſons have deceaſed in the year paſt; one lately of the ſmall pox.</p>
            <p>We are now beginning a new year. O! my friends, let us be more than ever concerned for the life of that religion, which is the life of our ſouls. Let us walk by faith; live upon the promiſes; be in earneſt for GOD, for religion, and for the welfare of mankind. Let us be much and often in the duties of ſelf examination, med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation, and prayer; attending all the means of grace. And may you be your preſent Paſtor's joy and rejoicing here, and his and mine <hi>in the day of the</hi> LORD JESUS.</p>
            <p>May you that are in the middle of life, or riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in uſefulneſs, be religiously concerned to live to the divine honour. You have ſpecial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages put into your hands. You have the publick miniſtry, and goſpel worſhip, to attend upon. Will not you be careful to improve them to the honour of the REDEEMER, and your own profit and ſpiritual comfort? Why will you not? Let me plead with you to ſet up and keep up family religion. Are you baptized perſons?
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025379_0022_0FCEDA65D581CC60"/>
Yes; the moſt of you. Think of your obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Have not a number of you bound your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by covenant engagements? And why, my friends, ſhould any be unwilling? Let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to love the religion of JESUS. Love the preached word, and publick ordinances of the Goſpel. Regard the chriſtian Sabbath. Shun all the paths of wickedneſs. Cheer and comfort the heart of your preſent Paſtor. How will he be pleaſed and gratified to ſee you walking in the truth! May the bleſſing of GOD reſt upon you; his ſpirit be poured out in plenty; and you be the cauſe of his rejoicing, and he of yours, <hi>in the day of the</hi> LORD JESUS. O think often of that ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn day, and let it influence your future conduct!</p>
            <p>May the youth, in this place, be diſpoſed to know, love, and ſerve the LORD GOD of their fathers; to remember their CREATOR now in youth; become ſober minded; ſhun the ways of vanity; behave virtuouſly; hearken to the inſtruction of their Parents, Miniſter, Teachers; improve all opportunities to be more and more acquainted with their duty; and lay in betimes for a happy eternity.</p>
            <p>The Paſtor of this Church will not take it amiſs, if I <hi>ſtir up his pure mind by way of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi> He will take heed to himſelf and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and continue in them, that he may ſave himſelf and them who hear him. He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that he <hi>watches for ſouls as one who muſt give an account.</hi> He will endeavour to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and wiſh to be ſucceſsful. He will be much in prayer, and concerned to know the ſtate of his flock. He will be ready to perform every kind
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025379_0023_0FCEDA69796509F8"/>
office for them; to ſpend and be ſpent for the good of ſouls. May he have much of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the great Shepherd with him, in all his future miniſtrations, and much ſucceſs! And may he and the People of his charge, be each other's rejoicing, in the day of CHRIST JESUS.</p>
            <p>And now, dear brethren and friends, I take an affectionate farewel of you, and cloſe with my dying wiſh. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>bleſs you, and keep you: The</hi> LORD <hi>make his face to ſhine upon you, and be gracious: The</hi> LORD <hi>lift up the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and give you peace.</hi> O! if the SPIRIT of GOD reſt upon you, you ſhall be built up. You will attend the means. May GOD ſhine upon this ſanctuary.</p>
            <p>I aſk an intereſt in your prayers, and, once more, ſay, <hi>Finally, brethren, farewel in the</hi> LORD. <hi>Be perfect: Be of good comfort: Live in peace: and the</hi> GOD <hi>of love and peace be with you.</hi> May I be your rejoicing, and you mine, <hi>in the day of the</hi> LORD JESUS. Amen.</p>
