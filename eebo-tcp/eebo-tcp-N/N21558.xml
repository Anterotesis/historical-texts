            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The ſhort Diſcourſe, with which this little volume begins, aims at nothing more, than to impreſs the minds of young people with a lively ſenſe of the love and favour of heaven in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the human race, the <hi>Inſtitution of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> which is ſo admirably calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their improvement, pleaſure and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

As we are rational creatures, we are then crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal when we indulge theſe propenſities, or natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al appetites in an unlawful way and manner, which conſtitutes whoredom, adultery, gluttony and drunkenneſs.</p>

                  <p>MAXIM 2.—No perſon ought to engage in the delightful buſineſs of courting, while his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in life afford no rational proſpect of ſupporting a ſmall family, and of his pretty ſoon entering into a ſtate of wedlock: for not obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe precautions, many evils have attended the married ſtate, and injured the parties all their days.</p>

However, a few years more in the age of the male than the age of the female, has been found by experience not inconvenient, owing probably, to women's failing in their natural ſtrength and vigour ſooner than men. But when the age of the parties are ſo diſproportionate, as to find the one party in the bloom and vigour of life, and the other undergoing all the infirmities of old age, much of the happineſs of the married ſtate is interrupted, if not wholly prevented.</p>
                  <p>MAXIM 6.—The parties who would wiſh to match with each other, ought to be as nearly of a level, as to reputation, and family, as poſſible; otherwiſe, ſcenes of contention may ariſe, which in time may ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is likewiſe frequently incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for perſons of one denomination, to match with perſons of another, eſpecially thoſe, who are of ſuch denominations as admit of no communion with each other. The evil effects of ſuch heterogeneous connections, are too many here to be enumerated.</p>
                  <p>MAXIM 8.—It is prepoſterous for any to marry only for the ſake of money; for riches may take unto themſelves wings and fly away: and when this comes to paſs, it will be ten to one if all the ſweets of matrimony do not follow, and innumerable evils riſe in their room. Inſtances of this kind have not been unfrequent in every part of the world.</p>

They who ſuffer their fancy to take the lead of their judgment in the choice of companions, will be in great danger of being deceived, and finally rendered unhappy in the conjugal ſtate.</p>
                  <p>MAXIM 10.—In the choice of companions, the parties ſhould as thorougly as poſſible, inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate each others natural tempers. Some are of a temper ſo rough and boiſterous, or ſo ſullen and unforgiving, that a perſon of a tender heart, calm diſpoſition, and delicate conſtitution, could no more be happy with them in the bands of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, than a lamb in the company of a tyger, or a dove in the preſence of a hawk. Many a poor wretch having never ſeen the intended com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, but in hours of the greateſt pleaſantry, has been decoyed into a match as unſuitable as can well be expreſſed. It is acknowledged, that in many inſtances, the natural tempers of young people lie much out of ſight, and conſequently cannot be known without much attention: this ought not to diſcourage, but engage all to obtain this knowledge.</p>

               <p>Eliza was a young lady of about eighteen years of age, whoſe perſon was in almoſt every reſpect captivating: ſhe was rather above the middle ſize for height, ſtrait and well proportioned through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, her features regular and charming, her ſkin admirably fair, her eyes black and expreſſive, her hair dark and flowing; ſhe was of a modeſt, amiable and religious character, and of a family truly excellent.</p>
               <p>Strephon and Eliza were of the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and had natural tempers and turns of mind, in many reſpects, much alike. Strephon
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028341_0018_0FD8B10F1F7F2BE0"/>
had been much more acquainted with the world than Eliza, for he had ſeen much company, for a man of his age. Eliza, by means of her tender parents, had been led in a courſe of life more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, till the age of ſeventeen; of conſequence, her ideas and ſentiments reſpecting matrimony, were ſuch as ſhe had gained from books, and from the wiſe and chaſte converſation of her dear parents, and a few ſelect friends of great modeſty and worth.</p>
               <p>Kind providence ſo ordered events, that Stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon and Eliza became acquainted with each other, and indeed long before they had kept one anothers company; they were both in love, and both ignorant of their being beloved by each other.

                  <p>IF I miſtake not, I have heard you obſerve, that you were peculiarly fond of hiſtory. It has juſt come into my head to give you a ſketch of my life from Friday laſt to the preſent time. I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my ſubject is of ſo melancholy a nature, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I will comfort myſelf that perhaps the next time I write to you, I may have a ſubject more lively and entertaining. We ſhould not know how to prize the innumerable favours of this life, were we to experience no evils while in the world.</p>
                  <p>Between ten and eleven o'clock on Friday laſt, in a very weak and languid ſituation of body (for you muſt know I have been ſick ſince you went from home) I took my leave of your honoured parents and dear family with an heart penetrated with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſembled gratitude, for the many favours they beſtowed on me while at H—r. It would have been a conſideration more pleaſing than I am able to expreſs, to have received a parting ſmile and charming look from my deareſt friend, my lovely Eliza, but theſe were impracticable: The kindeſt hearts and deareſt friends are ſometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to bleed alone. You were from home and knew nothing of my ſickneſs or emotions of heart.</p>
                  <p>Upon the road from your fathers to the Rev. Mr. H—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> my thoughts were principally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on the various affections and mercies, pains and pleaſures, enjoyments and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of which I had been the ſubject during my

Hanoverian viſit. I could not help thinking that this viſit was a picture of human life in miniature, nor forbear adoring the great Jehovah for the many uſeful leſſons I had been taught during it. O Eliza, mankind may ſay what they pleaſe, but I am perſuaded, that it is as impoſſible for us to be truly happy without real virtue, as it is for us to be rich without the poſſeſſion of any thing whatever. When I arrived at my old friend's, Mr. H—s, I found his ſon, the ſcholar, from Philadelphia, and daughter from New-York, were both at home; the whole family were apparently pleaſed to ſee me ſo far recovered from that dreadful ſtate of illneſs under which I had been labouring. When people appear happy in our company, we are naturally led to think they are our real friends: but this is not unfrequently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hypocriſy is one of the greateſt blots that ever ſtained the dignity of man: may kind heaven ever keep you and I at the greateſt remove from it.</p>
                  <p>I think Mrs. T— juſt as ſhe was before ſhe was married, only older—that Miſs H— pants for the joys of matrimony—and that Miſs P— will enter into the connubial ſtate within ten days. At two in the afternoon I took my leave of the old gentleman and his lady, together with my merry friends, the young gentlemen and ladies, and proceeded on my way homeward a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>My next ſtage was at Mr. P—'s, where I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways call with peculiar pleaſure. After ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable chat, I enquired for your intimate friend Miſs —, who was from home.

                  <p>My next ſtage was at the Rev. Mr. L—s, where I was received juſt at duſk, with all that friendſhip which gladdens the heart of a weary traveller. Having ſupped, I walked out ſeveral rods from the houſe, where, in a ſudden and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing manner, I was ſeized with a fit of languor ſo great, that for ſome time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I deſpaired of ever reaching the houſe again; however, by ſome means or other, I know not by what, I got into the houſe, where my good friends uſed every mean in their power to keep life in me, for ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al hours on the ſtretch. Miſs B. your great inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and admirer, with her brother, watched with me through the night; her kindneſs brought my friend Eliza into full view, whoſe tenderneſs to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

home, where I remained in this unhappy ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till two in the afternoon of the next day, when I gained in ſome good degree, my natural flow of ſpirits, and experienced that pleaſure and freedom of thought in contemplating the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy of God our Saviour, which no words can fully expreſs. O Eliza, it is in him we live, move, and have our being; and nothing ought to divert our attention from the great duty of aſcribing to him glory and honour for ever and ever.</p>

fears I have endured ſince I wrote you that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have cauſed me much uneaſineſs. I have aſked myſelf a thouſand times, what propriety there could be in my writing to a gentleman of your character and ſituation in life: my only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology has been, that you were too much of a gentleman as well as friend to our family, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a young creature, who from friendſhip, had as it were, thrown herſelf within your power. And I am happy beyond expreſſion to find that my judgment was not erroneous. Your laſt has put all my uneaſy feelings to reſt; I feel my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſafe in your generous hands. Be aſſured, my much eſteemed friend (for in this ſtyle you will now permit me to addreſs you) I moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely thank you for thoſe hiſtorical anecdotes concerning yourſelf, with which you have favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me.

The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of your health, and that flow of natural ſpirits ſo common to you, together with that calmneſs and tranquility of mind in devotional exerciſes, are circumſtances of too much value, to paſs unnoticed by a friend.

I ſaw you, I have been charmed with your perſon. And notwithſtanding all this, to you only it muſt be confeſſed, that my feelings towards you are quite different from what they were previous to that ſolemn interview I had with your dear par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. Unfeigned eſteem and friendſhip are things truly agreeable: but love, chaſte love, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds them. By ſome means or other, I now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to love my dear Eliza, whom heretofore I admired and treated as a friend only. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that virtuous affections never yet injured humanity, and therefore recommend them to you as worthy of your attention.</p>

things worthy to be treaſured up in a female mind: When at the ſame time, there are many other things ſaid by theſe ingenious and elegant writers, which I am afraid will do young ladies more harm than good: The general ſtrain, in which theſe gentlemen write, favours too much of female flattery; which cannot fail of giving diſguſt to a lady of ſenſibility, and at the ſame time of enſnaring thoſe of leſs penetration. To excite thoughts in the minds of young girls, that nothing ought to be more regarded by them than to render themſelves the deſirable ſubjects of men's pleaſures during a leiſure hour, is to abuſe the dignity of the female mind: Will not this lead to a ſhameful neglect of the mind and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to make way for the purpoſe of decorating the body? If it be true, that the higheſt ambition a woman ought to have, is to pleaſe man (which ſeems to be the great theme of theſe writers) is it not true, they ought to be excuſed from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and religion?—which is abſurd, and what every lady of ſenſe and piety muſt deſpiſe from the bottom of her heart.

                  <p>AFTER Strephon and Eliza had exchanged the foregoing letters, they were favoured, for ſeveral months together, with frequent and endearing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views with each other: And upon every interview, their affections for one another encreaſed with the greateſt rapidity: However, ſuch were the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Strephon, that he was obliged to take leave of the idol of his heart, his dear Eliza, for ſeveral months. This was truly mortifying, not only to Strephon, but to Eliza, who now began to feel her happineſs connected with the company of her Streph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At their parting, they mutually agreed to bear each other upon their hearts, before the throne of grace, morning and evening, till kind providence ſhould bring them together again. The ſight of a couple's parting, who were ſo happy in each other's company, muſt have been truly affecting. We will leave them to their own reflections for a few weeks, and then attend to the epiſtolary correſpondence which followed.</p>

Three times ſucceſſively have I been taken down within theſe two months, with the intermitting fever; and am now juſt recovering from the laſt and moſt ſevere turn of all.

Did I enjoy the company of my dear Eliza here, I ſhould be leſs anxious for a ſight of that ancient dome. During my ſickneſs, I have been favoured with all that attention one could wiſh. The ſoothing accents of friendſhip, in times of diſtreſs, are like cordials to a fainting man, and demand our ſincereſt gratitude.

After all, I muſt tell you, Sir, that did I not apprehend you to be a real friend to true virtue, I ſhould by no means wiſh to form any intimate connection with you.

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028341_0050_0FD8B1529BA4DBC8"/>
and entertaining acquaintance: When I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on theſe things, together with the poſſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of my being leſs happy in the married than in the ſingle ſtate, my affections for you have not been at all abated. Theſe facts lead me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that in my view, I am a kind of miracle, for I cannot underſtand my own heart. I have no doubt but I could marry in a manner equal to my ſituation in life, were I diſpoſed to accept any of the offers made to me of late; but this is not agreeable to my preſent feelings. It is not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, barely for a companion, but for the man whom I love, that I would change my ſituation. And now, perhaps, I ſhall be obliged to taſte the bitter cup, which I have turned out to others—I mean a denial of your affections. But, O Sir, think not of me as I have fooliſhly thought of others in like circumſtances, that it is a ſlight of fancy, and not love, which ſo powerfully moves and agitates my ſoul. Sure I am, I never had that love for any man, while in a ſingle ſtate, which now glows in my wounded heart for you. But what am I doing? In days paſt my indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been fired againſt thoſe ladies, who, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, had openly expreſſed their affections for any particular man; and indeed, my reaſon now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns this practice as imprudent: But love, all powerful love, triumphs over reaſon, judgment and education. My heart is engaged, and I muſt go through with the buſineſs. Dear Sir, be ſo kind as to inform me, whether you are under any particular engagement to any of my ſex? If you are, I am undone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you are not, I ſhall ſtill hope for happineſs in this life. I ſhall be in the

greateſt anxiety till I know what reception you will pleaſe to give theſe lines. For whether I ſucceed or not, my troubled heart will give me no reſt till I know my fate. There are ſundry reaſons I could mention, which have led me to indulge the flattering idea, that a near connection with me would not be diſagreeable to you—but I muſt ſuppreſs them. And now I begin to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, leaſt my freedom in writing ſhould leſſen your affections, and excite in your heart hatred for my perſon. When I recollect myſelf, I am ready to conclude my pride muſt be aſleep—to ſay nothing of thoſe delicate feelings of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male of which I once flattered myſelf I was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply poſſeſſed—otherwiſe I could not have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured ſo far, on imprudent ground, as I have done: However, I flatter myſelf, that you are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

That a perſon of your birth, education, character and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in life, ſhould write to one in my ſituation on ſo tender and delicate a ſubject as love, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not unworthy of ſeveral notes of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That fooliſh modeſty, fear and baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which prevents your ſex from diſcloſing the tender emotions of their hearts to gentlemen of character, has ever appeared to me an imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I confeſs, the tyrannical laws of cuſtom, however, in many caſes, have put it out of their power to do this with ſo much ſafety and honour as the rights of women demand. Aſide from this, I can ſee no more impropriety in a lady's communicating her thoughts on love to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of character, than there is in a gentleman's communicating his thoughts on the ſame ſubject to a lady of character: Therefore I beg you would give yourſelf no uneaſineſs on the account of the innocent freedom you have taken in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me on the moſt tender and delicate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that ever employed the pen of either men or women. It is evident to my mind, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all your notes of admiration and modeſt apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogies, that had not the ſecret ſentiments of your heart been ſimilar to mine, on this ſubject your addreſs would have never ſeen the light.

her affections for any particular gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man—I mean in an unmarried ſtate.

Be aſſured, Sir, nothing alloys my anxiety on this ſubject ſo much as the teſtimony of my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that I have acted in ſincerity. Your ſtrictures on the tyrannical laws of cuſtom are, in my opinion, juſt; and indeed are ſuch as have not unfrequently occurred to my own mind when reflecting on this ſubject. Were women allowed the ſame liberty to communicate their affections to men, as men are to communicate theirs to the women—I believe unhappy matches would be leſs numerous. One thing is certain, I ſhall now have no reaſon to reproach myſelf with the ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſufficient reaſon to draw this concluſion: But, dear Sir, I am unfeignedly ſincere in the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my affection for you—and will now tell you, that I will wait for you any period of time you may think proper to propoſe; provided you can aſſure me, you are under no engagement to any of my ſex, and will attend to my requeſt, which to me is a ſubject of the laſt importance. In the mean time I muſt let you know, Sir, that I never ſhall conſent to match with any perſon living—no, not even with yourſelf, whom I love almoſt to diſtraction, without ample evidence of being loved by the ſame. Where affections are not reciprocal, there can be nothing of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate nature of ſocial and refined happineſs. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious circumſtances have led me to conclude you have ſome eſteem of and love for my perſon: This concluſion emboldened me to addreſs you in the manner I have done, and yet I am afraid my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded expreſſions will leſſen your affections for me. I muſt be indulged in hoping you will never improve my freedom to the injury of my character, whether you finally comply with my propoſals or not. It gives me much ſatisfaction to hear that a private interview is not diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I ſhall wait with great anxiety till that happy moment arrives—when we ſhall have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, without the mediums of pen and ink, to know one anothers heart. It is the fervent and unceaſing prayer of my ſoul, that the great diſpoſer of all things may direct you, Sir, in the line of duty reſpecting this delicate and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous affair.

               <p>EMILIUS was a gentleman of taſte and information. Oliva was a young lady of good family; poſſeſſed of thoſe charms, which at the ſame time, awe and enrapture the beholder. Her features, ſhapes and turn of mind, as well as her proſpects in life, were exactly ſuch as Emilius wiſhed to find in the lady with whom he choſe to match. And though Emilius was ſeveral years older than Oliva, he had not completed the knowledge of that profeſſion upon which he had fixed for life. Oliva's youth on the one hand, afforded Emilius time to accompliſh this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant buſineſs—and on the other, herſelf time to gain thoſe perſonal embelliſhments, which Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to vanity and irreligion, I confeſs are great and powerful: Youth, beauty and worldly proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of happineſs here, which you poſſeſs above many of your ſex, all conſpire to work out your ruin: And what renders your ſituation more dangerous than all the reſt, is that circle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant admirers, and ſubtle flatterers, with which you are perpetually ſurrounded.</p>
                  <p>Pauſe then, a moment, my deareſt creature, and ſet the excellencies of real religion before your eyes; perhaps they may ſway your mind to a life of humility and undiſſembled piety, which is of more value than all this wide world affords. Rude and trifling company is more frequently attended with greater evil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Be therefore on your guard againſt the enchanting influence of the bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the young, the beautiful, the gay and faſhionable part of the world; otherwiſe you may be caught in the ſnare, and led captive at the will of the great enemy of all virtue. Think not, however, that I ſuppoſe you can, at all times, with decency, ſhun ſuch unprofitable company;

                  <p>When we parted, I expected to have ſeen you again this fall; but events reſpecting me, in a courſe of providence, have ſo turned up, that I now deſpair of doing myſelf this pleaſure.

                  <p>I THANK you for the fulfilment of your prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe. Yours of the 22d of Nov. came ſafe to hand yeſterday, and has afforded me more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than I can expreſs.

Your mortification at my being neceſſarily detained from the company of my beſt friends, cannot be greater than mine. As ſoon, therefore, as my important affairs ſhall permit, I am determined to mingle with that lovely circle of friends who reſide in your neighbourhood, and feaſt my eyes on the charming creature, whom I am afraid has already too much room in my heart.

                  <p>YOUR long and entertaining letter of the 14th of the laſt month, I have received with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar pleaſure; and now embrace the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which preſents, to make out ſome kind of anſwer to it.

Pardon my imperfections, and you will ſecure my heart. I am heartily rejoiced my honoured papa has been ſo good as to inform you of my welfare. I have written and thrown away ſeveral letters ſince my ſickneſs; the reaſon of this conduct has been altogether owing to my

want of opportunity to convey them to you; and it is entirely uncertain whether this ever reaches you; therefore you will accept of a ſhort and imperfect anſwer. Be aſſured, that it is with no ſmall pleaſure, that I find myſelf able to inform you that my health is perfectly reſtored. Oh how thankful ought I to be to the great diſpoſer of all events, for this diſplay of his goodneſs and mercy to an unworthy wretch. Many, many of my fellow mortals have been cut down as cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the earth, and lodged in the ſilent grave, ſince I was firſt ſeized with my late bodily indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. O Emilius! help me to praiſe the great preſerver of man, for his diſtinguiſhing goodneſs to an unworthy and helpleſs creature.

One thing, however, you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon as fact; and that is, I have never had more ſerious thoughts on the great and important things of real religion, than I have had during my late ſickneſs: And to tell you the truth, your piouſ letter has largely contributed to increaſe theſe ſolemn impreſſions on my naturally vain and trifling mind; but I am afraid they will ſoon wear away, and leave me worſe than they found me.

In the midſt of your rapturous deſcription of the happineſs of the married pair, you check yourſelf for thus writing to one, whom you knew not but was then ſolacing herſelf in the embraces of ſome favoured and unknown youth: Give yourſelf no concern, Sir, about any ſuch imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; and believe me incapable of acting a part ſo baſe, ſo contrary to my moſt ſolemn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to you.

                  <p>UPON the reception of the above letter, Emilius concluded to drop his important and delightful ſtudies, and ſpend a few weeks with his enchanting Oliva, from whom he had endured an abſence ſo long and painful. At their meeting, their mutual joys were expreſſed, not by the cold and lifeleſs language, which mere words compoſe—but by ſparkling eyes, glowing countenances, and actions the moſt polite and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <p>But to drop this, and paſs to a ſubject more cheerful.—In the midſt of that large acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which I have had with mankind, I have found it expedient that my peculiar friends ſhould be but few, and well choſen. I have ſought to aſſociate with thoſe only who were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, decent, ſenſible and virtuous. By this mean I have been often ſcreened from that imprudent and vicious courſe of conduct, which otherwiſe I ſhould probably have adopted; and perhaps brought upon myſelf diſgrace, if not ruin.</p>
                  <p>It is my ſerio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This proves beyond all contradiction, that our intimate and peculiar friends ought to be few and well choſen. There are ſeveral kinds of amuſement peculiar to youth, which, though they are not always criminal, are notwithſtanding very inconvenient: Theſe I have frequently pointed out to you in days paſt: I will now content myſelf with mentioning one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, too frequent among youth, which I have not heretofore laid before you: It is this—For a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſuffer ſeveral gentlemen to ſhare her pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar attention in cloſe ſucceſſion one after another: Or a gentleman to divide his affections and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions among ſeveral of the fair ſex. This ſhameful and diſingenious practice has a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ruin one's heart, and prevent it for ever

                  <p>It has been with ſome degree of confuſion, I have made your compliments to my parents. I wiſh for the future, you would excuſe me from a taſk ſo trying to my nerves. Your advice, to be ſo much on my guard againſt the pernicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of youthful amuſements, as to leave room in my heart for pious and devotional exerciſes, demands my unfeigned gratitude. The lines of poetry, with which you conclude this letter, are really charming; and indeed the whole letter is high in my eſtimation, except it be the laſt line—
"And you may prove a joyful wife."
Wife is more than a mouthful; it is with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty I write it—and you may be ſure it will be

                  <p>THAT you may not think my attention to you is abated, I have encloſed ſeveral let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to you which were written ſome time ſince, but not ſent for want of ſuitable conveyance; be ſo kind as to give them all an anſwer in your next. I have ten thouſand things in my head, which I could better tell you than write, were I in your agreeable company. Perhaps you may think my affections for you are greatly cooled— or I ſhould have otherwiſe viſited you before now.—Believe me, deareſt of creatures, could I do myſelf this honour without making a ſacrifice greater than you would wiſh me to do, I would be upon the wing immediately for B—m: however, I have fixed on the month of July next for this purpoſe. In the mean time, I ſhall let no opportunity of writing paſs unimproved, in furniſhing you with all that information re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting my perſon and circumſtances, which you can deſire—and beg you not only to adopt, but to perſevere in the ſame line of conduct towards me.</p>
                  <p>I enjoy my health to a very great degree, and in many reſpects am exceedingly happy; there being nothing which troubles me much, except it be the want of my deareſt Oliva's company. In my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I can never be thankful enough for that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied and generous pains you have ſo long taken to render my perſon, mind and carriage, agreeable to men of taſte, virtue and refinement; as well as for that concern you have exhibited for my happineſs beyond this tranſitory ſtate: theſe things I ſhall ſet down as real tokens of friendſhip.

I have for more than eighteen months, carefully attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe improvements, which you have ſo earneſtly recommended; and I hope I have not been altogether unmindful of the one thing, which above all others, is needful.</p>

                  <p>A LITTLE after the date of the foregoing letter, the happy Emilius and lovely Oliva, enjoyed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeveral weeks interview with each other. Their joys on this occaſion were b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They had been loving each other at ſeveral hundred miles diſtance, for more than ten months, without the ſight of one anothers faces; during which period, their perſons and minds had received many embelliſhments which ſerved to heighten their mutual eſteem; and now they had an opportunity of feaſting their eyes and hearts on each others perſonal beauties and mental accompliſhments, which they did with tranſports too great to eſcape the notice of a numerous circle of friends and relatives.</p>

The old manſion houſe became the reſort of the moſt polite and improving company in the town. The happy lovers felt themſelves ſtanding at the next door to the ſummit of all earthly joys.

Thus Emilius and Oliva enjoyed each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers company for more than ſix weeks together; dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time, they gained all that ſatisfaction with reſpect to the affections of each other they could wiſh; and conſequently entered into a moſt ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when the period fixed on for their ſeparation was come, theſe happy lovers, with glowing hearts, claſping hands and flowing tears, commended each other to the care of a kind and tender providence, and parted.

He anſwered, delicate ladies are not apt to communicate all their feelings to their ſuitors. Upon the whole, he talked with me till I heartily wiſhed myſelf at B—m—where I might judge of the health of my deareſt friend. Believe me, my love to you is ſincere, and I have not a doubt but yours to me is the ſame; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, depend on my fidelity, in every thing which I have ſaid to you.

                  <p>YOURS of March, 1774, I have this moment received; and heartily return you many thanks for its contents. Your remarks on the important event which you wiſh may crown the preſent year, perfectly accord with my feelings. But this is almoſt too much to ſay to a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; however it is ſaid and ſhall not be recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: my ſolemn vow to you, Sir, ſhall be my apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy. I have not received your long letter in which you ſay you have told me all your heart; and therefore muſt beg you to write another for this purpoſe, and I will give it a particular anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your friend and my near relative, Mr. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah G—y, loſt one of his legs, laſt March; it was occaſioned by a wound, which mortified, and of courſe called for amputation, as the only mean of preſerving his life. I have one piece of news more to tell you—my grand mama has been lately married to the Rev. Mr. C—s. What ſuch aged people mean by marrying, is beyond my knowledge.</p>
                  <p>I am heartily rejoiced to hear you got through the ſmall-pox ſafely; and am much obliged to you for your tenderneſs to me, in concealing this affair till you had quite recovered your health; for my mind has been ſo agitated with fearful apprehenſions concerning your welfare, when I knew not but you were well, that I know not what would have been the conſequence, had I
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028341_0115_0FD8B02A9DA0B780"/>
been told you were ſick with this dreadful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. My diſtreſs has in a great degree ſubſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and my mind is now calm, and my natural cheerfulneſs greatly revived.</p>
                  <p>Be ſo kind as to accept the following lines of poetry, as an evidence of my ſincerity, in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>

                  <p>YOURS of May the 15th is this moment come to hand. I thank you for the ſeveral pieces

of news you have been pleaſed to give me; and heartily ſympathize with my friend in the loſs of his leg. Old people who have been once mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, can better tell what they mean by ſecond marriages, than young one's—I will therefore let them alone. Your poetical flight would not have met with my approbation, had it not been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with that moſt ſolemn declaration in the beginning of your letter, that my wiſhes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the crowning of the year, perfectly accord with your feelings. I am glad you have recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that natural cheerfulneſs, which is ſo peculiar to yourſelf; and wiſh you may never loſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for it muſt be a continual feaſt—this I can ſay by experience. I know what it is to be cheerful, and within theſe three weeks paſt I have felt what it is to be melancholy. Sometime ſince you were in this ſituation; now I am taking my turn. I could not before ſympathize with you as I can now; what the reaſon is, I can give no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: but one thing is certain, I have no com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort of my life. My mind is ſo agitated with anxious thoughts, and perplexing fears, by night and by day, concerning you, that I get no reſt.

                  <p>I HAVE heavy tidings for you—My daughter, your Oliva, is no more. The laſt Sabbath ſhe was ſo well as to attend the funeral of her youngeſt ſiſter Charlotte, and the Tueſday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing was a corpſe. Our babe died with the canker—<hi>Oliva</hi> caught the dreadful malady; and being exceeding reſtleſs, her phyſician judged it expedient to give her a portion of opium; after receiving of which, ſhe appeared for a while, to be in a ſweet ſleep, and our hopes of her reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation were greatly revived: But to our aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before the time we expected ſhe would awake, ſhe ceaſed to breathe. Thus ſhe is gone! forever gone! and we muſt ſubmit to the Divine pleaſure without a murmuring thought. Pleaſe to excuſe my freedom, and come and ſee us as ſoon as convenient. Though our daughter is no more, you may depend on finding a father in her father. I unfeignedly thank you for all that friendſhip and love you have exerciſed towards her. Mrs. <hi>Calybs</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> ſend their love to you: Be ſo kind as to pray for us, that our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions may be ſanctified, and we made better by them. May God ſupport you, as he has ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported us, under this great and trying diſpenſation of his holy providence.</p>

                  <p>IT is with pleaſure intermingled with pain too great for pen and ink to expreſs, that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the receipt of your letter, dated May 30, 1774. Your troubled imagination, and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious heart, are exact pictures of my own; for although, when I wrote to you laſt, my mind was much more calm than it had been ſome time before, yet, before I received your laſt, my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs returned upon me with double force. I have been preparing every thing for that happy moment, when you and I ſhould participate of thoſe virtuous and refined joys, of which none but true lovers are capable.—But, alas! all my labour, as well as my love for you, is in vain.— You feel that we are never again to ſee each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo do I.

I thank you a thouſand times over for all that attention, friendſhip and love, you have ſhown for me, ſince the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our acquaintance.

However, my heart tells me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing great is about to take place.

<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028341_0121_0FD8B0398CC2CCC8"/>
the all accompliſhed <hi>Oliva</hi> is no more!—Then break thou my heart, and burſt ye mine eyes with ſorrow—and be thou my ſoul dead to this world; for what is all creation to thee, when thy <hi>Oliva</hi> is no more. O mourn, mourn thou for thy <hi>Oliva,</hi> the idol of thine heart—for ſhe is ſnatched from thine eager embrace. She has winged her way to the world of ſpirits—</p>
                  <l>But hark—the voice of reaſon cries</l>
                  <l>God lives—while thy <hi>Oliva</hi> dies.</l>

                  <l>For Nature's debts muſt all be paid.</l>
                  <p>Alas! what have I done, that I ſhould be marked out for ſuch peculiar afflictions? O Lord, did I love that deareſt of creatures too much, that thou haſt taken her away in the bloom of life? Was ſhe not formed to charm my ſoul? and haſt thou not cut her down to ſhew me the emptineſs and uncertainty of all earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Have I not ſought her welfare, as well as my own, in all my intercourſe with her? And have I not alſo ſought thy glory in the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which now is no more? O Lord, I appeal to thee, for thou knoweſt the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—but I muſt not forget that I am a poor imperfect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and though <hi>Oliva,</hi> above all others, was formed to charm my heart; and though I may have been upon my guard againſt loving her more than I ought to love any creature, yet God muſt be juſtified in his conduct, and I muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his holy pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Dear Sir, forgive me, if I have loſt ſight of you for a moment. My feelings are ſuch as none
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028341_0122_0FD8B03B29446078"/>
can conceive, who have not drank of the bitter cup I am now drinking. O my deareſt, lovlieſt, ſweeteſt creature, muſt my ears never more be charmed with the muſic of thy tongue, and my eyes never more be bleſſed with the beauties of thy form! My grief is too great for expreſſion; I cannot ſuppreſs its overflowings: however, I will try to be calm and reſigned—God has done nothing unrighteous—huſh then my heart, be ſtill, and know that God is the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Dear Sir, did the phyſician who adminiſtered the fatal doſe, underſtand his buſineſs? Was he friendly to your family—was he himſelf? O that I had been preſent, and ſnatched it from thoſe inchanting lips that received it, and ſaved the lovely creature from the deadly draught. But no more. I mean, dear Sir, to ſee you ſoon, when I ſhall enquire into all circumſtances, and ſatisfy my wounded ſoul. But, alas—this will be the exact time when your daughter and I once expected to be triumphing in all the innocent joys of the conjugal ſtate. O ye heavens, what a reverſe is here! My dear parents, (for ſo you will permit me to addreſs you) may he who gave you the moſt beautiful, virtuous and amiable child that ever lived, and has taken her away in the bloom of life, alſo give you grace to ſay, <hi>The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away, and bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The oldeſt and the youngeſt of your dear children are now no more; you have one who now lives: O that, like <hi>Anna</hi> of old, ſhe may prove a favourite of heaven.</p>

No language can expreſs the ſorrows of Emilius heart on this ſolemn and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous occaſion. Mr. Calybs preſented Emilius with a ſuit of mourning, together with ſome of the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite rings and jewels of his departed daughter, before they parted.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have given you a hiſtory of the courtſhip of Emilius and Oliva; to which we have added a brief account of Oliva's exit.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Courtſhip of <hi>BRAGADOTIUS</hi> and <hi>NUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SKULDIA.—Not</hi> for example—but warning.</head>
               <p>THE following anecdotes of the actual Courtſhip of Bragadotius and Numſkuldia, are recorded, not for the example, but for the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the American youth.</p>
               <p>As to parentage, education, turns of mind, and courſes of conduct, Bragadotius and Numſkul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, were much on a level. At an early period in life they formed an acquaintance, which final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iſſued in what they eſteemed <hi>love</hi>—and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was its conſequence.</p>
               <p>While Bragadotius viewed himſelf the moſt accompliſhed young gentleman within the circle of his acquaintance—Numſkuldia conſidered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a lady inferiour to none, within the circle of her knowledge. Bragadotius, without counſel, felt himſelf equal to the important truſt of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a companion every way ſuited to his taſte and views in life: and Numſkuldia became the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028341_0125_0FD8B044A0AD5370"/>
object of his higheſt ambition. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding many fair creatures fell under the notice of his eye, none appeared to him ſo charming, none proved ſo captivating, as his incomparable Numſkuldia. Contrary to the wholeſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and ſolemn commands of his parents, Braga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotius was frequently out whole nights on what he called his own buſineſs. Sometimes he was obliged to break open his father's houſe; at others he was neceſſitated to take up his lodgings with the cattle in the barn, or ſome out houſe, till the day broke and the family were up.</p>
               <p>The amorous Numſkuldia was under leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, than her beloved Bragadotius; which frequently chagrined, and pained him to the very heart. Bragadotius and Numſkuldia were equal as to religion; for neither they nor their parents had the leaſt appearance of any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>The following is an Epiſtolary correſpondence which paſſed between them during their court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

For I am ſure there was not one who cut ſo grand a figure as you did. Notwithſtanding the laſt night I ever ſaw you, was extremely boiſterous, yet after we parted, I met with your brother and ſeveral others of equal ſpirit, who aſſiſted me in pulling down ſeveral ſigns, and filling up ſundry wells, together with a number of other heroic exploits, which become gentlemen of ſpirit. When I came home I found all bolted and barred againſt me, and therefore was oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>YOUR concern for my welfare has added ten thouſand charms to all you have heretofore poſſeſſed. I believe in my ſoul you think a thouſand times as much of what is neceſſary for our ſubſiſtenee in this world, as I do. However give yourſelf no uneaſineſs about my ſiſters run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away with the old gentleman's eſtate. They are as deep in the mire as I am in the mud.— They have, contrary to my father's expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, kept company with two young fellows, who indeed I eſteem, but <hi>he</hi> deſpiſes. This may prove a lucky hit for me. After all I wiſh the girls no harm: Perhaps the old gentleman's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure may convince them that my conduct, or, in other words, a few funny tricks, ſhould not ſet the world in an uproar, and hurl confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion through the earth.</p>
                  <p>To tell you the plain truth, my father is againſt my keeping the company of any body; and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028341_0130_0FD8B0516319AFF0"/>
againſt my keeping your company. He ſays I am too young to be out in the night; and wonders what I can ſee in Capt. <hi>Mumpy's</hi> girls, that ſets me ſo bewitch'd; and often tells me that I ſhall rue the day I ever formed any acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, and a thouſand other things of the ſame tenor. Sometimes he puts on a pleaſant countenance, and ſays, <hi>Bragadotius,</hi> if you will be a good boy, and behave yourſelf well, till you are ſixteen, you ſhall ſee ſuitable company with my approbation; but if you cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained now, while you are ſo young, you may depend upon being ruined. Theſe are the things, my dear <hi>Numſkuldia,</hi> which made me intimate in my laſt, that if I did not conſult my own taſte, I ſhould never ſee you again. After all, I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined ſo to conduct my affairs, that if it ſhould be my good fortune to marry you, I may be able to ſupport you in a manner that becomes your family.</p>

All your relatives and mine, have done all in their power to perſuade me that you had put an end to your life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They had heard a rumour from P—l, a town about fifty miles diſtant, that a dead perſon was found in a ſwamp, whom they concluded muſt be you. None can conceive the diſtreſs I have undergone ſince you left us. My own circumſtances are truly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the thought of your death have been diſtreſſing beyond all deſcription. I muſt entreat you by all the ties of friendſhip, and by all thoſe ſolemn promiſes you have ſo frequently repeated to me, to give me an opportunity ſoon to ſee you —for I am already undone—and ſhall be wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond all conception, if you refuſe my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>

                  <p>I RECEIVED your affectionate letter yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and thank you for rejoicing that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. I believe there are but few people in B—l of your temper. But what do you mean by your circumſtances being ſo alarming? I hope you are in jeſt. You may depend upon my giving you an opportunity to ſee me in a private manner, before long: for I would by no means have our relations know I am alive. I ſhall be at D—y, which is only ten miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from you, in about eight days, when I hope to know your ſituation more particularly. I now begin to call to mind ſome things which my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in an angry fit, once told me, that I ſhould bring upon myſelf. However, be of good cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, I hope all will turn out well yet.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the <hi>Courtſhip</hi> of <hi>PARAMOND</hi> and <hi>MATILDA</hi> —the former an old <hi>Bachelor,</hi> and the latter an old <hi>Maid.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>PARAMOND was a bachelor of about fifty; who, notwithſtanding his large intereſt, had all his life feared to marry, leſt he ſhould not be able to ſupport his family in that ſplendor he wiſhed. He was a man of as good character as one could expect for a bachelor. His perſon was not ungraceful, though not very beautiful; his manners acceptable, allowing for the oddities peculiar to bachelors: And notwithſtanding all theſe things, he firmly adopted a reſolution to change his ſituation.</p>
               <p>What puzzled him more than every thing elſe, was whether he ſhould woo a young girl, an old maid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of widow. After ſeveral years reflection— for bachelors' thoughts run not very rapidly—he came to the concluſion to marry an old maid; and in the whole circle of his acquaintance (which
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028341_0139_0FD8B0641C64DC20"/>
was by no means contracted) he could not find a fairer candidate for his affections than <hi>Matilda. Matilda</hi> was a lady of good family, and of a moſt excellent character; ſhe was in reality exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly clever—but not handſome. Her good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left her poſſeſſed of a fortune of about four thouſand pounds; which rendered her more beautiful in the eyes of Paramond than any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal qualification whatever could have done.</p>
               <p>At a certain wedding, Paramond and Matilda were rallied by ſome of the company then preſent, and put in mind of the propriety of their match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with each other. This ſo emboldened Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in the ſecret concluſions of his heart, that he ſoon paid Matilda a viſit in the character of a lover; which was received with that coldneſs and indifferency which are peculiar to old maids: However Paramond was not diſcouraged, as the following correſpondence will ſhew.</p>

                  <p>FOR more than thirty years ſince, I have had a ſecret flame enkindled in my breaſt for your perſon. You may remember the ſilver ſnuff box I had the pleaſure to preſent to you when we were children. The ſparkling of your
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028341_0140_0FD8B06A8B9BAE00"/>
eyes, on that occaſion, wounded my heart, and it has never been healed from that day to this. Should you aſk the reaſon why I did not declare my paſſion before, I would anſwer becauſe it was very great. My circumſtances in life were then by no means affluent; and my love for you was too great to bring you (had it been in my power) into a ſituation in which you muſt have lived in a ſtyle leſs elegant than that in which you have been brought up. For more than thirty years it has been my conſtant ſtudy, as well as labour, to lay up money for the ſole purpoſe of your ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in my company. The great diſpoſer of all events has ſo far ſucceeded my worldly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, that I am now worth about ſix thouſand pounds clear of all incumbrances: This, added to the generous portion which your honoured father has left to you, may, with mutual affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for each other, render us happy for that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpace of time we have to ſpend in this world. I ſay that little ſpace, for you muſt know we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live long in this world.</p>
                  <p>Thus, my dear Matilda, I have ſincerely open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my heart to you, and ſhall wait with great anxiety, till you declare your ſentiments upon this important and intereſting matter. One thing more: It has always given me pleaſure to know that you have uniformly rejected the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous propoſals of matrimony.</p>

                  <p>THIS is the firſt time I have ever undertaken to write to a gentleman on the ſubject of your letter, with which I was honoured laſt even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it is not impoſſible but it may be the laſt. Let this be as it may, I muſt confeſs that your letter has convinced me, that old bachelors are not ſuch cold, frozen and ſtupid creatures as they are generally repreſented. The hearts of men are hidden from the common eye, and may contain many things—yea, and agreeable things too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which do not fall under the notice of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial obſervers. Who could have thought Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramond had been a lover for more than thirty years on the ſtretch! I confeſs I am ſurprized; and were it not for your known character, as a man of veracity, I would not now believe you. Your letter has likewiſe mended my opinion of old maids; perhaps they are not ſuch cold and deſpicable creatures as they have been generally repreſented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paramond,</hi> you have filled my head, to ſay nothing of my heart, with a thouſand thoughts, which belong to youth, and not to old age. What ſhall I ſay? I will write no more, leſt I expoſe myſelf.</p>

I hope ſhe contains the richeſt ſilk that ever was woven, to deck my dear Matilda on a bridal day.</p>
                  <p>I am ſincerely glad to hear that your letter to me was the firſt that ever you have written on the ſubject of mine. However, it damps my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to hear you ſay, that perhaps it may be the laſt.

I hope your head is not ſo filled with youthful thoughts as to diſturb your repoſe. It is truly an excellent character you have given of our firſt mother, out of Milton.

All the gold of both the Indies is trifling, when once compared with ſo rich a jewel as my Matilda. But I am afraid I ſhall appear to you like a child; however, remember, my Matilda, the paſſion which now agitates my ſoul, is of long ſtanding, and of late has gained much ſtrength— it burns with great vehemence.

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Courtſhip of <hi>POLYMOND</hi> and <hi>SYLVIA;</hi> the former a Widower, and the latter a Widow.</head>
               <p>POLYMOND was a gentleman of about thirty eight years of age—a man of a fair mind, agreeable perſon, ana unexceptionable charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a good eſtate. He had two children, whoſe genius and perſons promiſed fair to make a ſhining figure in life.</p>
               <p>Sylvia was a widow of thirty years of age— had four children, (two ſons and two daughters) —ſhe had no eſtate; but what was of more value in the view of Polymond—ſhe was a lady of the greateſt beauty, taſte and piety.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding Polymond and Sylvia had been born and brought up within twenty miles of each other, and were both perſons of conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable notoriety, yet they had formed little or no acquaintance with one another.</p>
               <p>About ten months after Polymond had buried his dear companion, he came to a firm reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028341_0150_0FD8B079E0788000"/>
to marry again, as ſoon as he could ſuit himſelf: But where to find a lady that would anſwer his ideas of a ſecond match, he was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant. Upon a certain public occaſion, he accidentally caſt his eye upon Sylvia, whoſe graceful appearance ſhaded the glory of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round her; ſhe was dreſſed in half mourning, and appeared with innocence and dignity, which never fails to command the attention of men of ſenſe, judgment and taſte. Polymond ſoon made himſelf acquainted with the circumſtances of the charming Sylvia, and found them to be ſuch, as emboldened him to make her overtures of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem, friendſhip and love; and accordingly ſpent ſeveral afternoons in her company. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letters will give the reader an idea of their views, ſentiments and feelings, during their Ccurtſhip, which terminated in about ſix months, after their firſt interview.</p>

but this you know has no tendency to make up the loſs of her; to me, ſhe is as if ſhe had never been—and therefore the language of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence ſeems to be thus: O Polymond, the world is before thee, chooſe for thyſelf: Hence I am determined to marry as ſoon as I can ſuit my inclination, fancy and feelings. You, dear Madam, are the firſt I have ſeen, with whom I think I could be happy in the married ſtate.

                  <p>I have two lovely children, for whom I muſt provide; I have likewiſe an eſtate equal to my moſt affluent neighbours. Thus you ſee, dear Sylvia, my ſituation and feelings.

kind and endearing favour, I have never had a ſingle thought of marrying a ſecond time. My circumſtances are ſuch, that I am pretty ſure, no perſon calculated to ſuit my taſte, would ever think of matching with me. My departed huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was a man of unbounded generoſity; and though he always lived in a ſtate of ſplendor, yet he died in a ſtate of poverty; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently left me and four lovely children without any conſiderable means of ſupport. I love my children and muſt cleave to them, let it reduce me to poverty and hardſhips ever ſo great. When a kind providence ſhall ſo order matters, as to provide for them, and furniſh me with a perſon agreeable to my taſte, I may marry—but not till then. I moſt ſincerely thank you for that eſteem you profeſs for my perſon, and for that generous propoſal you have made—of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my company. I cannot ſay how I may feel upon becoming more particularly acquainted with your perſon and circumſtances. One thing you may depend upon, and that is, your letters and viſits ſhall be attended to with all that reſpect matters of this kind demand from one in my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſaid, that a man can never love a ſecond perſon with that affection, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render the conjugal ſtate deſirable;— pleaſe to give me your ſentiments on this ſubject, if you ſhould write to me again.</p>

                  <p>YOUR anſwer to my laſt has met with my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and eſteem. I was not wholly unapprized of your circumſtances, and therefore am not ſhocked to hear them painted in the blackeſt colours.

                  <p>That you have never thought of marrying ſince the departure of your worthy companion, is not ſtrange; and is no reaſon I ſhould not put ſuch a thought into your mind.</p>
                  <p>I will aſſure you, that it is far from my mind to entertain the leaſt thought of marrying you, without making handſome proviſion for your children; and likewiſe recommending myſelf to your taſte.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to a man's loving a ſecond wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man well enough to render the married ſtate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, I muſt ſay, I have never had the leaſt doubt of ſuch a thing. The beſt proof, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of this is drawn from men of virtue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, who have had experience. As to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I have been once married, and loved my wife as well as I wiſh ever to love any body; and I know that I loved ſeveral young ladies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, with the ſame kind of affection, and to the ſame degree, before ever I ſaw her.</p>

                     <pb n="159" facs="unknown:028341_0154_0FD8B08674E7DA90"/>Doctor B—, a gentleman of known integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and unblemiſhed piety, told me a few days ſince, that he had buried four companions, which were ſo equal in his affections, that were they all now alive, and preſented before him, as they were the moment he gave them his hand; and he to looſe his life, if he did not ſay which he preferred—he ſhould not be able to do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>The idle fancy, therefore, of men and women not being capable of eſteeming and loving ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons in ſucceſſion well enough for marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is what no perſon of ſenſe will build upon. It is not improbable to me, that many a one has been led to fear a ſecond match on this account, which I think is wholly founded on imagination, and not on the reaſon and nature of things.</p>

                  <p>I AM charmed with your piety—with that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regard you have for your children, and that ſacred reſpect you pay to religion; and therefore there was no need of your aſking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for dwelling upon theſe great and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjects. It is with real pleaſure, I comply with your pious and rational requeſt, in giving you a ſummary of my religious ſentiments.</p>
                  <p>My parents were chriſtians, who lived in the ſtrict obſervance of all the duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and doctrines taught by <hi>Calvin,</hi> that eminent miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and reformer of the chriſtian church.— The religious ſentiments which I, for myſelf, have adopted, comprehend the leading ideas of Calviniſm—and differ from him in nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſeveral inconſiſtences, which he either had not time or wiſdom to rectify.</p>
                  <p>True religion, in my opinion, conſiſts in a conformity of mind, heart, and life, to the law of God and goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.— In the midſt of that almoſt infinite variety of ſentiments, this, my deareſt Sylvia, is all that I call religion; every thing elſe, in my opinion, being idolatry, ſuperſtition, enthuſiaſm and will-worſhip.</p>
                  <p>All the ſchemes of religion, ever yet publiſhed to the world of mankind, may be denominated
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028341_0157_0FD88BF33B24C710"/>
ſelfiſh, or benevolent.—Under the head of ſelfiſh religion, may be comprehended every falſe ſcheme of religion which has ever taken place in the world.—Under that of benevolence, we may ſay of true religion, that it is a religion which is derived from and ſupported by the ſcriptures of the old and new teſtament. This is the religion which I profeſs to believe and practiſe, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I mean to venture my ſoul into the world of ſpirits—for it bears the image of its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, the great author of the univerſe.</p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to give an anſwer to every man that aſketh you a reaſon of your hope that is in you, with meekneſs and fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That boaſting and proud mode of giving a relation of what is called religious experiences, too frequently practiſed among the warm and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, is in my opinion, an abomination to the great God, and all good men.</p>
                  <p>With meekneſs and fear, therefore, I would now give you the following reaſon of my hope that I am an heir of the grace of God.</p>
                  <p>I now perfectly remember that when I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven years of age, after hearing one of my parents commend me, together with my brethren and ſiſters, to the grace of God, that I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly affected with a ſenſe of my own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I really felt myſelf an exceedingly vile and unworthy creature in the ſight of God—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I had been uſually called to bow my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf morning and evening. This idea grew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me for more than ten years—I found myſelf
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028341_0158_0FD9BA9F0C0D05A0"/>
a wretch undone; for notwithſtanding I had been taught, and knew my duty, ſuch was the pride of my unhumbled and unſanctified heart, that I loved not the things which my reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience told me were moſt excellent. Sometimes I was gay and airy; but never without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
                  <p>When I was about twenty years of age, it pleaſed the great diſpoſer of all things (as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope) to change the temper of my heart. I remember perfectly well (which is not probably the caſe with every one) the place and time when I firſt diſcovered a change in my diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and feelings of ſoul.—I felt deeply impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſenſe of the righteouſneſs of the great Governor of the univerſe; and with the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vileneſs of my own conduct in life—though I have been ſo happy as to eſcape thoſe blots and blurs, which blaſt the characters of many of my fellow-citizens—I found enough in my char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter and heart to fill me with bluſhing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
                  <p>About this time, I felt an uncommon diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take blame and ſhame to myſelf, for all my former conduct towards my creator; and was moſt ſincerely diſpoſed to cenſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn myſelf as a ſinner before heaven. Now my conduct appeared infinitely more vile than ever it had done before; and I felt myſelf eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way undone—and began to feel in ſuch deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair as words cannot deſcribe. In the midſt of this diſtreſs and horror of ſoul, I was, in infinite mercy, favoured with a freſh idea of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.—The glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028341_0159_0FD88BFFE7ED34E8"/>
appeared juſt ſuch a ſaviour as I need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I thought I could with the greateſt pleaſure, yield my all up into his hands, without any reſerve, for time and eternity. Since that time, the worſhip of God—his friends—his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and precepts, have been my delight.</p>
                  <p>In about twelve months after I obſerved this alteration in my heart and life, I joined myſelf to a congregational church of Chriſt, with which I have lived in the greateſt harmony for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years paſt. With great pleaſure I have put my children under the watch and care of the church, with whom I am in covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thus, my deareſt Sylvia, I have given you a ſummary of my religious ſentiments; and, I hope, with meekneſs and fear, added a relation of my religious experiences. If I know my own heart, I muſt ſay, there is nothing in the whole circle of creation, which appears of more value, than real religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is in very deed <hi>the one thing needful.</hi> And to tell you the truth, all perſonal charms are of little value, where religion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. My former companion was a perſon of univerſally acknowledged wit and beauty: but her piety added ten thouſand charms to all her other excellencies—her laſt words to me were, "Polymond, if you ever ſhould marry again, ſee to it, that you match with a lady of virtue and piety—and may the great diſpoſer of all things direct you in the pathway of life."</p>

                  <p>AS Felix ſaid unto Paul—thou almoſt perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me to be a chriſtian—ſo muſt I ſay unto thee, Polymond—thou almoſt perſuadeſt me to be thy companion. For notwithſtanding I had drawn up a concluſion never to marry again, I begin to feel, that ſuch a concluſion was raſh, and unfounded on principles of wiſdom; and that in the great ſtore of my heavenly father, I may poſſibly find a companion, every way as agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me, as my former one was.</p>
                  <p>I am without diſſimulation, perfectly charmed with your ſentiments in religion; and hope that relation you have given of your attachment to the great and intereſting truths of the goſpel, is genuine.</p>
                  <p>Remember, Polymond, our heavenly Father knows what is beſt for all his children; ſome muſt be afflicted, and ſome moſt triumph in all the joys of proſperity: if I am a child, I am an afflicted one; but I would not deſpair of the goodneſs and mercy of God. Bear me upon your heart as often as you go before the throne of grace; and believe me</p>

                     <salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I AM exceedingly happy to find, that my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents on religion, ſo ſweetly accord with yours. Depend upon it, it was your religious character that firſt led me ſeriouſly to reflect up on making propoſals of matrimony to you. I am likewiſe happy to find that you are almoſt perſuaded to comply with my requeſt; and hope you will ſoon be altogether ſo.</p>
                  <p>It is an old maxim, and perhaps a true one, that widowers and widows ought not to ſpend ſo much time in courting, as it would ſeem neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for thoſe to do, who had never been marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Perhaps there is nothing within the bounds of decency, and limits of cuſtom, to forbid our entering into the joyful bands of matrimony, within a few months from the preſent moment. You will ſay, I am plain and explicit—I mean to be ſo—and hope you will ever treat me in the ſame undiſſembled way.</p>
                  <p>I have found by happy experience, in days paſt, ſomething irreſiſtibly captivating, in the company of a fine woman: for though her tongue ſhould be ſilent, her eyes teach wiſdom; and the mind ſtruck with the external graces, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates into reſpondant harmony.</p>

                  <p>NOT long after writing the foregoing letter, Polymond ſpent ſeveral weeks in the company of his beloved Sylvia. And within ſix months from his firſt interview with this charming woman, was bleſſed with her hand. They have now lived ſeveral years as huſband and wife, in the greateſt harmony. Kind providence has indulged them with an happy pledge of their mutual affection.</p>
                  <p>There is no difference made between the children of the mother and the children of the father; all ſeem equally to ſhare the affections of both.

                  <p>Polymond feels himſelf more happy than he ever was before; and Sylvia finds no reaſon to complain. Their children are trained up in all the graceful and uſeful arts. And what is of more importance, than every thing elſe, both father and mother are ambitious to excel one another, in inſtilling into the minds of their children, juſt views of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Wiſdom, virtue, religion and harmony reign triumphant through the family.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of the Courtſhip of <hi>FAIRSHUTE</hi> and <hi>SHUTEFAIR.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FAIRSHUTE was a gentleman of about ſeventy five years of age, who had been favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with two wives: by the firſt he had ſeveral children; by the ſecond he had none. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his ſecond wife brought him a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortune, which was a conſolation to him as great, as if ſhe had born him ſons and daughters.</p>
               <p>Shutefair was a young lady of about twenty-five; in indigent circumſtances; her eyes were black and ſparkling, her ſkin dark, and her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not diſagreeable.</p>
               <p>Fairſhute had caſt his eye on Shutefair, and was determined to make one vigorous puſh to gain the young and fair creature, as a companion in his old age. But how to accompliſh the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he could not for a while ſatisfy himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="unknown:028341_0164_0FD8B09985060A90"/>Shutefair lived with Mr. Peter Meanſomething. A gentleman of a ſingular character, and in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſomewhat needy. Fairſhute conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it would be a matter of the laſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to gain the good graces of Mr. Meanſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if he expected ever to win the young and amiable Shutefair. Theſe he ſoon obtained, by a few preſents of no great value; and Mr. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomething devoted himſelf to the ſervice of Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhute, who employed him in carrying his letters to Shutefair, and receiving hers. In this office Mr. Meanſomething did wonders.</p>
               <p>The following is a correſpondence between this remarkable couple, which laſted for more than ſix weeks; and finally iſſued in that happy connection, of which Mr. Peter Meanſomething was the principal occaſion.</p>

How your propoſal will finally ſet on my mind, is what I will not undertake fully to determine, without more time, and further conſideration.— However, you may reſt ſatisfied, that I will treat the ſubject with that attention which is due to matters of the laſt importance, till I ſhall have made up my mind upon it.

                  <p>YOUR letter has given me more pleaſure than you can cleverly conceive. It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common for young ladies to feel ſhocked at the firſt propoſals of matrimony, eſpecially when they come from an unexpected quarter. Mr. Peter Meanſomething ſays you look ſerious and very thoughtful, and thinks my propoſals are the principal cauſe of this uncommon appearance. Remember, my dear Shutefair, the moment you conſent to write your name Fairſhute inſtead of Shutefair, you become the miſtreſs of my houſe, and heir of my whole eſtate. I would moreover inform you, that I am by no means ſo debilitated as King David was, when Biſhag the Shunamite was placed in his boſom; for my eye-ſight has not ſo failed me, that I cannot diſcern a great difference between you and any other lady in town. I wiſh to hear from you ſoon, for I feel impatient to know my fate.</p>

                  <hi>DAMON</hi>—an American youth—was twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one years of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge, when he became the humble ſervant of <hi>Harriot.</hi> He was the oldeſt ſon of a reputable Clergymen; educated in the chriſtian religion. However, during his reſidence at the Univerſity, from under the eye of his pious father, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e contracted ſentiments and habits quite incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the chriſtian religion, and returned home a finiſhed Deiſt; which almoſt broke the hearts of his exemplary and pious parents. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, Damon was poſſeſſed of ſuch a degree of beauty, ſenſe, modeſty and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, as never failed to gain him the eſteem of thoſe who beheld him—eſpecially the eſteem of the fair ſex. Harriot, upon her firſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Damon, was turned of eighteen. She was the only child of a rich and reputable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and of courſe heir to a very handſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; her education was liberal for a female, and very particular in matters of chriſtianity.
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028341_0173_0FD8B0AB5E38D100"/>
Though Harriot was no beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet, in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, it was not uncommon for beauties to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſſatisfied with themſelves. Harriot was one of thoſe rare perſons, the ſecond ſight of whom, always charms more than the firſt. She dreſſes with ſingular grace, always intermingling ſimplicity with elegance. Her ambition is to know what moſt becomes the fair ſex, in every ſtation of life; and her ruling paſſion the love of virtue. She is poſſeſſed of a tender, modeſt, del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icate and benevolent heart. The peculiar turn of her mind is cheerfulneſs, unallied to vanity. She always appears pleaſed, at the ſtated returns of her ſeaſons of devotion.</p>
               <p>Damon and Harriot formed their firſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with each other, at a public entertainment. Damon, having entered the parlour, indulged his eye indifferently to wander over a numerous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of beautiful and well dreſſed ladies; in the midſt of whom his attention was irriſiſtably fixed on the incomparable Harriot—whoſe pene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Both bruſhed, and in vein ſtrove to hide from the company the impreſſions a ſight of each other had made upon their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and yielding hearts. The very next day, Damon found means to introduce himſelf to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot as a courtier, and met with her modeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. The following correſpondence will diſplay before the reader, their ſentiments, their love, and the obſtacles which lay in their way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a long time, of matching with each other.</p>

                  <pb n="179" facs="unknown:028341_0174_0FD8B0B15718C010"/>Damon having choſen the ſtudy of law, as the high road to political preferment, was obliged to reſide at ſome conſiderable diſtance from his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Harriot, and therefore commenced the ſubſequent correſpondence.</p>

                  <p>THE firſt impreſſions your lovely perſon made on my heart, have proved too powerful for oppoſition—too deep for eradication. They have anſwered one good end at leaſt: They have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me that I was a ſtranger to myſelf—that cool philoſophy is inſufficient to ſilence the clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of a warm, a loving heart. Since I parted with you, ten thouſand kind and tender ideas have ſtreamed through my unguarded, though alarmed mind; and as many new and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon feelings have rioted in my heart.</p>
                  <p>To give play to theſe new viſitors of my ſoul, I have undertaken to write to you in a manner I have never done to any before; yea, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have heretofore thought no gentleman of integrity could do to any lady whatever.

the aſcendency over my heart, that I am never happy, but when thinking or writing about you. This is a ſituation into which, once, I could not thought it poſſible for me to be thrown by the charms of the moſt charming creature that ever exiſted. But facts are ſtubborn things. My conſolation is, that it is honorable for the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed to acknowledge the power of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror.

                  <p>Your profeſſed eſteem for my perſon is truly flattering; and what I never thought of taking place in the heart of any gentleman of your rare accompliſhments But as flattery is too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed by young gentlemen, for the language of politeneſs to ladies, you will excuſe me if I treat it as ſuch, till I am furniſhed with more ample proofs of your ſincerity.

In this caſe, we may prove ourſelves raſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, if we reckon much upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their reality is more fully aſcertained.

From this declaration, you will eaſily ſee that I wiſh not to let my heart run away with my head—my fancy with my judgment. The firſt impreſſions made on the heart cannot always be relied on with ſafety; and therefore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt have time to be brought to maturity.</p>

                  <p>YOUR obliging and delicate letter has filled my heart with more pleaſure than I can command language to expreſs. The line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you formerly adopted, and conſtantly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, was undoubtedly judicious for the time of life in which it ſubſiſted. But all general rules have ſome exceptions; and I am happy to find, that in the preſent caſe you have laid hold of one ſo much in my favour. Be aſſured, dear Madam, your confidence in me ſhall never be abuſed. I moſt heartily confeſs, that the language of flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is too often uſed to the ladies as the language of politeneſs. For, upon recollection, I find that I have in ſeveral inſtances been guilty of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentleman-like conduct to the ladies.

                  <p>YOUR ſecond letter has made a greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my heart in your favour than any thing which preceded it. I am happy to find that you approve of that general line of conduct which I have obſerved till very lately, and that my preſent deviation therefrom can be juſtified upon principles of reaſon and expediency. Your approbation of my ideas of the language of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery being uſed for the language of politeneſs to the ladies, by the young and ſprightly among the gentlemen, is pleaſing; and your abhorrence of this practice is truly charming. I moſt ſincerely thank you for that aſſurance you have given me, that you will take time and lay hold of every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to prove your profeſſion of friendſhip is well founded and ſincere. The poetry with which you cloſe your letter is undoubtedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.

A ſincere Deiſt is a more commendable character than an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal believer in Revelation. The books you have recommended for my peruſal, are perfectly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to my mind, having been in my poſſeſſion a long time, and read with care and candor over and over again; and indeed I know not of any Deiſtical writer of note, in the Engliſh language, from Lord Herbert, the firſt Engliſh Deiſt, down to Thomas Paine, whom I have not read. And I muſt confeſs, that notwithſtanding ſeveral of theſe writers ſtand high in the liſt of fame among the literati, they appear to me, to have miſſed the

The conſequence muſt be that ſuch ſupernatural aid is truly deſirable.— When we contemplate the ſituation of the moſt enlightened and improved nations on earth, who are deſtitute of Revelation, the idea that the light of nature needs the aſſiſtanee of Revelation, ruſhes in upon our minds with irreſiſtable force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I need not inform you, Sir, (whoſe mind is open to the various ſituations of thoſe nations, which are deſtitute of Revelation) that not one of theſe nations have ever been known to form and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a ſcheme of religion which would bear the teſt of common ſenſe: Witneſs the religions of the Pagan world; yea, all the ſchemes of religion which have not been founded on revelation— the groſſeſt idolatry—the greateſt injuſtice, as well as the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. By contemplating the character of the one living and true God, I find it is not inconſiſtent with his perfections, to grant unto his depraved and benighted creature, man, an expreſs revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mind and will. For if the great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteriſtic of the Deity be goodneſs, and if the circumſtances of men be ſuch as call for ſuch aid as a revelation from God—then his character cannot be impeached, provided he ſhould give men ſuch a revelation. The objection againſt the bible's being a revelation from God, becauſe it is not given to all the nations of the earth at once, cannot be admitted; for in this caſe, we ſhould be deprived of one of the greateſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in favour of revelation, viz. the great need in which men ſtood of it. The revelation no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, if it can be made to appear, that the ſcrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> aid to men as the circumſtances of mankind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and the character of God admitted to be given to them—I think we ſhall have gained our point, that it is rational to believe that the Bible is a revelation from God.</p>
                  <p>This then is the <hi>third</hi> reaſon of my faith in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, viz. That the ſcriptures of the old and new teſtament, are ſuch a revelation of the mind and will of God, as the circumſtances of men re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quired,

                  <p>I ſhall not here ſtop to illuſtrate this idea, but proceed immediately to give you a fourth reaſon of my faith in revelation; which is, That the ſcriptures of the old and new teſtaments contain all the internal and external evidences of a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the mind and will of God, any one could reaſonably expect or wiſh for.</p>

                  <p>IN my laſt I endeavoured to ſtate ſome of the firſt principles of my faith in revelation. In this I ſhall attempt ſome farther arguments in favour of the Bible's being the word of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All the doctrines of the Bible are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028341_0190_0FD8B0D66BA2F1B8"/>
of them, however, are ſuch as men in the exerciſe of reaſon, unaſſiſted by revelation could never have diſcovered. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t it is affirmed, that after their diſcovery—though ſeveral of them are too great and ſublime for our ſcanty faculties to comprehend—yet none of them are contrary to right reaſon.—To exemplify—The law of God requires ſupreme love to God, and impartial and univerſal love to mankind—which exactly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds with the dictates of right reaſon and with common ſenſe. The ſcheme of ſalvation revealed in the Bible, though incomprehenſible and undiſcoverable by the light of nature, has been acknowledged conſonant to the dictates of right reaſon, by many of thoſe wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe rational powers are acknowledgely inferior to none of their fellow-creatures. Witneſs a <hi>Boyle,</hi> a <hi>Bacon,</hi> a <hi>Newton,</hi> an <hi>Addiſon,</hi> and ten thouſand more, whoſe names are recorded in the annals of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and ſame.</p>
                  <p>Again, that true religion, according to the ſcriptures, conſiſts in conformity to the moral law, which requires love to God and man, and compliance with the goſpel—which requires re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God, and ſaith in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt—together with a faithful obſervance of all the commandments and ordinances of God's houſe, has been found by the generation of the righteous in all ages, to be conſonant to reaſon. The univerſality and perfection of the divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment—a future ſtate of rewards for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and puniſhment for the unrighteous which is ſtrictly eternal, are doctrines perfectly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reaſon. The particular doctrines of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028341_0191_0FD8B0D86476E278"/>
depravity, human dependence, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral operations of the ſpirit of God, with all thoſe which are their conſequents, are ſo evident to every judicious mind, that I need ſay nothing of their being conſonant to right reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another argument which I conſider in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Bible's being the word of God, is the manner in which its doctrines were firſt propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. The writers of the ſeveral doctrines found in the holy ſcriptures, lived in different ages, and in different parts of the world; but all appear to ſpeak the ſame language, to be moved by the ſame Holy Ghoſt; which could not have been the caſe had they not been inſpired of God.— Moreover the propagation of theſe ſentiments have not been accompliſhed by the powerful arm of the civil law—by the dint of the ſword; their intrinſic excellency has been felt and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by thouſands. The ſpirit of God has evidently attended the reading and preaching of the great truths of the goſpel, to the comfort and ſalvation of thouſands who have been favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the original propagators of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines contained in the ſcriptures, were, generally ſpeaking, illiterate men; and conſequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed with the means of deceiving the world; and the doctrines which they preached and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed were, in every point of light, contrary to the taſte of ſelfiſh and wicked men. Their rapid ſpread, therefore, muſt be owing to the divine and not human agency.</p>
                  <p>A third argument in favour of the ſcri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s being of a divine original, is, that their contents
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028341_0192_0FD8B0DA00B6A9B8"/>
are of ſuch a nature as far exceeds the higheſt ſtretches of the moſt exalted created minds and powers. All finite powers are confined to limits infinitely ſhort of thoſe exalted and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>blime ſtretches of thought exemplified in the ſcriptures of divine truth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The whole of the ſcriptures are delivered, not in the name of the penman, as would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have been the caſe, provided they had not been of a divine original—but in the name of the God of Nature, who undoubtedly is their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Miracles, which were wrought in atteſtation of the truth of what the ſacred penman wrote, are, notwithſtanding all the Deiſtical tribe have ſaid and written to the contrary, a powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in favour of the divinity of the ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The fulfilment of propheſies is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible and powerful argument that the Bible is the word of God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, muſt be conſidered by all rational and candid minds in the ſame point of light—Chriſt had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his death, and the time of his reſurrection— If this had failed of proving true, the ſcriptures muſt have been given up as a deluſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n—the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies of revelation would have had great reaſon to have triumphed over the friends to revelation and chriſtianity. Perhaps you will ſay, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the ſcriptures themſelves. We ackn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the ſcriptures do aſcertain this great and glorious fact; and we moreover affirm th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> it is aſcertained by human teſtimony; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028341_0193_0FD8B0DB5FC1F970"/>
ought not to be rejected by any ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al man.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The internal evidences of the truth of the holy ſcriptures are very ſingular. Theſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, without exception, breath love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God and man; they are ſtamped with the marks of a divine original. We find men capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of comprehending the works of genius and piety of a human kind; but where is the man to be found, who can graſp the lofty extent of thought, the elevated and ſublime ſtretch of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent contained in the lively oracles of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God? We look at them as we do at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and mighty ocean, and ſee a part, but not the whole of their meaning.</p>
                  <p>While theſe ſacred writings have been hated and ridiculed by the vicious, they have always been eſteemed and loved by the generation of the righteous.</p>
                  <p>Thus, my dear Sir, I have given you ſome faint traces of the outlines of the reaſons of my faith in revelation.</p>
                  <p>I adviſe you carefully to peruſe Kneeland's View of the Engliſh Deiſtical writers, and the ſeveral anſwers to Pain's Age of Reaſon—which might with more propriety, have been ſtiled the Age of Folly.</p>

                  <p>IN your three laſt letters you have convinced me of one important fact, at leaſt, viz. that there is one ſincere believer in revelation.

I know not how to account for it, but ſo the fact is, that ſince I ſat down ſeriouſly to examine the contents of what you call the holy ſcriptures, I have formed different ideas of my own moral character than what I have ever heretofore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined concerning myſelf.—The dread of the majeſty of all the world has ſtrangely fallen upon my mind, and I really have no peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

my idea of univerſal ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as being contained in the ſcriptures, I feel aſhamed of having abuſed thoſe holy writings. It is really a fact, that the Book of God makes a wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the believer and the unbeliever —between the clean and the unclean—between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not—and heaven and hell are to receive the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent characters.</p>

                  <p>I KNOW not that ever I ſhall be otherwiſe than in the wrong. My early fixed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to ſteer clear of ſuperſtition and enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, landed me in the deeps of Deiſm. Being driven from this ground by your maſterly pen, I haſtily adopted the idea of Univerſal Salvation but being convinced that this ſentiment was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural and illuſory, I fell into the Arminian ſcheme, which promiſes ſalvation to thoſe who are careful to obey the law; and of courſe have been ſeeking to eſtabliſh my own righteouſneſs as my only ground of hope. But from your laſt, I perceive that I am ſtill in the wrong; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I find that my own righteouſneſs is far from that which God requires of every rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that there is no evidence from the Bible, that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is deſigned only to patch up our filthy rags. I now know not which way to turn, unleſs it be to believe that I ſhall be ſaved, let me live and do as I may. And yet this ſcheme of religion does by no means correſpond with the dictates of my reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dear Harriot,</hi> be ſo kind as to unboſom your heart to your afflicted friend, on the all impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubject of real religion; be not contented with telling me what is wrong, but tell likewiſe

                  <p>THE account which you give of yourſelf is like that of a ſlender barge toſſed on the boiſterous waves of the raging ſea—always in danger, though ſometimes faintly hoping ſoon to gain a ſafe and commodious harbour. God is my witneſs, that I pity you from my very heart, and would cheerfully do any thing and every thing in my power to pilot you into the only har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of complete and eternal ſafety. For this purpoſe I muſt be allowed the liberty to uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech—My love and concern for the welfare of your ſoul being too great to admit of flattery, or daubing with untempered mortar.</p>

                     </gap> leſs than the voluntary enmity of your heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bleſſed God. Believe me, Damon, it was this that blinded your eyes againſt the reality and glory of that revelation which the God of love has been pleaſed to make of his mind and will, in the ſcriptures of the old and new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was this wickedneſs of heart which led you to catch hold of that miſtaken idea of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Univerſaliſts have preſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly palmed on the holy ſcriptures. And after your good ſenſe and uncommon talents had led you to give up theſe too often fatal deluſions, it was the corruption of your own depraved heart, which ſpurre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> you on to embrace the Arminian notion of ſalvation by the deeds of the law. And being again driven from the dangerous ground which you had inconſiderately taken, by the mighty power of truth—it was the ſame deceitful heart that led you, as your laſt reſort, to the abſurd and unſcriptural ſcheme of ſalvation adopted by the Antinomians—which, give me leave to tell you, is no leſs foreign from the truth, than either of the former. Now, as theſe various ſchemes of religion will by no means anſwer your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, permit me in faithfulneſs to your beſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, to tell you, that your feet undoubtedly ſtand on ſlippery places. O, Damon, forgive me, if, by the terrors of the Lord I undertake to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It is a fact little known and leſs felt by the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inattentive world, that men, as they are by nature, are totally depraved; that this deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity conſiſts in ſelfiſhneſs—which, like a mighty fountain, burſts forth in innumerable ſtreams, and deluges human nature with ſhame, diſgrace and guilt; yea, ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Till you are convinced of this great truth, you will be always laying hold of error in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of truth. For, believe me, Damon, the goſpel plan of ſalvation, in every point of light, is abſolutely contrary to the views and feelings of a ſelfiſh creature. Hence have ariſen thoſe innumerable falſe ſchemes of religion, which have diſgraced, confounded and ruined a great part of the human race. Know, then, my dear friend, thyſelf. By comparing your heart and life, with the moral law, which indeed is a tranſcript of the moral image of that God, the peculiar glory of whoſe nature is diſintereſted benevolence, you will ſoon ſee what a wretch undone you are. Should you aſk, And what ſhall I then do, when I have gained this knowledge, which you conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſo much importance—I anſwer, it will, as it always has been, be your duty immediately to repent and believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>— From a ſight of your true character, and a ſight of your abſolute dependance on God, the way will be opened, or more ſtrictly ſpeaking, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you to underſtand the goſpel ſcheme of ſalvation through Chriſt. You will find, you need juſt ſuch an atonement for ſin, as that which is publiſhed in the goſpel—that you need juſt ſuch aſſiſtance as that which is pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I THANK you for your acknowledgments of my ſincere attempts to promote your beſt intereſts. I am moreover exceedingly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the truth has found you out—that in fact it has ſhowed yourſelf to yourſelf in any degree. But I muſt be forgiven if I tell you, that you need further information ſtill reſpecting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of your own heart. Remember, my dear friend, the human heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked. You ſay that you perceive it your duty to believe on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of men—but find yourſelf unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this important taſk. Here let me freely obſerve, that this is a difficulty not uncommonly felt by thoſe who are brought to the knowledge of the truth—and frequently got rid of with no
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028341_0205_0FD88BBB9DA94300"/>
ſmall trouble. I muſt, therefore, grudge no pains to free you from it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Be ſo kind, Sir, as to reflect ſeriouſly upon the abſurdity of any thing's being your duty which lies beyond the limits of your natural powers and faculties to perform.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Carefully examine whether, ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the great duties of repentance and faith, are of this kind?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Carefully ſettle the matter, whether it be really a fact, that you feel yourſelf under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to exerciſe repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt immediately, or not?</p>
                  <p>Now, that I might contribute, as far as in me lies, to your properly ſolving theſe momentuous queſtions—pleaſe to attend to the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are many things incumbent upon men as duties, which they have no inclination to perform; but none which lie beyond the limits of their natural powers. The natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, that the inability which men are under to obey God, muſt be of a moral and not a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kind; and of courſe wholly inexcuſable.— Hence</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. The want of natural ability is the only thing which can excuſe us for the non-perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any thing which God commands.</p>
                  <p>But remember, dear Sir, a diſapprobation of our wrong conduct towards God, lies within the limits of our natural powers and faculties; and of courſe is a duty incumbent upon us—for the non-performance of which, we can have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:028341_0206_0FD8AFBC47CA9160"/>
excuſe. Therefore, we may eaſily ſee, that when we feel it a duty to repent; and at the ſame time, feel no inclination to perform this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the difficuly lies not in the want of power, but in the want of inclination only—or in other words, in the poſitive and voluntary oppoſition of our hearts againſt God. When you come care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to examine theſe matters, I believe you will find I am not out of the way in my thoughts on this great and intereſting ſubject. Wiſhing you much of the divine aid, I beg leave to ſubſcribe myſelf</p>

We read of joy in heaven among the angels of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> over one ſinner, that returneth and repenteth.

But let us not be too ſanguine in our hopes; but rejoice with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; for this becomes us, while in this vail of tears—while in this ſtate of imperfection—while we have not gained the heights of glory—while we have not aſcended the mount of God.</p>

                  <p>And now, Harriot, I muſt inform you, that I begin to find myſelf engaged in a warfare, of which previous to my change I had no idea. I find that I muſt, in fact, fight not with fleſh and blood only, but with principalities and powers, with the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, or loſe my ſoul after all. Little did I think, in that happy moment, when, without reſerve, I gave my all into the hands of God, that I ſhould ſo ſoon be called to put on the goſpel armour, and plunge into the battles of the Lord, the Captain and Biſhop of my ſoul. I find it impoſſible for one, who is really embarked in the cauſe of the dear Redeemer, to live in this world without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and perſecution. My Deiſtical acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance have got ſome idea of my views of mind,
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:028341_0213_0FD8AFD060694590"/>
feelings of heart, and determinations of ſoul, and begin to deſpiſe my company—Some ſay I am beſide myſelf; others that I am acting a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived and hypocritical part, only to pleaſe a lady whom I wiſh to marry. The followers of the Lamb of God ſeek my company, and call me brother; they mark the change through which I have paſſed, and bid me God's ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>I am pleaſed with the change of company, which ſeems to be the conſequence of my change of heart. But Oh, what will become of thoſe ſprightly youths, who formerly were my deareſt companions? They certainly are in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bonds of iniquity. Their feet ſtand on ſlippery places, and muſt, unleſs ſovereign grace prevent, ſlide in due time. Oh that each of them had an Harriot, whoſe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would be attended to out of love. I am determined to do all in my power to convince them of their errors, and perſuade them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the chriſtian religion. You will join with me in addreſſing the throne of grace, night and day, with an expreſs view to their ſalvation.</p>

                  <p>I AM extremely gratified with your laſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſpeaks the language of the redeemed, ſtruggling through this vale of tears— to come off conquerors, yea more than conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, through him who hath loved and died for them. The effects of that change of ſentiment and heart, you mention, are what I have been looking for, and ſo far as they evidence the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of your religion, rejoice at. I have felt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar ones preſſing upon my ſpirits for more than eight years; and no wonder, for the Lord God, immediately after the fall of man, put enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſerpent and the woman whom he had deceived, and between his ſeed and her ſeed. Hence the righteous are an abomination to the wicked, and the wicked are an abomination to the righteous—and can no more have fellowſhip with each other, than Chriſt and Belial. Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is the natural conſequence of theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent natures; but let us be careful that we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and perſecuted for nothing but well-doing—that we ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake; then may we rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great will be our reward in Heaven; for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets who were before us; yea our Lord and maſter himſelf.
