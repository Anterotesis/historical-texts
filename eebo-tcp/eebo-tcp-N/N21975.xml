            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>YOU ſtubborn-hearted children hear,</l>
               <l>That ſlight your aged parents dear,</l>
               <l>Draw near a while, with patience wait,</l>
               <l>While I this tragedy relate.</l>
               <l>No further off than Burkentown,</l>
               <l>There liv'd a man of high renown,</l>
               <l>Who had a ſon and daughter bright,</l>
               <l>To give himſelf and wife delight.</l>
               <l>The maid was formed beauteous fair,</l>
               <l>And female pride engag'd her care,</l>
               <l>Neglecting thought of God on high,</l>
               <l>She follow'd wordly vanity.</l>
               <l>Theſe people did much pains afford,</l>
               <l>To make their children love the Lord;</l>
               <l>But where God doth not grace beſtow,</l>
               <l>What can poor feeble mortals do.</l>
               <l>At length a certain wealthy man,</l>
               <l>To court the lady fair began;</l>
               <l>Her parents lik'd the offer well,</l>
               <l>As few in riches did excel.</l>

                  </gap>he had not wealth enough to wed,</l>
               <l>With one ſo rich as him, he ſaid.</l>
               <l>Her parents gave her all their ſtore,</l>
               <l>Save what their ſon had got before,</l>
               <l>That ſhe might marry handſomely,</l>
               <l>As her rich lover did agree.</l>
               <l>They married were in ſplendor great,</l>
               <l>And ſettled in a lofty ſtate;</l>
               <l>The ſon and daughter thus did ſhare</l>
               <l>That wealth, which was their father's care,</l>
               <l>Excepting forty pounds a-year,</l>
               <l>Which the old people thought with care</l>
               <l>Would ſerve them both to live upon,</l>
               <l>Their ſon and daughter being gone.</l>
               <l>This aged couple, as we hear,</l>

               <l>Which from the Chriſtian's heart proceeds.</l>

               <l>The faith and zeal of ſaints to try,</l>
               <l>Sends trials and afflictive frowns,</l>
               <l>And all their flatt'ring hope confounds.</l>
               <l>Thus this old couple felt the rod,</l>
               <l>Of an all-wiſe omniſcient God;</l>
               <l>A dreadful fire in dead of night,</l>

               <l>Thus ſtripp'd of all their needed ſtore,</l>
               <l>They now became exceeding poor;</l>
               <l>Naked, as riſing from their bed,</l>
               <l>Without their needed clothes they fled.</l>

They on their daughter then did wait,</l>
               <l>Told her of their unhappy fate,</l>
               <l>Saying, dear child what muſt we do,</l>
               <l>Unleſs we are ſecur'd by you.</l>
               <l>She with a frown to them did ſay,</l>

               <l>And in the morning ſtraight ſhe goes,</l>

               <l>They at their table muſt not eat,</l>

You've heard of our unhappy fate,</l>
               <l>How we have been diſtreſt of late,</l>
               <l>They wrung their trembling hands and ſaid,</l>

               <l>The ſon he coldly did reply,</l>
               <l>I know not what to ſay, not I,</l>
               <l>You can't expect me to maintain</l>
               <l>You both cannot long here remain.</l>
               <l>They for a fortnight tarried there,</l>
               <l>At length the ſon began to ſwear,</l>

               <l>The ſervant ſtanding at the door,</l>
               <l>Her charity they did implore.</l>
               <l>The ſervant did not know their face,</l>
               <l>But to her miſtreſs told the eaſe,</l>

The ſervant ſaid there's nothing here,</l>
               <l>And from the gate you muſt repair,</l>
               <l>They ſaid go back you damſel dear,</l>
               <l>Tell them it is their parents here.</l>
               <l>The ſervant told her what they ſaid,</l>
               <l>She in a paſſion ſtruck her maid,</l>
               <l>Saying, go do as you were bid,</l>
               <l>And keep diſgraceful ſtories hid.</l>
               <l>The ſervant put them from the door,</l>
               <l>They wrung their hands and wept full ſore,</l>
               <l>Into a barn they then did hie,</l>
               <l>In bitter grief, prepar'd to die.</l>
               <l>But look not on the ſtory here</l>
               <l>As a tale fictious, not ſincere,</l>
               <l>For in this land it does appear,</l>
               <l>There ſome ſuch graceleſs children are.</l>
               <l>The next morn the old pair were found,</l>
               <l>Extended lifeleſs on the ground,</l>
               <l>News to the daughter ſtraitway came,</l>
               <l>She laughed when ſhe heard the ſame.</l>
               <l>Their age, and extreme poverty,</l>
               <l>It was too troubleſome to me,</l>
               <l>No more of them I now ſhall hear,</l>
               <l>I from their trouble am ſet clear.</l>
               <l>But ſoon the heavy hand of God,</l>
               <l>Extended his avenging rod,</l>
               <l>One day the ſon a hunting rode,</l>
               <l>And ſoon his horſe the rider thow'd.</l>
               <l>He broke his neck and inſtantly</l>
               <l>Extended on the ground did die,</l>
               <l>His ſiſter heard it, and the fright</l>
               <l>Brought a hot fever on that night.</l>

Her ſenſes quickly fled away,</l>
               <l>Ten days in tort'ring pain ſhe lay,</l>
               <l>And then to death ſhe did reſign,</l>
               <l>Thus ſhe experienc'd wrath divine.</l>
               <l>Great preparations there were made,</l>
               <l>Her body ſhould in earth be laid,</l>
               <l>But e'er the funeral was, we hear,</l>
               <l>Her breath within her did appear.</l>
               <l>And lifting up her hands, ſhe cried,</l>
               <l>My ſoul from heaven is deny'd,</l>
               <l>Then to the world ſhe did unfold,</l>
               <l>What ſhe did in her trance behold.</l>
               <l>When my poor ſoul did ſtrait depart,</l>
               <l>I wander'd through a vally dark,</l>

               <l>At length unto a den I came.</l>
               <l>Whence iſſued ſmoke and dreadful fire,</l>
               <l>As made my ſoul with fear retire,</l>
               <l>I ſaw my only brother there,</l>
               <l>Enclos'd in darkneſs and deſpair.</l>
               <l>He roll'd his tortured eyes on me,</l>
               <l>And ſaid 'tis for my cruelty,</l>
               <l>I uſed to my father dear</l>
               <l>That I am now confined here.</l>
               <l>Then hearing a ſhrill trumpet ſound,</l>
               <l>I quickly turn'd myſelf around,</l>
               <l>And ſaw a glorious place divine,</l>
               <l>Where angels did in glory ſhine.</l>
               <l>I ſaw my loving parents dear,</l>
               <l>With golden crowns in glory there,</l>
