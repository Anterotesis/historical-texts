            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>BY annual Services Eſtates are held,</l>
               <l>The Rent unpaid the Tenant is expell'd:</l>
               <l>And I, ſubjected by my Tenure, pay</l>
               <l>A new ſtruck Liſt of Rhymes on <hi>New-Year</hi>'s Day.</l>
               <l>Sure, if I miſs, to have an empty Purſe,</l>
               <l>And to diſpleaſe my MASTER'S, which is worſe,</l>
               <l>But never was I puzzled heretofore,</l>
               <l>So much the laſt Year's News to number o'er:</l>
               <l>I'm out of Sorts, and know not what to write;</l>
               <l>The War's begun with <hi>Spain.</hi>—but who will fight?</l>
               <l>Unfitted for this Taſk, a Tale I'll tell,</l>
               <l>In Hopes the Subſtitute may do as well.</l>
               <l>Two loving Neighbours, but unlike in Senſe;</l>
               <l>(For one rely'd alone on Providence)</l>
               <l>Reſolv'd, the firſt, his Houſhold to ſecure,</l>
               <l>By Arms prepar'd, and Locks on ev'ry Door;</l>
               <l>Th' other ne'er to be upon his Watch,</l>
               <l>But 'gainſt Temptations, and his Doors to latch,</l>
               <l>To keep out Winds and Rain, or Dogs and Swine;</l>
               <l>From Thieves defended by a Fence divine.</l>
               <l>Oft' had theſe Neighbours been in deep Diſpute,</l>
               <l>But neither could the Other yet confute:</l>
               <l>The firſt then thinking how with honeſt Guile</l>
               <l>He could his Friend to Reaſon reconcile,</l>
               <l>Goes in the Dead of Night, his Pewter takes,</l>
               <l>And Prize of all his looſe laid Treaſure makes.</l>
               <l>The Loſer in the Morn perceives his Loſs,</l>
               <l>Reflects full ſorely, on ſo great a Croſs;</l>
               <l>Refuſes Meat, grows thin; his Looks are pale;</l>
               <l>And loud he would, but durſt not loud bewail:</l>
               <l>His Neighbour ſaw, and pitying did reſtore</l>
               <l>The Goods purloin'd, and bade him bolt his Door.</l>
               <l>But he ſtill thinking Providence was near,</l>
               <l>That try'd his Faith by ſuch a ſimple Fear,</l>
               <l>Reſolv'd more firmly to rely on him,</l>
               <l>And more and more to merit his Eſteem.</l>
               <l>Not long, alas! he liv'd in this Reſolve,</l>
               <l>Seaſons and Things in Motion quick revolve;</l>
               <l>Thieves deſp'rate, came within the Neighbourhood;</l>
               <l>They try'd a Houſe, and there the Bars withſtood;</l>
               <l>They came to this (and here a Latch was all)</l>
               <l>An Entrance gain'd to Kitchen and to Hall;</l>
               <l>And rifled ev'ry Place, and left him Poor,</l>
               <l>Who thought himſelf in Providence ſecure.</l>
               <l>Thus miſerable grown, he ſought his Friend;</l>
               <l>Have you ſaid he contriv'd to ſpeed my End;</l>
               <l>I'm robb'd of ev'ry uſeful valu'd Thing,</l>
               <l>Except my Bed, which no Repoſe can bring.</l>
               <l>Quoth he, what I can ſpare I will beſtow</l>
               <l>To help your Need, but not to make you owe;</l>
               <l>To me this dire Misfortune is not due,</l>
               <l>I once for Caution kindly cozen'd you;</l>
               <l>The Warning miſs'd its Aim, yet I'm your Friend,</l>
               <l>And would your Thinking with your Living mend:</l>
               <l>What Virtue or good Reaſon can there be</l>
               <l>In baiting Hooks for Vice and Robbery?</l>
               <l>As Preſervation is our eldeſt Law,</l>
               <l>In which the Wiſe have yet obſerv'd no Flaw,</l>
               <l>It well becomes us to ſecure our own,</l>
               <l>While we thereby do Injury to none.</l>
               <l>Can Providence be pleas'd to ſee us lay</l>
               <l>The Fruits of Labour to be ſtole away?</l>
               <l>If at my Face a Rogue ſhould clench his Fiſt,</l>
               <l>Is it Religion if I don't reſiſt?</l>
               <l>Believe me Friend 'tis not—nor God we ſerve,</l>
               <l>By feeding Villains while our ſelves may ſtarve.</l>
               <l>An honeſt Induſtry becomes a Man,</l>
               <l>And to preſerve his Freedom if he can;</l>
               <l>But if with all his prudent Care he fails</l>
               <l>The laſt Great Day muſt equipoiſe the Scales.</l>
