            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Fellow Citizens,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is the happineſs of people who live in a free government, that they may upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when they conceive their rights in danger, from whatever cauſe, meet, conſult and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon the proper mode of relief, and addreſs their fellow citizens; pointing out the dangers which they apprehend, and inviting them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in meaſures for their removal.</p>
            <p>In the exerciſe of this privilege, a number of the free citizens of New-York did aſſemble, and having appointed us their committee, gave it in charge to us to addreſs you on the ſubject of a late deciſion of the Mayor's court, in this city, on the law commonly called the Treſpaſs Law, in a caſe brought to iſſue in that court between Rutgers and Wuddington.</p>
            <p>This action was founded on a law of this ſtate,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:018320_0003_0FA5D4712EE055F0"/>
entitled, 'An act for granting more effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in caſes of certain Treſpaſſes,' paſſed in March, 1783; by which it is declared, that it ſhall and may be lawful for any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are or were inhabitants of this ſtate, and who by reaſon of the invaſion of the enemy, left his, her or their place or places of abode, and who have not voluntarily put themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively in the power of the enemy ſince they ſo left their places of abode, &amp;c. to bring an action of treſpaſs againſt any perſon or perſons who may have occupied, injured, or deſtroyed, his, her or their eſtate, either real or perſonal within the power of the enemy. And that no defendant or defendants ſhall be admitted to plead in juſtification any military order or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whatſoever for ſuch occupancy.</p>
            <p>The plaintiff charged the defendant for the uſe and occupancy of a certain brew-houſe and malt-houſe, in the city of New-York, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the plaintiff.</p>
            <p>To this charge the defendant plead, that the premiſes in queſtion were occupied part of the time under the Britiſh army, who took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof by virtue of permiſſion from the commander in chief of ſaid army, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the time by virtue of licenſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion granted by the ſaid commander in chief to a certain perſon, under whom the defendant held; which licenſes and permiſſions the ſaid commander had authority to give by the law of nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:018320_0004_0FA5D471DDF3DCA8"/>The defendant further plead, that by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace, all right, claim, &amp;c. which either of the contracting parties, and the ſubjects and citizens of either of them might otherwiſe have to any compenſation, &amp;c. whatſoever, for, or by reaſon of any injury or damage, whether to the public or individuals which either of the ſaid contracting parties, and the ſubjects or citizens of either, might have done, or cauſed to be done to the other, in conſequence of, or in any wiſe relating to the war between them, from the commencement to the determination thereof, were mutually and reciprocally, virtually and effectually relinquiſhed, renounced and releaſed to each other; and further averred, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was, from the time of his birth, and at all times ſince hath been, a Britiſh ſubject.</p>
            <p>The plaintiff to the firſt plea of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, namely, that the premiſes were held by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of authority and permiſſion from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the Britiſh army, replied, that ſhe ought not to be barred of her action by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that plea; becauſe the law under which ſhe brought her ſuit did expreſsly declare, that no defendant or defendants ſhould be admitted to plead any military order or command what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever for the occupancy.</p>
            <p>As to the further plea of the defendant, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the treaty of peace, the plaintiff demurred, or denied its ſufficiency in the law.</p>
            <p>This cauſe, as above ſtated, was argued on the 29th of June paſt, before the Mayor's court,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018320_0005_0FA5D47296A08E88"/>
and on the 27th of Auguſt judgment was given.</p>
            <p>The two points which preſented for the court's determination upon, ariſing from the two pleas of the defendant, were,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Whether permiſſion and authority from the commander in chief of the Britiſh army, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the law of nations, was a ſufficient juſtification to the defendant for the uſe and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupancy of the premiſes in queſtion; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the act of the legiſlature declares, 'that no defendant or defendants ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to plead in juſtification any military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or command whatſoever.'</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Whether the treaty of peace includes in it ſuch an indemnity as to juſtify the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant for his uſe of the premiſes.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the firſt point, the judgment of the court was, that the plea of the defendant was good for ſo much of the time as he held the premiſes under the immediate authority of the Britiſh commander in chief; or in other words, notwithſtanding the law declares that no defendant ſhall be allowed to plead in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any military order or command whatſoever, yet the authority and permiſſion of the Britiſh commander in chief ſhall be deemed a ſufficient juſtification; becauſe in the opinion of the court a liberal conſtruction of the law of nations would make it ſo, and becauſe the court could not believe that a repeal of, or an interference with the law of nations entered into the ſcheme of the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:018320_0006_0FA5D4750E1D72F8"/>The ſecond plea, namely, the Treaty of Peace, the Court declared inſufficient.</p>
            <p>From this ſtate of the caſe it appears, that the Mayor's Court have aſſumed and exerciſed a power to ſet aſide an act of the ſtate. That it has permitted the <hi>vague and doubtful</hi> cuſtom of nations to be plead againſt, and to render abortive, a <hi>clear and poſitive</hi> ſtatute; and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary authority of the enemy to be plead againſt the expreſs prohibition of our legiſlature.</p>
            <p>This proceeding, in the opinion of a great part of the citizens of this metropolis, and in our opinion, is an aſſumption of power in that Court, which is inconſiſtent with the nature and genius of our government, and threatening to the liberties of the people.</p>
            <p>We think the controverſy, notwithſtanding the immenſe learning and abilities which we are told have been diſplayed in it, lies within a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs, and within the reach of every common underſtanding.</p>
            <p>It is reducible to the two following queſtions, Does the plain and obvious meaning of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute prohibit the pleading of any military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, commands, permiſſion and authority of the enemy in juſtification of any treſpaſs for which a ſuit can be brought under it?</p>
            <p>Can a Court of Judicature, conſiſtently with our conſtitution and laws, adjudge contrary to the plain and obvious meaning of a ſtatute?</p>
            <p>If theſe queſtions are anſwered in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, authorities from Grotius, Puffendorff,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018320_0007_0FA5D4768DC48558"/>
Wolſius, Burlamaqui, Vattel, or any other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians, are no more to the purpoſe than ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opinions drawn from ſages of the Six Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>If they are anſwered in the affirmative, then there can be no diſputing againſt the opinion of the Court.</p>
            <p>With regard to the meaning and intention of the Legiſlature, it may be inferred from the very enacting of the law; for in doing that they ſuppoſe that as laws before ſtood, actions could not lie in caſes of this nature; to remedy this, they make it lawful for perſons deſcribed in the act, to bring actions of treſpaſs againſt, &amp;c. and declare that no military authority whatſoever of the enemy ſhall be plead, or evidenced in juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the treſpaſs.</p>
            <p>No point of controverſy can ariſe on the caſe but muſt turn upon the propriety or impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the law itſelf; not upon its conſtruction. For the plain language of the law is this, that the military power of Great-Britain, by taking poſſeſſion of theſe eſtates, and giving authority, permiſſion, order or command to perſons for oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupying and improving them, ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the occupier from being conſidered as a treſpaſſer, and thereby not liable to pay da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to the owner. We can hardly conceive it poſſible for the legiſlature to have choſen words that would make the intention of their law more clear.</p>
            <p>If what we have ſtated be not the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018320_0008_0FA5D47771001140"/>
of the law, then we conceive that it has no meaning.</p>
            <p>The time of paſſing the law, and the evident grounds of it, ſhow the intention of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and put it beyond a doubt that the ſpirit and literal conſtruction of it are the ſame. To give a remedy to thoſe citizens who had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned their eſtates on the approach of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and who had adhered to the fortunes of their country in all its viciſſitudes; moſt of whom had ſuffered very great loſs of perſonal property, and many of them reduced from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to penury and want. The real eſtates which they owned in the Southern diſtrict, it was well known, had been greatly injured; moſt of them irreparably ſo.</p>
            <p>We were then at the cloſe of the war. The legiſlature had certain accounts that the preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary articles of peace were ſigned. The time was conſidered as juſt at hand, when the exiles, the greater part of whom had expended all their looſe property, were to be put in poſſeſſion of their real eſtates, from which they had ſuffered voluntary baniſhment for more than ſeven years. The bad condition of their eſtates, and their incapacity to improve them, made the caſe, which the legiſlature thought proper to afford relief in by the law.</p>
            <p>It is well known that moſt of theſe eſtates were at that time held, or pretended to be held by virtue of authority from the Britiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief. The law of nations was the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018320_0009_0FA5D477D5648060"/>
ſame then as at this time, and the immutable principles of juſtice have not changed. Yet the wiſdom and ſupreme authority of the ſtate did declare that no military order or command of the enemy ſhould be plead, or given in evidence. The law being thus plain and explicit, it was never apprehended that its operation would be defeated by the plea of authority from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</p>
            <p>Impreſſed with a belief of its compleat and entire operation, many of the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who held the eſtates of exiles under the Britiſh, abandoned the place with them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void paying the damages which would accrue from it.</p>
            <p>The gentlemen of the law, we are confident, almoſt univerſally conſidered it as expreſſed in plain and unequivocal language that could not be miſunderſtood or explained away. In ſhort, no doubt was entertained of the meaning of the law, until the caſe of <hi>Rutgers</hi> and <hi>Waddington</hi> was agitated, and then there was no way left for the Defendant to juſtify himſelf, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting diſtinctions where there was no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and introducing matter which the law prohibited.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, we think that no one can doubt of the meaning of the law. It remains to enquire, Whether a Court of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature can conſiſtently, with our conſtitution and laws, adjudge contrary to the plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious meaning of a ſtatute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:018320_0010_0FA5D4789F511700"/>That the Mayor's Court have done ſo in this caſe, we think is manifeſt from the foregoing remarks.</p>
            <p>That there ſhould be a power veſted in courts of judicature, whereby they might controul the ſupreme legiſlative power we think is abſurd in itſelf. Such power in courts would be deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of liberty, and remove all ſecurity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. The deſign of courts of juſtice in our government, from the very nature of their inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, is to declare laws, not to alter them.</p>
            <p>Whenever they depart from this deſign of their inſtitution, they confound legiſlative and judicial powers.</p>
            <p>The laws govern where a government is free, and every citizen knows what remedy the laws give him, for every injury. But this cannot be the caſe, where Courts, if they deem a law to be unreaſonable, may ſet it aſide.</p>
            <p>Here, however plainly the law may be in his favour, he cannot be certain of redreſs, until he has the opinion of the Court.</p>
            <p>It may be <hi>expreſſed generally,</hi> and only ſay, that all perſons in certain circumſtances ſhall recover in certain caſes. But it may not by name bar every objection that might poſſibly be argued againſt it, where intereſt and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hold invention upon the rack.</p>
            <p>It may not particularly deſcribe the man, ſay what country he is to ſpring from, or what his occupation is to be, and being thus <hi>gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expreſſed,</hi> it cannot be from the nature of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018320_0011_0FA5D47B82509EF0"/>
things, but it will admit of ſome exceptions, and as it may admit of ſome exceptions, it muſt receive a <hi>reaſonable</hi> and liberal interpretation from the Court, <hi>however arduous the taſk may be.</hi> Now the reaſoning of the Court and the reaſoning of the legiſlature may lead them to very different concluſions, and as the Court rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon laſt upon the caſe, it is utterly impoſſible for any man to gueſs when he brings a ſuit, however exactly it may apply to the law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til by a tedious and expenſive proceſs, he obtains the opinion of the Court whether he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover or not.</p>
            <p>It is not our intention to enter into a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſideration of the evils which would reſult from the exerciſe of ſuch a power in our courts; much leſs to conſider all the arguments uſed to vindicate the deciſion in the caſe of Rutgers and Waddington. We are addreſſing an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened people, who are awake to every thing that may affect their dearly attained freedom; who know that the conſequences which would flow from the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a power, would be of the moſt ſerious and pernicious kind; ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering abortive the firſt and great privilege of freemen, the privilege of making their own laws by their repreſentatives. For if the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of abrogating or altering them be aſſumed by our courts, and ſubmitted to by the people, then, as far as liberty and the ſecurity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty are concerned, they become as uſeleſs as
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018320_0012_0FA5D47BA5D24FE0"/>
other opinions which are not precedents, and from which judges may vary.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved that the principal judges are in moſt caſes appointed to act within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a certain age, or during good behaviour, We do not wiſh to leſſen their independency;— for while they are content to move in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſphere, while they ſpeak the plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious meaning of the law, and do not preſume to alter it, or explain it to mean any thing or nothing. While in the duties of their real pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince they cannot be too independent; nor ought they to be liable to a remove but for miſbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. But if they are to be inveſted with a power to over-rule a plain law, tho' expreſſed in <hi>general words,</hi> as all general laws are and muſt be. When they may judge the law unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe not conſonant to the law of nations, or to the opinions of antient or modern civilians and philoſophers, for whom they may have a greater veneration than for the ſolid ſtatutes and ſupreme legiſlative power of the ſtate. We ſay, if they are to aſſume and exerciſe ſuch a power, the probable conſequence of their independence will be, the moſt deplorable and wretched de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of the people.</p>
            <p>That the laws ſhould be no longer abſolute, would be in itſelf a great evil; but a far more dreadful conſequence ariſes; for that power is not loſt in the controverſy, but transferred to judges who are independent of the people.</p>
            <p>Theſe being our apprehenſions, we have, in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018320_0013_0FA5D47C6F1B5768"/>
compliance with the requeſt of our fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and from a conviction of its propriety, briefly ſtated to you our ideas on this important affair.</p>
            <p>In a free government people ſhould be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the conduct of their rulers and magiſtrates. It is a knowledge that is abſolutely neceſſary to the preſerving of their freedom.</p>
            <p>Power preſents ſo many charms to mankind, that there are very few indeed, even of the beſt of men who have their avarice and ambition ſo perfectly under the correction of virtue and true wiſdom, as not to feel an inclination to ſurmount the limits aſſigned them; eſpecially, when the additional temptation of ignorance or inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſide of the people prompt to it.</p>
            <p>A private and individual caſe would not juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the meaſures which we have taken. But we conſider the deciſion in the caſe of Rutgers and Waddington as an adjudication which may be drawn into precedent, and eventually affect every citizen of this ſtate. It therefore merits the attention of us all.</p>
            <p>To prevent this miſchief, we do not adviſe our fellow-citizens to meaſures which are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional; nor do we mean to uſe them our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The mode of redreſs which our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conſtitution points out is, Firſt, by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the ſupreme court, where this cauſe will be carried by Writ of Error. We feel a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence from the characters of the gentlemen who preſide in that court, that the law will have
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018320_0014_0FA5D47D47F25510"/>
its operation reſtored in its plain and obvious meaning. But if we ſhould be diſappointed, the cauſe is of too much conſequence to reſt here. Its importance will grow with the difficulties and defeats it may meet with; for each of theſe will make a new diſcovery of the ſtrength of its opponents; each defeat will create a new triumph over freedom, and give additional courage and importance to her adverſaries, and all call upon us the more earneſtly to ſupport that cauſe, to defend that ground upon which the ſtandard of liberty is erected, and which, if ever ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ſhould be prepared to ſurrender with it every leſs and conſequent privilege, whereby we might be allowed better terms, from deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, than we ſhould by diſcovering our wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and imbecility in a conteſt which the firſt defeat will have rendered vain and hopeleſs.</p>
            <p>The next mode pointed out by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is an appeal to the court of Errors, one part of which the Senate conſtitute. Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to ſuch an event, we exhort you to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in your future choice of members, that none be elected but thoſe on whom, from long and certain experience you can rely, as men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the liberties of America, and firm friends to our law and conſtitution. Men who will ſpurn at any propoſition that has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to curtail the privileges of the people, and who at the ſame time, that they protect us againſt judicial tyranny, have wiſdom to ſee the propriety of ſupporting that neceſſary indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018320_0015_0FA5D47DEFF55BE8"/>
in courts of juſtice, both of the legiſlature and people, without which the fear of diſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from office on the one hand, and of perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al violence on the other, might ſteal into their deciſions, and render them intereſted and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
            <p>Having confined ourſelves to conſtitutional meaſures, and now ſolemnly declaring our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of all others, and having ſolely for our object, the ſupport of our excellent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and the abſolute and entire operation of our laws, we feel a freedom in ſounding the alarm to our fellow citizens.</p>
            <p>If that Independence and freedom which we have obtained at a riſque which makes the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition little leſs than miraculous, was worth contending for againſt a powerful and enraged Monarch, and at the expence of the beſt blood in America, ſurely its preſervation is worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for againſt thoſe among ourſelves, who might impiouſly hope to build their greatneſs upon the ruins of that fabric which was ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed?</p>
            <p>That the principle of deciſion in the caſe of <hi>Rutgers</hi> and <hi>Waddington</hi> is dangerous to the freedom of our government, and that a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in that principle would leave our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature nothing but a name, and render their ſeſſions nothing more than an expenſive form of government, the preceding remarks muſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:018320_0016_0FA5D47E9E4E8798"/>Permit us, upon this occaſion, earneſtly to intreat you, to join us in a watchfulneſs againſt every attempt that may be uſed, either violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſuddenly, or gently and impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to effect a revolution in the ſpirit and ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nius of our government; and ſhould there be-amongſt us, characters to whom the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it is offenſive; let our attention and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance be ſuch, as to preclude the hopes of a change. For even if our government was leſs excellent than it is, it would be better for us to be reconciled to a few inconveniencies, than by a haſty and ill-judged revolution, to put to the hazard all that we now enjoy under the preſent.</p>
            <p>Frequent changes or even alterations in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, where the people have ſo lately come to the exerciſe of one, may produce an inſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in them that will be more diſagreeable than trifling inconveniencies in the one already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
