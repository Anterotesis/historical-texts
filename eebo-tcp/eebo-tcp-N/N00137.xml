            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is a known Observation, verified by Experience, as well as grounded upon Scripture-Prediction, That sinfull Security is the great Disease of the last Times, whereunto those Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many are the solemn Warnings that the Lord hath given of a day of Trouble hastning upon us. <hi>The Lion hath roared, and the Trumpet hath been blown; And shall not the people be afraid?</hi> What a dead sleep of Midnight-Security hath surprised and overtaken them, that do not hear the loud Report of the many Divine Warning-Pieces that are gone off among us?

When the Iudgements of God are on their March towards us, shall we not be Alarmed?

Gods coming near to us in Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will trouble us; but his coming near to us in Mercy will either set Trouble far off, or sanctifie it, and turn it into Advantage and Comfort to us, and sweetly alter the property of it. The design of this Discourse, and the Publication of it, is not to enfeeble and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any of the Lords Servants, but to startle and awaken sleepy sinners (that cry Peace and Safety to themselves) that they may not be taken as Fishes in the net, and caught as Birds in a snare, or through ignorance of their time, be snared in an evil time, falling suddenly upon them: And to engage all persons of Interest with God, to stir up themselves to take hold of him, when he seems to be going from us, and to get into the Gap, and make up the Hedge, that the Evils threatned and approaching may not break in upon us, but there may be a lengthning out of our Tranqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Instrumental <hi>adjuvent</hi> Cause was the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> they did <hi>help forward the affliction,</hi> and are therefore said to be the worst of men, yea the <hi>worst of the Heathen.</hi> The Impulsive Procuring Cause was Sin: there are three sins mentioned in this Chapter (of which afterwards) as the Procurers of the Judgement threatned. The Final Cause was the Glory of God, even that he migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. The Judgement here denounced is set forth from <hi>the Subject</hi> of it, or the persons upon whom it came, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Thus saith the Lord God to the Land of Israel:</hi> which is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the Ten Tribes, who were gone into Captivity before this Prophesie was written, but the <hi>Iews</hi> are here called <hi>Israel.</hi> Often in the Scripture, not onely in the New Testament, but in the Old, the <hi>Iews</hi> are called <hi>Israel:</hi> therefore <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> King of <hi>Iudah</hi> is styled, <hi>The King of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Judgement here threatned is set forth from the <hi>Greatness</hi> of it: therefore it is called <hi>the end,</hi> ver. 2, 3. and an <hi>onely Evil,</hi> ver. 5. that is, a grand Evil: as when <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, <hi>Against thee, thee</hi> [onely] <hi>have I sinned,</hi> Psal. 51.4. <hi>i. e.</hi> against thee chiefly: So an <hi>onely Evil</hi> here, noteth a principal evil, yea a sweeping Judgement, so as that there should not be need for affliction to rise up the second time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Judgement is set forth from the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it: therefore <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 'tis said, <hi>It is come, it is come.</hi> The Prophet doth repeat those words, <hi>It is come,</hi> six times over, which sheweth not onely the vehemency of the Speaker, but the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain undoubted futurition of the Evil spoken of.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:000192_0005_0FA31723E398E658"/>5. The Judgement here denounced is described from the <hi>Celerity and Proximity</hi> of it. This may likewise be intimated by those Repetitions and <hi>Iterations,</hi> but now hinted. As <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> said to <hi>Pharaoh, Gen.</hi> 41.32. <hi>And for that the dream was doubled twice, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</hi> So, inasmuch as the Prophet is so <hi>Repetitious,</hi> as here we see, it was to shew, that the Evil would <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>shortly</hi> come to pass. And that is the scope of this Verse, <hi>The morning is come,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Execution-day</hi> is at hand: for those words seem to be an allusion unto the <hi>Iews</hi> Custome of executing Malefactors in the morning. Hence <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101.8. <hi>I will early destroy the wicked</hi>; or as the words are, <hi>In the morning</hi> I will destroy them, it being the Custome in <hi>Israel</hi> of old, to cut off Malefactors betimes in the morning. But a little for opening the words.</p>

               <hi>Day</hi>] here noteth Time. We must not think that the trouble here spoken of, continued but for the space of 24 hours; for the words have respect to the <hi>Caldean Siege,</hi> which lasted two years, yea to the Captivity, which lasted seventy years. It is therefore usual in the Scripture to denote a <hi>Time of very long continuance,</hi> by the name and notion of <hi>a day.</hi>

               <hi>Of Trouble</hi>] The Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> noteth great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Iunius</hi> translateth it, <hi>The day of vexation.</hi> It is the same day of trouble which is spoken of, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Alas, for that day is great, so that none is like it, it is even the time of Iacobs trouble.</hi> When the City and Temple were taken, and burnt with fire; when the King had all his Children slain before his eyes, and then his eyes put out, and he clapt in Chains, and carried Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive, that was a day of trouble that had none like it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is near</hi>] It is not here said, how near that day was, out it is certain from other Scriptures, that this trouble began within three or four years after this Prophesie. For <hi>Ezekiel</hi> wrote in the fifth year of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and the <hi>Caldean</hi> Siege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the ninth year of <hi>Zedekiah</hi>; so that this trouble began within four years after these words were Preached, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in six years execution was done upon <hi>Israel:</hi> therefore well might the Prophet say, <hi>The day of trouble is near.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Trouble may be said to be near, in a double respect: 1. In appearance, and probability. As it is said of <hi>Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that he was <hi>nigh unto death,</hi> Phil. 2.27. <hi>i. e.</hi> in appearance,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000192_0006_0FA3172410C24880"/>
and as to an eye of reason. 2. <hi>Trouble</hi> may be said to be <hi>near</hi> in reality. And so was this day of trouble of which the Text speaketh, near not onely in appearance, but in reality; and therefore the next words are, <hi>and not the sounding again of the Mountains,</hi> that is to say, there should be more then a meer (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>fragor Montium</hi>) Eccho of troubles. If men shout (as in the Mountainous Land of <hi>Israel</hi> they were wont to do) amongst Mountains, it will cause an <hi>Eccho,</hi> a <hi>sounding again,</hi> which soon vanisheth, and cometh to nothing; but saith the Prophet, the sound of troubles at hand shall not vanish so. The <hi>Iews</hi> heard a report, a rumour, as if the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> whose cry was in their ships, were coming against them; now the Lord would have them to understand, that it should be more then a <hi>sound</hi> or rumour, even a <hi>reality.</hi> The divine Threatnings were but an empty sound with them, but the Troubles coming for the contempt thereof, should be more then an <hi>empty sound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Judgement here threatned, in consideration with the Author and Subject of it, we may observe,</p>
            <p>That God doth sometimes bring Times of great Trouble upon his own People.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the Doctrinal handling of this Truth, there are four things may be spoken to. 1. That <hi>Israel,</hi> i. e. the Church of God, is subject unto troubles in this world. 2. What troubles they are which Gods people are here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto. 3. What are the signs of a day of trouble being near. 4. The Reasons of this Doctrine, whence it is that God doth bring times of great trouble upon his own people.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Lords people are subject unto great troubles,</hi> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are abundant in bearing witness to that: <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. <hi>We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> As the children of <hi>Israel</hi> went through the Red Sea, and through the Wilderness, before they could enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> so must we wade through a Red Sea of Troubles, and pass through a Wilderness of Miseries, e're we can arrive at the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> Here is the difference between this world and that which is to come. Indeed in <hi>the world to come,</hi> the Church shall be freed from troubles: it is therefore said,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000192_0007_0FA31724C61DC7D8"/>
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>There was no more sea,</hi> such a day will come, when there shall be <hi>no more sea,</hi> no more troubles and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions in the world as now there is, but as for the Saints, <hi>God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain:</hi> but before this day, <hi>Heaven and earth shall pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and <hi>there must be a new heaven, and a new earth</hi>; that is to say, this will be fulfilled <hi>in the world to come,</hi> but not in this world. Hence the Apostle speaketh of <hi>the sufferings of this present time,</hi> Rom. 8.18. so that during <hi>this present time,</hi> the Church will be subject to sufferings. Therefore also the same Apostle calls <hi>this present world,</hi> an <hi>evil world,</hi> Gal. 1.4. So that Christians must look for evils, they must look for troubles, as long as the <hi>present world</hi> shall endure. Two or three things may be briefly touched on, as <hi>demonstrations</hi> of this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Christ himself was exposed to sufferings when in this world.</hi> He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. <hi>David</hi> speaking in the Person, and as a Type of Christ, saith, <hi>Thou hast shewed me great and sore troubles,</hi> Psal. 71.20. And again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.17. <hi>The troubles of my heart are inlarged, O bring thou me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut of my distresses.</hi> Therefore Believers must undergo troubles and distresses also: for God hath predestinated them to be <hi>conformed to the image of his Son,</hi> Rom. 8.29. that is, not onely in respect of grace, or of glory, but in respect of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, for of them is the Apostle discoursing in that Context. Should not the Members be like the Head? shall we be Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in the Mystical Body of Christ? Truly, if we should meet with no troubles in the world, we should rather be Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters then Members in the Mystical Body of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Verity and Veracity of God proveth the truth of this.</hi> The Lord hath said, <hi>In the world you shall have tribulation,</hi> Joh. 26.33. But if Christians should live and die, and never meet with any troubles, how should those words be true? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, God hath Covenanted with his people, that sanctified afflictions shall be their portion, if need be, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.32. The Lord hath put it into the Indenture which he hath made with his Servants, that they shall have Physick as well as Food: now afflictions are Physick for the Soul. There are Covenant-afflictions, as well as Covenant-mercies: yea, all the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which befall the Lords faithful Servants, are ordered
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000192_0008_0FA317258633D460"/>
according to the Covenant of Grace, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. Hence when God entred into Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was an appearance of great darkness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.17. signifying, that all dark dispensations of Providence are ordered by a gracious Covenant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Instruments, and immediate Causes of trouble to the Church, have ever been.</hi> Causes of trouble there are both within and without. <hi>Within,</hi> there is sin and corruptions in the hearts of the best; and it will be vain to expect that the Saints shall be freed from all suffering, untill such time as they are freed from sin. <hi>Without,</hi> there is Satan to raise storms of affliction. Indeed if the Devil were cast into the bottomless Pit, and shut up there, we might think that there would be less trouble in the world: But we know, that as yet though he be a Prisoner, yet he is a Prisoner at large, he hath a long Chain given him, and goeth with it ranging and raging up and down the world, and maketh it his great design to raise Persecutions against the Church. Also Instruments of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in the hands of Satan have ever been: There was the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and the <hi>Grecian,</hi> of old: And in these dayes of the New-Testament, first the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours persecuted the Church ten times. They were no sooner gone, but the <hi>Arrians</hi> arose, and persecuted worse then ever professed Pagans had done before them, so that the Church was in great danger of being swallowed up with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15. And by that time the <hi>Arrians</hi> were down, Antichrist got up, who hath persecuted more then all that ever were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him. <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus,</hi> were all but Types of Antichrist. Wherefore, as long as there is a Devil out of Hell, or a Pope in <hi>Rome,</hi> we may be sure that there will be dayes of trouble to the Church of God.</p>
            <p>But <hi>what troubles are they, which the Saints are here subject to?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That's the second thing propounded to be spoken to. And in general, it is true, that <hi>Christians are in this life exposed to all manner of Miseries.</hi> This we may see in that <hi>little Book of Martyrs,</hi> as it is wont to be called, <hi>viz.</hi> the 11th Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There are inward spiritual troubles,</hi> Soul-troubles, which Believers may be afflicted with: They may be molested with Satans temptations, the best Saint upon earth may so, as <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:000192_0009_0FA3172646DE7410"/>
was, which caused him to pour forth many a bitter and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complaint into the bosome of the Lord Jesus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. <hi>He besought the Lord thrice,</hi> that is, many a time. A true childe of God may also be under divine desertion: hence the Church said, <hi>The Comforter which should relieve my soul is far from me, Lam.</hi> 1.16. God may hide his face from his dearest Servants sometimes, and those are troubles indeed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> But these are not the troubles which the text speaketh of, and therefore I will not insist there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There are outward troubles</hi>; e. g. sufferings as to losses and crosses respecting a mans outward worldly Estate. This is partly meant in the Text, <hi>A day of trouble is near,</hi> that is, a day wherein all mens Estates shall go to wrack and ruine. Hence <hi>ver.</hi> 12. it is said, <hi>Let not the buyer rejoyce, nor the seller mourn</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why? because he should not have kept his Estate long, though he had not sold it, inasmuch as Enemies were at hand to take it away. Again, troubles upon the Body in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Sicknesses, Mortalities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are here intended: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>the Pestilence</hi> is mentioned. Some have made a question of it, Whether a godly man may be sick of <hi>the Plague?</hi> A needless question. It is generally conceived that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was sick of that disease: and some Interpreters on <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.11. think that <hi>David</hi> was visited with that <hi>stroke.</hi> And the like is apprehended concerning <hi>Lazarus.</hi> In <hi>Cyprians</hi> time there were many thousands of godly men and women that died of that disease. It should seem, that the believing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> many of them were sick, and some died of the Pestilence. We should be very uncharitable, did we conclude, that all those that died of the Plague, in that day of trouble and mortality which the Text speaketh of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perished eternally. And the like may be said with respect to those Seventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand that were swept away when <hi>David</hi> numbred the people. Again, when Wars arise, it is <hi>a day of trouble:</hi> that is here meant in a special manner. Hence some render the words, A day of <hi>Tumult</hi> is near,<note place="margin">

               <hi>viz.</hi> in respect of confused noise, and garments rolled in blood. This may well be called a day of trouble, because <hi>War</hi> is the greatest of all outward Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">See <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now I have nothing curious or critical to present you with, onely a few plain Scripture Truths.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The abounding of Iniquity is a sign that the day of trouble is near.</hi> Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ speaking of the signs fore-running that day of Calamity which then was coming upon <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> saith, <hi>Iniquity shall abound,</hi> Mat. 24.12. If Iniquity do abound amongst those that are the professed Enemies of God, and of his People, that's <hi>a sign</hi> that their day is near, and that the things which shall come upon them do make haste, <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.13. <hi>Their wickedness is great</hi>; and then it followeth in the next Verse, <hi>The day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.</hi> So we see in <hi>Sodom,</hi> wickedness was grown to a marvellous height there, and then on a sudden the fatal <hi>Morning came</hi> upon them. If strange Prodigious Wickednesses are breaking forth, that's a sign that strange Punishments are at hand: but especially if it be thus amongst a Professing People Hence it's said concerning the old world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.12. <hi>God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all flesh,</hi> even the Sons of God and all, <hi>had corrupted his way upon the earth:</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

However, it is certain that such Fears there were, and that they were ominous. Therefore <hi>Rahab</hi> said unto the Spies, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 2 9. <hi>I know the Lord hath given you the Land, and that your terrour is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the Land faint because of you.</hi> And again, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>As soon as we heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you.</hi> The Lord is wont to cause such fears to come upon men, that so they may be left without excuse if they do not prepare for <hi>the day of trouble.</hi> Hence then, when every mans hands are upon his loins, and all faces are gathering paleness, it is an ominous sign. This is mentioned as a sign fore-going the troubles of the last times, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.26. <hi>Mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.</hi> Look as a Spirit of Courage is a good sign, yea an evident token of salvation, and that of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so on the other hand, a Spirit of Cowardize and servile fear is an ill sign.

We see in these following Chapters in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> when the glory of the Lord began to remove, it went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further, untill at last there was a total departure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In which respect, if our glory begin to remove, it is very sad and ominous: If God be at the threshold, trouble is at the door. Hence, when the signs of the Lords Presence are taken away, it argueth that a day of trouble is coming on apace. <hi>Vnity,</hi> is a sign of the Lords Presence; <hi>Live in peace, and the God of Love and Peace shall be with you.</hi> Hence breaches and divisions, inasmuch as they are an evidence of the Lords departure from a people, are a sign of miseries at hand. So again, Ordinances, Civil, but especially Sacred Ordinances, when administred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the minde of Christ, are tokens of the Lords graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Presence in the midst of his people. Therefore when the Lord removeth these, or the Instruments of upholding and managing these, for the edification of his people, it is a sad sign. Hence also, lesser Judgements are signs of greater troubles at hand, because they are arguments of the Lords beginning to forsake such places where those Judgements take effect. Thus we finde in the fourth Chapter of <hi>Amos,</hi> that <hi>Droughts, and Blastings, and Mildews,</hi> &amp;c. are signs that <hi>the morning shall be made darkness.</hi> Yea, bad Harvests are sometimes a sign, that a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is the usual method of divine Providence, to bring light out of darkness, by the greatest Miseries to prepare for the greatest Mercies.</p>
            <p>We come now unto the fourth thing propounded,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sermon</hi> II. P.M.</note> in order to the clearing of the Truth before us, <hi>viz.</hi> To enquire into the <hi>Reasons</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> whence is it that the Lord doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring dayes of great trouble upon his own people? <hi>Ans.</hi> The Reasons may be referred unto two Heads:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Lord doth this with respect unto Himself.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With respect unto his people. As indeed all the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God, all that he doth in the world, may be referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those two Heads, the Lord therein aimeth at his own glory, and his peoples good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Lord hath respect unto Himself, in those troubles which come upon the Church.</hi> Hereby his Faithfulness is manifested and glorified: therefore <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.75<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy judgements are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me.</hi> The Lord sheweth his great Faithfulness as to the time, the kinde, the measure, the manner, the duration of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever afflictions may befall any of his faithful Servants. And his Power also is hereby discovered: it is a glorious evidence of the wonderful Power of God, that the Church should be upheld and preserved in the world, notwithstanding the troubles and miseries thereof. The Church's being continued in the world, is one of the great Wonders of divine Providence, wherein the mighty Power of God is seen. It is said, that the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were <hi>like two little flocks of Kids</hi> before the <hi>Syrians,</hi> 1 Kings 20.27. Should we see a little flock of Kids, or of Sheep, in the midst of Wolves and devourers, and yet not destroyed, we should say, The singer of God is here. Truly thus it is: The Church is <hi>a little-little flock</hi> of Sheep, and that in the midst of thousands of Wolves and Tygers, yet this flock is saved alive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so then the Power of God is seen and glorified. <hi>Moses</hi> did sometimes marvel at this thing, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. <hi>And he looked, and behold the Bush burned with fire, and the Bush was not consumed; and Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the Bush is not burnt.</hi> The
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000192_0017_0FA3172C4763F3D8"/>
children of <hi>Israel</hi> were the Bush that was all on fire, in respect of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Persecution, which then they were under; but the Lord by a mighty hand of Providence upheld them, so that the fire did not consume them. Moreover, the Saints are wont to glorifie God more in a day of trouble, then at other times: <hi>Isa.</hi> 24.15. <hi>Glorifie ye the Lord in the fires</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so are the Saints wont to do, when in the fires of affliction, they bring more glory to God, it may be in one day, then in many years of prosperity. How was the Name of Christ advanced, and his Interest promoted in the world in the Primitive Times? and the reason was, because those were times of great Suffering. Hence then the Lord brings such times upon his people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God brings dayes of trouble with respect to his people.</hi> And that especially on a fourfold account. 1. For their Probation. 2. For their Instruction. 3. For their Correction. 4. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Purgation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Lord aimeth at the Probation of his people,</hi> in those troubles which befall them in the world. Hence <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.13. the Prophet there speaking of the same day of trouble which the Text hath reference unto, saith, <hi>Because it is a triall,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Fear none of those things thou shalt suffer; behold, the Devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be Tried.</hi> Hence the afflictions of Gods children are compared to a refining Furnace, or to a calcining Pot, wherein Metals are <hi>Tried,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. <hi>The triall of your Faith,</hi> &amp;c. The Greek word (<gap reason="foreign">

The Faith and Patience of his Servants are hereby put to the Trial: therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> speaking concerning the troubles which should come upon the Church under Antichrist, saith, <hi>Here is the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Faith of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 13.10. that is to say, by these troubles it is exercised and manifested. By this means the Lord Trieth the sincerity and fidelity of his Servants; yea, and what measure of grace they have too. If they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ever since that day of trouble which the Text speaketh of, the Jews have dreaded that sin which was the principal Cause of all their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Lord in afflicting his people, aimeth at their Correction.</hi> Hence affliction is called a Rod, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 21, 10. <hi>It is the Rod of my son, contemning every tree.

It is true, that personal afflictions oftentimes come onely or chiefly in a way of Trial, but publick Calamities are wont to come as Corrections and just Punishments for sin: <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.15. <hi>Why criest thou for thine affliction? for the multitude of thine iniquities, because thy sins were increased, have I done these things unto thee.</hi> And to the like purpose doth the Lord speak by the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> Chap. 1. ver. 5. <hi>For the transgression of Iacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. But you will say, What sins are they for which God is wont to bring dayes of trouble upon his people?</p>
            <p>

Worship of God, hath been the grand Procuring Cause of those astonishing and desolating Plagues that have come upon the earth. If men worship a false God, their sorrows shall be multiplied; or if they worship the true God in false Wayes, by means which he never appointed, and which never came into his heart, that's a sin that procureth great wrath. If men shall adde unto what the Lord hath commanded, and so corrupt his pure Worship with their own devices, vengeance will come for it: <hi>Psal.</hi> 99.8. <hi>Thou tookest vengeance of their inventions</hi>; Hos. 11.6. <hi>The Sword shall abide on his Cities, because of their own counsels</hi>; that is to say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they corrupted the Worship of God with inventions of their own. So on the other hand, if there be a <hi>taking from</hi> the Word of God, in matters referring to his Worship, dayes of trouble will come. In case Churches shall not come up fully to practice the Institutions of Christ, and to stand perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in all the will of God, the Lord will punish them for their neglects; as we see in the Jewish Church, who met with sore troubles after the return from Captivity, and the reason of it was, because they did not carry on Temple-work to that perfection which should have been, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.4. Yea moreover, if men grow careless as to the manner of their worshipping God, (though Object and Means should be according to his Will) the Lord will visit for that iniquity. When the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not duely care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to the manner of worshipping, <hi>for this cause many were weak and sick amongst them,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.30. It is (as was hinted but now) conceived by some Expositors, that the Lord sent the Plague amongst them, for that sin. We reade in <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why? to signifie that here was the cause wherefore the City was burnt, it was the Lords Controversie respecting his Altar, his Worship that is, which brought that famous City into ruinous heaps. So again, <hi>Isai.</hi> 29.1. it is there said, <hi>Wo to Ariel, to Ariel the City where David dwelt. Ariel</hi> signifieth the Lion of God, and may intend the Altar, which like a Lion did devour the Sacrifices offered thereon: here then was the true Cause of that <hi>Wo</hi> which befell that City and Nation, in that matters respecting <hi>Ariel,</hi> even the Altar and Worship of God, were not as should have been. Look as when things are managed aright as to Divine Worship, great prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is wont to follow, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.3. <hi>They set the Altar upon his Bases,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000192_0020_0FA3172E88493F10"/>
for fear was upon them, because of the people of those Countreys:</hi> They knew that that was the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y to engage the Lord to be with them, and to defend them against their Enemies, even to set the Altar upon his right Bases; so the contrary is to be affirmed, when the Altar is not set upon his Bases, great troubles are then like to come.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Pride is another sin</hi> here mentioned, as the Cause of this day of trouble: ver. 10. <hi>Behold the day, behold it is come, the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is gone forth, the Rod hath blossomed, Pride hath budded:</hi> The buddings of Pride, do cause the Rod to blossome against a people. Hence the morning, even the fatall day came upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> Ezek. 16.49. <hi>This was the iniquity of Sodom, Pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of Idleness.</hi> Pride is mentioned in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">(3) <hi>Oppression is another Evil</hi> mentioned, as the Procuring Cause of this trouble, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Violence is risen up into a Rod of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness.</hi> Violence, Oppression that is, brought the wicked <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> upon the <hi>Iews.</hi> There seems to be a marvellous Elegancy in the Prophets words: The <hi>Tribe</hi> (the same Hebrew word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a Rod, and a Tribe) of <hi>Iudah</hi> is compared unto a <hi>Rod</hi>; now what were the Buds that grew upon this Rod? even Pride and Oppression: therefore did the day of trouble draw near. Thus we see the Lord brings troubles upon his people, that so he may correct them for their sins.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>God herein also aimeth at their Purgation.</hi> So is it said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the day of trouble that was inflicted on the Church by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> Isa. 27.9. <hi>By this shall the iniquity of Iacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin.</hi> And concerning the troubles under <hi>Antiochus,</hi> of which <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white.</hi> To the same purpose is that, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. <hi>And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them as silver is refined,</hi> &amp;c. So then, that which the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by bringing his people into the Furnace of Affliction, is that he may make pure Metal of them, yea, that they may be purged and sanctified, and become vessels meet for their Masters use.</p>

Kingdoms shake, Nations shake, yet let us not be dismayed, for the Lord will carry on his own good work and glorious designs, in the midst of these troubles.

               <hi>VSE</hi> III. If God doth sometimes bring dayes of trouble upon his own people, here then is matter of solemn Awakening unto us; <hi>It concerns us well to consider, whether there be not a day of trouble near unto us.</hi> For Awakening here, I shall mention some
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000192_0023_0FA317310DD32388"/>
things, which look awfully upon us. Some <hi>Arguments</hi> let us here take notice of, which seem to speak as if <hi>a day of trouble</hi> were <hi>near unto us,</hi> yea and <hi>not the sounding again of the Mountains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. (To begin with that which is most general) <hi>There is a day of trouble coming upon all the World</hi>; and such trouble too, as the like hath not been: for I am perswaded that Scripture is yet to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, even that <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. where it is said, <hi>There shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a Nation, to that same time.</hi> We are in expectation of glorious times, wherein Peace and Prosperity shall run down like a River, and like a mighty stream over all the earth; but immediately before those dayes, there will be such horrible Combustions and Confusions, as the like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was. It is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 46.9. <hi>He maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the earth:</hi> but the words immediately foregoing are, <hi>Come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.</hi> Before the dayes come, wherein the Nations shall learn war no more, O what desolations wil the Lord make in the earth? We look that the Church shall be in its <hi>Philadelphian state,</hi> when Enemies shall come and <hi>bow before the feet of Ierusalem,</hi> as Christ speaketh in his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> but first there will <hi>an hour of Temptation come upon all the world,</hi> Rev. 3.10. We look that the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be Converted; I know, and am perswaded by the Lord Jesus, that it shall be so in the appointed time. We look that <hi>Chittim</hi> and <hi>Ashur</hi> (that is, <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Turk</hi>) shall perish for ever; but is it not said, <hi>Alas, who shall live when God doth these things?</hi> Numb. 24.23. We know that in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Vision, <hi>when the Sun was going down, an horrour of great darkness fell upon him, Gen.</hi> 15.12. Why so? but to signifie, that when the Sun is going down, even in the end of the World, when Christ is ready to come and set up his Kingdome, and judge the earth, there shall be great horrour of darkness and misery upon the world: Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall then cover the earth, and gross darkness the people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Our eyes see, and our ears hear of the beginnings of sorrows.</hi> That which Christ spake with immediate reference to the troubles preceding the destruction of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church and State, may be applied to the troubles of the last times, the former being a Type of the latter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.6, 7, 8. <hi>And ye shall hear of wars, and rumours of wars, see that you be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet: for Nation shall rise against Nation, and Kingdome against Kingdome, and there shall be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000192_0024_0FA31731881CBC88"/>
and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stilences, and Earthquakes in divers places: All these are the beginnings of sorrows.</hi> What do we hear of at this day, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Wars, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umours of Wars? and Nation rising up against Nation, and Kingdome against Kingdome? Now if these are the beginnings of sorrows, what, and where, and when will the end be? There's an over flowing scourge breaking in upon the world, even a Judgement, that will not keep within ordinary banks or bounds, but shall pass over into many Lands. And how far will it go? where will the Tayle of this Storm fall at last, do we think? How if it should fall upon <hi>America?</hi> Will not some drops at least light upon <hi>New-England?</hi> We may speak in the words of the Prophet in my Text, and say, <hi>The morning is come,</hi> The day of trouble begins to dawn upon the world. Alas for this day, it is great, there is none like it. It is then high time for us to awake out of sleep.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To come nearer home; <hi>The fatal Strokes which have been amongst us speak ominously.</hi> Is not that a plain Scripture, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.1. <hi>The righteous is taken away from the evil to come?</hi> The Lord hath been taking away many righteous ones from the midst of us; yea righteous ones, that should have stood in the gap, now when the waters of many Troubles are breaking in upon us, whereby he hath <hi>made a way to his anger,</hi> Psal. 78.50. How many Magistrates, and Ministers especially, hath the Lord bereaved us of? When Kings call home their Ambassadors, it's a sign they will proclaim War. God hath called home many of his Ambassadors of late, and that's a sign that War is determined in Heaven against us. Our Enemies are coming, and our Chariots and our Horsmen are gone. <hi>Ah! poor</hi> New-England, <hi>thy Chariots and thy Horsmen are gone from thee, and now thine Enemies are coming against thee.</hi> And I would not pass by in silence, the observable Providence of God, who hath so ordered, that many Ancient Christians have been taken away of late, as it were together. I have made some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry about that matter, and finde it to be a general observation, That in many Plantations round about, in one or two years time, a great number of aged Christians have been hid in their graves. The <hi>taking away of the Ancient,</hi> is mentioned as an ominous sign, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Methuselah</hi> was the oldest man in the old world, and he died the year before the Flood came. Inasmuch as many of our <hi>Methuselahs</hi> are lately gone, and that so near together, we may fear that a Flood is coming. It's a sign of a Winter at hand, that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000192_0025_0FA3173246492180"/>
so many aged ones should drop down into the grave together. Nor would I omit here, the sudden Deaths whereby many have been snatched away. When Christ was told of some that were taken away by sudden death, he replied, <hi>I tell you, Nay: except you repent, ye shall all likewise perish,</hi> Luke 13.3. As if the Lord had said, I would have you take these sudden destructions which befall some, as an <hi>Item</hi> unto you, that your Enemies will come and make a general slaughter amongst you, except you do by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance prevent it. And in the 4th of <hi>Amos,</hi> it is set down as a sign fore-running a day of great and general trouble, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrow Sodom and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah.</hi> And how did God overthrow <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah?</hi> Was it not with Thunder and Lightning from Heaven? Many amongst us of late years have been so overthrown: yea this year, at least four persons have been so, and sundry of them good men, which maketh the Strokes the mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>wful and ominous.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>There are manifold transgressions, and mighty sins amongst us.</hi> And here if I should leave off speaking, and we should all of us joyn together in weeping and lamenting, it would be the best course that could be taken. Brethren, what shall I say? As to <hi>matters of Religion,</hi> things are not as should be. There is a great decay as to the power of godliness amongst us. Professors are many of them of a loose, carnal, ungirt Conversation. We can now see little difference between Church-members and other men, as to their discourses, or their spirits, or their walking, or their garb, but Professors of Religion <hi>fashion themselves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the world.</hi> And what <hi>Pride</hi> is there? Spiritual Pride, in Parts and common Gifts of the Spirit, and in Spiritual Priviledges; yea carnal, shameful, foolish Pride, in Apparel, Fashions, and the like. Whence is all that rising up, and disobedience in Inferiours towards Superiours, in Families in Churches, and in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but from the unmortified Pride which is in the hearts of the sons and daughters of men? And is there not Oppression amongst us? Are there no biting Usurers in <hi>New-England?</hi> Are there not those that grinde the faces of the poor? A poor man cometh amongst you, and he must have a Commodity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it cost him, and you will make him give whatever you please<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and put what price you please upon what he hath to give too, without respecting the just value of the thing.

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000192_0026_0FA317330AD6B438"/>
and Extortions which the eyes of the Lords glory have seen amongst us. And are there not <hi>Contentions and Divisions</hi> amongst us? It is in vain for us to go about to palliate this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to cover this sure, for the shame of our nakedness doth appear, so as that we are become a derision amongst our Enemies. We are divided in our Judgements; and if that were all, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were not much: but we are divided in our Affections, divided in our Prayers, divided in our Counsels: And will not an House divided be brought to desolation? We may say as that blessed <hi>Burroughs</hi> once complained, <hi>We have been so divided,</hi>

I do believe, that one reason why the Lord threatneth to send upon us that Calamity of War at this day, is because of wars and fightings which he hath seen, and been provoked with in the midst of us. If you will needs be fighting (saith God) I'le send those upon you, that shall give you enough of it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.1. The Clashings and <hi>Tumults</hi> which have been amongst us, may cause us to fear, that such a <hi>day of Tumult</hi> as the Text speaketh of, is hastening upon us. And what a <hi>woful Worldly spirit</hi> is there in many? Hence God, and Christ, and Heaven, and the Concernments of mens own Souls, are not minded: yea, duties of Communion with the Lord are either totally neglected, or slubbered over.

The Clouds begin to gather thick in our Horizon: yea, there is a Cloud of Blood, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to drop upon us.

So doth he say, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.</hi> It is not onely true concerning particular persons, but as to Churches, (those words were spoken to a Church) that if Christ hath a peculiar love unto them, then he will rebuke and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000192_0030_0FA31736073E5AD8"/>
chasten them, as there shall be cause for it. Indeed we may therefore hope that the Lord will not destroy us. Through the grace of Christ, I am not at all afraid of that. The Lord will not as yet destroy this place: Our Fathers have built Sanctuaries for his Name therein, and therefore he will not destroy us. The Planting of these Heavens, and the laying the Foundations of this Earth, is one of the Wonders of this last Age. As <hi>Moses</hi> said, <hi>Ask now of the dayes that are p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st, ask from one side of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the other, hath God essayed to go and take him a Nation out of the midst of a Nation?</hi> Deut. 4.32, 34. God hath culled out a people, even out of all parts of a Nation, which he hath also had a great favour towards, and hath brought them by a mighty hand, and an out-stretched arm, over a greater then the Red Sea, and here hath he planted them, and hath caused them to grow up as it were into a little Nation: And shall we think that all this is to destroy them within forty or fifty years? Destruction shall not as yet be. Nevertheless, the Lord may greatly afflict us, and bring us very low. It is a notable Observation, which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a <hi>Iewish</hi> Writer hath, who lived in the dayes of the second Temple;
<q>The dealings of God with out Nation (saith he) and with the Nations of the world, is very different: for other Nations may sin and do wickedly, and God doth not punish them, untill they have filled up the measure of their sins, and then he utterly destroyeth them; but if our Nation forsake the God of their Fathers never so little, God presently cometh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us with one Judgement or other, that so he may prevent our destruction.</q>
So let me say, Neighbouring Plantations about us may possibly sin grievously, and yet it may be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord taketh them to do, because it may be hee'll reckon with them once for all at last; but if <hi>New-England</hi> shall forsake the Lord, Judgement shall quickly overtake us, because the God of our Fathers is not willing to destroy us their Children.</p>
            <p>These things then are enough to awaken us out of our Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I have thought of three other Signs of approaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, which I shall not mention at this time, albeit they are (in my apprehension) no less ominous, then any thing that hath been spoken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VSE</hi> IV. I conclude with a word of Exhortation. <hi>Let us carry our selves as doth become those that have a day of trouble near unto them; yea, so as that we may prevent the troubles which
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000192_0031_0FA31736C58131E8"/>
seem to be near.</hi> I need not say much by way of Motive. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the <hi>Arguments</hi> mentioned in the last Use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Signs</hi> of Troubles being near, insisted on in the former part of the day. And consider, that if we carry our selves in a suitable manner, we may possibly escape those Evils, that otherwise are like to overtake us. It is possible that this Cloud may blow over, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.15. <hi>It may be the Lord of Hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Ioseph.</hi> Truly we are the remnant of <hi>Ioseph</hi>; we are (as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> was) <hi>separated from our Brethren,</hi> who can tell but that the Lord may be gracious to us? <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Seek ye the Lord, all the meek of the earth; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</hi> Nay, if we carry our selves as doth become us in a day of trouble, it's past a <hi>may be,</hi> that we shall be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But <hi>how ought we to carry our selves now that trouble is near unto us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <hi>It doth concern us and become us to be an humble people.</hi> As sometimes the Lord said to his people of old, <hi>Now put off thy Ornaments, that I may know what to do unto thee,</hi> Exod. 33.5. so doth the Lord by his Providence speak to us, Put off thy Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, O <hi>New-England,</hi> that I may know what to do unto thee, that I may know whether I had best spare thee, or punish thee. Prepare to meet thy God; even to meet him as sometimes <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> with-Confessions, and humble Supplications. And if we humble our selves deeply and unfeignedly, God cannot finde in his heart to destroy us. It is a wonderful Scripture which we have, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.16. <hi>David lift up his eyes, and saw the Angel of the Lord stand between the Earth and the Heaven, having a drawn Sword in his hand, stretched out over Ierusalem; then David and the Elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</hi> Indeed the Angel of the Lord is standing over us with a drawn Sword in his hand, but if we fall upon our faces before the Lord, as doth become us, God will say, Let it be enough that the Sword is held over this people, stay thine hand, put up the Sword.</p>

               <hi>And seekest thou great things for thy self? seek them not: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord.</hi> Now will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing serve you but the world, in this day wherein God is sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all Nations, yea shaking Heaven and Earth, and Sea and dry Land? What is the voice of God to us in these dreadful dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, but this, See that your hearts be taken off from the world, and set them more upon those things that cannot be shaken?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We should be a Believing people.</hi> That's the way to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of trouble: <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.4. <hi>Our fathers trusted in thee; they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.</hi> O the mighty things that Faith can do! It is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34. <hi>By Faith they escaped the edge of the Sword, and turned to flight the Armies of the aliens.</hi> Though Armies should come against us, the Spirit of Faith may turn them back. In the times of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> (for unto those troubles doth the Apostle there allude) sometimes a small hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, worsted great Armies that came against them, because they acted Faith upon the Name of the Lord.

Would we sink, or would we swim in this Sea of trouble that is a coming? If we break, we shall sink; if we divide, we perish, and are like to be an undone people: But if we be <hi>whole,</hi> if we unite, we shall <hi>swim,</hi> our heads will then be above water, let what troubles can come: yea, and we shall then be a burthensome stone to all that shall burthen themselves with us. If we do but become one with God and one another, as we ought to be, we need not fear all the world. Oh that our Divisions, and other Evils that are amongst us, might be repented of, and then I dare speak it boldly before all this Congregation, God will make <hi>New-England</hi> a burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some stone, yea though all the Nation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What people under Heaven have ever had more encouragement unto Prayer, then we have had? Know it Enemies to your terrour; Know it all the World, That the Lords poor <hi>New-England-People,</hi> have ever found him to be a <hi>God that heareth Prayer</hi>: and therefore let's be at that work still. And truly, there is as much need now as ever. We may even say, as sometimes that blessed Martyr did, <hi>Pray, pray, pray, never more need then now.</hi> Alas, that we are no oftener

in such a solemn manner, as at this day before the Lord! We may here allude to that which is spoken, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. we there reade that there was <hi>silence in Heaven half an hour,</hi> and then followeth <hi>an Earthquake.</hi> It's sad to consider, that there hath been so great a silence in Heaven amongst us: I have thought on it with some grief of heart, that there hath not been so much Fasting and Praying in <hi>New-England</hi> of late years, as sometimes formerly, though never so much need as now. Who knoweth, but the Lord may bring these troubles within our sight, that so we may seek him early, yea that so the Spirit of Prayer may be awakened amongst us? There are some that cannot pray, all unregenerate sinners are destitute of the Spirit of Prayer; many poor misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Souls, that keep their Prayers and Tears till such time as they will do them no good. But I know that there are many, Scores, Hundreds here this day, that have an Interest in Heaven, and know how to improve it. Why then, up and be doing. If thou hast but one Tear in thy eyes, if thou hast but one Prayer in thy heart, spend it now. And let us remember the words of the Lord Jesus, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36. <hi>Watch ye therefore, and pray alwayes, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things which shall come to pass.</hi>
