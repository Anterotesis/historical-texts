            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN, by you made Choice of to go down to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and examine into the publick Juſtice and Advantage of a Scheme called the Land or Manufactury Bank, as well for your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as that of my own in that Affair, you are ſenſible I declin'd that Truſt as unequal to it; however when you obſerv'd to me the Difficulty of procuring a Correſpondent at <hi>Boſton</hi> free from Prejudice and Affection, and no way influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd by private Intereſt, to make a fair and juſt Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Projection, I engaged in your Service with a full Reſolution diligently and impartially to ſcan the ſame; and which I ſolemnly declare I have done to the utmoſt of my Capacity, aſſiſted with all the Knowledge I could get by the cloſeſt Application</p>
            <p>When I got to <hi>Boſton,</hi> I judged it moſt prudent to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce myſelf into variety of Company, and ſtrictly to take No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice how they handled this new Diſcovery of a Medium. I could not be at a Loſs in bringing it on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, for it was the general Topick of Converſation. Then I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004541_0003_100D6503A387C788"/>
your Obſervation to be juſt; for in all my Converſation I plainly diſcovered it was treated by Perſons according to their reſpective Affections, Prejudices, and Intereſts; the moſt noiſy on both Sides, moſt ignorant of the intrinſick Worth of it, and Strangers to the right Notion of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um or Currency in a Community. Others there were who appeared to me to be more intelligent and cool; undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to point out Objections to ſeveral material Parts of its Conſtitution, and to the Mode of its Regulation: I muſt take Notice I could never hear this Claſs of Gentlemen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the Hearing of any of its Advocates, and therefore once took the Liberty of asking if they had at any Time attended the Committee according to their Advertiſements, and had there raiſed ſuch their Objections? They replied, they had not, with ſuch an Air as convinced me they judged they were unanſwerable, or at leaſt, ſo by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Committee, whoſe Abilities and Subſtance, they had not much in Eſteem. I therefore thought this Method alone could not poſſibly ſettle in me an equal and impartial State of the Affair, ſo as to form a ſatisfactory Judgment. However I carefully minuted down all the Objections worthy of Notice, and by whom made, that I might know whether private Intereſt was not in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at the Bottom; and theſe Objectors turn'd out to be principal Merchants, Factors, and rich Uſurers; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I was reſolved to weigh the Objections them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and give them their juſt Conſideration, and that the Riches of thoſe Gentlemen might not give them any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Weight, I oppoſed thereto their private Intereſts, which may engage them on that Side.</p>
            <p>My next Purſuit of Light in a Caſe of ſo great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and ſo differently repreſented, was to hear how the Gentlemen of the Committee maintain'd the publick Juſtice and Advantage of this their Scheme; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly I waited on them, and tho' a Stranger, their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement I obſerved, was my Introduction, and opened to them the End of my Attendance. They expreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to afford me all the Light and Satisfaction they could, and wiſhed for the Peace and Harmony of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004541_0004_100D65052589D918"/>
If ſuch as decryed the Scheme had acted the like ingenious Part, it probably might have prevented many of the Invectives againſt it. As I was then the only Inquirer preſent to be ſatisfied, they judged it moſt fair that one of them only ſhould maintain the publick Juſtice and Advantage of the Projection; the Gentleman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd premiſed ſomething by Way of Introduction.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That ſome Medium or Currency of Acceptance muſt be ſuſiſting in all Communities, which being a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal not to be brought into Queſtion, he proceeded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To demonſtrate the Want of it in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, from theſe Particulars; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That all the Bills of Credit of this Province, that by Law ought now to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, equally divided would not amount to <hi>Five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> a Head, and as the greateſt Part of them were hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by rich Men, there are not in Circulation what would amount to <hi>Six Pence</hi> a Head. So that in Fact this Province is at preſent dependant on the neighbouring Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments for much the greateſt Part of ſuch Bills of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Credit as are in Currency among us And <hi>Secondly</hi> that all fall greatly ſhort of the preſent Exigency plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, from a pernicious Practice and cheating Method of ſubſtituting Drafts on Shops in the Place of a Medium, to pay Artificers and poor Labourers. Herein the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mentioned a few ſhocking Inſtances, which for brevity I ſhall not mention. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The want of this Medium is further evidenced from the Neceſſity we were drove to, in being obliged to catch at <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> laſt Emſſion, and that in open Defiance of a ſtanding Law of this Province, and now glibly received by all our Merchants, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their moſt ſolemn Declarations to the contrary; and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to ſhew what Neceſſity will drive Men to, he declared that he had it credibly reported, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited <hi>Five Pound</hi> Bills paſs at the Eaſtward as currant as the true Bills, tho' known to be Counterfeits.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman, Thirdly, after thus proving the want of a Medium, proceeded to obſerve the ſame can't be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Legiſlature, during the continuation of His Majeſty's Inſtructions to his Governour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004541_0005_100D6508068F5DF8"/>
himſelf to the Proceeding of the laſt General Court. And finally theſe were the Motives that animated the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee (to uſe his own Words) to enterprize a Deſign of ſo grand Importance, the Uſefulneſs and Juſtice of which, was now the Subject Matter of my Inquiry. The Projection ſaid he, is term'd the Land Bank, from the Foundation of it on real Eſtates, the moſt permanent Security that can be given, and alſo called the Manufactury Bank, from its Production, and that it's real Security at Bottom is ſuperior to that of any other Paper Emiſſion, is obvious; for the Subſcriber's Eſtate to be Mortgaged is to be apprized by skilful Perſons under Oath to be equal and one half more in Value than the Subſcription Money amounts to. The Subſcribers are to pay annually, Intereſt at the Rate of three per Cent. and one twentieth Part of the Principal, which annually renders the Security better; whereas in all other Emiſſions of Paper Bills upon Land Security, its true, they were apprized by Perſons under Oath, and too often by Neighbours playing into one another's Hands, were over valued, the Mortgagors keeping in Poſſeſſion for many Years, without paying Principal or Intereſt, cutting the Wood, and wearing out the Land, at laſt left the Province a ſlender Security indeed. Beſides here every Subſcriber in Caſe of any Jealouſy that the Security given is ſcanty, is enjoined by the Conſtitution, to give freſh or additional Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, which is ſuch a ſtrengthning, as is wanting in all other Paper Emiſſions; ſo that he aſſerted, no Bank in Europe, no Emiſſion of Paper Currency in <hi>America,</hi> is or can be eſtabliſhed upon a better or more unexceptionable a Foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He further added, that beſides the View the Committee had in corroborating the Security annually, by obliging a twentieth Part of the Principal to be ſo paid, it alſo forced the Subſcriber yearly to be induſtrious, and he had it not in his Power to poſtpone the evil Day; which has been too frequently the Caſe between the Publick and Borrower i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As to its Production, from whence it is ſometimes called the Manufact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

render Silver or Gold an immediate Medium among us, the Bills themſelves being emitted on unqueſtionable Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, muſt therefore carry with them indiſputable Credit, and conſequently be a conſtant Medium, ever circulating, and as paid in, placed out again on lawful Intereſt; for if all is to be called in at a certain Period of Time, then the Medium is loſt. All Payments are to be made to the Company in their Bills, or in the enumerated Manufactures <hi>ad Valorem,</hi> according to the Denomination of the Bill. And as <hi>One Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Pounds</hi> in theſe Bills will in the Run of twenty Years, ſtill be but <hi>One Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Pounds</hi> in Bills, then it follows, the Intereſt of them multiplied all the Time, muſt be paid in the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated Manufactures, which of Neceſſity muſt greatly promote Induſtry, ſink Import, and raiſe Export; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, when Import and Export with us are upon a Par, Silver and Gold will then ſtay with us, mix with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactury Bills, and become a joint Medium among us; But at this Time a Day, when the Glut of Engliſh Goods, like Weeds choke our growing Manufactures, and our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from thence ſo vaſtly exceeds our Export, to pretend to make Silver or Gold a Medium in Circulation among us, or by the beſt concerted Schemes to render it ſo, muſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the Reach of all Mankind, ſaving a very few, who give themſelves the addition of Merchants, whoſe Riches he ſaid when he beheld, he was ſurprized at their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ding, and when he ſurveyed their Underſtanding, was equally ſurprized at their Riches; and therefore to ſupplant a wild Scheme, called a Silver Bank guilded with an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of introducing Silver and Gold among us, under our preſent Circumſtances, but virtually calculated to take away the addition of Yeoman in the Country, and impoſe on them the additions of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sbandmen, Labourers and Tenants, greatly contributed to the forming this Land and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factury Bank.</p>
            <p>He urged further that this Sett of Gentlemen were not content themſelves to expreſs ſevere Things of the Committee, but had inliſted a Writer, to treat them in Print with more Indecency. But that unguarded Gentleman happened to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004541_0007_100D650C6A64BCC8"/>
over-act his Part, by publiſhing a Pamphlet, whereby he preſcribed PURGING the Province of all Paper Currency, and dances the Reader over the ſeveral States in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in all ſhewing by Experience the pernicious Tendency of Paper Currency; but as that Gentleman has been ſufficiently handled by a Gentleman of much more Knowledge in that Subject and Manners, he ſhould not ſay any Thing further, than obſerve in reading his Treatiſe, I ſhould find upon the leaſt Reflection, that thoſe States were free and abſolute Powers, made ſuch Emiſſions on Exigencies, and ſome of them with unjuſt Views; and as often as they came juſtly to themſelves, they had abſolute Power to redreſs thoſe Grievances; whereas this Province, is a dependant Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on their Mother Country, can't make ſumptuary Laws, or ſuch as may extricate them out of their preſent Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, nor uſe Spunges to wipe away old Debts. And further remarked that the Author in drawing out of the Province, all this <hi>corrupted Blood,</hi> meaning Paper Currency, does not inject better in the room. It's eaſy to ſay Silver and Gold will be the Medium, but he does not inform the Publick how to effect it.</p>
            <p>He finally obſerved to me, that however the Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf in his Writing to have the real Intereſt of this Province at Heart, he had alſo at the ſame Time a little of his own, for he had ſeveral Mortgages &amp; Bonds to be paid in Silver, or Province Bills, and if no Province Bills remain, then he receives Silver for a Loan perhaps of <hi>Rhode Iſland, New-Hampſhire,</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> Bills of Credit.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman having finiſhed what he had to ſay on that Head, proceeded to ſhew a further Inſtance of publick Uſe and Juſtice that muſt reſult from the aforeſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which was to ſcreen the induſtrious who wanted a Medium to go to Work, from being eat up by the griping Uſurer: and what exorbitant Intereſt is daily taken; the Gentleman was pleaſed to mention ſeveral Inſtances; and alſo one of a new Cut, where a very conſiderable Merchant in <hi>Boſton,</hi> upon the Emiſſions of Merchants Notes (ſo called) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

him, redeemable upon paying the like Sum in Merchants Notes, or Silver at <hi>nineteen Shillings</hi> per Ounce: and withal ſaid, there might be enumerated ſeveral ſuch devouring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; whereas the ninth Article of the Manufactury Scheme, will be annually rooting out this pernicious Weed, till the Publick will be effectually cleared of it.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, the Gentleman took Notice, the Deſign of the Committee was laudable, and not baſe, as by ſome branded. And as he had accounted for the publick Juſtice and Uſefulneſs of the Deſign he would not entertain me with a Vindication of the Regulations preſcribed for the eſtabliſhing and governing of the Company moſt of them being ſuch as are in the Frame of other Companys, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would patiently wait to hear and anſwer ſuch Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as I ſhould raiſe, either againſt the eſſential or material Parts of the Projection, or the Rules preſcribed for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof. I thanked the Cammittee for their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and ingenious Treatment, and obſerved in Juſtice to my Principals, and to the Weight of the Deſign, I muſt take a reaſonable Time to conſider and digeſt what I had heard, which may give riſe to Objections that now do not occur, and accordingly took my Leave of them, with an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of attending them once more before I wrote to my Employers.</p>
            <p>I muſt acknowlege I was pleaſed with this Interview, and the Gentleman's Addreſs and Reaſoning ſeemed to gain prodigiouſly on me, but ſtill jealous of Impoſition, I tho't it adviſeable to reſort back to my Minutes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Objections, I had before taken, conſider them, and ſuch others as may appear to me proper, with what I had heard from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee; and after a few Days devoted for this ſpecial Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and having methodized all the material Objections, I waited again on the Committee, who were pleaſed to aſſign another of them to hear and anſwer me</p>
            <p>And firſt, I obſerv'd, in my Opinion the Scheme oug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to comprehend in their enumerated Commodities, Por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Grain, Oil and Whalebone.</p>
            <p>To this the Gentleman candidly acknowledged Oil and Whalebone eſcaped them; Pork and Grain the Committee
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004541_0009_100D6510CA2273B0"/>
thought of, but being periſhable and waſting Commodities, they thought proper not to enumerate them; however, if agreeable to the Publick the Enumeration ſhall take them in; for to be ſure they will conſiderably contribute to the Credit and Circulation of the Company's Bills.</p>
            <p>A further Objection I made, that theſe Bills will not gain a Currency, eſpecially when oppoſed by almoſt all the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Part of the Province, and the Gentlemen of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee without any Reflection, can't by their Scituation in Life afford any additional Weight to them, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Subſcribers are Perſons that carry on little other Buſineſs than that of Husbandry, and conſequently incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated to force a Currency of them.</p>
            <p>To which the Gentleman anſwered, that there were ſome Traders and Perſons that carry on a conſiderable Stroke of Buſineſs, that had already ſubſcribed, and in Caſe the Great and General Court ſhould decline any Interpoſition, a great Number of ſuch will ſubſcribe; neither are the Subſcribers ſo inſignificant and impotent as a Set of Gentlemen would repreſent them. It's ſuppoſed there will be about One Thouſand Subſcribers, who in their Station of Life muſt have an Intercourſe of Buſineſs or Dealing interwoven with Ten Thouſand more; and ſuch a Society of Men in the intercourſe of their Buſineſs, will of neceſſity give Bills e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, on Security ſuperiour to that of all others, a Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and ſuch have already ſubſcribed &amp; will ſubſcribe, who are by their Scituation and Mode of Living, better qualified to give theſe Manufactury Bills Credit, than even thoſe Merchants, who pretend not to receive them; for the Province would perhaps ſubſiſt as well, if not better, if all thoſe Merchants deſerted it, and the Towns ſent the Production of their Induſtry to foreign Markets themſelves. <hi>Marblehead</hi> has herein ſhewn an Example worthy an Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and a few more ſuch free ſpirited Towns, will humble thoſe Gentlemen who vainly think there can't be a Medium without their particular Fiat. Beſides, the enumerated Commodities as brought into the Treaſury, being to be Sold for the Company Bills, and no other Payments to be received, and ſuch Bills as are daily paid into the Treaſury,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004541_0010_100D651284BEFF10"/>
being again let out at 6 per Cent to ſuch as are not of the Company, muſt of neceſſity ſtill promote the Circulation.</p>
            <p>He further added, that if I would inquire how and by whom <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> laſt Emiſſion, in defiance of this Government, and maugre all theſe Merchants could do, gain'd a Currency; and what Trumpery now paſſes at the Eaſtward; and then judge, whether theſe Bills ſo well founded and productive of ſuch Manufactures, at this Time can poſſibly fail of Credit; and why theſe Merchants ſhould refuſe receiving theſe Bills, is ſurprizing. Is not the Bottom of the one much better than the other? Is not the certainty of the Payment of one, to the Poſſeſſor ſurer than the other? Who knows what that Government may do, when preſſed, either by protracting Payment <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> or making an Act like a Spunge to wipe them all away? Surely theſe proteſting Merchants muſt have in View that the People of this Province, of neceſſity muſt reſort to neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Colonies for a Medium, which is to the great Scandal and Ruin of the Province, or embrace Schemes by them projected, not for the good of the People, but of themſelves and their Employers at Home; and is no more than what might be fairly collected from their own Words. And he affirmed in Caſe of an Emiſſion, theſe Merchants who are always governed by their Intereſt, will gladly take them. For it's notoriouſly known there are for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, as few Bills of any Emiſſion, in their Compting-Houſes, as in the Houſes of ſeveral of the Subſcribers.</p>
            <p>From this I proceeded to give the Gentleman a further Objection, by asking him, as a twentieth Part of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal was annually paid in, why the Company did not pay to the Poſſeſſor a twentieth Part of the Bills?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer to it was ſhortly this; There was no Neceſſity for that, when the Poſſeſſor (as the Bills are in Credit) may daily purchaſe the Commodities he wants with them, and finally the Promiſe on the Face of the Bills, after the Expiration of twenty Years, obliges the Company to pay the Poſſeſſor for the ſame in the enumerated Commodities as cheap as if purchaſed with Silver at 6s. &amp; 8d per Ounce, Penny for Penny. And beſides, what anual Payments are
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004541_0011_100D651433BF44C8"/>
made to the Poſſeſſor by the Publick on any of the publick Bills of Credit?</p>
            <p>Another Objection I thought worthy of the Committee's Obſervation was. That the printed Scheme had not aſſign'd certain particular Times, annually for the fixing or regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Prizes of ſuch of the enumerated Manufactures, as ſhall be brought to the Company's Treaſury, but ſeemed abſolutely to leave it in the Power of the Directors and Treaſurer, to have the Countryman's Goods at their own Price, or not at all.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to which it was ſaid, that it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dangerous at certain particular Times annually to aſcertain the Prizes of ſuch Manufactures, for all Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities riſe and fall, according to the Scarcity or Glut of them, and as they are in Demand. And if the Prices ſhould be regulated for a certain time, till the Time for regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them comes again, it may frequently ſo happen in the interſpace of Time, that the Scarcity or Plenty of the Commodity, and the Demand of it, may vaſtly alter the Price from ſuch Regulation; however, what fully ſilences this Objection, the Committee have agreed alſo to alter their Sheme in this Particular, namely for encouraging the Induſtrious Man, to bring his Manufactures to the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's Treaſury, the Treaſurer ſhall give <hi>one per Cent.</hi> more than the Market Price for them; and that the Buyer may be induced to deal with the Company, the Treaſurer is to ſell the ſame at <hi>one per Cent.</hi> leſs than the Market Price, and the ſaid Loſs of <hi>two per Cent.</hi> to be born by the Company. This Emendation I acknowledge greatly pleaſed me, being perſwaded it will be no ſmall additional Credit and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Company.</p>
            <p>And now thus ſatisfied with the publick Uſefulneſs and Juſtice of the Projection, and the indiſpenſible Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in our preſent Circumſtances, of ſome immediate Expedient: I inform'd the Committee I ſhould not take up any more of their Time, about the Conſideration of the Rules preſcribed for the governing the Company, taking for granted they are in general ſuch as are eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004541_0012_100D65180C73E590"/>
in the Government of other Banks, as far as the Nature of the Caſe will admit; but I ſhould at large write to my Employers, and give them an impartial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all my Proceedings in Reſpect to the Truſt they repoſed in me; and to convince the Committee of the Senſe I have of their publick Service, they might depend my Friends and my Self will be Subſcribers as ſoon as the preſent injunction of the General Court is removed.</p>
            <p>And thus my good Friends I hope from this Narration, my Conduct will be ſatisfactory; and that as an Evidence of your Approbation, you will on your Part make good my Engagement to the Committee, and promote ſo laudable an Undertaking.</p>
