            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>IF it be true, fellow citizens, that liberty is worth preſerving: that poſterity deſerves our care; and that abuſes in government, are more eaſily ſubdued in their infancy, than when time has matured their ſtrength and conſecrated their exiſtence; then the ſubjects to which we now call your attention, will ſpeak their own propriety, and ſufficiently diſplay their own importance.</p>
            <p>We addreſs you in the name, and by the order of a ſociety, whoſe members have been ſelected from your boſoms, and in the various walks of private and public life, have hitherto poſſeſſed, and, it is hoped, ſtill continue to deſerve your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: to whom you have committed the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant duties of watching over your intereſts, and repreſenting your perſons, in the legiſlature of your country; and who would, therefore, be equally ungrateful for your favors, and faithleſs to their truſt, were they to remain in ſilence, when they conceive your rights to be enfringed, and your liberties in danger.</p>
            <p>Actuated by conſiderations like theſe, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, from ſome facts within their knowledge, the repreſentation in this ſtate to be unequal and unjuſt, the individuals who compoſe this ſociety, applied themſelves with attention and care, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the ſubject. They were ſtrongly impreſſed with its importance. They viewed repreſentation
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:027092_0003_0FD33A49EE6C56A0"/>
as the key ſtone of liberty. They ſought with di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligence, every ſource of information; took pains to aſcertain facts and inveſtigate principles; and found, to their aſtoniſhment, that in this ſtate, which calls itſelf free; in this ſtate, which even glories in the name of liberty, four fifths of the people are governed by one fifth. They found that the three lower diſtricts, which contain only 28,694 white inhabitants, have a much greater number of repreſentatives, in both branches of the legiſlature, than the ſix upper ones, whoſe numbers amount to 120 902. That Charleſton diſtrict alone, whoſe number of white inhabitants is only 15,452, leſs than one ninth of the free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the ſtate, elects more than one third of the whole legiſlature. That Beaufort diſtrict, the free inhabitants of which are but 4,364, ſends as many members as Ninety-ſix, which contains 33 674 white perſons. That Saint Stephen's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, with 226 white inhabitants, of all ages and ſexes, has as many repreſentatives as Edgefield county, which can ſend 2,000 freemen into the field for the defence of their country. That the three upper diſtricts of Ninety-ſix, Waſhington, and Pinckney, whoſe whole number of free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is 74,163, nearly two thirds of the ſtate, elect only thirty five members for both houſes; but one fourth of the legiſlature, which conſiſts of 161 perſons, and not as many, by one half, as Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton diſtrict ſends, whoſe members amount to 61 though its number of white inhabitants is only 15 452. That, conſequently, the diſtrict of Charleſton has twice as much power in all legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive acts, as the three back country diſtricts put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though they contain more than four times its number of free inhabitants. In fine, that the ſix upper diſtricts, which, by their numbers, are
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:027092_0004_0FD33A4CE8ED0148"/>
entitled to four fifths of the whole repreſentation, poſſeſs, in fact, conſiderably leſs than one half, and are completely under the dominion of the people below.</p>
            <p>Having aſcertained theſe intereſting facts, they next turned their attention to the principles of free government, and enquired whether property ought to influence repreſentation. They were ſpeedily led to the following concluſions, which they regard as fundamental and ſelf-evident truths, fit to be engraven on the heart, and implicitly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed in the conduct, of every freeman. That equality is the natural condition of man; the baſis of his moral excellence, and political happineſs. That although <hi>"equality of conditions"</hi> cannot be preſerved in ſociety, <hi>"equality of rights"</hi> is not only conſiſtent with good government, but forms its only firm and laſting foundation. That to ſuffer property to be directly repreſented, would deſtroy this equality, by giving rich men different and more numerous political rights than their neighbours, whoſe maſters they would thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. That in the origin of ſociety, when that mutual contract, on which all lawful government reſts, was formed, all the contracting parties, that is all the people, were equal, and ſtipulated to continue ſo: each individual having, in order to obtain the protection of the reſt, agreed to ſubject himſelf, not to any other individual or ſet of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, but to the whole community. That all ſuperiority of rights, which ſome individuals in ſociety have ſince obtained over others, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be conſidered as unjuſt uſurpations, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of liberty and fit to be aboliſhed. And, finally, that wealth need not be repreſented for its own protection, ſince it will always have power enough, by the influence which it beſtows, to
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:027092_0005_0FD33A4E5E2197B0"/>
protect itſelf; and ſince the repreſentatives, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever choſen, will always be poſſeſſed of more or leſs property, and therefore ſufficiently attentive to its preſervation.</p>
            <p>But having often heard attempts made to juſtify the inequality of our repreſentation by the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or riches of the lower country, they ſet themſelves next to enquire, whether, even admitting that wealth ought to be conſidered in repreſentation, the ſuperiority is ſo great as to juſtify the exiſting inequality. They found that it is not: that the lower country poſſeſſes only three times the moſt wealth; while the upper country has five times the moſt inhabitants; conſequently, that on a joint proportion of wealth and numbers, the principle contended for below, the upper country ought to have the moſt repreſentatives, in proportion of five to three; inſtead of which it has much the feweſt: only 54 repreſentatives and 17 ſenators; while the lower country has 70 repreſentatives and 20 ſenators.</p>
            <p>They ſaw this inequality, already ſo enormous, becoming daily greater and more formidable, by the rapid increaſe of population and wealth in the upper diſtricts; and foreſeeing the period, not a very remote one, when this ſtate, ſhould the preſent ſyſtem remain, muſt be governed by one twentieth of its inhabitants, they could no longer remain in ſilence.</p>
            <p>Their firſt ſtep was to explain, prove, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate all theſe important points, in a ſeries of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, addreſſed to the citizens of this ſtate, a copy of which is ſubjoined to this paper, and the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and attentive peruſal whereof they earneſtly recommend. In theſe letters it was their aim to compriſe all neceſſary information on the ſubject, in the ſmalleſt poſſible compaſs; and to treat it in
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:027092_0006_0FD33A4FEAF1F908"/>
a manner the moſt clear and conciſe. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves to your underſtandings, not your paſſions; and wiſh to inform and convince, not to inflame. When made acquainted with your rights and your preſent ſituation, it will be with you to decide, whether you will remain as you are, or take ſteps for a reform: whether you will ſuffer this evil to ſtrike deeper and deeper into your government, and deſtroy the liberties of your poſterity, perhaps your own, or root it out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, before it ſhall become, by age, too ſtrong for your efforts. Should the latter be your determination, this ſociety offers you its aſſiſtance. There were two objects in its inſtitution; firſt, to give you the requiſite information on theſe ſubjects ſo intereſting to your welfare; ſecondly, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and aid you in any meaſures which you may think proper to adopt for promoting a reform. To theſe ends, it has appointed a general commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of correſpondence, the ſame that now addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es you, and a ſpecial committee in each county, compoſed of perſons whom you know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in. Theſe ſpecial committees are furniſhed with the rules, regulations, and proceedings of the ſociety, which are to be held open for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and will fully explain the objects and nature of the aſſociation, and the principles of its members. We invite you to join it; for which nothing more is neceſſary than to ſign the rules and reſolves. We would alſo ſubmit to you the propriety of forming ſimular aſſociations in your reſpective counties, which may form branches of the general aſſociation at Columbia. Should you think this a proper meaſure, our committees will give their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Thus a communication of ſentiment will be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed throughout the ſtate; and whatever meaſures you may think proper to adopt, will have all the weight of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic opinion unanimouſly expreſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:027092_0007_0FD33A516484CCF8"/>What theſe meaſures ought to be, fellow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> a matter of ſerious and important conſideration. Weigh them well; and however decidedly you may adopt them, with whatever firmneſs they may be ſupported; they ought to be moderate and regular; ſuch as the laws will fully juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, and good citizens need never bluſh to have purſued. The power of redreſſing the wrongs of which you complain, has been placed by the conſtitution in the hands of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature. To the legiſlature therefore you ought to apply for redreſs. Approach that reſpectable body with a def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference due to its ſtation and an unanimity becoming your cauſe, and you will be heard. Rely on the juſtice of your fellow citizens below; numbers of whom are probably ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of your claims, and want only to hear them ſtated, in order to accede to them. Petition; and let your petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſpeak a manly, frank, and firm, but a moderate and reſpectful language. Repreſent your grievances; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them with clearneſs and candour: urge your wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with dutiful modeſty; and reſt aſſured that you will not urge them in vain. Our committees have it in charge to aſſiſt you in drawing up and circulating petitions; and we, on our part, promiſe our exertions in bringing them before the legiſlature, and ſupporting them in ſuch a manner is, we truſt, will not be unworthy of the cauſe. Attempts we know have been unſucceſsfully made to obtain from the legiſlature a partial redreſs of theſe abuſes; but this ill-ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, we are perſuaded, was occaſioned by an opinion in that body that the people in general did not wiſh for a change. Refute this opinion by the unanimity of your meaſures. Convince the repreſentatives of the people, that the people deſire a reform; and a reform will take place. For we have too much reliance on the juſtice, the patriotiſm, and the prudence of thoſe who compoſe the legiſlature of this country, to believe that they will, on any occaſion, much leſs on one of ſuch importance as this, ſhut their care to the well founded and general complaints of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents and fellow citizens, when properly expreſſed and made known to them.</p>

               <p>IT is a truth my fellow citizens, not ſo obvious as important, that a government may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times poſſeſs the form of freedom, without the ſubſtance.

               <p>Examples of theſe truths moſt frequently occur in repreſentative governments, which being of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry complicated ſtructure, require the moſt exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of parts, and are thrown into diſorder by the ſmalleſt derangement. We are ſtruck by the beauty of the machine; we admire the variety and apparent aptneſs of its parts; but we overlook, or diſregard ſome ſeemingly minute defects, which frequently, but ſometimes too late, command our attention, by their deſtructive conſequences.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027092_0009_0FD33A559829AF28"/>
It is now univerſally admitted, that the ſupreme power reſides in the whole people. In the exerciſe of this power, all are equal. For when men enter into ſociety, they enter with equal rights; and the portion of independence which each gives up, is relinquiſhed to the whole community, not to any of its ſeperate members. No indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual can be bound, except by the will of all. This will muſt be declared by a majority; in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which; every individual has a right to give his vote; otherwiſe he would be a ſubject of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, not one of its members. When his vote is given, it has as much weight as that of any other member of the ſociety. Hence, in the ancient republics, when the ſpirit of liberty was ſtrong, but the ſcience of government not far advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its firſt principles, all the citizens had a right to aſſemble, and deliberate in common, on public meaſures. This was called popular government.</p>
               <p>But in large ſocieties, it is impoſſible to convene all the members: even in ſmall ones, it cannot be done without great inconvenience: and ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies have ever been found an unfailing ſource of public calamities. A method was therefore contrived, of aſſembling the people by repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The territory which belong to a ſtate, was divided into diſtricts, or the inhabitants into claſſes; and a number of repreſentatives were choſen, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to one or the other, and ſometimes, to both of theſe diviſions. The ſupreme power, or certain portions of it, was delegated to thoſe repreſentatives, who, in the name of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents, carried on the government. Thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative governments were founded.</p>
               <p>Hence it is evident that a repreſentative govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be free, unleſs it be ſo conſtituted,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027092_0010_0FD33A56C00514C8"/>
that each member of the community may poſſeſs, by his repreſentative, the ſame portion of power, in public affairs, that he would have been entitled to himſelf, had the government been adminiſtered by all the people in perſon. In the latter caſe, all would be equal; becauſe each member would have a right to vote; and one man's vote would count as much as another's. All, therefore, ſhould be equal by repreſentation. Liberty is deſtroyed, if each individual has not as much power, by the laws, over any other, as that other has over him. If the ſtate be divided into diſtricts, equal in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, and ſome ſend more repreſentatives than others, the government is not free; for the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of thoſe diſtricts, which ſend the feweſt repreſentatives, have leſs power than their fellow citizens, and are in a greater or leſs degree govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. Still farther will liberty be baniſhed, if ſome diſtricts have fewer inhabitants than others, and yet chooſe a greater number of repreſentatives. But if a caſe ſhould occur, in which a few ſmall diſtricts, thinly populated, ſend more repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives than all the others of which the ſtate is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, though much more extenſive, and fuller of inhabitants, then the government, whatever may be its appearance and external form, is a perfect ariſtocracy. The very definition of ariſtocracy, is a community, where a ſmall part of the people have the power of making laws to bind the reſt. This ſmall part may exerciſe its power in perſon or by repreſentatives; but the government is ſtill the ſame. A ſtate in which one fifth of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can make laws to bind the other four fifths, cannot be free. It may be a mild ariſtocracy; from particular circumſtances it may long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo: but it is an ariſtocracy ſtill; and ſooner or
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027092_0011_0FD33A5934EB7858"/>
later, will produce all the bitter fruits of that hateful and pernicious weed.</p>
               <p>Since then my fellow citizens, a repreſentative government requires ſuch nicety in its conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and may be ſo eaſily perverted; ſince liberty may be deſtroyed by ſuch ſmall deviations from principle; ſurely it is an object deſerving the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of enlightened patriotiſm, to enquire, whether ſome abuſe has not crept into our ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.—Such an enquiry I propoſe to undertake; it will be carried on through a ſeries of letters, in which the following points will be diſcuſſed: 1. Whether on the principle of numbers, the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of South-Carolina are equally repreſented in the ſtate government? 2. Whether property ought to influence repreſentation? 3. Whether our repreſentation is equal on the principle of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty rightly underſtood? 4. If an inequality ſhould be found to exiſt, how it was introduced? 5. What is the peculiar nature of this inequality? And laſtly, what are its effects on liberty?</p>
               <p>Let not this enquiry be conſidered as uſeleſs. I know, that under our preſent form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatever may be its effects, we enjoy a great portion of liberty and equality. But preſent health is perfectly conſiſtent with the ſeeds of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Preventive medicines are beſt. And the ſureſt method of perpetuating the bleſſings of a ſyſtem, is to find out and remove its imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>THE firſt object propoſed for enquiry, is, whether the citizens of this ſtate enjoy, in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027092_0012_0FD33A5B1E8F6CE0"/>
the ſtate government, an equal repreſentation, on the principle of numbers? Here our ſureſt guide will be the cenſus, and the liſt of repreſentatives, as ſettled by the conſtitution. By comparing them, the queſtion may be decided with eaſe and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
               <p>The ſtate may be conſidered under a threefold diviſion: firſt, into upper and lower country; ſecondly into diſtricts; and thirdly into counties and pariſhes. The lower country extends along the coaſt, from Georgia to North-Carolina, and about fifty or ſixty miles back from the ſea. It includes the diſtricts of Georgetown, Beaufort and Charleſton, and is divided into pariſhes. The upper country takes in the reſt of the ſtate, to the borders of North-Carolina, and the Indian boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary. It contains the diſtricts of Orangeburgh, Camden, Cheraw, Ninety-ſix, Pinckney, and Waſhington, which are ſubdivided into counties.</p>
               <p>Charleſton diſtrict conſiſts of the following pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes: Saint Michael's and Saint Phillip's, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Charleſton, and containing 8,089 white inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; Saint Bartholomew 2,133; Saint John's, Berkley 692; Saint George's, Dorcheſter 1,252; Saint Stephen's 226, Saint James' Santee 437; Saint Thomas' 397; Chriſt Church 566; Saint James's, Gooſe creek 439; Saint John's, Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton 585; Saint Andrew's 370; and Saint Paul's 276. This gives Charleſton diſtrict 15,452 white inhabitants. That diſtrict ſends 48 repreſentatives, 15 from Saint Michael's and Saint Phillip's, and three from each of its other pariſhes: it has alſo 13 ſenators.</p>
               <p>Beaufort diſtrict includes 4 pariſhes; Saint Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Saint Lukes, Prince William, and Saint Peter's. Its number of white inhabitants is 4,364; and it
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027092_0013_0FD33A5D1290BB38"/>
ſends 12 repreſentatives; 3 from each pariſh: it has four ſenators.</p>
               <p>Georgetown diſtrict conſiſts of 3 pariſhes; Prince Georges, All-Saints, and Prince Frederics; containing together, 8,878 white inhabitants; It ſends ten repreſentatives and three ſenators.</p>
               <p>The white inhabitants of the lower country, therefore, amount to 28,694; its number of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives is ſeventy; and it has twenty ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>The diſtrict of Ninety-ſix has four counties; Edgefield, containing 9,785 white inhabitants, Abbeville 7,495, Laurens 8,210, and Newberry 8,186; Ninety-ſix diſtrict then has 33,674 white inhabitants; and its number of repreſentatives is twelve, three for each county; it has four ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The ſame number of both, with Beaufort diſtrict, which contains only 4,364 white inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants; leſs than one ſeventh of the number in Ninety-ſix. Hence it is plain that one free man in Beaufort diſtrict, has as much power in our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as ſeven free men in Ninety-ſix.</p>
               <p>Charleſton diſtrict contains 15,452 white inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; Ninety-ſix, 33,674; more than double; yet Ninety-ſix diſtrict ſends twelve members to the houſe of repreſentatives, and Charleſton forty-eight, exactly four times as many. A free man, in Charleſton diſtrict, therefore, has eight times as much influence in the houſe of repreſentatives, as a free man in Ninety-ſix. In the ſenate, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion is not quite ſo great. Ninety-ſix has four members, and Charleſton diſtrict thirteen; ſomething more than three times the number; ſo that, in the ſenate, a free man of Charleſton has only ſix times as much power as one of Ninety-ſix.</p>
               <p>Waſhington diſtrict is compoſed of two coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027092_0014_0FD33A5E13FB2C60"/>
Pendleton and Greenville; the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 8,731 white inhabitants; the latter 5,888; in all 14 619; within leſs than a thouſand of the numbers in Charleſton diſtrict, which are 15,452; yet Waſhington ſends five members to the houſe of repreſentatives, and two ſenators. Charleſton ſends forty eight to the former, and thirteen to the latter; more than eight times the number ſent by Waſhington.</p>
               <p>Pinckney diſtrict contains four counties: Union, which has 6,430 white inhabitants; Spartanburgh 7,907; York 5,652; and Cheſter 5881; amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the whole, to 25,870. Each of thoſe counties ſends two members to the houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, except York, which has three; this makes 9 in all. 25,870 inhabitants in Pinckney, ſend 9 members to the houſe of repreſentatives. Four thouſand three hundred and ſixty four in Beaufort, ſend twelve; and in Charleſton fifteen thouſand four hundred and fifty-two, ſend forty-eight; ſo that a free man in Charleſton or Beaufort diſtricts, has at the leaſt ſeven times as much pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the government, as a free man in Pinckney. This diſtrict ſends three ſenators, Charleſton thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and Beaufort four.</p>
               <p>In Camden diſtrict there were five counties, at the time of the cenſus: Fairfield, Richland, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon, Claremont, and Lancaſter. A new one, Kerſhaw, has lately been erected. Fairfield has five thouſand one hundred and thirty-eight white inhabitants; Richland two thouſand four hundred and ſeventy-nine; Clarendon one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety; Claremont two thouſand four hundred and thirty-eight; and Lancaſter four thouſand eight hundred and ſixty-four. This is the enumeration by the cenſus; but it is thought to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027092_0015_0FD33A6094E457C8"/>
be much too low. It gives Camden, however, ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand ſeven hundred and nine white inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; above one thouſand more than Charleſton diſtrict contains; yet Camden diſtrict ſends but twelve members to the houſe of repreſentatives; two for each of the above-mentioned five counties, and two for Kerſhaw; whereas, Charleſton ſends forty-eight; juſt four times the number. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion in ſenators is ſtill greater; Camden ſends but three, and Charleſton thirteen.</p>
               <p>Orangeburgh diſtrict, contains 12,412 white in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and it ſends ten members to the houſe of repreſentatives, and three ſenators. Beaufort has 4,364 inhabitants, ſomething more than one third of the numbers of Orangeburgh, and it elects twelve repreſentatives and four ſenators. Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton has 15,452 white inhabitants; about 3000 more than Orangeburgh, and yet it elects very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly five times as many repreſentatives, and more than four times the number of ſenators.</p>
               <p>In the diſtrict of Cheraw there are 7,618 white inhabitants; it ſends ſix members to the houſe of repreſentatives, and two ſenators.</p>
               <p>Throwing the diſtricts of Ninety-ſix, Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, Pinckney, Camden, Orangeburgh, and Cheraw, into the upper country diviſion, it is found to contain 120,902 white inhabitants; it ſends 54 members to the houſe of repreſentatives, and 17 ſenators. The lower country, including the three diſtricts of Charleſton, Beaufort and Georgetown, contains 28,694 white inhabitants, and it elects 70 repreſentatives and twenty ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Divide 149,596, the whole number in the ſtate by 28,694, thoſe of the lower country, and the reſult will be more that five, from whence it appears, that a large majority of both branches of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027092_0016_0FD33A62AC457348"/>
the legiſlature, is elected by leſs than one fifth of the people. This one fifth therefore governs the other four fifths, and the ſtate is an ariſtocracy. 28,000 citizens by their repreſentatives, can make laws to bind 120,000, without their conſent.</p>
               <p>If you take away Georgetown diſtrict from the lower country, ſtill the two remaining ones, Charleſton and Beaufort will have ſixty repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and 17 ſenators, a greater number of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives and as many ſenators as the whole upper country together, which has only fifty-four of the firſt and ſeventeen of the latter: and if you add Georgetown diſtrict to the upper country diviſion, the latter will even then have but a very ſmall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority; ſixty-four repreſentatives to ſixty, and twenty ſenators to ſeventeen.</p>
               <p>Thus the two diſtricts of Charleſton and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which contain but 19,866 white inhabitants, not more than one ſixth of our whole numbers, can nevertheleſs, with the addition of three repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives and two ſenators from the other diſtricts, govern the whole ſtate—can make laws, raiſe tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, appoint officers of government, and exerciſe all other functions of ſupreme power over the other five ſixths, how much ſoever they may be oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the meaſures adopted, or how firmly ſoever oppoſed to them. Such a government may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed with the form of freedom, but it would be difficult to prove that it poſſeſſes the ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>The whole ſtate contains 149,596 white inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. Of this number 15,452 not quite one ninth, reſide in Charleſton diſtrict, the houſe of repreſentatives conſiſts of 124 members, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of thirty-ſeven; of theſe Charleſton diſtrict elects forty-eight repreſentatives and thirteen ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators. Conſequently Charleſton diſtrict, with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027092_0017_0FD33A64CFE14AD8"/>
leſs than one ninth of the inhabitants in the ſtate, elects more than a third of the legiſlature. It ſends very nearly as many members to both houſes, as all the upper country together, though it has not one ſixth of the numbers. Charleſton diſtrict has 15,452 white inhabitants, forty-eight repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and thirteen ſenators. The ſix upper coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try diſtricts have 120,902 white inhabitants, fifty-four repreſentatives, and ſeventeen ſenators. So that in all legiſlative queſtions 15,452 citizens, who happen to reſide in Charleſton diſtrict, have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a very little, as much power in the government as 120,902 who inhabit other parts of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>Here the greater number is evidently ſubjected to the power of the ſmaller, and a much ſmaller too; which is the moſt exact definition that can be given of an ariſtocracy.</p>
               <p>If we compare particular pariſhes in the lower with particular counties in the upper country, the inequality of repreſentation will ſtrike us ſtill more forcibly. Thus, for inſtance, Saint Paul's pariſh, in Charleſton diſtrict, contains two hundred and ſeventy-ſix white inhabitants, and this pariſh ſends three repreſentatives and one ſenator. Edgefield county, in Ninety-ſix diſtrict, has 9,785 white in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. It alſo ſends three repreſentatives and one ſenator. The county has above thirty-nine times as many white inhabitants as the pariſh. Yet they ſend an equal number of members to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature. Conſequently, one freeman in Saint Paul's pariſh, has more influence in the government than thirty-nine freemen in Edgefield county.</p>
               <p>Pendleton county, in Waſhington diſtrict, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 8,731 white inhabitants. The pariſh of St. Stephen's, in Charleſton diſtrict, 226; Saint Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen's pariſh ſends three repreſentatives and one
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027092_0018_0FD33A69F660E600"/>
ſenator. Pendleton county the ſame number of each. It follows that one freeman in this pariſh, has as much power in the goverment, as thirty-eight freemen in Pendleton county.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the moſt populous counties in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per country. And Saint Stephen's and Saint Paul's are the leaſt populous pariſhes below; they were choſen to make the contraſt more ſtriking. But in many other inſtances, the diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween numbers and repreſentation, is nearly as great; in all it is very conſiderable.</p>
               <p>From all this, it appears, that the citizens of South-Carolina, are very far from being equally repreſented in the ſtate government on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of numbers. On the contrary, it is evident, that a conſiderable majority of the legiſlature is elected by leſs than one fifth of the people; which one fifth conſequently governs the other four fifths. In the next number I ſhall proceed to enquire, whether any other principle, than that of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ought to be admitted in the apportionment of repreſentation.</p>

               <p>THE order of my ſubject leads me next to enquire, whether repreſentation ought to be affected by wealth?</p>
               <p>It is admitted by all, that the lower country contains far more wealth, in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, than the upper coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Should it appear that property ought to be regarded in apportioning the repreſentation, a great part of the inequality, which exiſts in our government, might be juſtified on that principle.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027092_0019_0FD33A6BE3E06708"/>
But I apprehend that a very little conſideration of the ſubject will be ſufficient to convince us, that no principle can be more void of foundation, or lead to more deſtructive conſequences.</p>
               <p>Society is prior to property. In a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture each individual poſſeſſes what he can enjoy at the time, and no more. When he goes out of his cave another comes into it with as good a right as his predeceſſor, and in his turn is ſucceeded by a third occupant, who holds by the ſame title as the former. If he ſhould find a fruit tree, he claims a right to as much fruit as he can pluck and carry away. The reſt remains ſo the next comer. In a ſtate like this no property can be accumulated. The ſingle efforts of one individual can do nothing more than ſupply his own immediate wants: and when a number of ſuch individuals aſſemble for mutual defence, or from any other motives, no one brings into the community more than his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſtrength and labour. All are equal in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and rights; and for a conſiderable time whatever they acquire continues to be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. At length, however, as ſociety advances, and the underſtandings of men are improved by longer experience, it is diſcovered, that in order to encourage induſtry and enterprize, each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual muſt be ſecured, in the ſeparate enjoyment of what he can procure, by his labour or inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity. Hence rules are made for the ſecurity of property. Wealth encreaſes by the united efforts of a ſociety, whoſe members mutually aid each other, while each is purſuing his own advantage; and ſome being more induſtrious, more ſkilful, or more fortunate than others, accumulate to themſelves a greater portion, of what the labour of all is employed in producing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:027092_0020_0FD33A6D132682F8"/>Property then being a more creature of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and laws, can have no influence in their original formation. To deny this would be to contend that an effect might be inſtrumental in producing its cauſe, or that a plant had produced the very ſeed from which it ſprung.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, we find, that in all theſe early go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, which were formed on the principles of freedom, all the members, however different in property, talents or influence, were equal in political rights. In an aſſembly of the people at Athens, the loweſt mechanic, or labourer, had a vote. Themiſtocles, Cimon, or Pericles, had no more. And in the democratic aſſemblies at Rome, the pooreſt citizen was equal to Scipio, or Julius Caeſar in the right of ſuffrage.</p>
               <p>But repreſentative governments are ſubſtitutes for theſe popular aſſemblies, where all the citizens are convened, and each has a right to vote. As wealth gives no preference in one, it ought not to give it in the other.</p>
               <p>It is a never failing property of wealth to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate in particular hands. In all well regulated ſocieties, ſome few will be very rich, a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number in moderate circumſtances, and far the greater part comparatively poor. Suppoſe that the government remains in the hands of all the people, who aſſemble, in perſon, to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and decide upon public meaſures. If you ſay that a citizen, who poſſeſſes twice as much as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall have twice as many votes, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be free, becauſe a much ſmaller number, poſſeſſing two votes each, can govern a much greater, each of whom has but one. If you purſue the principle, a citizen who poſſeſſes ten times as much as another, muſt have ten times
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027092_0021_0FD325E2B03C7708"/>
as many votes. Suppoſe the community to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of 10,000 members; it may well happen that 1,000 of theſe will collectively poſſeſs as much wealth as the other 9,000, perhaps more. In that caſe this 1,000 will govern the community; and the ſtate will be an ariſtocracy.</p>
               <p>If the government be repreſentative, this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple will ſtill produce the ſame effect. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance mentioned above, ſuppoſe that the people, inſtead of aſſembling to vote in perſon, ſhould chooſe repreſentatives. If the 1,000 rich citizens chooſe ten times as many repreſentatives, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their numbers, as the 9000 poor ones, the former will have the greateſt number of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, and will continue to govern the whole ſtate. The only difference is, that inſtead of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in perſon, they do it by their repreſentatives. Conſequently, if wealth has any influence on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, the government cannot be free. It is further removed from liberty, in proportion as this influence becomes greater. Whenever it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo great, that a ſmall number of citizens, on account of their wealth, have more votes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in perſon or by repreſentatives, than all the others, the government is an ariſtocracy.</p>
               <p>But it is ſometimes ſaid, that property ought to have the power of protecting itſelf—That the poor being the moſt numerous in all ſocieties, would, if they had equal power in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the rich, ſacrifice theſe latter to their envy or their avarice.—And that to guard againſt this evil, property ought to be repreſented.</p>
               <p>This amounts to ſaying, in the firſt place, that every government ought to be ariſtocratic; for no community can be free, when a ſmall number of its members poſſeſſes, no matter for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027092_0022_0FD33A719A7233E0"/>
more power in the government than all the reſt together. This is evident from the principles already eſtabliſhed. If wealth muſt be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a free government cannot exiſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wealth will always acquire influence enough in every government to protect itſelf. The poſſeſſors of it commonly have a better education, more extenſive means of acquiring knowledge, and improving their talents, more leiſure for attending to public affairs, better opportunities of making friends, eſtabliſhing connections and forming parties. A rich citizen, without having more votes, or chooſing more repreſentatives than his poor neighbours, will very ſpeedily obtain ten times as much influence in the government. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of giving him more votes, you ſhould give him fewer, in order to ballance and check that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to inequality, which exiſts in every ſociety, and is its moſt dangerous ingredient. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevent one man from acquiring more wealth than others. You cannot prevent this wealth from uniting itſelf with talents, and obtaining influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But you ought to counteract this diſpoſition as much as poſſible. Strip wealth of as many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages as you can, ſtill it will have enough, and more than enough. But if in addition to its natural and inevitable influence, you give it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional power in the government; then inſtead of checking, you favor and promote the tendency of ſociety to its moſt dangerous diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, no ſociety is, or can be divided into very rich and very poor members. There will be a great variety of intermediate claſſes, riſing in regular gradation, from the loweſt to the moſt opulent. Theſe middle claſſes indeed form the bulk of every community. As they are all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027092_0023_0FD33A75F31C4A20"/>
of more or leſs property, they are all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in its preſervation; and while they enact juſt laws, for the ſecurity of their own poſſeſſions, they equally protect thoſe of the richeſt members.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, the repreſentatives, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the ſituation of their conſtituents, will always be men of more or leſs property: on ſuch the people naturally fix their choice; they will carry with them into the government, not only the feelings and views of their conſtituents, but their own alſo—this will enſure a ſufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the rights of property. Repreſentatives who poſſeſs wealth themſelves, whatever their conſtituents might do were they aſſembled in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, will never make laws for ſubjecting property to unjuſt burdens. There is more danger of their conſulting their own intereſts at the expence of their conſtituents. Thus it appears, that repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, however equal on the principle of numbers, is, in its very nature, neceſſarily conducive to the preſervation of property.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the rights of property could not be protected, without giving it a ſhare in repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there could be no occaſion for its having that ſhare in more than one branch of the legiſlature. The uſe of two houſes, or ſeperate branches, is that one may operate as a check upon the other; ſo as to prevent improper meaſures from being adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through haſte or raſhneſs. If property be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the ſenate, it will be ſecure: for no legiſlative act can be done without the ſenates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. Beſides, if property be repreſented in one branch, the perſonal rights of the people ſhould be repreſented in the other. Of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, one man's perſonal rights being as great as another's, the repreſentation, in one branch at
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027092_0024_0FD33A7792CCE590"/>
leaſt, ought to be equal on the principle of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The truth is, that it ought to be ſo in both branches; for property will always be ſecure and formidable, though you give it no conſtitutional advantages; and to allow it any is contrary to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſt principle of free government.</p>
               <p>It is further alledged, that as wealthy men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute moſt to the ſupport of government, they ought to poſſeſs the greateſt number of its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
               <p>And they do poſſeſs the greateſt number. Why does a rich man pay more to government than a poor one? Becauſe he has more to pay with. Is it not from government and laws that he derives his wealth? Do they not protect him in the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive poſſeſſion of it? What but their influence and authority prevents his riches from being ſeized by men ſtronger than he is, and who want perhaps for the ſupply of their neceſſities, what he diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates in gratifying the moſt idle, perhaps the moſt vicious appetites? Will any one affirm, that a wealthy man enjoys no greater portion of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of ſociety than a poor one? What is the reſpect and influence which riches beſtow? What are the pleaſures of affluence and eaſe? What is the power of conferring obligations, rendering ſervices, and relieving diſtreſs? Are not theſe advantages? Do not rich men enjoy them in a much higher degree than thoſe in more narrow circumſtances? and is it not perfectly reaſonable, that as they have more to pay with, and more to be protected, they ſhould pay a greater portion of the price of protection?</p>
               <p>Beſides it is not true, that the rich contribute more than the poor. All contribute equally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all pay in proportion to their poſſeſſions, that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027092_0025_0FD33A79118F9718"/>
is to their means of payment. If I poſſeſs 1000<abbr>l.</abbr> and another perſon ten thouſand, he pays 100<abbr>l.</abbr> and I pay ten. The ſum which he pays is the largeſt, but my ten pounds is as much for me, and as difficult for me to pay as his hundred, and as I pay leſs, ſo I have fewer advantages, and leſs property to be protected than he has.</p>
               <p>To ſay, that becauſe one citizen is richer than another, and in a general and equal aſſeſſment of property, pays a larger ſum towards the expence of government, he ought to poſſeſs greater po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical privileges, and more power in the enacting of laws, which are to bind both equally; amounts to ſaying, that becauſe a man is poor he ought to be a ſlave; that there ought to be no ſuch thing as a free conſtitution; in fine, that every govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be an ariſtocracy, in which the rich might domineer at pleaſure over their fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. Preſent the idea in this form, which is its true one, and it becomes too horrid to be dwelt upon; yet when diſguiſed by a little ſophiſtry, it is made one of the chief arguments to ſupport an unequal repreſentation. From all this it is evident, that property ought to have no influence on the number of repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>We are next to enquire, whether, even on the ſcale of property, the citizens of this ſtate are equally repreſented.—This will be the ſubject of the following number.</p>

               <p>IN the laſt number, my fellow citizens, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that property ought to have no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on repreſentation. We will now admit, for a moment, the contrary poſition, and enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the principle of property, rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,

the citizens of this ſtate are equally repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
               <p>Here, inſtead of the cenſus, we will take the tax returns. By comparing them with the liſt of repreſentatives and ſenators, we may quickly ſolve the queſtion.</p>
               <p>It is to be lamented, that from various cauſes, theſe returns are very inaccurate. It frequently happens, that people reſiding in one county or pariſh, poſſeſs property in others; and yet make all their returns where they live. Hence one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or county often appears to be much more rich, and another much poorer, than it is in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Property in the upper country, to a large a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, is held by people in Charleſton, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned there; ſo that the advantage of the lower country, in point of wealth, is leſs in truth than in appearance. The tax collectors who receive the returns, are ſometimes negligent; the people who make them are often inaccurate. But we have no better guides, and muſt follow theſe with all their imperfections.</p>
               <p>The pariſhes of St. Phillip's and St. Michael's, which include Charleſton, pay taxes to the amount of 10,671<abbr>l.</abbr> 13<abbr>s</abbr> 4<abbr>d.</abbr> It is however to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that many wealthy planters, whoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions are in the other pariſhes, make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in Charleſton. Theſe two pariſhes ſend 15 repreſentatives and two ſenators. Saint Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew's pays 1,566<abbr>l</abbr> 10<abbr>s</abbr> 1<abbr>d.</abbr> Saint Andrew's 1,020<abbr>l</abbr> 0<abbr>s</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> Saint Paul's, to include its two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Ediſto iſland, 2,220<abbr>l</abbr> 2<abbr>s</abbr> 3<abbr>d.</abbr> Chriſt church, 631<abbr>l</abbr> 16<abbr>s</abbr> 8<abbr>d.</abbr> Saint Stephens, 958<abbr>l</abbr> 6<abbr>s</abbr> 9<abbr>d</abbr> Saint James's, Santee, 886<abbr>l</abbr> 3<abbr>s</abbr> 11<abbr>d.</abbr> Saint James's, Gooſe creek, 295<abbr>l</abbr> 8<abbr>s</abbr> 10<abbr>d.</abbr> Saint John's, Berkley, 1,115<abbr>l</abbr> 11<abbr>s</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> Saint Thomas, 895<abbr>l</abbr> 19<abbr>s</abbr> 5<abbr>d.</abbr> Saint

The whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of their taxes is 21,473<abbr>l</abbr> 14<abbr>s</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> They ſend to the legiſlature forty-eight repreſentatives and thirteen ſenators.</p>
               <p>In Beaufort diſtrict there are four pariſhes— Saint Helena, which pays 1,114<abbr>l</abbr> 13<abbr>s</abbr> 2<abbr>d</abbr> in taxes. Prince William's, 468<abbr>l</abbr> 7<abbr>s</abbr> 5<abbr>d.</abbr> Saint Peter's, 642<abbr>l</abbr>, and Saint Luke's 767<abbr>l</abbr> 2<abbr>s</abbr> 4<abbr>d</abbr>; in all 3,022<abbr>l</abbr> 2<abbr>s</abbr> 11<abbr>d.</abbr> This diſtrict elects twelve repreſentatives and four ſenators.</p>
               <p>Georgetown diſtrict contains three pariſhes— Prince George, All Saints, and Prince Frederick.

The whole lower country, including Beaufort, Charleſton, and Georgetown diſtricts, pays 28,081<abbr>l</abbr> 5<abbr>s</abbr> 11<abbr>d.</abbr> and chooſes ſeventy repreſentatives and twenty ſenators.</p>

               <p>No body contends, that wealth alone ought to be conſidered in apportioning the repreſentation. Such a principle is too monſtrous to be endured for a moment. The moſt violent ſtickler for ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy and the preſent ſyſtem, have never ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured upon that ground. To contend for it would be to attempt the eſtabliſhment of a pure ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027092_0028_0FD33A82D33CAEC0"/>
of the rich; a deſire of which, nobody has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been found ſo ſhameleſs as to avow. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of our preſent ſyſtem, contend, that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation ought to be in a joint ratio of wealth and numbers—each diſtrict, ſay they, ſhould have a number of repreſentatives, in proportion, not to numbers alone, or to wealth alone, but to a joint proportion of wealth and numbers. That is, if one diſtrict or county has three times as many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants as the other, and that other is three times the richeſt, they ought to have an equal number of repreſentatives; becauſe, the advantage of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior numbers on one ſide, is counter-ballanced by the advantages of ſuperior wealth on the other. Let us for a moment admit, though the contrary has been clearly proved, that this is a juſt principle. Let us apply it to our preſent ſituation, and ſee what will be the reſult.</p>
               <p>The lower country, as we have already ſeen, contains 28,694 white inhabitants, and pays £. 28,081 5<abbr>s.</abbr> 10<abbr>d.</abbr> tax. The upper country con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 120,902 white inhabitants, and pays £.8,390 13<abbr>s.</abbr> 3<abbr>d.</abbr> tax. The former pays three times as much tax; the latter has five times as many free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. If the lower country exceeded the upper as much in amount of taxes, as the upper country ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds it in number of inhabitants, the proportion would be equal, and they ſhould have an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of repreſentatives. The ſuperiority of numbers on one ſide, being compenſated, in that caſe, by the advantage of wealth on the other. But the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of numbers in the upper country, five to one, greatly out-weighs the ſuperiority of tax below; which is only three to one. Conſequently, on the principle contended for, a joint proportion of wealth and numbers, the upper country ought to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027092_0029_0FD33A8453056E38"/>
exceed the lower in number of repreſentatives, in the proportion of five to three; and ſhould have at leaſt one fourth the moſt members in both hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Inſtead of which it has nearly one third the feweſt.</p>
               <p>On the principle of property therefore, in the only ſenſe in which it is or can be contended for, as well as on that of numbers, the only true one, our repreſentation, is exceedingly unequal. We are next to enquire into the origin of this inequality.</p>

               <p>IN the preceeding numbers, my fellow citizens, it has been proved, that you are not equally repreſented in the ſtate government. The ſix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diſtricts are entitled, by their ſuperior populati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to four fifths of the whole repreſentation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of which they have leſs than one half. Even the principle of property, combined with numbers, gives them a right to one third more repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives than they now elect. We are next to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the origin of this inequality.</p>
               <p>The ſea coaſt of South-Carolina was ſettled many years before the interior country had been explored. The firſt ſettlers were Europeans, who would naturally form their eſtabliſhments near the ſea. The tide flows but a very ſhort diſtance up the rivers. There are few, if any, inſtances in which it exceeds 30 miles. Conſequently naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and commerce would at firſt be confined entirely to the ſea coaſt. The country, for a conſiderable diſtance above the tides-way, is low, wet, and barren; affording no inducements to early ſettlers, and even now very thinly inhabited. For many
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:027092_0030_0FD33A867007B338"/>
years after the firſt eſtabliſhments were formed, ſome hoſtile tribes of Indians maintained their ground in the neighbuorhood of the coaſt, and prevented the new ſettlements from extending far into the interior country. All that is now called the back country, and even the middle diſtricts, were for a long time held by the ſavages; early in the ſettlements, the culture of rice was introduced, and ſoon became the great object of enterpriſe and induſtry. The only lands proper for the production of this grain, are ſituated near the ſea—wealth and population rapidly encreaſed; and all theſe circumſtances united to confine them to a few leagues along the coaſt.</p>
               <p>It was in this ſtate of the colony that its firſt government was formed. The lower country flouriſhing and wealthy; the middle either wholly unſettled, or containing a few indigent and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered inhabitants; and the more remote interior parts, now called the back country, entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, or occupied by ſavages. This government conſiſted, in part, of an aſſembly elected by the people. The elections was made by pariſhes, into a number of which the colony was divided. In this diviſion the middle country was little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the back country being almoſt or quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, was wholly over looked: inſomuch that ſome of the pariſhes extended from the ſea to the mountains, while the place of election was at the pariſh church, within a few miles from the coaſt.</p>
               <p>The few ſcattered back ſettlers, as the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants at a diſtance from the ſea were then called might come down and vote if they thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: but it never was expected, and ſeldom done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:027092_0031_0FD33A88113B06A8"/>In proceſs of time, the back country began to be peopled by emigrations from the interior parts of North-Carolina, Virginia, and Penſylvania. Some numerous ſettlements were gradually form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the rich and refined inhabitants below, either knew nothing of them, or conſidered them as hordes of rude hunters, little ſuperior to ſavages. They were of no importance in the goverment; no change was on their account made in the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The members of the legiſlature were elected by the pariſhes, and aſſembled in Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. At the ſame place the courts of juſtice were held; and if a man of Long Canes, or Paco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, was ſued, brought an action, or was indicted for an offence, he and his witneſſes were forced to attend in Charleſton.</p>
               <p>The people of the back country becoming daily more and more numerous, began to be ſenſible of their ſtrength, and loudly complained of this une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſtribution of the advantages of government. At length in the year 1769, more than 100 years after the colony was planted, they, with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, obtained an act for eſtabliſhing courts in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the country. Still they were little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in elections. A few of the moſt popular men among them ſometimes obtained ſeats, but the number was ſmall and precarious. Almoſt the whole houſe of repreſentatives was choſen by the people below. The elections were ſtill made by pariſhes; and a leading man from the back coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, had no method of getting himſelf elected, but to bring down a ſufficient number of his neighbours, to give him a majority of votes. The firſt inſtance of this happened about 30 years ago. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Long Canes, who were included in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of Saint Bartholomews, came down in a body
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027092_0032_0FD33A8C07F69AD0"/>
to an election, and put in one of their neighbours. This gentleman, the firſt inhabitant of the upper country, that ever obtained a ſeat in the legiſlature of this ſtate, is ſtill alive. So long was it before the rights of the upper country began to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
               <p>This inequality of repreſentation continued to exiſt at the revolution. The popular aſſemblies, which made the firſt regular oppoſition to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government, were elected by the pariſhes in the uſual manner. A few of the principal men in the upper country obtained ſeats; but their number was ſmall, and their influence inconſiderable. When the province at length completely threw off its dependence, and began to form a government of its own, no convention of the people was called for that purpoſe; but the aſſembly, which, till then had exerciſed the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers, paſſed an act containing a form of government. This inſtrument apportioned the number of repreſentatives in ſuch a manner, as to give the back country a ſhare greater than it had before; but ſtill very inadequate to its population. As it had however but a very ſmall number of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, and of courſe, very little power in the aſſembly which formed the ſyſtem. It was forced to ſubmit to the conditions impoſed on it, and glad to accept ſuch advantages, however ſmall, as it could obtain. Beſides it was, probably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with its own ſtrength; nor was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of numbers as great then as it has ſince become. Thus was a ſyſtem formed and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced in, which gave the three diſtricts of Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Beaufort and Georgetown, more repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives than were allotted to all the reſt of the ſtate. In the year 1789, the legiſlature reſolved to call a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027092_0033_0FD33A8ED1762378"/>
convention of the people. To reviſe and amend the conſtitution was the object of this aſſembly. When the motion for calling it was diſcuſſed in the legiſlature, ſome contended, that a conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brings back the people to the firſt principles of ſociety; according to which all are equal. That conſequently all ought to be equally repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in this convention, for which purpoſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pariſh and county ſhould be invited to chooſe a number of delegates, in exact proportion to its number of free inhabitants. Theſe principles are undeniable; but the lower country members per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that ſhould they be adopted, the upper country, by its ſuperior population, would rule the convention. They, therefore, oppoſed this ſyſtem with all their might, and their ſuperiority of numbers in the legiſlature, enſured their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. It was reſolved, that each pariſh and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould ſend the ſame number of delegates to the convention, that it ſent of members to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature: and thus the lower country preſerved the ſame ſuperiority of numbers, the ſame power over the votes, in one aſſembly, which it poſſeſſed in the other.</p>
               <p>The effects of this plan became viſible as ſoon as the convention commenced its deliberations. In every vote the lower country was found to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a deciſive majority. Conſequently no reform, however deſirable to four fifths of the people, could be made without the lower country's conſent. Some of its members joined the upper country in its attempt to remove the ſeat of government; which was effected by their aſſiſtance. But on the ſubject of repreſentation they were inflexible. An attempt was made to apportion it according to numbers, or to a joint ratio of numbers and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027092_0034_0FD33A8ED5561CC8"/>
wealth. The lower country firmly oppoſed both propoſitions. A violent conteſt enſued, in which, as uſual, the upper country was defeated. The will of four-fifths of the people, expreſſed by their repreſentatives, was prevented from taking effect, by the oppoſition of one fifth. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of repreſentatives was reduced by one-half, but the proportion remained the ſame. To a county, or pariſh, which before elected ſix repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, three were allowed. The lower coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try maintained its former ſuperiority, and one-fifth of the citizens impoſed a government on the other four-fifths.</p>
               <p>This view of the origin of our inequality in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, leads us to conſider, next, its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar nature. This enquiry will make the ſubject of the following number.</p>

               <p>HAVING in the preceeding number, explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the origin of our inequality in repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we come now, my fellow-citizens, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider its nature and properties. I fear we ſhall find them of a very alarming kind.</p>
               <p>In North-Carolina and Virginia, ſome counties are much larger than others, and yet all chooſe an equal number of repreſentatives; but there, large and ſmall counties are equally diſtributed through every part of the ſtate: and if you throw it into two grand diviſions, you cannot ſay that one has a greater portion of repreſentatives than the other, Thus the repreſentation is equal with reſpect to the whole ſtate; though unequal if eſtimated by ſingle counties or diſtricts. The ſame obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will apply to England, where about one twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027092_0035_0FD33A9057115D70"/>
of the people elects the houſe of commons. But that twentieth is equally diſtributed through every part of the kingdom. The miſchief there, is, not that ſome parts of the country are une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually repreſented; but that all are inſufficiently and improperly repreſented.</p>
               <p>But in this ſtate the inequality is confined to particular parts of the country, lying contiguous to each other. Not only a pariſh containing 300 inhabitants, elects as many repreſentatives as a country with 8,000, but a diſtrict conſiſting of ſuch pariſhes, and whoſe aggregate numbers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to only 15,452, elects four times as many repreſentatives, as another diſtrict, whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are 33,674; and three diſtricts on the ſea coaſt, containing 28,694 white inhabitants, ſend more repreſentatives, than ſix other diſtricts in the interior country, whoſe numbers amount to 120,902. Hence it is evident, that one part of the ſtate, much inferior in extent, and far more ſo in population, can govern all the other diſtricts; which conſequently, inſtead of being parts of a free government, are reduced to the condition of provinces, ſubject to a foreign power.</p>
               <p>In the next place, theſe different parts of the country differ widely from each other, in ſituation and character. In the upper country a great equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of property prevails. Below, ſome are very rich, others extremely poor; and from the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country, and mode of cultivation, carried on by ſlaves, and confined, as it is, to ſome ſmall ſpots of land, this inequality is likely to encreaſe with the encreaſe of wealth. Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of fortune leads to inequality of condition; and inequality of condition is the parent and nurſe of ariſtocracy. Superior wealth, not only,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:027092_0036_0FD33A91DF058F10"/>
is apt to beget and cheriſh a love of power and privileges, but has a ſtrong tendency to beſtow them Hence there is danger that an ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſpirit may ariſe in the low country, if it do not already exiſt there: and this is a powerful reaſon againſt ſuffering that part of the ſtate to poſſeſs an undue influence in the government. For where ariſtocracy once gains admittance, it never ceaſes to make new encroachments, 'till it has to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally rooted out the principles of liberty, of which it is the natural and implacable enemy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the upper and lower counties have oppoſite habits and views in almoſt every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. One is accuſtomed to expence, the other to frugality. One will be inclined to numerous offices, large ſalaries, and an expenſive govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The other, from the moderate fortunes of the inhabitants, and their ſimple way of life, will prefer low taxes, ſmall ſalaries, and a very fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, civil eſtabliſhment. One imports almoſt every article of conſumption, and pays for it in produce: The other is far removed from naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has very little to export, and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſupply its own wants. Conſequently one will favor commerce; the other manufactures. One wiſhes for ſlaves; the other will be better without them. Where two claſſes of people, in the ſame community, have ſuch oppoſite inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and cuſtoms, it is fit that the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſhould govern. For the intereſts and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the greateſt number ought to be conſulted.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this inequality is much greater in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality than appearance From the cenſus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that 28,000 citizens out of 149,000, govern the whole ſtate. But we muſt recollect, that in the lower country, where theſe 28,000 reſide, the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027092_0037_0FD33A9421E15AE8"/>
greateſt inequality of property prevails—This has a tendency to throw all political power and privileges into the hands of the rich; whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are comparatively ſmall. The power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which the lower country poſſeſſes by its ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in repreſentation, is not poſſeſſed by all the people of the lower country, but by a ſmall part of them. A certain great man in Athens, uſed to aſſert that his little ſon governed all Greece: for, ſaid he, Athens governs Greece, I govern Athens, my wife governs me, and my young ſon governs my wife. In like manner, a few hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons below, govern South Carolina; for they govern the lower country, and the lower country governs the reſt of the ſtate. Of all the properties of our inequality in repreſentation, this is the moſt alarming.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, this inequality, already ſo enormous, is every moment becoming greater. The ſtate is now governed, we will ſay, by one-fifth of its inhabitants, reſiding in a particular part of the country. In twenty years, ſhould the preſent ſyſtem remain, it will be governed by one-tenth; in forty years by one-twentieth; and ſo on as the exceſs of numbers becomes greater and greater. The encreaſe of population below is very ſlow and inconſiderable. The ſwamps are engroſſed by a few families. Beſides, they require immenſe labour, and perhaps the labour of Africans to reduce them to cultivation. The high lands are exceedingly barren. Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will continually drive labouring people, of a diſpoſition, in any degree enterprizing, into the upper country. They will never ſtay and exhauſt their ſtrength in a barren ſoil, and ſickly climate, when they know that lands can eaſily be
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027092_0038_0FD33A9749D4A1D0"/>
procured in a fertile and healthy country. From the expenſive manner of living below, a family might be independent, and even opulent in the upper country, with what would hardly enable them to ſubſiſt decently near Charleſton. This, with the changes of property, which muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently take place, will probably occaſion many families to retire from the lower country with the remains of their fortune, and ſettle above. The ſicklineſs of the climate below, which deſtroys life, perhaps faſter than it is produced, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe from multiplying who do not emigrate. It is queſtionable, whether Charleſton diſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, out of Charleſton, more inhabitants now, than it did fifty years ago. The encreaſe, if any, has certainly been very inconſiderable. A great number of families which were among the firſt ſettlers, have become wholly extinct; and many, formerly numerous, are now reduced to one or two individuals in each. In the upper country, on the contrary, population advances with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing rapidity. A mild and healthy climate, a fertile ſoil, almoſt every where capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous cultivation—the ſimple and active life of the inhabitants, the abundant means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which moderate labour procures—the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the country, which give the ſpecies full room to expand itſelf; all contribute to multiply it in a manner almoſt incredible, and this natural encreaſe is aided by conſtant migrations, from leſs fortunate climes. Thirty years ago, Abbeville and Edgefield counties were ſo inconſiderable as to remain a part of Saint Bartholemews pariſh. They now contain 17,280 white inhabitants. The numbers of Pendleton county, which about eight years ago was entirely a deſert, now amount to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027092_0039_0FD33A9A9E4A12F8"/>
8731, with this rapid progreſs in population, wealth muſt greatly encreaſe. A fertile country encreaſing in number of inhabitants, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving in agriculture and arts; where the fruits of his induſtry are ſecured to every individual, muſt ſoon become rich. There is no doubt that wealth encreaſes much faſter in the upper country than below. Exports by no means afford a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain criterion of riches. The moſt wealthy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries often export the leaſt, becauſe the people have enough within themſelves, without purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from abroad, and conſume their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, inſtead of exchanging them for thoſe of their neighbours. This is very much the caſe with the upper country. On the contrary, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole labour of the lower country, is employed in cultivating ſtaples for exportation. The people import a great part even of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions: and almoſt the whole product of their labour is exported. Yet the exports of the upper country have doubled within the laſt ſeven or eight years; while thoſe from below have encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed very little during that period. Hence it is plain, that the ſuperiority which the lower coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try country enjoys in point of wealth, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually diminiſh; while its inferiority in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, muſt every day become more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Should the preſent apportionment of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation continue, the time muſt ſoon arrive, when the upper country, equal to the lower in wealth, and containing ten times as many free inhabitants, will have one third leſs power in the government. The leaſt opulent, the ſmalleſt, and the worſt peopled part of the ſtate, will rule all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears that the inequality of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027092_0040_0FD33A9BA7AE0908"/>
is of the moſt dangerous kind, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enormous, conſtantly encreaſing, and throwing the whole power of government into the hands of a ſmall part of the citizens, whoſe habits of life, ſituation, and political ſentiments, muſt be for ever different from thoſe of the great body of the community. We muſt next conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the effects of this inequality.</p>

               <p>IT now remains for us my fellow citizens, in this ſeventh and laſt number, to conſider what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the inequality of which we have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may now, or hereafter, produce on our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</p>
               <p>It is extremely evident, that the ſix upper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts are abſolutely under the dominion of the three lower ones, which poſſeſs a deciſive majority in both branches of the legiſlature. If any one ſhould be diſpoſed to deny this, let us aſk him, whether the whole upper country, ſhould it unite to a man, can carry any meaſure in the legiſlature, however important to its intereſts, without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the lower members? Surely it cannot. There hardly can be a queſtion which will more deeply intereſt the upper country, than the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the ſeat of government. But how was it carried; by their own ſtrength? No, all their ſtruggles for that purpoſe were ineffectual till they were joined by ſome members from below. Though the upper country, to a man, was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of county courts, though four fifths of the people conſidered that eſtabliſhment as of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt importance to their welfare, it was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without the greateſt difficulty; and never could have taken place, had not ſome lower mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027092_0041_0FD33A9DD3322B58"/>
lent their aſſiſtance. Yet this was a meaſure which the lower country had no intereſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. They, therefore, after a long ſtruggle, granted it as a matter of favour. But is it conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant with the character of freemen to hold their rights by courteſy, at the will of an handful of their fellow citizens? No, this is the condition of ſervants, whoſe maſters may ſometimes be mild, juſt, and even generous; but are maſters ſtill.</p>
               <p>Provinces will be well governed, whenever their intereſts happen to coincide with the views and intereſts of the power to which they are ſubject. This power may ſometimes even make a ſmall ſacrifice of its own intereſts to their wiſhes. But will it always be in that diſpoſition? Let our own hiſtory witneſs. In ſome points where the lower country was not very materially intereſted, it has yielded to the wiſhes and intereſts of its ſubjects in the upper country. This was the caſe with the county court act. Even the removal of the ſeat of government, though highly intereſting to thoſe lower members, who reſide in Charleſton, and therefore oppoſed by them with all their might, was a matter of indifference to the lower country gentlemen in general, who, when they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave home, cared very little, whether they went to Columbia or Charleſton. Some of them, therefore, gratified the upper country by voting for the removal, and ſome, no doubt, voted for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought it right and conducive to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good of the ſtate. After all, this removal was more properly a diviſion of the government, for all the principal officers continue to reſide in Charleſton. The governor is never obliged to be at Columbia, but while the legiſlature is ſitting. The ſupreme courts are held there but a few days in the year; the ſecretary's, treaſurer's, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027092_0042_0FD33A9F97094B08"/>
general's offices, at a great expence, and with much inconvenience to the ſtate, are divided between Charleſton and Columbia. The lower country was by no means generally intereſted, to prevent this partial removal; and yet through the oppoſition of a few powerful individuals, it did not take place without conſiderable difficulty. A complete removal, though much deſired by the whole upper country, by four-fifths of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, could not poſſibly be obtained. And when a queſtion aroſe, in which the lower country was univerſally oppoſed in intereſt to the upper, the queſtion of repreſentation, we all know the event. The upper country, with four fifths of the people, and every principle of juſtice and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment clearly on its ſide, was out voted and over ruled. It was not then the intereſt of the ruling power to gratify the wiſhes, or conſult the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of its provinces; and accordingly they were treated with the utmoſt neglect, and a ſyſtem of government impoſed upon them, replete with inequality, injuſtice and ſervitude.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient to ſhew, that the lower coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is the governing power, will ſeldom be diſpoſed to favor its dependant provinces, the other diſtricts, where its own intereſts or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, or thoſe of ſome powerful individuals in it, can be in any conſiderable degree affected. On how many, and what important points, theſe intereſts may differ, will ſoon appear.</p>
               <p>In the election of officers they muſt frequently differ. The lower country will wiſh to have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, ſenators for congreſs, and electors of the preſident, choſen from among men of their own party and way of thinking. The upper country, on the contrary, will be deſirous to fill thoſe high and important ſtations with men whom they know,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027092_0043_0FD3DFF06EA53920"/>
and on whoſe love of true republicaniſm they can rely. But have they the power of doing it? No. Should the lower country combine in ſupport of a candidate, the moſt odious to the ſix upper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts, that is to four fifths of the citizens, it can give him 90 votes. The upper country has only 73 to oppoſe him with. Conſequently every pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic office of this ſtate, from the governor and ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the United States, down to the ſheriffs of the various diſtricts, may be filled, by the lower country in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> with characters the moſt obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to four-fifths of the people.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the upper country ſhould fix its choice on a candidate univerſally beloved by them, for the office of governor, for inſtance, or ſenator; can they elect him? Not if the lower country thinks proper to ſupport another. They can give him 73 votes Theſe 73 votes will repreſent the will of four-fifths of the people. Conſequently this candidate will be the choice of four out of five of his fellow citizens. But if the other one-fifth think proper to oppoſe him, they can give his antagoniſt 90 votes, and prevent his election.</p>
               <p>It is not only in elections, but in paſſing laws, laying taxes, and indeed in every legiſlative act, that this tyranny may be exerciſed. The cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lands in the lower country are of ten or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times the productive value of thoſe above. At preſent they are taxed according to their reſpective value, which is juſt: but ſuppoſe the lower coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhould think fit to alter the mode, and to tax all lands equally: could the upper country pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it? No. Suppoſe the people below ſhould chooſe to take off the tax on negroes, and lay it upon cattle, tobacco, hemp, and wheat; ſo as to remove the whole burden of public contribution from their own ſhoulders, and lay it on thoſe of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027092_0044_0FD33AA378855470"/>
the upper country: could the latter prevent this unjuſt impoſition? No. The lower country has a decided majority in the legiſlature, and can make what laws, and lay what taxes, it may think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Suppoſe it ſhould think proper to lay a poll tax; by which a man in the lower country poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of 10,000 pounds would pay no more for the ſupport of government, than one in Ninety-ſix or Pinckney, who has only ten pounds: it has the power of doing it. It may alſo take off the tax on coaches and lay it on waggons: if it ſhould be diſpoſed to do ſo, the upper country has no power to hinder it.</p>
               <p>It would be endleſs to enumerate all the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in which the lower country, by its ſuperiority in repreſentation, may ſacrifice the intereſts of four-fifths of the people who are governed, to the intereſts or convenience of one-fifth which governs.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, will all theſe oppreſſions be exerciſed? I do not ſay that all of them will; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be a conſiderable time before we ſhall feel any of them. I contend that they may be exerciſed, that the lower country has the power of exerciſing them: a power which it has in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances exerted: and I ſay that it is inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with every juſt idea of freedom for the great body of the people to be in the power of a ſmall part, and to hold its rights dependant on their juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or favor. Why did we quarrel with Great Britain? Not for the evils which ſhe inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, but to guard againſt thoſe which ſhe might inflict. Not becauſe ſhe taxed us in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, without our conſent; but becauſe ſhe claimed a right of doing ſo. This right the lower country poſſeſſes over the upper, and may exerciſe whenever prompted to do ſo by its intereſts or inclination.</p>
               <p>And now my fellow citizens, I conclude with a
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027092_0045_0FD33AA732C1BA88"/>
warning which requires your moſt ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beware of ſuppoſing, that becauſe the evil which I have pointed out, does not at preſent preſs with its whole weight upon you, it is therefore unworthy of immediate attention. Great abuſes in government, like great rivers, ariſe from ſmall beginings. They are eaſily checked at firſt, but encreaſing imperceptibly in their progreſs, they at length become too powerful for oppoſition. Thus corruption crept into the Britiſh government; and thus your liberties will be gradually undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, unleſs you ſpeedily apply a remedy to the dangerous malady under which our conſtitution labours.</p>
