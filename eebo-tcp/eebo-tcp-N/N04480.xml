            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>O ſing unto the Lord a new Song, for he hath done marvellous Things: His right Hand and his holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AS we are now together in the Houſe of the Lord, to pay him our humble and grateful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments for the eminent Succeſs which he has granted the <hi>New England</hi> Arms againſt a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring powerful Enemy, I could think of no Words more pertinent than thoſe I have read to you to employ your Meditations on ſo remarkable an Occaſion.</p>
            <p>SOME indeed refer them to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and his ſpiritual Conqueſts in behalf of a rebel World; but others think they were penned in commemoration of ſome ſignal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Victory gain'd by the Troops of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under the Command of <hi>David,</hi> over their Enemies. In this View of them they are properly applicable to the Deſign of this Day's Solemnity; for <hi>the Lord hath done marvellous Things</hi> for us; <hi>His right Hand and holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory</hi>: And we are hereupon obliged to <hi>ſing a new ſong</hi> to the Praiſe of his great Name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:005558_0004_1018681F3461BAA0"/>IN ſpeaking to the Words,</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider God as <hi>getting the Victory by his right Hand and holy Arm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall take Notice of the <hi>marvellous Things</hi> which he ſometimes does in <hi>getting the Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I ſhall ſhow what Reaſon a People, for whom God has thus gotten the Victory, have to <hi>ſing a new Song</hi> of Praiſe to him.</p>
            <p>THESE are the Heads we are naturally led to diſcourſe to from the Text: And we ſhall endeavour to ſpeak to them in a Manner not unſutable to the Occaſion of the Day, and Circumſtances of divine Providence.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am, in the firſt Place, to conſider <hi>God</hi> as <hi>getting the Victory by his right Hand and holy Arm.</hi> The inſpired <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> aſcribes this Glory to him. He does not take it to himſelf, he does not beſtow it on the Troops of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; but acknowledges the Efficiency of God, and gives him the Honour due to his Name. <hi>His right Hand and holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory.</hi> Literally ſpeaking it cannot be ſaid of God, that he has an <hi>Hand</hi> or <hi>Arm</hi>; for he is a pure Spirit, without bodily Shape or Parts: But as 'tis by the <hi>right Hand and Arm</hi> that Men are wont to put forth their Strength, theſe Parts of the human Body are figuratively applied to God. So he is ſaid in the Text to <hi>get him the Victory by his right Hand and Arm.</hi> The Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is uſed by way of Accommodation to our Capacities, and obviouſly leads us to conceive of Victory as obtain'd by God, bro't about under the Direction and Influence of his powerwful and alwiſe Providence.</p>
            <p>AND this is a Truth every where acknowledged in the ſacred Writings. They ſpeak of the great God as ruling in the Armies of Heaven and Earth; as preſiding over the Kingdoms of this lower World, governing all their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005558_0005_101868210A4B6BF8"/>
Affairs, and deciding all their Battles. The Names by which he is commonly known in the Bible are theſe, <hi>the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Armies, the Lord ſtrong and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Lord mighty in Battle</hi>; importing, that he directs, preſides and over-rules in all Armies, ſo as to turn the Battle on which Side he pleaſes. Nor is Victory ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but under the divine Guidance and Bleſſing. 'Tis in the Faith of this, that <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>General,</hi> as well as <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo often applies to God to be his Shield and Help, and ſubdue the People under him. 'Tis in the Faith of this, that the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God do ſo often make their religious thankful Acknowledgments to him for giving them the Necks of their Enemies. And 'tis upon this ſame Account, that we meet with ſo many ſacred Hymns of Praiſe, in Commemoration of glorious Victory in a Day of Battle.</p>
            <p>NOT that God, in getting the Victory, <hi>immediately</hi> exerts his <hi>right Hand and holy Arm.</hi> He does it <hi>ordinarily</hi> by the intervention of ſecond Cauſes, and of ſuch as are naturally fitted, in a humane Way, to accompliſh his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: Tho' this ought not, in the leaſt, to take from him the Glory of his Agency; for the Victory is notwithſtanding his. He raiſes up and qualifies thoſe who are employed in a Day of Battle, he Spirits them to the Service, arms them with Reſolution, directs their Conduct, and crowns their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor with Succeſs. The greateſt Generals are abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on God. He gives them Preſence of mind, or confounds their Tho'ts; he directs their Counſels, or ſuffers them to be led aſide by a Spirit of Infatuation; he renders their Projections proſperous, or fruſtrates their beſt concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Meaſures: He gives Courage to their Armies, or ſtrikes them with Surpriſe: And if he intends to render them victorious, he will order ſuch a concurrence of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in their Favour, as that they ſhall have the Advantage of their Enemies, and tread upon their High Places.</p>
            <p>AND now, if 'its by the <hi>right Hand and holy Arm of God;</hi> that victory is obtained,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005558_0006_10186822DE1F78B8"/>THIS ſhews us where our <hi>Dependance</hi> ought to be for Succeſs againſt our Enemies. Not on the beſt Means, or Inſtruments: Tho' we ought to make uſe of theſe, and may depend on them, provided we don't place them in the Room of God. For he is <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>ultimately</hi> to be confided in. And curſed is the Man, the Nation, the Province, that maketh Fleſh their Arm. The Lord Jehovah, and he only, is the Strength of his People; and whatever Truſt is placed in Men or Means, it ought always to be in ſubordination to his all-governing Will and Providence.</p>
            <p>AND 'tis owing, I would hope, to ſuch a well-placed Truſt in God, that we his People in this Land have been favoured with ſuch remarkable Succeſs againſt our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. We were not wanting in the Uſe of all ſutable Means; and yet, I could not but obſerve a general Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in all ſerious People, both high and low, to own their Dependance on God, without the concurrent Bleſſing of whoſe Providence, they had no Hope of Succeſs. It was this that brought us once and again publickly into the Houſe of the Lord, under the Countenance of Authority, to humble ourſelves before him, to confeſs our Sins, and beg that his Preſence might be with our Brethren gone againſt the Enemy. And upon no Occaſion do I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have ſeen a Spirit of Prayer more generally prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among thoſe who profeſs a Regard to Religion. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayers were continually going up to God, from all Parts of the Country: And may it not be hoped, that God has heard our Prayers of Faith and Truſt in his Power and Goodneſs, and, in Anſwer to them, crowned our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize againſt the <hi>French</hi> Enemy with ſuch ſignal Glory and Victory?</p>
            <p>WE are likewiſe taught from what has been diſcourſed, that the <hi>Glory</hi> of Victories gained over Enemies is to be given unto God. To him therefore let us aſcribe the Glory of our late Conqueſt, ſo nearly connected with the Proſperity of theſe Colonies. 'Twas by the <hi>right Hand and holy Arm of God</hi> that we got this Victory: And to him be the Praiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:005558_0007_101868291C53C908"/>NOT that we are to be unmindful of thoſe whom God has been pleaſed to uſe as Inſtruments in this great Affair. 'Tis the Command of God, that we give Honour to whom Honour is due. And ſhall we not think and ſpeak of thoſe, with all decent Reſpect, and entertain a graceful Senſe of their Service, who have expoſed themſelves to Hardſhips, and ventured their Lives in the high Places of the Field, for our Benefit; eſpecially, when they have been honored by God in being made victorious over our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? All Nations have done Honour to their <hi>Heroes,</hi> both living and after they were dead: And if they have ſometimes exceeded herein, giving that Glory to <hi>Man</hi> which was due to <hi>God,</hi> this is no Reaſon why we ſhould not make our grateful Acknowledgments to our <hi>Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,</hi> and in Proportion to the Extent and Value of their Atchievements on our Behalf, and the greatneſs of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and Difficulties they have gone thro' for our Sakes; always provided we keep within the Bounds of Religion, and honor not <hi>Man</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>God,</hi> but in ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to him, and <hi>ultimately</hi> reflecting Glory on him.</p>
            <p>IT has been remarked, the Song of <hi>Deborah,</hi> tho' it gives the principal Glory of the eminent Victory it cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates to God, whoſe is the Glory, and the Power, and the Victory, and the Majeſty; yet at the ſame Time it forgets not to give all juſt Applauſe to the Officers and Troops that acquired it under the divine Conduct and Bleſſing. A good Example this! and we may learn our Duty from it both to <hi>God,</hi> and thoſe he has employed as <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in the glorious Conqueſt we are this Duty celebrating.</p>
            <p>WE ought highly to eſteem in Love and honour his <hi>Excellency,</hi> our <hi>Commander in Chief,</hi> whoſe Wiſdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected this great and neceſſary Undertaking; whoſe Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directed to all ſutable Meaſures to conceal it from the Enemy; whoſe indefatigable Labours, by Night and Day, carried it on with ſuch ſurpriſing Diſpatch; and, in a Word, whoſe juſt Influence at <hi>Home,</hi> and ſeaſonable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications there, procured thoſe Ships of War, without which we could not have ſucceeded in this noble Deſign.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005558_0008_1018682E0705B2F0"/>
He has herein approved himſelf faithful to his <hi>Royal Maſter,</hi> and a Father to NEW-ENGLAND. The good Lord <hi>have reſpect</hi> to his Servant! And may he long live at the <hi>head</hi> of this <hi>Province,</hi> in high Favour with the <hi>King,</hi> and rejoicing in the Love Reverence and Obeiſance of a loyal People!</p>
            <p>GREAT alſo are our Obligations to our wiſe and valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>General,</hi> who, from a diſintereſted Love to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, laid by his own private Affairs, left his honorable Seat at Court, and, what is more, his beloved Relatives and Friends, under all Advantages to be happy in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, to go at the <hi>head</hi> of our Forces into the Enemies Land, and beſiege their ſtrongeſt Fortifications in this part of the World, expoſing himſelf to known Difficulties and Hardſhips, and hazarding his Life, to make Acquiſitions for the public Safety. Bleſſed be the Lord his Strength, who taught his Hands to War, and his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to fight; who hath been his Fortreſs and Deliverer; who hath proſpered his Counſels and Arms, to the ſubduing the People under him, and leading him into the <hi>ſtrong City,</hi> and putting him in Poſſeſſion of its ſtrong Holds. May the great JEHOVAH be ſtill his Shield and Defence, and return him in Safety to his own Land, that he may here ſpeak of the mighty Acts of the Lord, and receive the juſt Applauſes of his People!</p>
            <p>WE ſhould likewiſe be ungrateful, if we did not take a thankful Notice of our brave <hi>Commodore,</hi> to whoſe Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Vigilance, and active Courage, under God, it was owing, that the Siege was covered. Relief for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my cut off, and a ſtrong Ship of War taken, which might otherwiſe have obliged our Forces to return with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment and Damage. His readineſs, had there been a Neceſſity for it, to have gone into the Harbour with his Ships, to join the Army in one general dreadful Attack upon the Town, ought always to be rememembred to his Honour: Nor will it be denied, that the Terror of ſo many Ships, under the Command of ſo brave an Officer, had a powerful Influence in the Surrender of the Place.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005558_0009_1018682FE1B41510"/>
Upon theſe Accounts the Name of <hi>Warren</hi> will, I truſt, be ever treated with Reſpect in NEW-ENGLAND.</p>
            <p>NEITHER ſhould we forget to make an honourable Mention of the other <hi>Officers,</hi> yea, and of the <hi>Soldiers,</hi> who, in order to reduce the City of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> endured Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, cheerfully went thro' Fatigues and Hazards, fearing nothing, and doing every thing Man could do!</p>
            <p>AND ſhall we not love and honor theſe brave Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Shame that has been bro't upon thoſe who hated us, and the Salvation God has wrought out for this his People? We ſhall be baſely ungraceful, if we withold from them their juſt Praiſe.</p>
            <p>BUT our Acknowledgments muſt not be confined to <hi>Men,</hi> nor <hi>principally</hi> made to <hi>them</hi>; but to the <hi>God of Armies,</hi> the God whoſe <hi>right Hand and holy Arm hath gotten us the Victory.</hi> Not unto us, O Lord, not unto any Skill, or Valor, or Strength of our Army or Fleet, but to thy Name be the Glory.—But I muſt not anticipate what will more properly come in afterwards. I therefore go on to the next Thing propoſed, which was,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To take Notice of the <hi>marvellous Things</hi> which God ſometimes does in getting the Victory for a People. Says <hi>David</hi> in the Text, <hi>Marvellous Things hath he done: His right Hand and holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory.</hi> The meaning is, that it was in a <hi>marvellous</hi> Way, by ſurpriſing Events, that God gained this Victory for <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR was this the only Inſtance in this Kind. God often appeared <hi>wonderfully</hi> for that People, and made bare <hi>his holy Arm</hi> for the Deſtruction of thoſe who roſe up againſt them. Sometimes he <hi>miraculouſly</hi> exerted his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, and did Things not only <hi>above,</hi> but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to the Courſe of Nature, and all humane Contrivance, to give them the Advantage of their Enemies. Thus, he rebuked the Red-Sea, and it was dried up: He led his <hi>Iſrael</hi> thro' the Depth as thro' the Wilderneſs; while the Waters ſwallowed up the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> The Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> marvellouſly fell down at the Sound of <hi>Rams-Horns</hi>; and the <hi>Lamps</hi> and <hi>Pitchers</hi> of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s three hundred Men
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005558_0010_1018683331446570"/>
ſtruck the vaſt Army of the <hi>Midianites</hi> with Conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that they madly turned every Man his Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Fellow. The Sun ſtood ſtill to favour <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the purſuit of his Enemies, while <hi>Hail-Stones</hi> from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven killed more than the Sword of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> was diſpatch'd from the <hi>Armies above</hi> to raiſe the Siege at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by deſtroying an hundred and eighty five thouſand of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army in one Night, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the reſt immediately to retire from the Walls of that City.</p>
            <p>BUT, in the <hi>ordinary</hi> Courſe of Providence, God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does <hi>marvellous Things</hi> in favour of a People, and in order to their getting the Victory: Either, by a ſecret and inviſible Influence, diſpoſing and ranging ſecond Cauſes in ſuch a Manner as to operate beyond all humane Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; or by interpoſing ſuch a Coincidence of Events, as could not have been foreſeen, and when bro't to paſs, draw the Attention of wiſe Obſervers, and force from them an Acknowledgment, that God's Throne is in the Heavens, and his Kingdom ruleth over all.</p>
            <p>AND of this we have had an illuſtrious Inſtance, in the memorable <hi>Conqueſt</hi> that has brought us together this Day.</p>
            <p>I ſcarce know of a Conqueſt, ſince the Days of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>Judges,</hi> wherein the Finger of God is more viſible. There has been ſuch a Train of Providences, ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of favourable Circumſtances, making Way for it, as are truly wonderful; and, if conſidered in one collective View, render it proper to take up the Language of the Text, and ſay, <hi>Marvellous Things hath God done for us: His right Hand, and his holy Arm hath gotten us this Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT may ſeem ſtrange, that ſuch a Country as this, ſo weak in Strength, ſo unſkilled in the Uſe of military Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, ſo diſtreſſed for want of Money, ſhould make an Attempt upon ſo ſtrong and fenced a City as <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> at <hi>Cape-Breton</hi>: Nor ſhould we have entertained the Tho't, if it had not been clearly pointed out to us by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God.</hi> It was apparently <hi>Providence</hi> that gave
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005558_0011_10186838A64180B8"/>
Riſe to this important Deſign; partly, by permitting the <hi>French,</hi> laſt Year, to take <hi>Canſo,</hi> and invade <hi>Annapolis,</hi> and form a Scheme to invade it again this Year; hereby open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our View, in the cleareſt Manner, not only the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of reducing this Place, from whence we were expoſed to ſuffer ſo much, both on our <hi>Sea coaſts,</hi> and <hi>Frontier-borders</hi>: Partly, by ſending a Number of rich <hi>Eaſt-India Ships</hi> into the Harbour of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> for the ſupply and manning of which, in their Voyage to <hi>France,</hi> ſo many of their Men, and ſuch Quantities of their Stores, were taken off, and ſo late in the Fall, as to render the Spring the <hi>Nick of Time</hi> (as we vulgarly ſpeak) the moſt favourable Opportunity we might ever expect, for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of this Nature: Tho' after all, it would probably have never been undertaken, if the Providence of God, notwithſtanding the moſt prudent Steps, under good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, to gain Intelligence, had not kept us ſtrangely in Ignorance, both as to the vaſt Strengh of the Place, an Number of Inhabitants that might ſuddenly be call'd in to its Aſſiſtance. Many of our <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Soldiers,</hi> who now know theſe Things, have frequently declared, had they known them before, they ſhould never have gone upon this Affair.</p>
            <p>AND as it was by the Direction of Providence, we were led to form an Enterpriſe of ſuch vaſt Moment; to the ſame Cauſe muſt it be aſcribed, that ſo many Things were remarkably ordered all along in favour of it, and ſo as finally to bring it to an happy Iſſue.</p>
            <p>IT was apparently owing to a ſignal interpoſition in Providence, that ſo many Perſons, from all Parts of the Land, were ſpirited to offer themſelves willingly for this Service; and that, within two Months from the Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government to undertake this Deſign, the whole military Force was in readineſs for Embarkation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sail for the Place they were intended to go againſt. I believe, I may ſay, ſuch an Armament for an infant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, ſo voluntarily raiſed, ſo well fitted for their Buſineſs, and ſo ſpeedily diſpatched away, can't be parallel'd in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005558_0012_1018683A5AA3F628"/>
Hiſtory: Eſpecially, if we take into Conſideration, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our Inexperience in Affairs of this Nature, the conſiderable naval Force equipped; the great Number of Tranſports provided; the vaſt Quantity of Stores procured, both for the Support of our own Men, and the Annoyance of the Enemy: And as to many of theſe neceſſary Stores, ſuch as <hi>Cannon-Shot, Shells</hi> of various Sizes, <hi>Mortars, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns, Hand-Granadoes, Scaling-Ladders, Field pieces, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Carriages</hi> for many of our Cannon, and <hi>ſpecial ones</hi> accommodated for the Tranſportation of thoſe Cannon that were to be uſed in Battery; I ſay, as to theſe Stores, they were not only to be bought, but to be <hi>made</hi>: And yet, to the Surpriſe of every Body, the whole Work of Preparation, which was took in hand, after the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Court, <hi>Jan.</hi> 29th, was compleated by <hi>March</hi> 21ſt. when the <hi>General</hi> gave his Signal for ſailing.</p>
            <p>I may, not improperly, remark here to the Honour of this <hi>Province,</hi> that the Men, ſo ſuddenly and ſtrangely got together to go upon this Expedition, were of a different Character from thoſe, who are commonly ſent upon ſuch Occaſions. They were not the Scum of the Land, idle worthleſs Creatures, given to Prophaneneſs, Intemperance, and univerſally debauched in their Manners. A Number of ſuch there might be: But for the <hi>generality,</hi> they were Men who had upon their Minds an Awe of God, and feared an Oath; they were Men induſtrious in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and well able to provide for themſelves and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; in a Word, they were Men of Life and Spirit, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with love to their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and willing to venture their Lives, not ſo much to <hi>ſerve themſelves,</hi> as to promote the <hi>publick Good.</hi> 'Tis a rare Thing for ſo many Men, of ſuch a Character, to be engaged in a military En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize: And I can't but think, there was a ſpecial Hand of Providence in it.</p>
            <p>IT was owing remarkably to the Government of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that the <hi>Weather</hi> was ſo ordered in Favour of this Enterprize. Perhaps, the oldeſt Man living does not remember ſo long a Courſe of moderate fair Weather as
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005558_0013_1018683D75DFB3C8"/>
we were bleſſed with, while preparing for the Expedition. There was not the loſs of a Day, either by <hi>Snow, Rain,</hi> or <hi>Cold</hi>; which is wonderful, in this Climate, at this Time of the Year. Some, who have preſerved an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Weather for more than twenty Years back, have been ſurpriſed to behold the Difference between the Months of <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> this Year, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ones; <hi>This,</hi> a continued Courſe of good Weather; <hi>thoſe,</hi> as continually intermix'd with Storms of <hi>Snow,</hi> or <hi>Rain,</hi> or <hi>ſeverity of Cold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND the Weather was as remarkably favourable to our Deſign at <hi>Cape-Breton:</hi> For, as ſome have obſerved in their <hi>Letters,</hi> there was ſcarce ever known, among the <hi>French,</hi> ſuch a Run of good Weather, as while they were laying Siege to <hi>Louiſbourg:</hi> Whereas, the very Afternoon they entered the City, the Rain came on, filled their Trenches with Water, and continued for ſuch a Number of Days, that they muſt have gone thro' inſufferable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and been in danger of raiſing the Siege. The <hi>French</hi> themſelves took Notice of this Diſpoſition of Providence, and ſaid, <hi>it was viſible God fought for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was obſervably owing to Providence, that our <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> were preſerved from the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> as ſuch Numbers of them were in this Town, in order to embark, when that <hi>infectious</hi> Diſtemper broke out among us, threatning a univerſal Spread. And, perhaps, the Time was never known, when ſo many Perſons, in ſo many different Parts of the Town, were taken ill with this Sickneſs, and it was notwithſtanding ſtopped in its Progreſs: Which is the more worthy of ſpecial Notice, becauſe, if it had prevailed, it would unavoidably have put an End to the intended Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
            <p>IT was owing to the wonderful Conduct of a kind Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that ſo conſiderable a military Force, at ſuch a Seaſon of the Year, ſhould be carried in Safety to the Place they were bound for, without the loſs of a Man, or meeting with the leaſt Diſaſter; and that their Deſign ſhould be a <hi>perfect Secret</hi> to the Enemy, till they were
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005558_0014_1018684049408F90"/>
ſurpriſed with the Sight of our Fleet, going into <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereauge Bay.</hi> It was this that made way for landing our Men and Stores without Annoyance, unleſs from a ſmall Party of the <hi>French,</hi> ſome of whom were taken, ſome killed, and the reſt obliged to flee for their Lives.</p>
            <p>IT was owing to the extraordinary favour of Providence, that the Enemy, ſo ſoon after our landing, forſook their <hi>Grand-Battery</hi>; allowing us to enter and take Poſſeſſion of it without the leaſt Oppoſition. This ſeems, on the one Hand, to have been a moſt fatal Miſtake to <hi>them,</hi> which can ſcarce be accounted for, unleſs from a <hi>Spirit of Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,</hi> or a <hi>mighty Terror ſeizing their Hearts</hi>: And, on the other, the leading Advantage put into <hi>our</hi> Hands; as it animated our Men with Life and Vigor, furniſhed them with the <hi>heavieſt Cannon</hi> made uſe of in the Siege, and enabled them with greater Speed, and leſs Danger, to make their Attempt on the Town.</p>
            <p>AND here was a Series of Things remarkably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd in Providence.</p>
            <p>Not only were our Men diſpoſed and enabled to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Cannon (ſome of which were of large Size and Weight) over Hills, and Rocks, and thro' Moraſſes, in which ſometimes they ſunk with their Carriages ſo as to be buried in the Mire; but, in ſight of the Enemy, and within reach of their Shot, they erected Batteries, mounted Guns, fixed Mortars, and ſoon got all Things in readineſs, both to <hi>cannonade</hi> and <hi>bombard</hi> the Town: And all without the Loſs of ſcarce a Man. And tho' they were nine and forty Days beſieging the City, and had their neareſt advanced Battery within leſs than <hi>Thirty Rods</hi> of its <hi>Weſtern Gate,</hi> (as the Meaſure has ſince been taken) and were playing from it moſt of the Time, and receiving the Enemies Fire; yet the Men ſlain were but an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>AND the like ſignal Preſervation they met with at their <hi>Battery</hi> by the <hi>Light Houſe.</hi> This was the greateſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance to the Enemy, and, under God, the greateſt Cauſe of their Surrender. And the whole Time they were
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005558_0015_10186843940E27C0"/>
erecting it, and getting their heavy Cannon up the high and ſteep Rocks, to the Amazement of the Enemy, they were continually played upon both by their Cannon and Bombs: And yet, if I remember right, there was no more than one Man ſlain. The whole Number indeed of Men loſt, whether by the Sword, or Sickneſs, or Diſaſter, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Siege, did not amount to more than an hundred and Twenty. This is <hi>the Doing of the Lord,</hi> and ought to be <hi>marvellous in our Eyes.</hi> The like has ſcarce been known in the World.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides theſe Favours of Providence, there was a moſt ſeaſonable Coincidence of Events, all tending to point our View to God, and to lead us into an apprehenſion of him as remarkably appearing to grant us Succeſs.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the coming in of a large Supply of thoſe very Proviſions which were wanted, juſt as our Forces were ready to ſail, and without which they muſt have been delayed.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the taking a Number of <hi>Store Ships</hi> going to the relief of the Enemy, as well as intercepting a <hi>Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> from <hi>France</hi> to the Governour of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> which might have contain'd Advices of great Importance to the <hi>French,</hi> and Diſſervice to <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND ſuch alſo was the taking a large Ship of War, with more than five hundred Men, Proviſions for eight Months, and about an hundred Barrels of Powder more than her own proper Store. Had the Providence of God permitted her to go in Safely, it might have defeated our Deſign. Such a Number of Men and ſuch a Quantity of Proviſion and Ammunition, would have given Heart as well as Strength to the Enemy, and, ſome think, muſt have obliged us to raiſe the Siege. But what a merciful Turn did her Capture give to our Affairs? Not only were the Enemy weaken'd and diſpirited, but a great part of their Strength put into our Hands to be turn'd againſt them; beſides that our <hi>Army</hi> received a Supply of Powder, which was now ſo wanted, that our Canno muſt have been ſilent without it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005558_0016_10186846DA3C2BD8"/>AND this Event is the more worthy of Notice, becauſe of the Incidents in Providence remarkably leading to it. A <hi>Packet boat</hi> from <hi>Great Britain</hi> arrives to Commodore <hi>Warren,</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> ordering him to <hi>Boſton</hi> with ſeveral Ships of War, to adviſe with Governour <hi>Shirley</hi> for the Protection of the <hi>Northern Colonies</hi>; which is the more obſervable, as the <hi>Commodore,</hi> thro' the Ignorance of his Pilot, had juſt before loſt his own 60 Gun-Ship, by Means whereof he could give our <hi>Governour,</hi> who had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched Letters to him, adviſing him of the Deſign againſt <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> no great Encouragement to expect his Help; tho' being now acquainted with the Reſolution of this Government, he was prepar'd and diſpos'd to haſten away with the greater Speed, upon his Orders from <hi>Home.</hi> But had he come to <hi>Boſton,</hi> as he intended, agreable to his Orders, he had probably been too late at <hi>Cape-Breton</hi> to have met with <hi>this Ship of War.</hi> A Veſſel therefore is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently caſt in his Way at Sea, accidentally to Man, but <hi>intentionally</hi> by God, giving him certain Information, that the <hi>New-England</hi> Forces had been ſome time on their Voyage; upon which, tho' in want of Water and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he altered his Courſe, and arrived before the Harbour of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> time enough to take the <hi>Vigilant,</hi> a fine new 64 Gun Ship, deſignedly ſent from <hi>France</hi> for the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>French,</hi> and Diſtreſs of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the moſt aſtoniſhing Article in the Conduct of Providence, was its diſpoſing the Enemy, by ſurrendering their City and Fortreſſes, to prevent that general Aſſault, both by Sea and Land, which had been reſolved upon, and muſt have occaſioned a moſt dreadful Effuſion of Blood on both Sides: And God only knows, what the Event would have been; as the <hi>French</hi> were ſo ſtrongly fortified, and had within their Walls 600 regular Troops, and, at leaſt, 1400 of the Inhabitants, whom they had valled in to their Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, the Reduction of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the immenſe Sums of Money that have been laid out, by the King of <hi>France,</hi> to render it impregnable;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005558_0017_1018684A15F50090"/>
and conſidering alſo that it was accompliſhed by inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced undiſciplined Troops from <hi>New-England,</hi> is an Event truly ſurpriſing, and will be ſpoken of as ſuch at <hi>home,</hi> and handed down as ſuch to the Children yet unborn.</p>
            <p>WE may ſay, upon a review of the Providences obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly leading to undertake this Affair, and viſibly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it when undertaken, and all along remarkably concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to its being delivered up into our Hands, <hi>Marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Things haſt thou done for us, O Lord; thy right Hand and holy Arm have gotten us this Victory.</hi> And to thy Name be the Glory; which leads to the laſt Thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſhow what Reaſon a People, for whom God has thus <hi>marvellouſly</hi> gotten the Victory, have to <hi>ſing unto him a new Song</hi> of Praiſe. <hi>David,</hi> you ſee, calls upon the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>ſing unto the Lord a new Song,</hi> for the <hi>Victory his holy Arm had gotten</hi> for them. This gave them new Matter for a <hi>new Song,</hi> and juſt Occaſion to ſing it unto God.</p>
            <p>AND the ſame may be ſaid of us the People of God in this Land. He has given us a <hi>new</hi> and great Occaſion to ſing Praiſe to his Name; and we ſhall be horribly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, if we neglect to do ſo. And the Ingratitude will riſe in its Baſeneſs, and Malignity, in proportion to the <hi>marvellous Things,</hi> which <hi>the right Hand and holy Arm</hi> of God hath done in getting for us ſuch a glorious Conqueſt; a Conqueſt, putting us in Poſſeſſion of what may be called, <hi>the Key of North America</hi>; and which, if wiſely improved, may be of vaſt Service, not only to this and all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Governments, but to <hi>Great Britain</hi> alſo, by guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Navigation, and ſecuring to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the <hi>Cod-Fiſhery,</hi> the value of which will be great, at preſent, and may, in Time, go beyond Account.</p>
            <p>'Tis obſervable, it was a common thing for God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of old, when ſucceeded againſt their Enemies, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Praiſes of that God who appeared for them, and gave them Victory. We have many Songs of Praiſe upon ſuch Occaſions in the ſacred Writings. Such was the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005558_0018_1018684C060722F8"/>
Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> for the Victory of <hi>Iſrael</hi> over the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> recorded in the 15th Chapter of <hi>Exodus.</hi> Such was the Song of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> for their intire Conqueſt of <hi>Jabin</hi> and <hi>Siſera,</hi> as we may ſee in the 5th Chapter of <hi>Judges.</hi> And ſuch alſo were ſeveral of the Songs of <hi>David,</hi> for God's powerfully delivering him out of the Hands of his Enemies, as they are to be met with in the Book of <hi>Pſalms.</hi> All which Inſtances of religiouſly acknowledging God, upon Occaſion of Victories obtain'd, were written for our Example, and call upon us, under the preſent Circumſtances of Providence, <hi>to enter into God's Gates with thankſgiving, and into his Courts with praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as this is the Deſign of this Day's Solemnity, let us unite in <hi>praiſing the Lord for the avenging of Iſrael.</hi> Let us <hi>ſing Praiſes to the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> Let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Language of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>whole Body of the Jewiſh Nation,</hi> be our's upon this memorable Occaſion, <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſly.—The Lord is my Strength and Song, and he is become my Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He is my God, and I will prepare him a Habitation; my Father's God, and I will exalt him.—The Lord is a Man of War, the Lord is his Name.—Thy right Hand, O Lord, is become glorious in Power.—Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the Gods? Who is like unto thee, glorious in Holineſs, fearful in Praiſes, doing Wonders? Thou haſt ſtretched out thy right Hand;—Thou, in thy Mercy, haſt led forth the People which thou haſt redeemed;—thou haſt guided them in thy Strength</hi>—.</p>
            <p>LET us recount the many Favours of God to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; the many wonderful Interpoſitions of Providence, making way for the glorious Conqueſt they have gained: And let us muſe on theſe Things, till our Hearts are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and our Tongues opened to ſhew forth the Divine Praiſes. Let us <hi>extol our God and King, and bleſs his Name forever and over.</hi> Let us <hi>ſpeak of the glorious Honor of his Majeſty, and of his wondrous Works. Let us ſpeak of the might of his terrible Acts, and declare his Greatneſs. Let us abundantly utter the Memory of his great Goodneſs, and ſing of his Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:005558_0019_10186850F47467E0"/>AND let not the bleſſed God have Occaſion to ſay of us, as of his People of old, <hi>They ſang his Praiſe, they ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat his Works. They forgat God their Saviour, which had done great Things in</hi> Egypt, <hi>wondrous Works in the Land of</hi> Ham, <hi>and terrible Things by the</hi> Red-Sea.</p>
            <p>LET us not think it enough, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> that we have laid aſide our wordly Buſineſs, for a while, to appear in the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of God, that we may ſpeak and ſing his Praiſes. The Lord hath <hi>done great things</hi> for us. The <hi>God of</hi> Jeſhurun <hi>hath rode upon the Heavens in our help, and in his Excellency on the Skie.</hi> And this wonderful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of God for us, ſhould excite our Love, warm our Devotion, confirm our Faith, encourage our Hope, and inſpire us with the firmeſt Reſolutions of all holy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Commandments of God.</p>
            <p>LET us not think, that God will be pleaſed with meer external Offerings of Praiſe. <hi>Nay, he hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good. And what doth the Lord thy God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thee, but to do Juſtice, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? Behold, to obey is better than Sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of Rams. To love the Lord our God with all our Heart, and with all our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and with all our Soul, and with all our Strength, and to love our Neighbour as ourſelves, is more than whole Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices.</hi> Let us, together with <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Praiſe, order our Converſation aright:</hi> So ſhall we <hi>glorify God,</hi> and he will ſtill <hi>ſhew us his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND let me here mind you of one Way wherein 'tis peculiarly fitting you ſhould expreſs your Gratitude on this joyful Occaſion; and that is, <hi>by ſhewing Mercy to the Poor.</hi> 'Tis obſervable, when the <hi>Jews</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt their Enemies, and ſolemnized the <hi>Feaſt of Purim</hi> in Thankſgiving to God, they <hi>gave Gifts to the Poor,</hi> as we read, <hi>Eſther</hi> 9.22. And if, when we faſt, and humble our ſelves before God, 'tis proper <hi>to deal our Bread to the hungry, when we ſee the naked to cover them, and ſatisfy the afflicted Soul</hi>; is it not reaſonable alſo when we are called to <hi>ſerve the Lord with gladneſs, and to come before his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with ſinging,</hi> to be in the exerciſe of that <hi>Charity</hi> which ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the Bowels of the poor and needy? Can there be a more fit Occaſion than a Day of religious Gladneſs and Thankſgiving, to open our Hands in liberal Diſtributions, cauſing the Widow's Heart to ſing
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005558_0020_10186852D1883090"/>
for Joy? Let us in this way, <hi>do good, for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT what I would more eſpecially recommend to you is, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all Chriſtian Compaſſion towards thoſe of the <hi>Enemies</hi> whom it has pleaſed God to put under our Power. <hi>Of old it was ſaid, thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine Enemy</hi>; but our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>love your Enemies.</hi> This <hi>Chriſtian Law</hi> muſt not indeed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> conſtrued in prejudice of that Love which we owe to our ſelves, our Families and Country, which may make it neceſſary to take up Arms: But when by this Means our Enemies are fallen into our Hands, we ſhould treat them, not only with Humanity, but Chriſtian Love; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to all the Offices of Kindneſs and Compaſſion towards them. We ſhould not inſult them, we ſhould not upbraid them, we ſhould not treat them with Harſhneſs and Severity; but endeavour to make their captive State as comfortable to them as may conſiſt with the publick Good.</p>
            <p>SOME of you, it may be, have Friends or Relatives among their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. How would you deſire they ſhould treat them? Would not you be glad, if they were kind to them? Would you not think hardly of them, if they ſhould ſhut up their Bowels of Compaſſion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have towards them with Diskindneſs? Let us treat thoſe who are our Captives in the ſame humane chriſtian Way, we ſhould be glad our Friends ſhould be treated, or our ſelves, were we in our Enemies Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. That is the Preſcription of the Bible, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.21. <hi>If thine Enemy be hungry, give him Bread to eat; and if he be thirſty, give him Water to drink.</hi> And the Reaſon follows in the next Verſe, <hi>For thou ſhalt heap Coals of Fire upon his Head, and the Lord ſhall reward thee.</hi>— But I have no need to uſe any Arguments upon this Head. I believe there is no Place where Priſoners of War are treated with more Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They have no Reaſon to complain for want of all reaſonable Liberty, or that they are not ſutably provided with all Things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Tho' the Caſe of ſome of them may be ſuch as to call for Chriſtian Charity; and in this Caſe, I would hope, there are none of us but would willingly open our Hands for their Relief; and in ſo doing we ſhould honour God, and behave like the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt: Nor ſhould we in any wiſe loſe our Reward; it would be laid up for us in Heaven.</p>
            <p>AND now as the Concluſion of all, May it pleaſe the good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God to over rule this glorious Conqueſt to an happy Iſſue, the Good of our <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Land.</hi> May he give all needed Direction as to reſettling the Place. And may all proper Care be taken, that the pure Goſpel of Chriſt be preached in this part of the Dominion of Antichriſt. May the Man of Sin, that Son of Perdition, be no longer acknowledged as Chriſt's Vicegerent. May all <hi>Graven Images</hi> be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down, all <hi>Superſtition</hi> removed, and the Religion of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as it is contained in the BIBLE, be upheld and practiced there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:005558_0021_10186855FA848F70"/>AND may the happy Period come on, when Nation ſhall no more life up Sword againſt Nation, nor the Alarm of War be heard on Earth. This happy Time can't be expected till the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has taken to himſelf his great Power and Reign; till he is ſeated <hi>King upon God's holy Hill of Zion,</hi> and has generally ſubdued the Luſts and Paſſions of Men: And when this is once the Caſe, that will be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led which is ſpoken by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, The Wolf ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid; and the Calf, and the young Lion, and the Fatling together, and a little Child ſhall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lie down together.— They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain.</hi> The Meaning is, Love and Peace ſhall reign on Earth among Men. The good Lord haſten this bleſſed Time, for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake in Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>
