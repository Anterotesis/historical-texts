            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>ELlis Pugh</hi> was born in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Dolgelle,</hi> in the County of <hi>Merionith,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> in the Sixth Month, 1656. His Parents were religious People, and he was left Fatherleſs and Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, <hi>like a Sparrow alone upon the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002950_0002_0FE64834A6B47A50"/>
Houſe-top.</hi> His Father dyed before he was born, and his Mother a few Days after: And when he was in his Youth, going with the Multitude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Folly, it pleaſed God by his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſtand in his Way, and cauſed him to <hi>conſider the Things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his Soul's everlaſting Peace.</hi> And in the Eighteenth Year of his Age the Lord viſited him more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, kindling a Zeal in him to ſerve his Creator more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">1674, when thoſe People ſuffered Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> having been alſo reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Teſtimony of <hi>John-ap-John,</hi> one of the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD, who promiſed <hi>to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Fatherleſs,</hi> took Care of him, and endued him with his Grace; and about the Year 1680, gave him a Part of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel of Chriſt, (notwithſtanding he was not one of the wiſe of this World, nor had humane Learning;) yet he was made, a
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:002950_0002_0FE64834A6B47A50"/>
profitable Inſtrument to turn divers from Vanity, and to exhort and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en many in their Spiritual Journey in his Native Land, and alſo in this Country, where he finiſh'd his Courſe.</p>
            <p>IN the Year 1686, He and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, with divers of his Acquaintance began their Journey to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and whilſt they ſtayed for the Ship to be ready, there came great Trouble and Exerciſe upon him, ſo that he was ſick for ſome Days; and in that Strait the Lord ſhewed unto him, that they ſhould meet with Troubles and Exerciſes in their Journey, and that he had a Work for him in that Country, and that he muſt return there again. After they ſailed, they met with Storms, Straits and Troubles; and having been upon the tempeſtuous <hi>Sea</hi> all Winter, they arrived in the <hi>Firſt Month</hi> at <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi> where they were joyfully and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly received by their Friends, and the Summer following, in the Year 1687
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:002950_0003_0FE6A13D0C691BD8"/>
they arrived in <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> After he had lived there till the Year 1706. a Concern remained upon him to viſit the Inhabitants of his Native Country, according to what the Lord revealed unto him before he came from thence. And after he had performed that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which was beneficial and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to many, he returned to his Family in the Year 1708. and a Concern came upon him to write the following Book, to direct the <hi>unlearned Britains</hi> of low Degree, to know God and Chriſt, the Life eternal; which he wrote for the moſt Part in his laſt Sickneſs.</p>
            <p>HIS Conduct in his <hi>Family,</hi> in his <hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> and in the <hi>Church</hi> was meek, loving, and peaceable; and his Miniſtry living, profitable, and to Edification, and his Converſation inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, chaſte and coupled with the Fear of God, honourable among his Friends, and of good Report among all People gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; and being patient in his tedious

            <p>THE Lord, out of his great Mercy hath long forbore, and often called after us, and in ſome Meaſure opened our Eyes to ſee the Emptineſs and Vanity which we followed, and at that Time in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for our Souls, endeavoured to ſeek the Way to pleaſe God. And in the Beginning of our aſſembling together in this Condition to wait
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:002950_0004_0FE6A13D27404760"/>
upon the Lord, it pleaſed him to prepare our Friend and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Ellis Pugh,</hi> to be a ſerviceable Inſtrument in his Hand, to cheriſh and inſtruct us in Meekneſs, and Tenderneſs, to obey that which God made known unto us of his Will, and to follow and underſtand the Operation of his Spirit, diſcovering to us the Snares of the Enemy of our Souls, his good Will, and loving Care (among others tha were fitted for the ſame Service) hath been a more profitable Means in the Hand of the Lord, towards directing and edifying of us in the Way of Truth, than the Miniſtry we had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from our Youth; for by the Tenderneſs and Influence which came as Dew upon our Souls, while we ſat under his Miniſtry, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his Doctrine was of God. He continued with the ſame Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in his Service, until he found

in his Heart to viſit his Country-People in his Native Land.</p>
            <p>WE believe his Viſit was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, where there was an open Door to receive it. After his Return, his Service and often Viſits to us were profitable.</p>
            <p>IT is with us to make ſome Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's Dealings with him, concerning which, we have obſerved, that the Lord was near unto him in the Time of his Trial.

And as the Angels were gone away, into Heaven, the Shepherds ſaid one to another, Let us go even unto Bethlehem, and ſee this Thing that is come to paſs which the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with Haſte, and they found Mary and Joſeph and the Babe lying in a Manger.

For when Chriſt comes to take Poſſeſſion in the Hearts of People, he ſets up his Kingdom, Law and Government; that is, the Law of the Spirit of Life which ſets free from the Law of Sin and Death; then the Devil loſeth his Kingdom, and loſeth his Subjects and Government in the Hearts of People when Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to caſt him out, and take the Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE the old ſubtil Enemy ſets all his Craſt to work to keep the Children of the World in his dark Kingdom, granting them all outward Means to deck themſelves to appear religious, and make them bold and confident of their being in

the Way: They may have as many Church-Traditions and Cuſtoms as they pleaſe, they may read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and what Books they will, and they may talk of Chriſt that he died for them, and roſe, and aſcended into Heaven, and that he ſits at the right Hand of the moſt High; for Satan is fully aſſur'd that all this is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to carry his Servants out of his Hands, therefore he will allow them every Thing but the Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> within, the Hope of Glory.</p>

their Condition, as he is the Spirit of Truth, to guide them into all Truth, as he is Life eternal, to quicken and heal the Souls that are wounded, weary, and heavy laden, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them from the Kingdom of Darkneſs into his, own Kingdom, to be under his Government, that ſo he may dwell in them, and they in him; Here <hi>Satan</hi> loſeth the Field, and his Subtilties come to be manifeſted.</p>
               <p>FOR if a Man had all Books and all Knowledge that may be in the World, and knew the Principles of every Profeſſion; and treaſur'd them up in his Head, yet except <hi>Chriſt</hi> takes Hold and Poſſeſſion of his Heart, there will be for all That, Room for <hi>Satan</hi> to make his Abode, and to work and keep Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; for where <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not Place to work on the Hearts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is moſt certain that <hi>Satan</hi> works there; for he is the Spirit that works in the Children of Diſobedience, and

he leads them into all Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>BUT the Rule which Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give his Followers, to walk by, and to be with them to the End of the World, was his own Spirit: <hi>Lo I will be with you to the End, I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever, even the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth,</hi> John xiv. 16, 17. who was to abide with them and to be in them; the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, who was to teach and guide them into all Truth. Is not this the one thing needful, without which it is in vain for Man to think that he can do any thing towards the Work of his Salvation?</p>
               <p>HE is alſo ſufficient of himſelf to lead his Followers in the Paths of Life; he giveth them <hi>Power to be Sons of God, for whoſoever are led by the Spirit of God, theſe are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> Rom. viii. 14. But the Dark People will ſay, Whoſoever

are led by the Scripture, are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, <hi>if ye thro' the Spirit do mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. viii. 13. But they ſay that through the Scripture the Deeds of the Body are mortify'd; but God thro' his Spirit did reveal to his People what <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man, the Things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 9. So the Things of God no Man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE there are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not receive the Spirit of God, they neither know nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures, nor the Things which he hath prepared for them that love him: <hi>But,</hi> ſaith the Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THIS Living Water is to be freely

Therefore is not the Privilege of knowing the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Living Waters in our ſelves made ſure to us, the Shepherds and poor Tradeſmen, rather than to the Men of Learning (who have filled themſelves with the Knowledge that puffeth up) or to the great Men? for it is a great Work for them to come down ſo low, to be taught by that which is ſo little in their ſight, as is the Seed of God's Kingdom; for it is too common in them the leaſt of all Seeds.</p>

               <p>WE ſee here how needful it is for every true Chriſtian to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf grafted in Chriſt the true Vine, and after he is ſo grafted, to abide in him, (that is) in his Grace, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Inſpiration, in his pure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Vertue, Love, and Fellowſhip in the inward Man. This is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sap that the Vine is full of, which aſcends up to the Branches,

cauſing them to grow, flouriſh, and bring forth ſweet Fruit, well pleaſing to the Husbandman, which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſprings forth from the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Root.

               <p>BUT after ſome Men ſtrive, and labour againſt Sin, and fail to get Victory, they are forced to yield, and drop Anchor in the Quickſand, and Place of Deſpair, believing there is no Power to be obtained to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Sin; but that the Saints and People of God muſt live in it all the Days of their Lives; and this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake

But the Voice of Chriſt and his Prophets and Apoſtles runs conſonant and agreeable the ſame Way like a Stream, but the Voice of the World is in it ſelf full of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and quite contrary to the Voice of the true Shepherd; but it is the Voice of a Stranger, therefore the Sheep run away from it, becauſe they know not the Voice of Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>John</hi> x. 5.

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002950_0028_0FE6A193DE7E9078"/>
the true Vine cauſeth the Branches to bear the ſame good Fruit. There is the ſame Virtue in the Grace to teach a godly Life, and the ſame Power in the Holy Spirit to guide into all Truth. And it is given to the Sons of God, to be with them to the End.</p>
               <p>BUT great is the Deceit of the old ſubtil Enemy, to keep People in his dark Kingdom, by making them believe, that the Spirit of God is not to be had to lead his People in theſe Ages. Therefore what may be thought of that? If the Spirit of God does not lead any in theſe Days, then God hath no People nor Children upon the Earth: It is true enough, that the Devil would have it ſo. For if the Spirit of God doth not lead a Man, he will be led by his own fleſhly Luſt, and the Spirit of this World, that is the Spirit of Satan, which leads into all Falſhood and Iniquities; for the Spirit of Man
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002950_0028_0FE6A193DE7E9078"/>
is ſubject to be led by ſome Spirit, and there are but two Spirits, and two Natures, to wit, <hi>Good and Evil,</hi> to govern the Hearts of People.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE the Enemy knows, that there is nothing draws a Man out of his Reach, but the Spirit of God, for which Cauſe he darkens and bewitches the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth, who are made drunk with the Wine of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Fornication, by putting Examples before them, of other Ways to be Children of God, beſides being led by his Spirit: But theſe Ways are ſo void of the Croſs, that after a Man comes at them, he may ſin as much as he will, to ſatisfy his fleſhly Luſts, and to ſerve the Devil: And altho' he allows them to have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to read, yet he will never grant them to come to that which the Scripture calls unto: For the Script<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as was ſaid before) calls all to Chriſt, and to the Knowledge of him
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002950_0029_0FE6A1A12B9AD398"/>
as he is to his Saints, a <hi>Spirit, Life, Light, Grace, Fountain, Vine, Shepherd,</hi> to work the new Birth.</p>
               <p>IT is true, that the Scriptures were given forth by the Inſpiration of God, and ſprung from his Spirit, which was in the Holy Men and Prophets, Chriſt himſelf and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles who were in the Spirit, and thro' the Spirit gave them forth, and their Teſtimonies are true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, for Counſel and Comfort, and Edification to every Traveller, that hath his Face towards <hi>New Jeruſalem:</hi> But it is poſſible, that a Man in a State of Nature (who is for fulfilling his Luſts) may ſin at his Pleaſure, notwithſtanding he has the Bible, which he could not do, if Chriſt by his Spirit had taken Hold and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Heart and Soul.</p>
               <p>BUT ſome may ſay, If the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had taken Hold of the Heart of Man, it might help him to forbear Sinning. Yet who will open the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002950_0029_0FE6A1A12B9AD398"/>
Heart to receive the Scripture, if not the Lord? He opened the Heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to receive what was ſpoken by <hi>Paul.</hi> In him alone is Power to open People's Hearts. For where Satan keeps Poſſeſſion, no good Thing ſhall come in, until he come that is ſtronger than he, to caſt him out, and take Poſſeſſion, and open the Heart to receive in, all the Goodneſs which God is pleaſed to vouchſafe to his People for their Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>FOR of a Truth, when Chriſt, by the Spirit of his Grace, takes hold on the Hearts of People, the Fear of God comes to take Place in them, cauſing them to tremble and cry for Help to depart from Iniquity. And the Lord is near, and ready to ſtand by them, againſt; the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan: And as they ſtand faithful, he diſtributes to them of the Spirit of his Grace, to leaven, change, and make them new Creatures.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002950_0030_0FE6A1D159B26A38"/>
Theſe come more and more, to be Partakers of the Divine Nature which is in the true Vine, to change their Nature and Affections, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to love God, and love all Good, and love all Men, love their Enemies, and pray for them, and do good to all Men.</p>

likewiſe ſay that the beſt World of the Saints are Sin.</p>
               <p>BUT it belongs to us here, in the firſt Place, ſeriouſly to conſider what is Sin, and from what Root, Spirit and Nature it ſprings, and is brought forth. Muſt not Sin be ſome Evil? If it is not Evil, how can it be called Sin? But if it is an Evil, it muſt ſpring from an evil Root, Spirit and Nature, and is, in ſome Meaſure, the Fruits of the Devil's Kingdom, which are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>WHAT then muſt we think of this Doctrine? To wit, that the beſt Works of the Saints and People of God, are Sin: By this their beſt Deeds muſt be evil; this is a Doctrine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural, ſenſual, dark and hurtful. They throw Dirt on the Goſpel, to defile the Work of God, and the heavenly Fruits of his Kingdom, which ſprung out thro' his Saints, Prophets and Apoſtles, and all the

godly, and thoſe that were grafted in the Vine, <hi>to wit,</hi> Chriſt, and their Words and Actions ſpringing from the Root and Spirit of the divine Nature; ſo that their Waters were clean, iſſuing out of the Rock where there is no Impurity.</p>
               <p>BUT it is poſſible they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the Words and Works of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men of old, did proceed from the Spirit of God, and Pure Root: And if they will acknowledge that, then I ſhall ſay, is not God the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the Rock is the ſame; the Vine and the Sap thereof is the ſame; and the ſame Spirit to lead into all Truth, which is to be with the Followers of Chriſt to the End of the World: Alſo Chriſt's Sheep are the ſame, and the ſame Shepherd they follow: The ſame God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THEREFORE I demand, how can the beſt Works of the Saints, be Sin, ſince they muſt ſpring out of the ſame Rock and ſame Fountain? But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome may ſay, all the Things of God are good in themſelves, but we are corrupt, and our Veſſels turn the Taſte of the good Things poured thereinto, and make them corrupt and ſinful. This may be granted as to the old dirty Veſſels, the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated Men, who are yet in the State of Nature, without being born again; but Chriſt makes his Saints and Followers new Veſſels, fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and keep the new Wine of the Kingdom of God; for, ſaid he, <hi>No Man putteth new Wine into old Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, elſe the new Wine doth burſt the Bottles, and the Wine is ſpilled, and

the Bottles will be marred, but new Wine muſt be put into new Bottles,</hi> Mar. ii. 22.</p>
               <p>BUT of a Truth, thoſe that plead for Sin (which is the Devil's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the Fruits of his Kingdom) muſt drop their Anchor in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which Doctrine hath dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Chriſtian World, and made drunk the Inhabitants of the Earth, by making them believe that the Spirit of God, in theſe Days, doth not lead the Children of God, and that Chriſt is not in his Saints, nor have they his Spirit; and that it will not avail People to wait for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt in themſelves, a Life to quicken them, and a Light to enlighten them, a Leader to guide them into all Truth, nor a Fountain to waſh and refreſh the Souls; therefore here is no Help for People, but to live in Sin all the Days of their Lives.</p>

                  </gap> to waſh Chriſtians away from on the Earth, and to ſhut out Chriſt and his Kingdom, and Reign, and Government, from amongſt and out of the Hearts of People, that ſo he may ſet up himſelf, and eſtabliſh his own dark Kingdom, Reign, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in the Hearts of People. And indeed he has carry'd on his Work to a large Degree, in the Night of Darkneſs which he brought in over the Profeſſors of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by making them Strangers to Chriſt and to his Work in their own Souls; teaching them to dig Wells for dead Waters; deſpiſing and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Fountain of living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſowing among them all manner of falſe Doctrine; making them believe that they muſt ſerve him (that is, <hi>Satan)</hi> and live in Sin all the Days of their Lives, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them Heaven after Death.</p>
               <p>SO ſome will alledge, that it is
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002950_0044_0FE6A1D29D0371C8"/>
the Will of God that Sin remain in the Saints, to keep them humble: This is not only unſcriptural, but clear contrary to the Nature of God, and againſt all good Reaſon; for Sin is the only thing that maketh Separation between Men and their Creator; and God, thro' all the Scripture, calls his People out of Sin, to Holineſs, Perfection, Cleanneſs of Hands and Purity of Heart, that they may ſtand with him in his Holy Place.</p>
               <p>SO the Nature of God is pure and holy, hating all manner of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Sin and Tranſgreſſion, which cannot dwell with him, how then is it that God deſireth that Sin ſhould dwell with him in his Saints? Is it not the Will of God to ſanctifie his People? 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> iv. 3. But the Will of the Devil is to keep People Sinners, whilſt they are upon the Earth, for every Sin is ſome Degree of Service to him, and inclines to pleaſe him;
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:002950_0045_0FE6A1D2C58DA180"/>
and ſo far it is againſt God, and tends to make him angry and diſpleaſed. But is it not a great Miſtake, that is, to take the Will of the Devil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Will of God?</p>
               <p>THESE do manifeſt themſelves to be Strangers to God and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity; and where God dwells, his Preſence is a Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-Fire to deſtroy all the Droſs and Filth: For he ſits as a Refiner of Silver in the Hearts of his Saints, to purify and to waſh them from all Sin. And the Debate is not, <hi>That Sin is in me,</hi> or, <hi>that Sin is in thee,</hi> but the Cauſe of it is for want of Chriſt's having his perfect Work in us, whoſe Blood cleanſeth from all Sin.</p>
               <p>BUT where they ſay, <hi>It is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Saints that Sin be in them, to keep them low and humble;</hi> This is but Ignorance: For it is contrary to all Reaſon that Sins make Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:002950_0045_0FE6A1D2C58DA180"/>
fit for the Kingdom of God; and it is a poor Defence to put one Sin to help out of another Sin. But ſurely it is the circumciſing Spirit of Chriſt that teaches his People to deny themſelves, and bear his Croſs. And the nearer they are to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Nature of Chriſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the more humble they are, the more mild, the leſſer in their own ſight to do any thing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for they know it will not avail them to ſtrive in their own ſtrength againſt the Power of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to break off their Sins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they have Chriſt with them a preſent Help, and be cloathed with his Spirit and heavenly Armour, that they may withſtand the Snares of the Devil.</p>
               <p>AND as they are taught by Chriſt, who ſaid, <hi>Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="76" facs="unknown:002950_0046_0FE6A1DCC4CD85D0"/>
his Followers to walk humbly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying themſelves, making them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and low in their own Eyes: But Sin and Satan make or teach People to be proud, high and lofty in their own ſight, great and better than any body elſe.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, where they ſay, <hi>The Saints and true Children and People of God daily ſin, in Thought, Word and Deed;</hi> it would be well for ſuch to conſider what Hope, what Promiſes, what Security they have that they are God's Children, further than that they preſume to call themſelves ſo. How can theſe think they love God, or gain his Love to their Souls, while they are daily ſinning againſt him, in Thought, Word and Deed? For where Sin daily breaks out in Word and Deed, that Man always ſerves the Devil, and he cannot love God, nor keep his Commandments, becauſe none can ſerve God and Mammon. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>If ye love
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:002950_0046_0FE6A1DCC4CD85D0"/>
me, keep my Commandments: He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf to him,</hi> Joh. xiv. 15, 21.</p>
               <p>WE ſee here the Mark which Chriſt put on his Sheep: So it is Life Eternal to know him and hear his Voice, follow him, love him and keep his Commandments; and the Man that comes to know theſe Things to be carried on in his Heart, he comes to have Aſſurance of his Inheritance. Was not this the Hope the Saints had in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, as <hi>John</hi> the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſciple ſaid, <hi>Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments: He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him; But whoſo keepeth his Word, in him verily is the Word of God perfected; hereby know we that
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:002950_0047_0FE6A1DCDFFCDF90"/>
we are in him,</hi> 1 Joh. ii. 3, 4, 5. But how can a Man think he is in God, or the Love of God in him, or that he is his Child or Servant, while he ſerveth Satan (the Enemy of Chriſt, and the Enemy of all Good) and ſinneth daily againſt the Lord in Thought, Word and Deed?</p>
               <p>AND Chriſt ſaid again, <hi>If a Man love me, he will keep my Words, and my Father will love him; We will come unto him and will make our Abode with him,</hi> Joh. xiv. 23. We ſee here from the Truth's own Mouth, that thoſe who love him muſt keep his Word and Commandments. Then there is a comfortable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſuch an One, that he ſhall obtain the Love of God to him, and that God and Chriſt will come to abide with him in his Heart; and when the Father and the Son come to dwell in the Heart of the True Chriſtian, how can the Devil have Room there? He muſt turn out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:002950_0047_0FE6A1DCDFFCDF90"/>
a ſtronger than he hath taken Poſſeſſion, and is come to govern the Heart.</p>
               <p>THEN the Child of God comes to be led by the Spirit of God, who leads none to do Evil, nor to ſin againſt him, but guides them into all Truth, ſetting them at Liberty from being Servants to Sin, <hi>Joh.</hi> viii. 32. Therefore they know they are of God, becauſe he hath given them of his Spirit, that works Hatred in them againſt all manner of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednedneſs (which is the Work of Satan) and teaches them to love God, and love one another, and deſire the Good of all, engaging them to ſerve their heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and keep his Commandments. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>He that keepeth his Commandments, dwelleth in him: And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us,</hi> 1 Joh. iii. 24. So the true Children of God that are born
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:002950_0048_0FE6A1E12D53D9F0"/>
of his Spirit, he abideth in them and they in him; that is, in his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in his Grace, in the undefiled Condition and pure Nature of his heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>AND while the true Chriſtian remains in this Spiritual State, his Words and Actions are begotten in that good Condition and Nature, and are carried forth by the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God's Spirit, and of a Truth, none of theſe are Sin, but theſe are the good Fruits which every good Tree and every Branch of the Vine are to bear, under the Pain of being cut off; for <hi>a good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit. Either make the Tree good, and his Fruit good, or elſe make the Tree corrupt, and his Fruit corrupt, for the Tree is known by its Fruit,</hi> Mat. vii. 18. xii. 33. Therefore God's Trees (that is his Children) bear good Fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:002950_0048_0FE6A1E12D53D9F0"/>WHAT then? Is not here a fit Place for the Reader to enquire, <hi>Do not God's Children Sin at all? or doth he cut them off when they ſin?</hi> Indeed it muſt be granted that the Children ſometimes do ſin, and their Father doth not caſt them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: For to ſin at ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Provocation, which comes ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſingly, and to an unſavoury Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuddenly breaking out in Word, or Action, this diſpleaſes the Father, and wounds their own Conditions: But theſe are not the Children's beſt Works, but their worſt Works; and indeed there is great Difference between this, and ſinning daily, in Thought, Word, and Action, and that their beſt Works are Sin.</p>
               <p>FOR where are thoſe Children, tho' they dwell in their Father's Houſe, and in his Service, but at ſome Time, and in ſome Things, they diſpleaſe their Father, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Reproof of Inſtruction to
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:002950_0049_0FE6A1E14E27D338"/>
make them the more careful not to do ſo again: So the Children of God learn daily of God, and they grow in Grace, Knowledge, and ſpiritual Gifts, and they go further and further from Sin, and nearer and nearer unto God, by witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Son, to cleanſe them from all Sin.</p>
               <p>BUT ſuch as do plead, and hold that the beſt Works of the Saints are Sin, they endeavour to come to the Scriptures to verifie their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine by bringing the Words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> when he was praying for the Sons of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and as it is common, when God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are praying for the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to put themſelves with them in interceding for them, tho' they are yet Sinners; or as thoſe People were, when they had departed from the Lord: Therefore he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>We are all as an unclean Thing, and all our Righteouſneſſes are as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

Rags, and we all do fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like the Wind have taken us away,</hi> Iſa. lx 4.6. See here how theſe were fallen, and their Iniquities had carried them away from the Lord. <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy Name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee; for thou haſt hid thy Face from us, and haſt conſumed us becauſe of our Iniquities,</hi> Ver. 7.</p>
               <p>SO their Sins diſpleaſed God, and made him hide his Face from them and their Righteouſneſſes, which were as filthy as Rags; and the Lord was weary with them, ſuch were their Offerings, and Sacrifices, their New Moons and Sabbaths, their appointed Feaſts and outward Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, by which they thought that they pleaſed the Lord, heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto themſelves Offerings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Obedience, upon which he would not look, but rather weary of bearing them, and complaining

againſt them, as may be ſeen by the ſame Prophet, ſaying, <hi>To what Purpoſe is the Multitude of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices unto me, ſaith the Lord, I am full of the Burnt-Offerings of Rams, and the Fat of fed Beaſts, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in the Blood of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of He Goats: When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your Hand, to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblations; Incenſe is an Abomination unto me, the New Moons and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, the calling of Aſſemblies I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with; it is Iniquity, even the Solemn Meeting. Your New-Moons and your appointed Feaſts my Soul hateth; they are a Trouble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I am weary to bear them: And when ye ſpread forth your Hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you; yea, when you make many Prayers, I will not hear, your Hands are full of Blood,</hi> Iſa. i. 11, 12, 15, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:002950_0050_0FE6A2808D1E69E8"/>ARE not theſe the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which were, and are in the Sight of the Lord, as filthy Rags, abominable and unſavoury, upon whom he does not look? Thoſe People intended to pleaſe the Lord with their Traditions and outward Ceremonies, which they accounted Service to him, and their Duties to perform: But becauſe they were a ſinful Generation, a People laden with Iniquities, and had backſlidden, and refuſed the Lord, and grieved the holy One of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> therefore the Lord did not look favourably upon, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of their Offerings, but rather hated them, and was weary to bear them.</p>
               <p>AND tho' theſe were their beſt Works, and the Righteouſneſſes which they truſted in, yet none of them were acceptable with God: Therefore he hid his Face from
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:002950_0051_0FE6A1F0972AE880"/>
thoſe People, for that their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had carried them away from him, to rebel againſt him, and to diſpleaſe him daily; ſo when they prayed much, he did not hearken unto them; for their Hearts were evil, and their Hands full of Blood: But what are theſe Righteouſneſſes to be likened to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, who juſtifies his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers under the New Covenant, by waſhing, cleanſing, purifying and ſanctifying of them, by his Grace and Spirit, and fitting them to ſerve God in Newneſs of Life? Alſo what are the beſt Works of the Children of the New Birth, Sheep and Lambs of Chriſt, Branches of the true Vine, which Bears Spiritual Fruit, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſweet Root, pure and uncorrupted, ſuch as Chriſt by his Spirit, leads into all Truth?</p>
               <p>BUT they have another Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they think is ſtrong, and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:002950_0051_0FE6A1F0972AE880"/>
impoſſible to anſwer, and that from the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> who ſpoke the moſt, and the cleareſt of all the Saints (whoſe Teſtimonies we have) againſt Sin, <hi>If we ſay that we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us,</hi> 1 John i. 8. But what of that? did not the Apoſtle in this Place, put himſelf among others, even all thoſe who had received the Chriſtian Faith? And it is very poſſible that divers of them were young, and weak, and did not know their Sins, or were not come to acknowledge them: Therefore he ſaid, <hi>If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all Unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 1 John i. 9.</p>
               <p>SO the Deſign of the Apoſtle was to bring them to confeſs their Sins by Repentance, that the Lord might forgive them, and cleanſe them there-from, and not live
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:002950_0052_0FE6A1F24491E048"/>
therein all their Days; as he ſaid before, <hi>If we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one with another, and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin,</hi> Ver. 7. So he was for having them waſhed, cleanſed, purify'd, and ſanctify'd. Therefore I cannot ſee any Reaſon to grant <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple himſelf to be a Sinner, any more than <hi>James</hi> was a Curſer, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he did put himſelf among others when he ſpoke concerning the Tongue, <hi>Therewith bleſs we God, even the Father; and therewith curſe we Men, which are made after the Similitude of God: Out of the ſame Mouth proceedeth Bleſſings and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> Jam. iii. 9, 10. My Brethren, theſe Things ought not ſo to be.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE who can think otherwiſe, but <hi>James</hi> was clear of that Sin which he was judging in his Brethren? And without Doubt
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:002950_0052_0FE6A1F24491E048"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> was waſhed and cleanſed from his Sins, tho' they, unto whom he wrote, were not then throughly purged, ſome in a large Degree cleanſed, others in a leſs Meaſure, ſome being young and weak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning their Pilgrimage; therefore he ſaid, the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us. So he goes on in the ſecond Chapter, <hi>My lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children, theſe Things write I unto you, that ye ſin not: And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one ſin, we have advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> 1 John ii. 1.</p>
               <p>WE may ſee here what wrong Uſe People make of <hi>John</hi>'s Words, that he wrote to his Friends, to perſwade them againſt Sinning, which theſe take for an Occaſion to live in Sin, and plead for it; but if any thro' Temptation ſinned, he ſhewed them the Help and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which they might have; even to walk in the Light, that
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:002950_0053_0FE6A1F260519AF8"/>
the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt might cleanſe them from all Sin: So he goes on, <hi>Whoſoever committeth Sin, tranſgreſſeth alſo the Law; for Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 John iii. 4. By this it is plain; and who can deny that Sin breaks the Law of God, that he writes in the Hearts of his People? which every true Chriſtian is bound to keep, and perform, under the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of being cut off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AND ye know, that he was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to take away our Sins, and in him is no Sin,</hi> Ver. 5. So that this is the End of Chriſt's Appearance in the Fleſh, and alſo by his Spirit in the Hearts of his People, even to take away their Sins, and deliver them there-from, and to make them in their Meaſures to be like himſelf in whom there is no Sin.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, <hi>Whoſoever abideth in him, ſinneth not; whoſoever ſinneth, hath not ſeen him, neither known him,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:002950_0053_0FE6A1F260519AF8"/>
Ver. 6. That is, whilſt a Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in the Spirit of Chriſt, even in the good Condition and Nature, he ſinneth not; but thoſe that are contenting themſelves to abide dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Sin, theſe do not know nor come unto him who is to waſh them: <hi>O little Children, let no Man deceive you; He that doth Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is righteous, even as he is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil, for the Devil ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the Beginning. For this Purpoſe the Son of God was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> Ver. 8.</p>
               <p>SO as Satan ſinneth daily from his Beginning to his End, and the People that do ſo, they are like him, to whom they are Servants and Subjects; but the Work of Chriſt is to deſtroy his Works, and to ſet People free from his Priſons and Servitude. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin, for his Seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:002950_0054_0FE6A201EB1E5C50"/>
in him, and he cannot ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is born of God,</hi> Ver. 9.</p>
               <p>SO every true Chriſtian is in ſome Meaſure born of God, and the Seed or God remains in him, and he in God; and whilſt a Man remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him, he cannot ſin, as Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>He that doth Truth, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God,</hi> Joh. iii. 21. And the Works that are wrought in God, they are all pure; for no Evil can be brought forth in him; therefore a Chriſtian in the Spirit, and in the Power and Nature of God, cannot ſin.</p>
               <p>BUT inaſmuch as there are many of ſeveral different Opinions, and all Societies in general conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the true Church, and every body elſe in Darkneſs and Error; and that the Ordinances and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of [their] Church only, is the true Service and Duties which pleaſe God, therefore they are ready to ſay,

               </p>
               <p>AND ſome are ſo bold and ſhameleſs as to ſay, None were ever perfect upon Earth. Theſe do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately give God the Lie, who ſaid concerning <hi>Job, That he was a perfect Man.</hi> And if <hi>Job</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as without doubt he was, and divers others before Chriſt came in the Fleſh, how much more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the God of Heaven call for and expect Perfection under the New Covenant, when he po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s forth of his Spirit more plentifully into the Hearts of his People, and writes his Law there.</p>
               <p>HOW then is Perfection become impoſſible under the new Covenant? Shall we ſay that Chriſt lays upon his Followers Burthens impoſſible for them to bear, who ſaid, <hi>My Yoke is eaſy, and my Burden is light,</hi> Mat.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:002950_0055_0FE6A2020C23F0D0"/>
xi. 30. So he commanded them, <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven is perfect,</hi> Mat. v. 48. So that Perfection is poſſible for the Children of God to attain in this Life, <hi>Becauſe greater is he that is in them, than he that is in the World,</hi> 1 Joh. iv. 4.</p>
               <p>GREATER and ſtronger is the Power of God, who helps his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and People to overcome all Sin and Iniquity, and to give them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to follow and ſerve him in Obedience, Perfection, Sanctification and Cleanneſs of Hands, than is the Power of the Devil, who leads and brings his Followers into Sin and Iniquity.</p>
               <p>BUT People, by pleading for Sin, that they muſt remain in it, (which is the Enemy's Work, and the Fleſh's Luſt, whereby they rebel againſt God, and ſin againſt their own Souls) they clearly deny the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which they came under at

               <p>SO this Man believed, if he had God's Grace to help him, it was
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:002950_0057_0FE6A205245FBCB0"/>
poſſible for him to overcome Sin, and forbear committing Iniquity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and likewiſe he could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf but backſlide daily, unleſs the Lord would deliver him out of all Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>BUT there are ſome People that ſeem Religious by ſetting themſelves at Work to lop the Tree of Iniquity, endeavouring to cut away the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as they grow; This is the hopeleſs Labour and Striving which they eſteem profitable for them to be at all their Days, and leave the Tree alive, and to bear Branches, that they may be daily employed to lop them.</p>
               <p>WHAT then? Do they think if the Tree dies, that they have no more to do towards the Work of their Salvation? But of a Truth, the Salvation of the Soul is to know the inward ſpiritual Grace to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Tree, by killing the Root of it, ſo that there may be Room
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:002950_0057_0FE6A205245FBCB0"/>
for the Tree of Life, even the Truth, Chriſt within, to grow in the Soul, and to bring forth his own good Fruits.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE let every true. Chriſtian lay down his own Axe, and pray to God for Grace to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and ſlay all his ſinful Luſts, and to give him Victory over the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and all his Temptations, Sin and iniquity; but I believe that ſome People have ſought Help from God againſt all Iniquity and ſinful Luſts, and that he heard them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed unto them a Meaſure of his Grace and Spirit, ſo that their Words and Actions, in Degree, ſprung from the Spirit of God, and from a good State and Condition.</p>
               <p>BUT for all That, their Principles oblige them to account all their Actions (let them be bad or good) altogether Sin; and in that they wrong the Lord, and injure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; becauſe their Rudiments do
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:002950_0058_0FE6A2115FAE36D8"/>
not allow them to make a Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Bad and Good, and become as the Mouth of the Lord: For when a Child of God offends, he ſoon knows Chaſtiſeme it from his Father, as a Cloud coming over him, with Guilt and Trouble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Father hides his Face; but when he does well, his Father ſmiles upon him, rewarding him with Conſolation and Joy, and ſpeaking Peace to him; ſo the Child knows, that it was not Sin he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at that time.</p>

               <p>BUT this is the Birth, which People, in a State of Nature, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know, or comprehend no more than <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> until the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to work in their own Souls: For by Spiritual Means God works the New Birth in the Hearts of his People.

He is alſo the Fountain of living Waters which People reject: And the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Water is to waſh and to heal.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="unknown:002950_0059_0FE6A2117ABC0A90"/>
they are ſpiritually diſcerned. And Fleſh has no Room to ſet it ſelf at Work. Therefore unconverted Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt have all Things carnal and outward, that Fleſh and Blood may comprehend them, and, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures and human Reaſon, debate and labour in them.</p>
               <p>BUT the Lord, in Condeſcenſion to his own People, the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> delivered to them divers Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Uſages, <hi>to wit,</hi> Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Purification, Offerings and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, which were outward Things, to ſignify the Subſtance which was to be revealed in the Fulneſs of Times. And thoſe Shadows and Signs were to remain and ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Time of Reſtoration; that is, till Chriſt came to ſet up a more ſubſtantial and ſpiritual Miniſtry and Worſhip: And their Waſhings went under the Name of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT next after all thoſe Signs and Shadows, the Lord, for prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:002950_0059_0FE6A2117ABC0A90"/>
the Way to Chriſt, ſent <hi>John</hi> to baptize the People in <hi>Jordan,</hi> confeſſing their Sins; and then <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance, but he that cometh after me, is mightier than I, whoſe Shoes I am not worthy to bear, he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire,</hi> Mat. iii. 11.</p>
               <p>SO there was a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Baptiſm of Chriſt, and the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> becauſe they were not of one Nature nor of one Matter: For the one baptized with outward Water, and the other bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the Holy Ghoſt and with ſpiritual Fire; the one waſhed the Body, the other waſhed the Soul. So Chriſt commanded his Diſciples, <hi>that they ſhould not depart from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, but wait for the Promiſe of the Father, which,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ye have heard of me: For John truly baptized with Water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt not many Days hence,</hi> Acts i. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:002950_0060_0FE6A214386076F0"/>THESE two Teſtimonies do well agree with each other, and both make the Baptiſm of Chriſt, and the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> to be two Baptiſms. The Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was an outward Shadow <hi>ſignifying,</hi> but the Baptiſm of Chriſt was the Subſtance, and <hi>ſaving.</hi> The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of <hi>John</hi> and his Miniſtry ſtood only in Force at the Time when Chriſt walked upon the Earth; therefore Chriſt went to his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm for the Fulfilling of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: But <hi>John</hi> endeavoured to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, ſaying, <hi>I have need to be baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me? And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Suffer it to be ſo now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Then John ſuffered him,</hi> Mat. iii. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>AND as <hi>John</hi> and his Miniſtry and Baptiſm was to decreaſe, and paſs by, ſo Chriſt and his Baptiſm and Miniſtry was to increaſe, and
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:002950_0060_0FE6A214386076F0"/>
to be ſet up and ſtand to the End. So that the Baptiſm of Chriſt was the only Baptiſm which did, and doth deliver and ſave the Souls; therefore the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> Eph. iv. 5. And ſince there was but one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to remain, no more than but one Lord and one Faith and one God, doubtleſs it is, that Chriſt's Baptiſm was that one Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>BUT Jeſus ſuffered his Diſciples to baptize with Water, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh <hi>John</hi>'s Adminiſtration, until the Time came to baptize with the Holy Spirit; and as the Diſciples loved <hi>John,</hi> and eſteemed his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and being natural to it by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ordinances, ſo they made Uſe thereof in their Freedom among thoſe that believed; but they knew it was not the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when he preached at the Houſe of <hi>Cornelius, And the Holy Ghoſt fell
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:002950_0061_0FE6A21464257AA0"/>
upon the People, ſaying, then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred I the Word of the Lord, how that he ſaid,</hi> John <hi>indeed baptized with Water, but ye ſhall he baptized with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts xi. 16.</p>
               <p>BUT when Darkneſs came in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Chriſtians, and they loſt Sight of Chriſt within, and the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, then there was Nothing but extolling the Sign inſtead of the Subſtance, and ſet it up as the Horn of Salvation, and give it a great Name in the Church, accounting it to be the Means by which a Man is made Chriſtian. But ſome uſe the Way of Water-Baptiſm as the Apoſtles did, without depending thereon, but to fulfil it, becauſe they think it their incumbent Duty: I do not judge ſuch.</p>
               <p>BUT the Hurt is, when People ſet up ſome outward Tradition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon it for Salvation, their Zeal goes much for it, and the
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:002950_0061_0FE6A21464257AA0"/>
more their Zeal is, the more they make it their Idol, and then they cannot bear ſo much as to ask from whence it came, what Scripture is for it: There is in this dark Zeal, Gall, Blood and Revenge; and ſuch Zeal as this has been the Cauſe for the Martyrs of Jeſus frequently to loſe their Blood; becauſe the Meſſage of the Ambaſſadors which God ſent was to bear Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Manner of Idols.</p>
               <p>AND when Chrifſtians came to be fully perſwaded, that Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was neceſſary to Salvation, they judged it needful to baptize little Children, leſt they ſhould die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had Baptiſm, and be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but when they ſaw it was hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for ſome little Children to be dipt over Head in Water, then they invented another Way to baptize, which is corrupt and unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
               <p>AND altlho' the Proteſtants have
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:002950_0062_0FE6A2200CD49B60"/>
teſtify'd that Water-Baptiſm was not neceſſary to Salvation, and as the friendly and conſiderate People of the Church of <hi>England</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that Water-Baptiſm does Nothing for the Soul, yet the ſame, in the like corrupt Way, has crept in among them from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo far, that the dark Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among the Proteſtants are of the ſame Tone as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> Oh! Oh! the holy Baptiſm: Oh! make the Man a Chriſtian; ſo that when a Child is born into the World, they muſt make haſte to go with him (as they ſay) to make him a
Chriftian.</p>
               <p>NOW therefore, O thou inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Man, canſt thou bear us to take a View of, and handle this Matter a little, to ſee if there is Life in it, and how far it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the Scriptures. They ſay, that Chriſt ordained two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Church, when we do
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:002950_0062_0FE6A2200CD49B60"/>
not read that Chriſt ever ſpoke of a Sacrament; nor is there any ſuch Word as Sacrament in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But they will ſay, the Thing does not conſiſt in the Name, but what we mean by this Sacrament is Baptiſm; what then? Is this Way of Baptiſm which we now ſpeak of more agreeable to the Scriptures than the Word Sacrament? That is not yet made out.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, they will ſay, we are all by Nature born Children of Wrath, and by Baptiſm are made Children of Grace: I utterly deny, that little Children new-born, are Children of Wrath; and alſo, that, by ſuch Baptiſm (which we are now ſpeaking of) any are made Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Grace. Are not new-born Children without Sin? Truly before Sin came, God looked on all that he had made, and the ſame was good in his Sight: But they ſay, when <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſſed, he brought
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:002950_0063_0FE6A2202C0593B8"/>
in Sin upon all his Offspring, and they are Partakers of his Tranſgreſſion, and that the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> are by Nature become Sinners. That is granted; but that they are born Children of Wrath, and that God imputeth Sin to them before they do ſin, That is deny'd</p>
               <p>FOR the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Rom. iv. 15. Since that the States of new-born Children do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, nor can they reach to come at any Law; therefore Iniquity is not laid to their Charge; <hi>For Sin is not imputed, where there is no Law,</hi> Rom. v. 13. So where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tranſgreſſion nor Sin, how can we think there is Damnation? But thoſe that hold forth the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of little Children, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they have a Foundation for it from the Words of the Prophet, who ſaid, <hi>I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:002950_0063_0FE6A2202C0593B8"/>
me,</hi> Pſal. li. 5. Is not this Sin ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be imputed to the Parents than the Child? For he doth not ſay, my Mother conceived me a Sinner, but in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</p>
               <p>AND the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall Die: The Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Father, neither ſhall the Father bear the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Son,</hi> Ezek. xviii. 20. But for the Iniquity the Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf commits, he ſhall die. O, I would think that Chriſt's own Words are ſufficient to give Satisfaction to every conſiderate and impartial Man, and put this Controverſy out of all Doubt, who extolled the State of little Children, ſaying to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Except ye be converted, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. xviii. 3, 4, 10.</p>
               <p>WE may ſee here, how Chriſt owns the States of little Children
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:002950_0064_0FE6A221716CE888"/>
above the States of his Diſciples, when they inquired who ſhould be the greateſt in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, <hi>And he having called unto him a little Child, and ſetting him in the Midſt of them,</hi> he further ſaid, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore ſhall humble himſelf as this little' Child, the ſame is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Kingdom of Heaven; take Heed that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little Ones; for I ſay unto you, that in Heaven their Angels do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Here is the Judgment of the King, who knows better than Men, who is fit to enter into his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>HE alſo is the Door of the Sheep, and he knoweth his own, and thoſe that go in by him: If any be ſo ignorant to think, that thoſe Children whom Chriſt ſo much owned, were baptized, there was no bapti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing of little Children in thoſe Times; and there is no Cauſe
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:002950_0064_0FE6A221716CE888"/>
to think, that the Condition of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children is worſe now, than in thoſe Times: So the Command of Chriſt was, <hi>Take Heed, that ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not one of theſe little Ones, whoſe Angels behold God's Face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT dark People take little No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what Chriſt ſaid; but the Rudiments which they have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Tradition, from the Leaders of their Churches, thoſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and will have to be Truth: Therefore they are not afraid to diſeſteem the State of little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are newly come into the World, from under the Hand of their perfect Creator, who made all Things good, and according to his own Pleaſure; but they reckon the Child a Jew, or ſome unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Stranger, 'till they go with him to the Prieſt, to be made (as they judge) a Chriſtian, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:002950_0065_0FE6A22196CB7EB8"/>AND if the Child dies before he be baptized, they deem it not fit to bury him like a Chriſtian, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Order of the Church; but when the Child hath been under the Prieſt's Hands, if he happens to die before he ſinneth, there is no Doubt of his Salvation: What then ſhall be thought of theſe Things? Did not God know how, or was he not able to make the Child according to his own Mind? But the Prieſt does know how, and is able to make him according to the Lord's Mind; ſo that it is Time to go with the Child to the Prieſt, where Sureties muſt be had, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for him: Firſt, <hi>That he ſhould deny the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomp and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the Points of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That he ſhould keep the bleſſed Will of God, and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Commandment's, and walk in the ſame all the Days of his Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND altho' they themſelves judge, that they are not able to perform theſe Promiſes, yet it is eaſy to get thoſe Sureties; but if they were to be bound by Promiſes concerning Things of this World, they would take more Care before they become engaged, how they might perform their Promiſes.</p>
               <p>SO after having a little Water, the Prieſt goes and prays to God, that he would ſanctify that Water, ſo that it may waſh away Sin; then the ſinful Man goes to waſh the innocent from his Sins: But what is this good for? There is no Reaſon, nor Scripture, nor any Proof, but Part of the dead Traditions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, for ſuch a Thing.</p>
               <p>THEN the Prieſt calls the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be Witneſſes how that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Body of the Church of Chriſt, and ſo gives Thanks to God for the Child, that he is born again by the Holy Ghoſt, and received to be his own Child by Adoption; and then they profeſs, that the Child from henceforth, is made a Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>BUT this is a great Work, if it were but done indeed, where there is a Neceſſity for a Change, and Newneſs of Life: But this may be allow'd, <hi>to wit,</hi> that the Child at firſt, is a Member of Chriſt, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven, and that he is yet no worſe, nor in a State to be made better: But if neither the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor the Prieſt know no better than theſe Things, the Lord enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them.</p>
               <p>BUT I do believe, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them know, that all this is but the Uſe, Cuſtom and Tradition
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:002950_0066_0FE6A2372896F9D8"/>
of the Church, and therefore they do judge it a Duty upon them to perform: But the Traditions and outward Cuſtoms become corrupt in the Uſing, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Coloſſians, Wherefore if ye be dead with Chriſt from the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the World, why, as tho' living in the World, are ye ſubject to Ordinances (which all are to periſh with the Uſing) after the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Doctrines of Men? which Things have indeed a Shew of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Will-Worſhip,</hi> Col. ii. 20.22, 23.</p>
               <p>WHAT then? Is not this Way of baptizing little Children not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupt with the Uſing, but alſo formed in the Dark, and ſet up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Commandments and Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of Men, and carried on in Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Worſhip, after the Ordinances and Rudiments of this World, and not after Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:002950_0067_0FE6A23744BA8A70"/>NOW therefore ſhall we conſider a little, what Neceſſity there is for outward Water in the Baptiſm? But thoſe that are for <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, they have Need of Water to dip the People; but as many as come to Chriſt to be baptized by him, he baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt: For the Baptiſm of Chriſt is the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, which is the Subſtance: but the Baptiſm of <hi>John (to wit,</hi> Water-Baptiſm) was the Figure or Shadow thereof.</p>
               <p>BUT there are many in theſe Days that would tie the Baptiſm of Chriſt and <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm together, and make them one Baptiſm, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the outward Water, which is the Shadow, is one Part, and the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Grace within, is the other Part, which is knit to it. Is not this Way cunningly deviſed to beguile the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or the Salvation or their Souls? For it muſt be believed, if they but
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:002950_0067_0FE6A23744BA8A70"/>

               <p>SO of a Truth, all this is but to pleaſe the Fleſh and ſelf-End of Man, who hath been aſſerting, that he had a Part in Chriſt, tho' he lived in the Fleſh, where none can pleaſe God, and in ſuch Pomp wherein he cannot receive the Spirit of Truth: And where they ſay, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is tied to the Shadow; The Face of the preſent World is as Clouds of Witneſſes to the contrary, ſeeing that the Life and Converſation of Thouſands of thoſe who profeſs Chriſt, and have been baptized with Water, are worſe than the Lives and Converſations of <hi>Turks, Indians</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> who were not baptized with Water.</p>
               <p>BY which we may ſee, that the ungodly and irreligious Profeſſors
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:002950_0068_0FE6A238ABFD71B0"/>
have not yet been baptized into the Baptiſm of Chriſt, which is the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Holy Ghoſt, that clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from dead Works, and makes Man a new Creature, to live a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life; whereby it is evident enough that the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Baptiſm of Water are two diſtinct Things.</p>
               <p>SO that it is poſſible for a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man to be baptized with Water, and know Nothing of the Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit: But the Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt are baptized by him with the Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit, without elementary Water; and yet ſome will ſay, that the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was to follow the Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit, becauſe the Apoſtles baptized with Water, and that Chriſt had given it them in Command.</p>
               <p>THAT the Apoſtles baptized with Water is granted: But that Chriſt gave it them in Command, is nor yet made out: But they are
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:002950_0068_0FE6A238ABFD71B0"/>
ready to ſay, hath not Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles? <hi>Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teach all Nations, baptizing them into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. xxviii. 19. But I would think, that in as much as there is no Mention of Water, we have Room to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what one did Chriſt command? Was it his own Baptiſm, which was the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, or was it the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> which was Water Baptiſm?</p>
               <p>AND in as much as, then was the very Time, wherein the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Miniſtry of Chriſt was to be ſet up in Authority, being taken from under the Shadows and Signs; and that to baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, was the Work of Chriſt, and that he at that Time was to pour forth of his Spirit on his Miniſters, to ſend them on his own Work: What Reaſon therefore will tell us, that he ſet his Miniſters upon <hi>John</hi>'s
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:002950_0069_0FE6A238CC647C40"/>
Works (which was not but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Shadow paſſing by) inſtead of ſending them on his own ſpiritual Work, after he had filled them with his Spirit, and cloathed them with Power from on High, fit for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that ſpiritual Work?</p>
               <p>BUT the Oppoſer will ſay, It was the Work of Chriſt only to baptize with the Spirit, and the Apoſtles could not do it, becauſe they were but Men. It is true enough that it is the Work of Chriſt to baptize with the Holy Spirit: What then? was it impoſſible for Chriſt's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to do any of his Works, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they received of the Spirit of Chriſt, even the Holy Ghoſt which did baptize? But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doubt the Servants of Chriſt did his Work, by his being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working with them; for when they taught and preached where the Lord had ſent them, they were Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Hand to do a great
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:002950_0069_0FE6A238CC647C40"/>
Work; that is, to turn People from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, thro' his Co-working to open the Hearts of People.</p>
               <p>AND for this End <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent, and not to baptize with Water: As we read when the Lord was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and calling him, he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Riſe, and ſtand upon thy Feet; for I have appeared unto thee for this Purpoſe, to make thee a Miniſter and a Witneſs both of theſe Things which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe Things in the which I will appear unto thee, delivering thee from the People, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee, to open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, that they may receive Forgiveneſs of Sins, and Inheritance among them which are ſanctified by Faith which is in me,</hi> Acts xxvi. 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>LET us therefore ſee the great
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:002950_0070_0FE6A2419C2C8640"/>
Work which <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to labour in, which was the Work of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Souls of People, and the thing he was employed about, even to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, to obtain Forgiveneſs of Sins, and a Portion amongſt thoſe that are ſanctified. Here is the Work of the New Birth, even Chriſt's Work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Souls of Men: Here alſo is the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>AND as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was an Inſtrument in the Hand of the Lord, ſent upon this Work; ſo by preaching of the true Goſpel he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Commandment, by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them into the Name of the Father, who is the ſtrong Tower, and turning them unto him who is the Light; and baptizing them into the Name of the Son, who is the Rock of Ages, Jeſus the Saviour, Chriſt the Anointed, the Fountain of Living Waters; which Water doth
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:002950_0070_0FE6A2419C2C8640"/>
waſh away Sin and Iniquity, that they may receive Forgiveneſs of Sins; by baptizing them into the Name of the Holy Ghoſt, who ſanctifieth and giveth them Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>SO <hi>Paul</hi> taught the Gentiles, and they were baptized with the Holy Ghoſt under his Teſtimony. After this manner was the Commandment fulfill'd, <hi>Go teach all Nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them into the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And this Apoſtle that was ſent to turn the Nations, was not ſent to baptize with Water, as he himſelf teſtified when he ſaw that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were corrupted, by making a wrong Uſe of Water-Baptiſm, and that Contentions were among them; and, as it may be ſuppoſed, ſome ſaid, <hi>I am owned by the Man that baptized me,</hi> and, <hi>I am owned by the Man that baptized me;</hi> which gave the Apoſtle Occaſion to ſay, <hi>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but</hi>

               <p>AND in as much as this was the Apoſtle that was moſt abſolutely ſent to teach and convert the Nations, and was not ſent to baptize with Water; and that Commandment ſaid, <hi>Go ye, and teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them into the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> therefore it was not outward Water that was here commanded to go with the Teſtimonies of the Apoſtles, but the Living Water and Eternal Word, which is the Sword of the Spirit that is as a Fire, and as a Hammer to break in pieces the hard Hearts.</p>
               <p>THUS Life and Virtue went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with their Preachings: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

whether God works upon the Hearts of People by Inſtruments, or without Inſtruments, the Work is the Lord's. And ſush as know his Work to be carried on in their own Souls, they ſee no Neceſſity for Signs and Shadows, that were to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or do periſh with the Uſing.

the Work of Regeneration, and it belongs to every Birth to have Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment ſuitable to its Condition and Nature, ſo it belongs to the Children of the New Birth, that are born of the Spirit, to have Spiritual Food to nouriſh their Souls, as the natural Body is fed with outward Food: This ſpiritual Food the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall, cannot know or apprehend, nor be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of, till the Lord, in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, lays hold on their Hearts, and enlightens them, and lets them ſee their Conditions, and makes them ſenſible of the Neceſſity and Want of their Souls, and lets a Man ſee how he is gone from home, as the Prodigal Son, into a far Country, a Stranger to his Father's Houſe, where is Bread enough, and he ready to die for Hunger: Then the poor Soul, having a Sight of his Condition, cries for his Father's Houſe; becauſe he is got into a Belief, that there is

               <p>SO the Soul that comes to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, the Promiſe is, <hi>That ſuch ſhall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> Mat. v. 6. For the Lord prepares pleaſant Dainties for the Poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that turns to him with his whole Heart, and waits upon him in Truth. So when a Man comes to witneſs theſe Things, he is in ſome Degree to be counted a Child of the New-Birth, becauſe he cries for Food, and Food belongs to him; and he is ready to open unto Chriſt, who knocks at the Door, ſaying, <hi>If any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me,</hi> Rev. iii. 20.</p>
               <p>SO that Chriſt is ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and the hungry Soul rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive Nouriſhment: And this is the Supper which gives Life, Nutriment and Growth to the Souls of the Children of the New Birth:
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:002950_0073_0FE6A244E5396B40"/>
Therefore what ſort of Suppers ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men may make without Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Chriſt, and receiving him into their Hearts to ſup with them, their Supper is not Chriſt's Supper, nor of any Benefit to their Souls; for <hi>He is the Bread of Life which comes down from Heaven, and gives Life to the World,</hi> John vi. 33.</p>
               <p>THIS is the Food which God communicates to his Children, who are born of the immortal Seed, thro' his Word, and have received the Holy Ghoſt to lead them into all Truth; which conſolates, and makes glad, and gives Nouriſhment and Increaſe, to the afflicted and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls. Therefore thoſe that have opened their Hearts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt to take Poſſeſſion, and govern in them with Power, ſuch as theſe come to be graffed into the true Vine, and their Souls are fed with the Fruit of the Vine, which is the ſame thing as the Bread of Life,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:002950_0073_0FE6A244E5396B40"/>
which cometh down from Heaven, that he who eateth thereof may live for ever, John vi. 51.</p>
               <p>THE Fruit of this Vine is alſo the Spiritual Wine, and Living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Heavenly Blood, which the Branches drink of, ſo that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Birth may grow and increaſe, by feeding upon Chriſt, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him, who ſaid, <hi>My Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed; He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,</hi> John vi. 55, 56.</p>
               <p>LET us ſee here, Thoſe that are feed on Chriſt, they dwell in him, and he in them. Not in his Body, but in his Spirit, and his Spirit in them; and the Unity and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between Chriſt, and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, not in outward Things, as he ſaid to his Diſciples, who were offended at the hearing of ſpiritual Things; but he interpreted it to them, <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:002950_0074_0FE6A254637554E0"/>
the Fleſh profiteth nothing; the Words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life,</hi> John vi. 63. So they that dwell in the Vine, the Fruit and Virtue of the Vine is Life and Support to them.</p>
               <p>SO he likewiſe ſaid, as the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Father ſent me, and I live by the Father, So he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me: And as the earthly Part nouriſheth it ſelf on earthly Food, outward and periſhing, ſo the ſpiritual Part is fed with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Food, even the hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> inviſible and eternal; and ſuch as feed upon it, know where they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; not in any Thing that is outward, but in a ſpiritual Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Father, and with the Son Jeſus Chriſt, knowing their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be their Shepherd, to lead them into the fruitful Paſtures, by the ſtill Waters, out of the World in themſelves, and out of all carnal

Reaſonings, and Conjectures of Fleſh and Blood.</p>
               <p>HE is alſo the daily Bread which is a Support to the true Chriſtian, and the living Soul cannot be one Day without it, but he will feel a Hunger, and it is not enough for him to receive outward Bread and Wine once a Year, inſtead of Life to his Soul, and ſpiritual Food, which comes down from Heaven, Day by Day, to the hungry and thirſty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>BUT ſuch as ſpend their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that which is not Bread, and their Labour for that which ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, they come to the Prieſt, to eat every one a Bit of Bread that periſheth, and every one a Sup of Wine, and their Principles oblige them to believe, that by taking ſo much, their Souls are fed, tho' they know not how. Oh, how eaſily do
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:002950_0075_0FE6A25480768F90"/>
People ſuffer themſelves to be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning their Souls eternal Life, which is to know the Father and the Son to dwell in the Heart, and to have gained the Man to love God, ſo as to be his Meat and Drink to do his Will!</p>
               <p>FOR to do the Will of God is the only Thing that makes up the Peace, and works the Unity and Communion between the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and Chriſt the beloved of his Soul, <hi>So they that are joined to the Lord are one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 17. And this is the Communion which makes the Saints to be one Bread, and one Body, by being Partakers of that one Bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 17. which the eating of Bread and Wine cannot do: For People eat it before they go to ſpill one another's Blood.</p>
               <p>SO alſo great has been the Strifes and going into Parties, which broke out into Malice and Revenge, Wars, and ſpilling of Blood, amongſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors

of Chriſtianity, about the Bread and Wine, how to order it, and when to take it. Here was the cunning Device of Satan, even to drive People to kill one another, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a dead Tradition; for thereby, he drew them further and further from God, into his own dark King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, alienating them more and more from the Life and Subſtance, even <hi>the Bread from Heaven, which giveth Life to the World,</hi> John vi. 33.</p>
               <p>BUT the wife Men hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opinions concerning theſe dead Things, and never could agree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were Strangers to the Spirit and heavenly Life; They judge, that by receiving the Bread and Wine, they muſt eat the Fleſh of Chriſt corporally, even he that was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſuffered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, and was raiſed again, and aſcended into Heaven, to ſit on the right Hand of Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:002950_0076_0FE6A255B6AFC180"/>BUT as to that, they broke out into three Opinions. The firſt is, that of the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who ſay concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Bread and Wine; that after the Prieſt conſecrates them (as they call it) the ſame is no more Bread nor Wine, but the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, in the Subſtance, which was crucified by the <hi>Jews.</hi> Here is a grievous Error; Men ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon them to make Chriſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally upon Earth, out of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Matter, and give People the ſame to eat for their Money, [See <hi>R. B.</hi> 498.]</p>
               <p>THE Second Opinion is, that of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who ſay, That the Subſtance of the Bread remains after it is conſecrated, but that alſo that Body is in the Bread, and with it, or under it; ſo that there is the Subſtance of the Bread, and the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt are mix'd together, to be given the People to eat for their Money. The Difference here is, That the Firſt take upon
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:002950_0076_0FE6A255B6AFC180"/>
them to make Chriſt bodily upon Earth, out of Bread and Wine, that is periſhable; the others take upon them to bring him down from Heaven to be mix'd with the Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>THE Third Opinion is that of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> who deny both the the former, ſaying, That Chriſt is not corporally in the Bread and Wine: But yet the Faithful receive him by taking of the Bread and Wine; But how, or which Way he is there, they know not, nor can they tell, but only we muſt believe he is there, yet ſo that it is properly in Heaven, [<hi>R. B.</hi> p. 498.] But of a Truth, tho' this Opinion may in ſome Things be born with, yet it is very uncertain: It is nothing; but we muſt believe.</p>
               <p>AND if we muſt believe that our Souls are fed with the Bread of Life, and that we are Partakers of Chriſt's Supper, tho' we do not know him come into our Hearts, to
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:002950_0077_0FE6A255D49CE2D0"/>
ſup with us, and we to ſup with him, this is the Way for us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ourſelves. This is alſo a Sign of Death: For the living Souls know, like <hi>David,</hi> when they receive the Joy of their Salvation, and when the Lord by his free Spirit upholds them, and their Souls are by the Holy Ghoſt comforted, and they can ſet their Seal to the Words or the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Do not err, my beloved Brethren; Every good Gift, and every perfect Gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no Variableneſs neither Shadow of Turning,</hi> Jam. i. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>BUT in the Night of Darkneſs, where Satan wrought amongſt the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, his Work and Cunning hath been, and is, to deceive People, and ſet them at Work to deceive one another, to the End and Purpoſe to keep them in Ignorance, and wholly Strangers to the true Shepherd, who gives enternal
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:002950_0077_0FE6A255D49CE2D0"/>
Life to his own Sheep, who know and follow him.</p>
               <p>WHEN he was, with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, eating that Supper, or the laſt Paſſover before he was betray'd, he ſaid unto them, <hi>With Deſire I have deſired to eat this Paſſover with you before I ſuffer; for I ſay unto you, I will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God,</hi> Luke xxii. 15, 16. The Fulfilling of that Paſſover, and that which it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, together with other Signs, was the Coming of the Kingdom of God, that is, God to dwell in his People, to teach them himſelf. For the Kingdom of God is within, and Chriſt within, a Comforter, ſupping with, and nouriſhing the Souls of the Children of the New Birth.</p>
               <p>AND when he took the Cup and gave Thanks, he ſaid, <hi>Take this and divide it among your ſelves; for I ſay unto you, I will not drink of the Fruit of the Vine until the Kingdom
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:002950_0078_0FE6A264A1D06328"/>
of God ſhall come,</hi> Luke xxii. 17, 18. <hi>And the Kingdom of God is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>CHRIST by doing this, was ſhewing his Diſciples that he was going to give his Body to ſuffer for them, and that they when they did eat and drink, were to remember him. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid farther, <hi>Do this as often as ye do it in Remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's Death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. xi. 26.</p>
               <p>SO all that can be gathered from theſe Things, is that when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhould come together to break Bread, they were to think of, and remember Chriſt and his Death, and
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:002950_0078_0FE6A264A1D06328"/>
his Departure from them that Night, and this in Reverence to his Name, until the Kingdom of God came to be enlarged in their Hearts, and the King to ſit in his Kingdom, after a ſpritual Manner, to ſup, and give himſelf to be Life and Nouriſhment to their Souls.</p>
               <p>WE read alſo concerning the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, how they continued daily with one Accord in the Temple, and breaking Bread from Houſe to Houſe, eating their Meat with Gladneſs and Singleneſs of Heart; and they eat in a religious Way, having made a joint Preparation for coming to eat together; and this did ſignify their Unity and Love one to another: They alſo did eat to ſatisfy their bodily Wants; what then?

               <p>THE Mercy of God Almighty hath been, and is in a great and large Meaſure extended towards the Children of Men, by ſending his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to offer unto them Covenants of Peace, tho' they daily rebel againſt him: And the Meſſage which he did put into the Mouth of his Prophet was, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no Pleaſure in the Death of the

Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live; Turn ye, turn ye from your Evil Ways, for why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. xxxiii. 11. <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life. For God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World thro' him might be ſaved,</hi> John iii. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>SO the Apoſtles had received the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, teſtifying <hi>that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them; and hath committed unto us the Word of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: Now then we are Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for Chriſt, as tho' God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>BUT contrary to theſe Things, there are ſome hold forth, That God
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:002950_0080_0FE6A2664A8D2818"/>
ordained the moſt Part of Mankind to Damnation, and the other Part to Salvation, even from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or before the Creation; ſo that there is no Poſſibility for any one of them to be loſt, that are ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, nor any one of thoſe that are ſo loſt, ſhall ever be ſaved.</p>
               <p>IF this were true, it would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all the Promiſes and Covenants of Peace which God ſent his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to publiſh throughout all the Scriptures, and would deny the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, which God offers unto the World thro' Chriſt: This inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates alſo, that God hath not ſent his Son into the World, to ſave the World, but to damn it.</p>
               <p>THIS alſo renders God unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, (whoſe Mercies excel all his Works) if he ordained the moſt Part of Mankind to be damned, not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them one Talent, nor any Grace, nor Day of Viſitation; but ordained them to Sin, and work all Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,

that he may puniſh them eternally for doing that which he had ordained them to do: By this there is no Room to extend Mercy to the greateſt Part of Mankind.</p>

               <p>THIS contradicts the Scriptures, which declare, that Chriſt died for every one, as may be ſeen, <hi>to wit, that God will have all Men to be ſaved, and to come unto the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God

So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the Angel proclaimed to the Shepherds, <hi>the Coming of Chriſt to be good Tidings of great Joy, which ſhall be to all People; and there was with the Angel a Multitude of the heavenly Hoſt, praiſing God, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on Earth Pence, good Will towards Men,</hi> Luke ii. 10, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>AND truly, my Paper is too ſhort to contain but few of the many Calls and Invitations, which God tenders to Sinners, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,

               <p>HERE is the Door of Salvation opened to all Mankind; thoſe who ask, and ſeek, and knock, they ſhall come in, and be received with Joy: Alſo the Grace of God, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Salvation, hath appeared unto all Men.</p>
               <p>BY theſe Things we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a Day of Viſitation from God, thro' his Grace and Light, is ordained to all Mankind upon the Face of the whole Earth: For there is no Man ſo far in any Corner of the World, but God is near unto

World: He that followeth me ſhall not walk in Darkneſs, but ſhall have the Light of Life,</hi> Joh. viii. 12. He is all-ſufficient to lead into Salvation every one that hearkneth to him while he knocks, and thoſe that turn at his Reproof, he promiſed to give them of his Spirit, and make known his Words unto them.</p>
               <p>BUT thoſe that reject theſe Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the Lord leaveth them, and their Blood is upon their own Heads. <hi>Becauſe I have called,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Wiſdom) and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my Hand, and no Man regarded,</hi> Prov. i. 24. Therefore the Lord gives up Sinners to take their own Ways; then the Day of their Viſitation paſſeth over their Heads, and the Lord leaves them, and ſo there is none that will deliver them in the Day of Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>THIS is agreeable to the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Place where thoſe that plead for Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation would faſten Something, <hi>What
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:002950_0083_0FE6A2755EAAA1B8"/>
if God, willing to ſhew his Wrath, and make his Power known, endured with much Long-ſuffering, the Veſſels of Wrath fitted to Deſtruction?</hi> Rom. ix. 22. The Word (Long-ſuffering)ſhews that they had a Day of Viſitation, but they rejected it; wherefore Chriſt wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaying, <hi>that ſhe was to be deſtroyed, and laid even with the Ground, becauſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>thou kneweſt not the Time of thy Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> Luke xix. 44.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE Man's Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of himſelf, but his Salvation is from the Lord: In Chriſt does the Election ſtand, <hi>and ſuch as are graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in the Vine, and overcome the World, and Satan and his Temptations, they ſhall eat of the hidden Manna, and a white Stone ſhall be given them, and in the Stone a New Name written, which no Man knoweth ſaving he that receiveth it,</hi> Rev. ii. 17. <hi>Here is the heavenly Inſcription, and the Names of the Elect, which are written in the
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:002950_0084_0FE6A27575C0A2A8"/>
Lamb's Book of Life,</hi> Rev. xxi. 27.</p>
               <p>ARE not People preſumptuous and ſelfiſh? Nothing takes more Hold on them than what they received from their own Church by Tradition, let it be as erroneous as may be; they will have it to be a Goſpel Truth, let God, Chriſt and the Scripture ſay what they will; but the Thing ſaid by the Churchmen and Society, which the Man owns he will believe and follow, and judge it erroneous in all others, if they believe not the ſame Things, as may be ſeen by divers wrong Rudiments, which crept in amongſt Chriſtians in the Night of Obſcurity, when the Church went into the Wilderneſs, and the falſe Church, even the Whore <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſat upon the People.</p>
               <p>SO in this Caſe, God ſaith, <hi>I have no Pleaſure in the Death of him that dieth,</hi> Ez. xviii. 32. But theſe Men ſay, that God hath willed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:002950_0084_0FE6A27575C0A2A8"/>
the greateſt Part of Mankind to ſin and die for ever. God calls the wicked, ſaying, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die, return therefore and live,</hi> Ezek. xliii. 11. But they ſay, that God holds the Wicked under his Order of Reprobation, that they can do no leſs than ſin to their Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>THE Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God will have all Men to be ſaved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 4. But they ſay, God would have, yea, he willed and made the moſt Part to Deſtruction, and that he witholdeth from them all true Knowledge, and all Means of Salvation, ſo that they may not lay hold thereon.</p>
               <p>IF I were to go on after this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I might gather a great Part of the Scriptures to ſhew how oppoſite this Doctrine is againſt God, againſt his Mercies and Love and Good Will towards all Mankind; it is alſo
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:002950_0085_0FE6A276B4F56B38"/>
againſt Chriſt, by making his Coming his Death and Redemption unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the greateſt Part of Mankind, but rather adds to their Damnation.</p>
               <p>THIS denies the Reconciliation, which God offers to the World, thro' Chriſt: It denies the Goſpel, which is glad Tidings of great Joy to all People: It makes Men of Opinion, that it is in vain to ask, to ſeek and knock, in Contradiction to the Words of Chriſt, when he preached to the Multitude, <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>THESE alſo ſay, that Sin cannot be a Means to loſe any of thoſe that are elected, and that the Reprobate cannot do any Thing that may be a Means to ſave them: By this it is in vain for Man to mention Religion. Oh! how croſs this is to the Words of the Lord, by his Prophet in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before mentioned, from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the End, <hi>Behold, all Souls are mine, the Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die: The Righteouſneſs of the Righteous
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:002950_0085_0FE6A276B4F56B38"/>
ſhall be upon him,</hi> Ez. xviii. 4. See from the twentieth Verſe to the End of the Chapter cloſe to the ſame Purpoſe; and alſo in <hi>Chap.</hi> xxxiii. from the Eleventh Verſe to the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, where it plainly appears, that Sin ſeparates between People and their Creator, and their Return to him makes the Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>LET it be our Belief therefore, that it is poſſible for the ungodly Man, thro' Mercy, to return unto the Lord, whilſt he calls, invites and preſſeth, ſhewing forth his Hands, and knocking at the Door of the Heart. Here is the Law that was given to <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

come. And whoſoever will, let him take the Water of Life freely,</hi> Rev. xxii. 17.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE let us truſt in the Lord, and believe his Promiſes, hope in his Mercies, depend upon Chriſt and his Offering, who hath redeemed us, and paid the Ranſom for us, by giving himſelf a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Sins of the whole World; alſo let us yield Obedience to the Grace and Light which is given us, for a Manifeſtation to lead us into that Salvation which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us by redeeming us.</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE theſe hold forth, that the Lord ordained <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, and it is he that drives and cauſeth the Wicked to ſin, and keeps them in their Sins, that he may have juſt Cauſe to puniſh them eternally for their Sins, and alſo that God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained all Things that come to paſs.</p>
               <p>WE may here ſee, that theſe make God the Author of all Wickedneſs
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:002950_0086_0FE6A276DA005388"/>
and alſo more unjuſt, cruel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful than the cruelleſt of Men as ever we heard of: For where is, or has been any King or Prince, who would bind his People with Chains of Iron in dark Priſons, before they did any Thing to diſpleaſe him, and there keep them, under ſuch Locks and Bolts, that it would never be poſſible for them to come forth, yet come at Times, and call them into the Field to work his Harveſt, and becauſe they come not forth, then chaſtiſe them with the moſt cruel Puniſhment? O, who would impute this to God, who is ſlow to Anger, and great in his Mercy, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Evil.</p>
               <p>Where then does this errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrine allow the Devil to have any Hand in the Deſtruction of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeeing that he cannot deceive, nor gain any, but ſuch as God hath ordained and prepared for him? what ſhall we ſay to this? Did not <hi>Peter</hi>

know what he ſaid, or was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil fooliſh and mad, <hi>who was ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy like a roaring Lyon, walking about, ſeeking whom he might devour,</hi> 1 Pet. v. 8.</p>
               <p>BUT Satan, no doubt, is well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that God does not make People on Purpoſe for him; and that he has none, but ſuch as he catches in his Snares and Netts, by his Deceit and Baits; he is the Enemy of Men, and the Enemy of Truth; he ſow'd the Tares in the Field; he deceives and corrupts People, making them Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the wicked one, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>But the Tares are the Children of the Wicked One. The Enemy who ſow'd them is the Devil,</hi> Mat. xiii. 38, 39. This Enemy deceived Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at firſt, to ſin againſt the Will of God, and his Commandments, and he works in the Children of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and holds Sinners Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at his Will, in his dark Priſons.</p>
               <p>BUT Chriſt was ſent by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                  <hi>and anointed to preach good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings unto the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound,</hi> Iſa. lxi. 1. Luke iv. 18. <hi>Satan is gone out to deceive the Nations, which are in the Four Corners of the Earth,</hi> Gog <hi>and</hi> Magog, <hi>to gather them together to Battle, the Number of whom is as the Sand of the Sea,</hi> Rev. xx. 8. <hi>But Chriſt was given for a Light to the Gentiles, and Salvation to the Ends of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. xlix. 6. <hi>to open the blind Eyes, to bring out the Priſoners from the Priſon, and them that ſit in Darkneſs out of the Priſon-Houſe,</hi> Iſa. xlii. 7. to reconcile God and Men, to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, which made the Separation.</p>
               <p>THIS is the general Salvation, which Chriſt hath purchaſed to all Mankind, by his own precious Blood, and the Help which he gave them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THERE is another Branch of the ſame Doctrine, where they ſay, that thoſe who once receive Grace from God, it is impoſſible for them ever to fall from Grace, or loſe their Salvation.</p>
               <p>THIS is likewiſe contrary to the fore-mentioned Scriptures, where i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and committeth Iniquity, his Righteouſneſs ſhall be no more remembred to him, but for the Sin he hath committed, he ſhall die: Alſo Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>That he is the true Vine, and his Father is the Husbandman, every Branch in him that beareth not Fruit, he taketh away,</hi> Joh. xv. 1, 2. And ſays Chriſt, <hi>If a Man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a Branch, and is withered; and Men gather them, and caſt them into the Fire, and they an burned,</hi> Ver. 6.</p>
               <p>SO it is poſſible that Branches once graffed in the Vine, may be cut off, becauſe of Unfaithfulneſs: This is likewiſe truly anſwerable to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's Words, when he was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to thoſe whom he accounted the <hi>Elect,</hi> and were graffed into the true Vine; he warns them ſaying, <hi>Behold the Goodneſs and Severity of God: On them which fell, Severity: But towards thee, Goodneſs, if thou continue in his

               <p>OF a Truth, great is the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Ungodlineſs, which hath wrought, and is working in the Darkneſs of Men's Hearts, in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the World, the old Satan, the crafty and dark Spirit which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Night, turning many Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards which God had planted, to bear ſour Grapes: And he began to work in the Church in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſtianity, appearing like an Angel of Light: And as Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles, ſo Satan likewiſe ſent Apoſtles, who transformed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Apoſtles of Chriſt, and Miniſters of Righteouſneſs; yet for all that, God carried on his Work,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:002950_0090_0FE6A2844B909A10"/>
and the true Church and Miniſters proſpered and Chriſtians multiplyed.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE the Devil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, and appeared again in his own Colour, a devouring Lyon, and entred into the Heart of <hi>Nero,</hi> to perſecute and impriſon, to kill, to burn and ſtone the Lambs and Sheep of Chriſt; and for all this, the Blood of the Chriſtians was the Seed of the Church; tho' many were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred, yet the Chriſtians multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo there followed Ten heavy Perſecutions under the Pagan <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and yet they encreaſed in Number.</p>
               <p>BUT the Way Satan overcame moſt, was by cooling of Love, and ſuffering People to receive a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt and Chriſtianity, and from Age to Age Darkneſs thickned, Iniquity increaſed, Schiſms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions coming in; leſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and of the Grace, and of divine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>HERE Satan got the Victory, by making <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> Darkneſs and a Wilderneſs, and the Church a falſe Church, that is, a Whore to ſit in Authority upon People, and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, and Nations and Tongues; ſhe alſo ſat upon the Beaſt having Heads and Horns, that is the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power, which was an Enemy to the true Church, <hi>And the Woman was aray'd in Purple and ſcarlet Colour, and decked with Gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones and Pearls, having a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cup in her Hand, full of Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

               <p>AFTER they had thus left the Truth, and loſt Sight of Chriſt, who was the Head of the true Church, and Governour in his Saints and Followers, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſet up to be Head of the falſe Church, and then it was not what Chriſt ſaid was to be taken Notice of, but what the Pope and the Church ſaid; the Lord of the Harveſt ſaid to his Servants, pull not the Tares, let them grow together with the Wheat until the Time of Harveſt: But the Pope and the Whore, who call the Wheat (<hi>to wit</hi> the Children of Grace) Tares, ſay, pull them all up, ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan

would root up Truth and pure Religion from among Men.</p>
               <p>THE Spirit of Perſecution is a dark, angry, revengeful and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Spirit, in what Man or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſoever it appears; it is an Enemy to Truth, and of that ſtubborn cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Nature, which began to appear in the Time of <hi>Cain:</hi> And that great City, <hi>to wit Babylon,</hi> began to lay her Foundation in the Hearts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Morning of the Creation; for it was ſaid of her, that in her was found the Blood of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Saints, and of all that were ſlain upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>SO the evil Spirit and Nature were the Cauſe of killing of the Prophets, and of perſecuting the Righteous in every Age; for there was, and is an Enmity in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine Spirit againſt Chriſt and his Saints: So the Lord ſent his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers as Lambs amongſt Wolves to be perſecuted and brought before

Judgment-Seats to be killed, to be martyred for his Name-ſake, whom the World hated.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE the Devil, the old Enemy of all Good, moves his Servants to perſecute the Innocent; and it belongs to Perſecutors to have two Things to fit them for Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; their Eyes muſt be hoodwink'd with thick Darkneſs, ſo that they may not ſee what they are doing; for Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples <hi>They ſhall put you out of the Synagogues, yea the Time cometh, that whoſoever kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you will think that he doth God Service,</hi> Joh. xvi. 2. It belongs to them alſo to have their Conſciences ſeared with a hot Iron, leſt ſhe ſhould grieve and bleed when they kill and butcher the innocent Lambs.</p>
               <p>BUT in this Blindneſs and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, the Perſecutors conſult toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; come, we the Lambs and Sheep of Chriſt, let us deſtroy the Wolves.

But away with ſuch a one, hang, burn, crucifie him! This was the Treatment Chriſt himſelf had in the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Tribunal; it was in vain for <hi>Pilate</hi> in his own Court to argue for Jeſus; their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt him was, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the People, and was teaching thro' all <hi>Judea,</hi> therefore they would have him crucified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BUT</hi> Pilate <hi>ſaid, I find no Fault in this Man, and argued again, that he had examined him. And</hi> Herod
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:002950_0094_0FE6A29151091198"/>
                  <hi>having examined him, and had found no Fault in him, nor any Thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Death, he would therefore cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtize him, and let him go: Then the whole Multitude cryed out at once, away with this Man, and releaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us</hi> Barrabas, <hi>who for Murder was eaſt into Priſon:</hi> Pilate <hi>therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to releaſe Jeſus, ſpoke again to them; but they cryed out, ſaying, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie, crucifie him: but</hi> Pilate <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſaying, why, what Evil hath he done? I have found no Cauſe of Death in him, I will therefore chaſtize him, and let him go: And they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with loud Cries, requiring that he might be crucified, and the Voices of them and of the High-Prieſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,</hi> Luk. xxiii.</p>
               <p>THIS is the Treatment the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had, who left Footſteps for his Saints and Martyrs, ſhewing them divine and evangelical Examples, how to follow him thro' Perſecution, by demonſtrating his Doctrine and

pure Nature in his Sufferings, who ſaid, <hi>Love your Enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you,</hi> Mat. v. 44.</p>
               <p>SO when he was led to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and his cruel Enemies drove Nails thro' his Fleſh, he pitied them: Here is the heavenly Nature that is in the Lamb, and the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirit, which he makes his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers Partakers of in their Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; <hi>Then he prayed for them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O God forgive them; for they know not what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND the firſt that followed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Martyrdom was <hi>Stephen,</hi> who had received of the ſame Spirit, Grace and Vertue, to fit him to ſuffer for his Teſtimony. When the People were cruel and deviliſh, ſtoning him to Death, <hi>he kneeled down, and cryed with a loud Voice, Lord lay not this Sin to their Charge,</hi> Act. vii. 60.
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:002950_0095_0FE6A29A40BF2598"/>
This is that Evangelical, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and forgiving Nature, which hateth none, envieth none, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the Harm of any, but the good of every one. The Teſtimony of God's Meſſengers in all Ages, was the Truth; and for declaring the Truth, they were hated and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MICAIAH</hi> for telling the Truth, was put in Priſon, <hi>to be fed with the Bread of Affliction, and with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Affliction,</hi> 1 King. xxii. 27. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> for ſpeaking the Truth, <hi>was caſt into the deep Dungeon,</hi> Jer. xxxviii. 6. It was for declaring the Truth, that the Followers of Jeſus were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and perſecuted by the cruel Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in all Ages of the World: It was in vain for the Chriſtians in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church to plead their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence before the <hi>Pagans;</hi> there was Nothing but Martyrdom for the Teſtimony, and for not worſhipping their falſe Gods.</p>

                  <pb n="175" facs="unknown:002950_0095_0FE6A29A40BF2598"/>IT was to no Purpoſe for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and divers others, when they were reſtoring Religion, to plead their Innocence in the Courts of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor ask, what Evil have we done? But for their Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Corruption and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to deſtroy them by every cruel Death. It was in vain for the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> before that Tribunal, to ask, what Evil have we done? What Law have we bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? but becauſe they came there to bear their Teſtimony againſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, there was nothing but Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them: So for the ſame Cauſe Chriſt and his Prophets and Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and all his Meſſengers in every Age ſuffered, that is, for their Teſtimonies to the Truth, which the World could not receive, <hi>For they did not ſpeak in the Words which Man's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth,</hi> 1 Cor, ii. 13. And
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:002950_0096_0FE6A29A82813088"/>
the Teachings of the Holy Ghoſt are out of Eſteem among the wiſe Men of this World; for it is Fooliſhneſs in their Sight.</p>
               <p>CHRIST is the Stone which the Builders rejected in all Ages, even the Wiſe of this World: Therefore God accounted the Wiſdom of this World to be Fooliſhneſs; becauſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer human Wiſdom and Learning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſpiritual, and becauſe they reject the precious Stone, the Rock of Ages, the Fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hate him and his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and their Meſſage: O! what is the Meſſage then that Chriſt and his Miniſters declare among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this World, to make them angry and envious towards them? Is it not the Goſpel of Salvation, which calls People from Satan to Chriſt, from the Kingdom of Darkneſs to the Kingdom of the Son of God, and to his Light? They alſo call the People of the Lord out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:002950_0096_0FE6A29A82813088"/>
that they be not Partakers of her Sins, and receive not of her Plagues; inviting all to the Waters, to buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SATAN</hi> is diſturbed at this, leſt he loſeth his Subjects, and he moves the Inhabitants of the Earth, who have been made drunk with the Wine of the great City's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; as alſo her Merchants, leſt they loſe their Gain; and her great Men who lived deliciouſly in her, feeding their Luſts; theſe will agree to war againſt the Lamb, and againſt his Saints: But the Weapons of the Warfare of Chriſt's Servants are not carnal, but ſpiritual; and in the meek Spirit (after they have known the Fear of God) they perſuade others, exhorting them in Love and good will to their Bodies and Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching them to be reconciled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Forbearance, in order to gain them, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who is a wiſe Man and endued with Knowledge amongſt you? let him ſhew out of a good Converſation his Works with Meekneſs of Wiſdom; But if ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts, glory not, and lie not againſt the Truth; this Wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh: For where Envying and Strife is, there is Confuſion and every evil Work: But the Wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality, and without Hypocriſy,</hi> Ja. iii. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. This is the Wiſdom that gains upon the Hearts of People in order to turn them to God; not to drive them by Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Strength of Arm, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weapons.</p>
               <p>IT is very poſſible that Numbers of the true Church may be deceived

by Satan, to hold forth ſome erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Points which the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear, what therefore ſhall be done to ſuch, but after Perſuaſion and Advice, if they cannot be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then turn them out of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, and there leave them amongſt the reſt of Mankind, to ſtand or fall to their own Maſter? But what if the Church is in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the Rulers and Officers are Members thereof, Is it not then lawful for the Officers to uſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement, as Fines and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order to turn the Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous into the Way?</p>
               <p>OF a Truth, it is not Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (that is, to rob and impriſon) will ever bring People to love the Religion of thoſe that perſecute them; but it gives them an Advantage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and ſtrengthen them in their way, and count themſelves ſuffering Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for the Sake of Chriſt and their Conſcience, looking upon their

Perſecutors to be cruel and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful; for Perſecution is heinous in the Sight of all that ſuffer under it: But it is natural, and too often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens among the Profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, when they get into Power, to raiſe Perſecution againſt thoſe that cannot join with them in Religion.

                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:002950_0098_0FE6A29F24F97FF8"/>LET us obſerve how far it was from Jeſus to return any Revenge, tho' Power was in his Hand; and how he reproved that Spirit in his Diſciples, and utterly diſowned it, as a thing contrary to his Nature, Kingdom and Goſpel. And ſince it is unlawful, and contrary to the way of Chriſt to call for Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to deſtroy thoſe that would not receive him, how much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful is it to kindle a Fire on Earth, to deſtroy ſuch as believe in him, becauſe they cannot for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, pin their Religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to the Sleeves of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and believe and ſay every thing like them? And if People muſt follow the Religion of thoſe that are in Authority, it is in vain for them to ſearch the Scriptures, and endeavour to try what is good, in order to follow it, becauſe they muſt receive the Magiſtrate's Religion, or

               <p>THE Perſecutors by carrying on and pleading for their Work, do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify all the cruel and curſed Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, who in all Ages afflicted God's People: But it is poſſible they may ſay, Thoſe in Times paſt were wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thoſe whom they perſecuted were good; but it is not ſo at this Time, becauſe we are the godly People who are in the Way, and we endeavour to bring them that are gone aſtray to the Right, and to return to us.</p>
               <p>IS not this the Plea and Excuſe by which all the Perſecutors in Ages paſt, did ſeek to excuſe and ſhelter themſelves, and juſtify their Cauſe? Therefore ſince the Perſecutors of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Age have been of one Voice, how much greater Truth can be in theſe Excuſes in the Mouths of latter Perſecutors, more than in the former?

               <p>WHEN a true Chriſtian is fully reſolved to keep the Commandments of God, and the Magiſtrates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the contrary, the faithful muſt ſuffer for his Religion, let come what will come, and ſay, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, Whether it be right in the Sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye,</hi> Acts iv. 19, Theſe latter Ages verify the ſame Things.

When Chriſt was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Difference between his own Law, even the Law of the New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Ye have heard, that it hath been ſaid by them of old Time, thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt perform un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord thine Ouths; But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all.</hi> Here in the firſt I lace he forbids Swearing to the Lord, which under the old Law was commanded; yea further, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Heaven, for it is God's Throne; nor by the Earth, for it is his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool; neither by Jeruſalem, for it is the City of the great King; neither ſhalt thou ſwear by thy Head, becauſe thou canſt not make one Hair white or black; But let your Communication be Yea, Yea, Nay, Nay; for what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is more than theſe, cometh of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> We ſee here, that Chriſt hath forbidden all manner of Oaths, and alſo commanded not to ſwear at all, <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 33 34, 35, 36, 37.</p>

                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:002950_0100_0FE6A2CBADD834C0"/>BUT there are many of thoſe that take upon them to be good Chriſtians in theſe Times, do not ſee a Neceſſity of keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt; therefore they ſtrive to gather many Reaſons, ſeeking to caſt down and aboliſh this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment and Doctrine of Jeſus; But the more a Man, that is wiſe in his own Sight, gathers for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reaſons to oppoſe Chriſt, the more he makes himſelf an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Reſiſter of him: For he is the Author of the New Covenant, the true Lawgiver, the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, whom every one is to hear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pain of being cut off; then where will a Man go to hunt for, or gather Arguments, to ſtand for his Act of Swearing? If he goes to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Chriſt hath changed that; thou haſt nothing there unleſs thou wilt be a <hi>Jew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT if thou comeſt to ſearch the New Teſtament, thou wilt find
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:002950_0101_0FE6A2CDCC0EAF68"/>
there the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> of the ſame Mind with his Maſter, becauſe he gives a manifeſt Command, that they ſhould not ſwear, ſaying, <hi>But above all things, my Brethren, Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, neither by any other Oath; but let your Yea be Yea, and your Nay, Nay, leſt ye fall into Condemnation,</hi> Jam. v. 12. See here how both theſe Teſtimonies of Chriſt and his Apoſtles meet each other, ſo agreeable to ſhut out all manner of Swearing. This Apoſtle alſo commanded it above all things, becauſe it came from his great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, even the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings; and likewiſe under ſuch Danger, <hi>leſt they ſhould fall into Condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND yet People would hold forth, that neither Chriſt nor the Apoſtle did forbid Swearing before Magiſtrates, in a Way of bearing Witneſs in Cauſes; but of a Truth theſe Teſtimonies of Chriſt and his
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:002950_0101_0FE6A2CDCC0EAF68"/>
Apoſtle, are wrought into a Ring ſo entirely ſtrong, that there is no Room for Time nor Cauſe to break in upon them: But when any of thoſe who are for obſerving this Command, come before Magiſtrates to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in a Cauſe, what will they anſwer? Hath not Chriſt told them, and put Words in their Mouths? to wit, <hi>let your Communication be Yea, Yea, Nay, Nay; whatſoever is more than theſe cometh of Evil:</hi> And the Apoſtle likewiſe, <hi>Let your Yea be Yea, and your Nay be Nay; leſt you fall into Condemnation.</hi> Of a Truth, great is the Difference between the Voice of the Apoſtle, and that of the preſent World, where he ſays, <hi>Above all things, Swear not at all;</hi> but they ſay, <hi>Above all Things you muſt Swear.</hi> They will not allow any to be a Miniſter in the Church, without he is firſt ſworn, which is a Breach of the Command of Chriſt; as if they deemed that a Man is not fit for any

Service in the World, without he firſt Swears.</p>
               <p>IT would be but reaſonable for People that confeſs Chriſt, if they could not forbear Swearing, to be eaſy with thoſe that would forbear, becauſe of keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <q>O everlaſting Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, enlighten thou the Children of Men, draw them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that dark City, where is Envy and Malice, Pride and Contention, Revenge, Wars and Spilling of Blood; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them to the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> where there is Light, where there is Love, where is Tranquility, Peace, Unity, Quietneſs and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip one with another, and with the Father, and the Lamb, among all the Citizens.</q>

               <p>THE Meſſage which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God received of him, and declared unto others, <hi>That God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all;</hi> and the Work which God ſet them upon, was, to <hi>turn Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God,</hi> even from the dark Kingdom, (where the Devil, the dark Spirit, doth govern) to the Kingdom of Light, whereof the Lord God is the Light, and to that City <hi>which hath no need of the

Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it, for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof, and the Nations of them that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſhall walk in the Light of it,</hi> Rev. xxi. 23, 24. <hi>The Sun ſhall be no more thy Light by Day, neither for Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall the Moon give Light unto thee; but the Lord ſhall be unto thee for an everlaſting Light, and thy God thy Glory,</hi> Iſa. lx. 19.</p>
               <p>THIS is the Work of the true Apoſtles, even to call People to God, who is Light, and hath enlightned every Man, and calls them to Chriſt who is the Light of Life; and this Light (which is the Father and the Son) hath lighted every Man that came into the World; <hi>And this is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men loved Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds were evil: For every one that doth Evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, leſt his Deeds
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:002950_0103_0FE6A2D5F52BD100"/>
ſhould be reproved; but he that doth Truth, cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God,</hi> Joh. iii. 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>SO they that hate the Light in themſelves, they hate God, becauſe he reproves them for their Sins; and where they love Darkneſs in themſelves, they love the Devil, who ſpeaks Peace to them, tho' they walk after their own Hearts Luſts. Thus the Miniſters which God and Chriſt ſend, are hated by the World, becauſe they ſpeak againſt Evil in Men. Therefore Jeſus comforted his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>If the World hate you, ye know it hated me before it hated you: If ye were of the World, the World would love his own; but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you,</hi> Joh. xv. 18, 19.</p>

The World fitteth its Miniſters by its own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Wiſdom, and, as <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>They are of the World, thereſore ſpeak they of the World, and the World heareth them.

               <p>THESE are the falſe Prophets of whom Chriſt ſpoke, that they

then they ſhould have turned them from their evil Way, and from the Evil of their Doings: And they cauſe my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to err by their Lies, and by their Lightneſs; yet I ſent them not, nor commanded them; Therefore they ſhall not profit this People at all, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. xxiii. 14, 17, 21, 22, 32. Alſo by the Prophet <hi>Micah, Thus ſaith the Lord, concerning the Prophets that make my People err, that bite with their Teeth, and cry Peace, and he that putteth not into their Mouths, they even prepare War againſt him.

               <p>AND in Truth, tho' there be falſe Teachers in this latter Time that are decked with the Whore's Jewels, and altho' they hold the
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:002950_0106_0FE6A2D750635BB8"/>
golden Cup, yet the ſame Root brings forth the ſame Fruit; and as Chriſt marked them, <hi>the are ravening Wolves, ye ſhall know them by their Fruits,</hi> Mat. vii. 15, 16. So did the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſet the ſame Marks on the falſe Teachers, ſaying of them, <hi>They are to come among the Chriſtians, and thro' Covetouſneſs ſhall they with feigned Words make Merchandiſe of you, whoſe Judgment now of a long Time lingreth not, and their Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſlumbreth not; having Eyes full of Adultery, that cannot ceaſe from Sin, beguiling unſtable Souls; an Heart they have exerciſed with cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Practiſes, curſed Children, which have forſaken the right Way, and are gone aſtray, following the Way of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, <hi>who loved the Wages of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 3, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>THIS covetous Spirit entered into the Hearts of ſome in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> which cauſed the Apoſtle to be ſo ſtrict, that he would take
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:002950_0107_0FE6A313F9FA8780"/>
Nothing from any of them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Neceſſities, leſt he ſhould give them Occaſion, as he teſtifies at large, how he had been in Want, whilſt he preached to them the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of God freely, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 9, 12, 13. And thoſe covetous Miniſters he reckoned to be falſe Apoſtles, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Workers, being transformed into the Apoſtles of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>AND of a Truth, great is the Difference between the Miniſtry and Miniſters of Chriſt, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Miniſtry of Antichriſt; they are as unlike as Water is to Fire, or Light to Darkneſs: Chriſt called his Diſciples from unlearned Men, and fitted them by his Grace and Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but Antichriſt muſt have Scholars fitted with human Wiſdom. Chriſt communicated freely to them of his ſpiritual Goodneſs, commanding them to give as they had received free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but the Miniſters of Antichriſt receive not freely: it is great Pains
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:002950_0107_0FE6A313F9FA8780"/>
and Labour to them, and Expence of much Money; therefore it is coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to any that receive of them. The Meſſengers of God called People to Chriſt the Fountain of living Water, that they might drink of the Water of Life freely, and buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price: But the Merchants of <hi>Babylon</hi> call every Body to their Shops after this Manner, <hi>Come to us and buy, and if you do not buy, pay; and if you do not pay, we will make War againſt you.</hi> But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have coveted no Mans Silver, or Gold, or Apparel: Yea, you your ſelves know, that theſe Hands have miniſtred unto my Neceſſity, and to them that were with me,</hi> Acts xx. 33, 34. But theſe Merchants are too great to work with their Hands: They will have Gold or Silver, Corn, Wool and Lambs, with Part of all the Increaſe of the People's Goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:002950_0108_0FE6A2E1B0194F08"/>THE Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>a Neceſſity is laid upon me to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, yea, Woe is unto me if I do it</hi> not: But there is no Neceſſity upon theſe to preach any, but where they have the moſt Wages. The Apoſtle did not bid them believe Men, but God; ſaying, <hi>Do I ſeek to pleaſe Men? For if I pleaſed Men, I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. i. 10. But theſe are for pleaſing of Men; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not the Servants of Chriſt. Again, the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I certify you, Brethren, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which was preached of me, is not after Man; for I neither received it of Man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Ver. 11, 12. But theſe preach Doctrine (which they call Goſpel) after they receive it, and learn it of Men, and not by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt; for they deny ſpiritual Revelation in theſe Days. Alſo the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We have received not the Spirit
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:002950_0108_0FE6A2E1B0194F08"/>
of the World, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the Things that are freely given us of God: Which Things alſo we ſpeak, not in the Words which Man's Wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth,</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>BUT theſe do not profeſs, that they have received the Spirit of God; nor is what they preach freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them of God, neither do they ſpeak the Words which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, but thoſe that Man's Wiſdom teacheth.</p>
               <p>NOW it is high Time for People to be awakened out of Sleep, and endea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vour for their Lives to come out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon: For a Voice from Heaven calls, Come out of her my People, that ye be not Partakers of her Sins, and that ye receive not of her Plagues: Fo rher Sins have reached unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and God hath remembered her Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: Therefore ſhall her Plagues come in one Day: Death and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And white Robes were given unto every one of them; and it was ſaid unto them, that they ſhould reſt yet for a little Seaſon, until the Number of their Fellow Servants and their Brethren that ſhould be killed as they were ſhould be fulfilled,</hi> Rev. vi. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>AND indeed the Saints Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and upon Earth do jointly cry to him who ſits upon the Throne, that he may haſten on his Journey againſt the Power of Darkneſs, and

               <p>NOW the Day begins to dawn, and the Lord ſends, and hath ſent his Meſſengers to preach the true Goſpel; and tho' there are many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that it have been enlightened in a large Degree to behold the Pretence and Likeneſs of Worſhips that are among the Children of the World, who are yet in the Fleſh fulfilling the Laſt thereof: Nevertheleſs the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Darkneſs and the Sprit of the great World are too ſtrong for them

               <p>For the Lord will make bare the Arm of his great Power to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with his Servants to quench the Violence of Fire, to ſtop the Mouths of Lions, to wear away the Strength of Archers, to ſmite the Camp of the

               <p>INDEED the ſpiritual Purpoſes and Prophecies which God revealed to <hi>John</hi> (when he was in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on the Lord's Day) are in a great Meaſure come to paſs: The Church is coming up out of the Wilderneſs, and the Goſpel is freely preached in divers Countries, the ſpiritual Sun begins to ſhine; and is not the One Thouſand two Hundred and Sixty Days fully expired ſince the Church fled into the Wilderneſs?

before is within a little of the Forty and two Months.</p>
               <p>BUT ſome my interpret thus, the <hi>Pope</hi> is the Beaſt; and by the Time he came, and by this Number, he has yet about one Hundred and Fifty Years to reign: But it is eaſier for me to think, that the Devil and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> was the firſt Beaſt that John <hi>ſaw riſing out of the Sea, to wit,</hi> out of the Fulneſs and Depth of Corruption, which had the Wound by the Sword in the Time of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but now is revived, <hi>and has Authority from the Dragon to work Forty two Months, and Power over all Kindreds and Tongues and Nations;</hi> and that the <hi>Pope</hi> was the ſecond Beaſt <hi>which came up out of the Earth to do the Service of the firſt Beaſt, and to cauſe them that dwell on the Earth to, worſhip the Devil, and to make Images to him, and reverence him, and receive his helliſh Marks in their Hands or in their Foreheads, that they might

               <p>AND of a Truth, the Lord hath raiſed Witneſſes for himſelf in theſe latter Ages to preach the true Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and to proclaim againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> but not in the Place where was the ſtrongeſt Defence, and moſt cruel Soldiers of the Beaſt: But after they had ſuffered in <hi>England</hi> and other Places, Spoil and Impriſonment, and ſome the Loſs of their Lives, God was pleaſed to ſoften the Hearts of the chief Men, and the Hands of Perſecutors grew weak, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience in a large Meaſure was granted; and then the Work in P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE Almighty God who made Man in his own Image and Likeneſs and hath endowed him with Knowledge, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, giving him Authority to rule over all the Creatures, it is his Due to have Reverence and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Humility, as being the Subſtance of true Worſhip; for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a Thing which the World makes a great Noiſe about, and much Strife concerning it; many ſet Ways are invented by the Conjecture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Man, and by the Reaſonings of Fleſh and Blood, to the End they may ſeek to pleaſe the Lord without Obedience: But God requires of his People a ſpiritual Worſhip. Where therefore is this Worſhip to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:002950_0114_0FE6A2F00E608AC0"/>
but in the Spirit? As Chriſt ſaid, <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth;</hi> Here is the Worſhip the World knows not, nor the Place to worſhip.</p>
               <p>BUT Men will ſay, we muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in the Church; yet many are ſo ignorant, that they know not what the Church is, nor where ſhe is; whereas the Church is the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, who worſhip in Spirit even in God, who dwelleth in his People, and makes them a Temple for himſelf.</p>
               <p>AND tho' there is but one Church, yet ſhe is in a two fold State in the outward: For the Woman that <hi>John</hi> ſaw flying into the Wilderneſs from the Face of the Serpent, was the Church, which God feeds there. Theſe the Perſecutors cannot ſpy out, theſe are diſperſed through all the World, ſome of all Profeſſions, ſome of all Kindreds, Tribes and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:002950_0114_0FE6A2F00E608AC0"/>
who fear God, and depart from Iniquity; for <hi>John ſaw an Angel fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midſt of Heaven, having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth, and to every Nation, and Kindred, and Tongue, and People; ſaying with a loud Voice, fear God, and give Glory to him; for the Hour of his Judgment is come, and worſhip him that made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and the Fountains of Water,</hi> Rev. xiv. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>AND of a Truth, the Voice of this Angel hath reached to the utmoſt Part of the World; and there is a Witneſs in every Man that tells him, he ſhould fear God and give him Glory; for his Judgment is within upon the Heart of the Sinner, by Reaſon of his Wickedneſs. Alſo the Heaven and the Earth, the Sea, Fountains of Water, and all the wonderful Works of the Creation are in the Sight of People, to ſhew them the Greatneſs and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of him that made the whole: This

ſhews them, that Man ought to bow before the Creator of all Things, and yield Adoration and Obedience to him: Alſo they have been illuminated with the Light which lighteth every one that cometh into the World. This is the Light of Life, and the Grace that brings Salvation hath appeared unto them to teach them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable there are ſome of theſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all Sorts of Idol. Worſhips which are among the Children of the World; but their Worſhip doth not ſtand in what their Eyes ſee, nor in the Things which their Ears hear; but in the Bowedneſs of their Hearts, Souls and Spirits in the inward Man, before the Almighty God. And tho' this Worſhip is not tyed to Man, nor to Place, nor
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:002950_0115_0FE6A2F032EC8790"/>
Time, but when they turn inwardly into themſelves, and the Lord breaks in upon their Hearts, in the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Mercies and Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his Protection and Love toward them. And in this Lowlineſs and ſpiritual. Poverty, their Hearts are ſoftened, and their Souls and Spirits tendred together. And this is the Worſhip that God receives accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from every one in particular, when the Perſon is without any Body but him and the Lord This is the State of the ſcattered Church and her Worſhip, which is in the Spirit, out of the Sight of Men: Of this Sort was the ſeven Thouſand which the Lord had in the Days of <hi>Ahab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the Place and Time when theſe ſhall come to know each other, and the Lord gather ſome of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to join in Worſhip; the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is the ſame, and they in the ſame Spiritual Poverty do worſhip. Yea, it is poor Worſhip that God looks
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:002950_0116_0FE6A2FE0D2F55F0"/>
upon: For <hi>bleſſed are the Poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for there's is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. v. 3. Becauſe the Lord will viſit ſuch, even the poor and needy, and <hi>the contrite in Spirit, who tremble at my Word, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. lxvi. 2. For his Promiſe is, <hi>Where two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in my Name, there I am in the midſt of them.</hi> Mat. xviii. 20.</p>
               <p>THIS Worſhip is poor, becauſe theſe needy Ones have nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned or prepared before-hand to ſpeak nor act, but wait near the Lord, for him to prepare them an Offering that will be acceptable in his Sight; for he hath promiſed to give of his Spirit unto his People, and teach them himſelf, and to make manifeſt unto them, what they ſhall ſay and do.</p>
               <p>AND here is the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the true Church, which Chriſt is the Head, Captain, and Prince of, and the idolatrous Churhes which
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:002950_0116_0FE6A2FE0D2F55F0"/>
have deck'd themſelves with a Set Method, Service, and Worſhip. When they come together, every Thing is made ready: There is Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Old Prayers to be read to fill the People's Ears, and which of them belong to be read this Day, and which to the next Day of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And how little of the Scriptures is to be read on every Day or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? There is alſo a Sermon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and by humane Wiſdom ſet is Order before-hand; ſo that they want nothing from the Lord; they have all Things ready; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but going upon the Service, in their own Time, and in their own Will, and in their own Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waiting upon the Lord for Help and Aſſiſtance: nor for the Holy Spirit to refreſh and comfort them, and to be with them a Life and a Light, to lead them and guide them in their Service; for without the Light [that is Chriſt] we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is acceptable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="unknown:002950_0117_0FE6A2FE27AAD0D0"/>BUT the true Worſhippers, when they come together, the Buſineſs and Concern of every one in particular is to turn inward, and give his Heart and Mind to wait upon the Lord, for his Preſence, to refreſh their Souls: And their Prayers are in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to their Helper, that he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Temple, to drive out the Buyers and Sellers, that they may witneſs true Silence in the inward Man, from all carnal Sounds and Reaſonings of Fleſh and Blood, that they may in Quietneſs and Patience poſſeſs their Souls, and reſign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the Hand of their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, even as Clay into the Hand of the Potter, to the End that he may fit every one to the Service he hath prepared for him.</p>
               <p>SO in this ſilent Waiting their Strength is renewed, and as it is written, <hi>They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their Strength,</hi> Iſa. xl. 31. In this true Silence, they ſit under

the Teaching of that Anointing which they receive <hi>from the Holy One, who is the Spirit of Truth, that leads into all Truth; and as this abides in them, they need not that any one teach them, but as the ſame Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teacheth them all Things,</hi> 1 John ii. 27. And when God ſees meet to put a Word into the Mouth of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of them, he is to ſpeak what the Lord hath revealed and taught him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 4.

               <p>SO here is the Church that cometh up from the Wilderneſs, leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> viii. 5. Here alſo are the Worſhippers and their Worſhip; and as the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt is their Leader in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he likewiſe is to order them in their Lives and Converſations, and all their Affairs, teaching them to love one another, and to take Care one for another, that every Member may keep his own Place, and learn of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to do the Service he has fitted him for, and puts him upon, and that every one may live a clean Life and Converſation in Innocency and Simplicity of Heart, with his Eye to his Maſter.</p>
