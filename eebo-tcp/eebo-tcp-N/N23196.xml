            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>OUR aſſembling at this time, and place, ſpeaks the occaſion import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant—Among other deſigns of a more uſual nature one principal object, is, to record the name of Jehovah in this Houſe, which has lately, been erected for his praiſe. <hi>And now, for the firſt time,</hi> we are called upon to enkindle upon <hi>this Altar,</hi> through the aids of the holy Spirit, thoſe holy and devout af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards GOD, which may reach his throne as ſweet incenſe perfumed in the Blood of the Lamb. And how happy ſhould we be, were theſe affections, we are now to offer, a prelude to our ſtanding in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of GOD above, and joining with the heavenly hoſts, and all the redeemed, in their more pure, and eternal effuſions of love, adoration and praiſe. But while we preſent our ſacrifice here, we are to offer to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030663_0003_0FE854F6AC179900"/>
GOD, our devout acknowledgments—as for all his other mercies, ſo in particular for this—the gift of ſo convenient an edifice, which of his own free bounty and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he has enabled us to accompliſh—And finally, We are here to leave our vows with GOD—that we avouch the Lord Jehovah for our GOD, confeſſing our entire dependence upon him, for all the preſent temporal and ſpiritual favors we enjoy—and all which we hope for, in the world to come.</p>
            <p>That we may perform theſe exerciſes, in a becoming manner, may the Holy Spirit, who dwelt in the temple of old, deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every heart, <hi>enlighten, guide, and direct us,</hi> that at the cloſe of this ſervice, and the cloſe of life, we may find to draw near to GOD is good, and that his loving kindneſs is better than life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>To aſſiſt in the duties before us—the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt: Pſalm</hi> cxlv. <hi>at the</hi> 7<hi>th</hi>—are choſen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſhall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodneſs.</hi>

            <p>WE find that this inſpired Penman, opens his moſt excellent Hymn, with the ſenſe which he had of the divine Majeſty, <hi>wond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous works, and greatneſs.</hi>

               <hi>I will extol thee, my</hi> GOD, <hi>O King, and I will bleſs thy name for ever and ever.—Every day will I bleſs thee, and I will praiſe thy name for ever, and ever.—Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed; and his greatneſs is unſearchable.</hi>—He then gratified the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his heart, in contemplating the unceaſing praiſes of his GOD, by after gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations—<hi>One generation</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſhall praiſe thy works unto another, and ſhall declare thy mighty acts.—They ſhall ſpeak of the might of thy terrible acts.</hi>—And then he introduced the words of the text, <hi>They ſhall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodneſs, and ſhall ſing of thy right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs.</hi> He then proceeded to mention the ſubjects of gratitude which ruſhed into his mind, which in their number and extent, were almoſt boundleſs—But in the particular words which are ſelected for our preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, are noticeable the following things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the goodneſs of GOD is very great towards his people—<hi>Thy great goodneſs.</hi>

the inſtances of GOD's great mercy and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—<hi>They ſhall abundantly utter the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of thy great goodneſs</hi>—and</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is according to the will of GOD—<hi>They ſhall</hi> do thus—The words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, not merely, a prediction of what would be, but the pleaſure of GOD in it, that they ſhould do thus, in a way of duty, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful praiſe—agreeably to the cloſe of the Pſalm, <hi>My mouth ſhall ſpeak the praiſe of the Lord—and let all fleſh, bleſs his holy name, forever, and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears therefore to be the duty of GOD's people, <hi>to utter abundantly</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his great goodneſs towards them.</p>
            <p>From theſe hints, it is propoſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe no more in the following diſcourſe than may be included in this general Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in two parts (viz.)</p>
            <p>Wherein is the great goodneſs of GOD manifeſted towards us, as a nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and an individual ſociety—</p>
            <p>From which, in the concluſion will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the duties of this day.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Then, our ſubject leads us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, in what inſtance the goodneſs of GOD is manifeſted to be great towards us as a nation—</p>
            <p>IN a field ſo wide where can we with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety begin or end?</p>

            <p>Shall we in the</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt.

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:030663_0007_0FE8550A22FED8D8"/>2dly. Take a glance at the great goodneſs of GOD in carrying this people through the ſtruggles of a civil war with Britain—When oppreſſed and doomed to ſlavery, we aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our independence and GOD was pleaſed to eſtabliſh it—But who can count the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and almoſt miraculous interpoſitions of GOD's hand in this affair—In the view of man our cauſe appeared gloomy—<hi>to many deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi>—Without money, without warlike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements—without diſciplined troops we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged—On their ſide was power of every human kind.—But as an anſwer <hi>for all our weakneſs,</hi> and for <hi>all their ſtrength,</hi> The Lord was on our ſide—The language of the people of GOD is put into our lips—<hi>If it had not been, the Lord who was on our ſide, now may Iſrael ſay—Had it not been the Lord, who was on our ſide when men roſe up againſt us—Then they had ſwallowed us up quick— when their wrath was kindled againſt us—then the waters had overwhelmed us, the ſtream had gone over our ſoul—Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth— Our ſoul is eſcaped as a bird out of the ſnare of the Fowler: the ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped; Our help is in the name of the Lord who made Heaven and Earth.</hi>—His mighty acts—his terrible acts, were made known in the judgment inflicted on our foes, and <hi>his
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030663_0008_0FE8550BB10D3870"/>
great goodneſs</hi> manifeſted towards us as a people—</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Shall we again take but a curſory view of GOD's goodneſs towards us ſince the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of peace—As a nation, how greatly bleſſed have we been in the formation, adoption, and eſtabliſhment of a Federal Government—The good hand of GOD, formed men for council, and wiſdom, brought them forward as the Fathers of the people, and guided them to unite the intereſt of individuals, with the good of the whole, in the formation of our general conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Through the guidance of God's good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, this conſtitution, has gone into the moſt benign operation, without the loſs of any man's life, and made us, in reſpect to our civil privileges, one of the happieſt people on the Globe.</p>
            <p>To awaken in us a ſenſe of GOD's great goodneſs in this particular, we need only turn our eyes, acroſs the Atlantic, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the anarchy, rage of party, and flowing blood of an allied nation: What could have reſcued us, from the horrors they experience, but that ſame good providence which has <hi>nouriſhed and brought us up as children</hi>—But whoſe heart is not ſmitten, and whoſe eyes do not <hi>guſh with tears,</hi> to hear of the ſcenes
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030663_0009_0FE855119D72C9B0"/>
of woe and blood, tranſacted in the capital of France, and her other great cities, through means of civil diſcord. Theſe ſcenes by contraſt may ever teach us, the diſtinguiſhing goodneſs of GOD towards us, and make us prize our liberties and civil bleſſings.</p>
            <p>As to our increaſe in population and wealth, what nation has exceeded us? In the year 1783, at the concluſion of peace, the number of inhabitants in the United States were computed at 2, 389, 300—The laſt year they were computed upon a pretty accurate ſcale of calculation, taken from the Cenſus of 1791, and the number was found to be 4, 784, 983—which makes an increaſe ſince the war, of 2, 395, 683—which is ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more than double. Our internal wealth likewiſe has had a rapid increaſe— Our ſhores are lined with ſhips—Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is large and extenſive—and for this two years, been greatly enriching to the country. Our Lands yield their increaſe by handfuls, through the bleſſings of GOD on the labors of the huſbandman. Our country <hi>does much</hi> in feeding the Iſlands of the ſea, and even many on the eaſtern continent. Our granaries are full; affording all manner of ſtore. The preſent year in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the earth has afforded us, rich and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſupplies of every neceſſary and valuable
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030663_0010_0FE85514753DB708"/>
fruit—<hi>The ways of</hi> God <hi>drop marrow and fatneſs to us</hi>—Although in ſome inſtances loſs has been experienced, ſtill the bleſſings of GOD have been ſo abundant in general, that even the appearance of complaint would be criminal.</p>
            <p>In addition to theſe inſtances of GOD's great goodneſs towards us, as a people, we have to notice the continuation of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant life of our chief Magiſtrate, The Preſident of the United States—Many things in the peace, order, and happineſs of our country have ſeemed to depend much upon his wiſe and energetic management—And none can foreſee, what a righteous provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may ſuffer to take place when he falls. Our confidence ought to be in GOD, who is able to form another of equal wiſdom to fill his place—<hi>The lives</hi> alſo of moſt of our chief Rulers have been continued.</p>
            <p>We are to notice likewiſe the continuation of general health. Although ſome places have been viſited with ſickneſs, the people in general have had occaſion to rejoice in GOD, <hi>their Preſerver.</hi> We might ſtill go on to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerate mercies, ſuch as the peace with the natives on our frontiers—The ſuppreſſion of tumults—The peace likewiſe with the regent of Algiers—The treaty with Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—The bleſſings of GOD in ſocieties and families: but where would the growing

numbers end? Theſe hints muſt ſuffice to bring into view GOD's great goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, as a nation, in a <hi>temporal view.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall we in the</p>
            <p>4th And laſt place, hint at our religious privileges—their nature, and importance? But who can ſpeak of the inſtances of GOD's goodneſs in theſe?—A theme like this would be expoſed in the hands of an angel—How much more in the hands of a potters veſſel! —<hi>But</hi> let us juſt obſerve; the word of the ever bleſſed GOD, <hi>is in our hands.</hi> It is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in our own language, and we have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant time, and opportunity to peruſe it—No religious tyranny pretends to interfere, to deprive us of any part of this ineſtimable treaſure—No inquiſition uſurps the authority, of giving <hi>law</hi> to conſcience; or diſturbs our religious exerciſes—<hi>more ſtill,</hi> we have no religion eſtabliſhed by civil Iaw, or one man permitted to domineer over the conſcience of another—But every one is protected in his devotion by the civil arm, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to diſturb his neighbor.</p>
            <p>One day in ſeven is immediately aſſigned for the worſhip of GOD. This day, as yet, is reverenced more generally, by the people of theſe States, than in any other country— though in many caſes as a chriſtian people, we ought to feel the depth of ſhame, <hi>yea, horror,</hi> at our profanation of it—Still, the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030663_0012_0FE8551D0CD45510"/>
Lord is good—He makes it a day beyond conception better, than is enjoyed in moſt countries. In addition to this, how highly favored are we, in the enjoyment of religious information. The Sun of righteouſneſs has bleſſed us with the richeſt ſupply of his cheering beams. How full is our land of the judicious labors of pious men. The truths of GOD's word, <hi>the law and goſpel,</hi> are made to ſhine all around us. No time perhaps can be pointed out, when a people have enjoyed a ſet of teachers more ſincere, enlightened, and evangelical than the preſent.—We have line upon line given us, and are urged to duty and happineſs, by infinite motives from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the word of GOD—Theſe privileges ſhew <hi>the great</hi> and diſtinguiſhing goodneſs of GOD towards us: But when we come to view properly, the nature and importance of the law and goſpel of GOD, as they reſpect our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined race—and the bleſſings to be enjoyed in the kingdom of the Redeemer; <hi>we are</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſwallowed up with the proſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Man by nature is a rebel againſt his</hi> GOD— By turning enemy to him, he has imbibed the Spirit; and has the black character of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer. By this revolt, the whole race of men are ſentenced, by the holy, juſt, and good law of GOD, to death temporal, ſpiritual, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal—They all lie under this juſt and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſentence—But in the infinite compaſſion
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030663_0013_0FE855241AE7A260"/>
of GOD, he ſent his only begotten Son, that whoſoever ſhould believe in him ſhould not periſh, but ſhould have eternal life. The goſpel is this good news of life to a periſhing world—Chriſt Jeſus has actually come, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the law—died on the croſs—lay in the tomb—and roſe again the third day—aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to Heaven, <hi>and ſent down gifts for men, even for the rebellious, that</hi> GOD <hi>might dwell among them.</hi>—The <hi>plan</hi> of the goſpel is ſuch, that while it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the way, it invites, intreats, and beſeeches periſhing mortals, to repent and live—It is the voice of the ever bleſſed GOD to men, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye,</hi> for why <hi>will ye die;</hi> O miſerable ſinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters—and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</hi> How great, how infinite is God's goodneſs towards us in theſe offers of grace!—When it is conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered what is our moral character by nature —When it is realized, we have immortal <hi>ſouls</hi> of vaſt capacity—and of ineſtimable value, which if they continue as they are, muſt be caſt into Hell, <hi>where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched</hi>—and when it is conſidered, what GOD has done for our Salvation, and now is offering us freely the gift of eternal life—the mind is loſt in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration!
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030663_0014_0FE85525AAE55A90"/>
               <hi>No wonder the Angels deſire to look into theſe miſteries</hi> of GOD's goodneſs. Realize further, that it is the whole buſineſs of the Heralds of Salvation, to perſuade us to be reconciled to GOD—and to ſet forth all the arguments which an eternal paradiſe can furniſh, to ſweeten the perſuaſion—and on the other hand, all the terrors of eternal perdition, to enforce the reconciliation: and when it is conſidered, that GOD ſends theſe for our own benefit—how great is his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? But we cannot enlarge here, eternity only will be ſufficient, fully to contemplate this grace.</p>
            <p>Again—GOD is infinitely good to us, in a ſpiritual view—not only in offering mercy, but in abſolutely giving power to his bleſſed goſpel, and ſaving a multitude of precious ſouls from deſtruction. The church of Chriſt is ſpread through our land—There are a multitude, we have reaſon to think, of vital chriſtians in the midſt of us, who are born of GOD—who have eternal life begun in their ſouls—and who have publicly and ſincerely, dedicated themſelves to Chriſt, We have reaſon to think there are more of this deſcription in theſe States, than on any ſpot of equal extent on the globe—The Lord's people are here ſcattered among the multitude, as the ſalt of the earth—
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030663_0015_0FE8552CE1BE0020"/>
the church is as a city ſet on an hill—and is the moral light of our land, and nation.</p>
            <p>In this bleſſed kingdom of the Redeemer, how many and rich are our privileges? time and eternity will not exhauſt their illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—We cannot forbear to mention a few.</p>
            <p>Here GOD himſelf dwells in this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual houſe, and holds communion with all who are his people—Says the Apoſtle to his brethren, <hi>Ye are no more ſtrangers, and foreigners, but are fellow citizens with the ſaints, and of the houſe-hold of</hi> GOD—<hi>and are built upon the foundation, of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone, in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord—In whom ye alſo, are build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together for an habitation of</hi> GOD, <hi>through the Spirit</hi>—Here, GOD himſelf dwells in his habitation—Here <hi>Chriſt walks amidſt his gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en candleſticks, and holds his ſtars in his right hand</hi>—and ſays in the language of his own Spirit, <hi>This is my reſt forever, here will I dwell for I have deſired it: and he loveth the gates of</hi> (this) <hi>Zion, more than all the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Jacob</hi>—Now, the privilege of meeting Chriſt and enjoying the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which he makes of himſelf to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, are eſteemed by them, of infinitely greater value than all things beſide. Here, all the people of GOD, <hi>ſee him;</hi> and to behold
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030663_0016_0FE8552E6F8FBC48"/>
               <hi>the King of Glory in his beauty,</hi> is pleaſant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond deſcription—Said the Pſalmiſt, <hi>O</hi> GOD <hi>my ſoul thirſteth for thee—my fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirſty land where no water is—to ſee thy power, and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen them in the ſanctuary</hi>—A ſight of the glory and power of GOD, in his ſpiritual hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation, is ſo raviſhing to the hearts of GOD's people, as hides the luſtre of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objects—The communion alſo; which they hold with their GOD, is pleaſant—<hi>Thy loving kindneſs</hi> ſays one, <hi>is better than life.</hi> To pour out the heart before him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the communications of his grace, makes the communion bleſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Out of this Zion</hi> alſo, <hi>the perfection of beauty,</hi> GOD <hi>ſhines</hi> by his truth, and illuminates every pious ſoul: <hi>Here</hi> the wonders of redeeming love, refreſh them continually, and cauſe their ſouls to burn within them, as the diſciples go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Emmaus. Here likewiſe, they find ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery needful word, of inſtruction and comfort. Says the Holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking of the church, <hi>I will abundantly bleſs her proviſion, and I will fill her poor with bread: I will alſo clothe her prieſts with Salvation, and her ſaints ſhall ſhout aloud for joy</hi>—How great is this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of divine light, inſtruction, and comfort?</p>
            <p>Here alſo, in this houſehold of GOD, Chriſt ſeals his covenant with his people, by
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030663_0017_0FE85536536ACB70"/>
his ſacraments. By theſe outward ſolemn tranſactions, between GOD and their ſouls, they grow confirmed in the precious bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the goſpel, and live upon the <hi>hidden manna.</hi> They nouriſh their ſpiritual life, by that bread, which came down from Heaven; which gives life to all who partake of it. Indeed the divine ſatisfaction, of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with Chriſt, and he with them, is a moſt glorious anticipation of the Heavenly felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—thoſe who have never taſted this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion cannot judge of its privilege.</p>
            <p>In the light of this dwelling of GOD, ſouls are alſo, <hi>created anew,</hi> in the image of him that created them—Says the Holy Spirit—<hi>Of Zion it ſhall be ſaid, that this and that man, were born in her—and when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there</hi>— How unſpeakable is this privilege, as a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mean, of bringing loſt ſouls to life, and the eternal enjoyment of their GOD and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? In view of theſe ſpiritual privileges, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in the bleſſed kingdom of the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we cannot but ſee, that here is the place where the people of GOD on earth, hold the greateſt communion, with the ſaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. In theſe ſacred ordinances, Heaven and Earth are united. Chriſt and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are united, and the latter are here made <hi>meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the ſaints in light</hi>—This doubtleſs made the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030663_0018_0FE85537E14044A0"/>
Pſalmiſt expreſs himſelf with exultation and ſay—<hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe— Bleſſed is the man, whoſe ſtrength is in thee, they go from ſtrength to ſtrength, every one in Zion appeareth before thee—A day ſpent in thy houſe, is better than a thouſand—I had rather be a door-keeper, in the houſe of my</hi> GOD, <hi>than to dwell in the tents of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>—Now, of theſe divine bleſſings, <hi>all</hi> who are the people of GOD, partake in great perfection—and multitudes of our fathers, mothers, brethren and ſiſters, friends and relatives, are doubtleſs preparing for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicity in Heayen. But it is likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that the perfection of theſe ſocial bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, in the kingdom of Chriſt, could not be enjoyed, without the accommodation, of external temples made with hands: In dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ages of the church therefore, GOD has directed his people, <hi>To build him Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, that he might dwell among them,</hi> and confer upon them theſe infinite bleſſings. He has promiſed <hi>that in every place</hi> (or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) <hi>where I record my name, I will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee and bleſs thee.</hi> In this reſpect finally, as a chriſtian people, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſally accommodated and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed—<hi>How manifold are</hi> GOD's <hi>mercies?</hi> But as this external accommodation, has been provided for us particularly, the preſent year, and as the good providence
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030663_0019_0FE8553D177EA218"/>
of GOD, has aſſembled us here, in his <hi>ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary which is now dedicated to his worſhip,</hi> on this anniverſary feſtival—With great propriety as we hinted in the beginning, we may contemplate GOD's great goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, as a ſociety <hi>in this ſingle particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But at what period ſhall we begin? Our minds are naturally carried back, to that deſolating ſcene in which our former houſe was laid in ruins<note n="*" place="bottom">In Nov. 26 1793—A fire broke out in a ſtore in this city, owned by Meſſrs. Hubbards &amp; Greene, about ſix in the evening— and burnt with much fury. It continued to encreaſe, baffling all efforts to ſuppreſs it, till it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed fifteen buildings, among which was the Meeting Houſe—Through a kind Providence, the wind ſuddenly ſhifting carried the flames back from its firſt courſe—and by the vigorous exertions of the citizens, were ſuppreſſed. No lives were loſt. The loſs of property in the whole was eſtimated from eight to ten thouſand pounds.</note>—The frown of GOD, lay upon us for that moment; many of us have felt the rebuke, till this hour—the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was terrible, though mingled with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Our feelings as a ſociety, received a ſenſible check, in reſpect to our worldly proſpects—but did not ſink. The Lord was kinder to us than we deſerved, and ſpared the moſt of our dwellings from the flames. Soon the cloud of GOD's diſpleaſure, began to <hi>diſſipate,</hi> the firſt meeting which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for the purpoſe of rebuilding an houſe of worſhip, evidenced the good hand of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030663_0020_0FE85541252E3428"/>
GOD towards us. The union, prudence, and mutual kindneſs, which appeared was ſingular. All as one, expreſſed their wiſhes to attempt the execution of ſo important a deſign; and leave to the deciſions of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whether <hi>means</hi> could be obtained by gratuity, for the accompliſhment of it. As is was the Lord who put it into the hearts of the people of old, to give for the building of the temple; ſubſcriptions for this purpoſe, far ſurpaſſed our expectations. The attempt likewiſe to raiſe ſupplies from our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring friends by lot, ſucceeded <hi>perfectly</hi>—beyond what might juſtly be expected, eſpecially in the caſe of thoſe donations which were generouſly given <note n="†" place="bottom">Theſe were by Thomas Shaw Eſq. of New-London, 262 Dollars, and Col. Joſeph Williams of Norwich, 131 Dollars. Being their ſhares in the higheſt Prize in the Lottery.</note> and every ſucceſſive attempt has been proſperous.</p>
            <p>We are next to notice that the goodneſs of GOD has appeared great—in the procuring the materials—the location of the houſe— the hazard of rearing of it up, and the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious taſk of finiſhing. Theſe have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with diſpatch—without any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous events, ſuch as wounds—diviſions or unfriendly feelings on any ſide, which events frequently happen, as a ſore evil, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030663_0021_0FE85548E8061418"/>
greatly to be lamented. And now, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of GOD, has crowned our wiſhes, in the complete enjoyment of this convenient and pleaſant ſanctuary.</p>
            <p>You will ſuffer me therefore in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this diſcourſe juſt to hint, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to which we are called this day—and</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It becomes us to treaſure up in our memories, theſe various inſtances of GOD's goodneſs towards us, as <hi>a people,</hi> and as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety—To forget the loving kindneſſes of GOD, as ſoon as experienced is ungrateful— it argues the baſeſt unchriſtian temper—one which a grateful people muſt abhor.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. As the people of GOD, we are called upon this day to expreſs the grateful feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our hearts, in <hi>uttering</hi> abundantly the memory of his great goodneſs towards us. We are to acknowledge GOD in all his kindneſſes—we are to ſpeak and rehearſe over his mercies, which our memories have treaſured up—We are to meditate and talk of his mighty acts, which he hath done for our fathers and country in general—and ſhow forth his praiſe in public, and private. Particularly we are to praiſe GOD for his goodneſs towards us the current year, in our temporal intereſts—that he has bleſſed us in general, in our baſket and ſtore—that he has ſo far preſerved our health, and dwellings from deſtructive judgments: But
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030663_0022_0FE8554A778B7B80"/>
eſpecially we are to praiſe GOD this day for his goodneſs in bleſſing our exertions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his kingdom and cauſe, and for giving us this his temple—that he has given to the people of this place, ſuch union, and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from the firſt to the preſent—that he has given ſo much wiſdom and prudence in all our deliberations from time to time, as to create no diſcord—we are to praiſe him likewiſe for all his goodneſs in the various ſteps, by which it has been accompliſhed, even from the foundation. And in praiſing GOD for his mercies in this reſpect, we are to thank thoſe public ſervants who have given their time and attention to the overſight and direction of the work; and thoſe alſo who have deſerved well in the manual performance of it. <hi>But</hi> above all we are to praiſe GOD, for thoſe divine and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed privileges to which by this <hi>ſacred altar</hi> we are admitted—Here my Friends, do we not hope to meet in an humble, devout, and joyful manner, the Great GOD himſelf, and yield up our ſouls to him? Do we not hope to hold communion with the Father and with his ſon Jeſus Chriſt upon our ſoul's eternal concerns? Do we not hope to receive the bleſſed light of the goſpel, and be ſanctified by the truth—and the divine influences of the holy ſpirit? Do we not hope to ſit around the ſacred board, and ſeal our covenant with

GOD, by eating and drinking the cymbals of the death of our Divine Jeſus? Do we not expect to be refreſhed with the bread, which wiſdom has prepared, and the wine ſhe hath mingled?—And finally do we not expect in the uſe of theſe privileges, to hold intercourſe with the heavenly word? Nay, do we not hope to be prepared for death; and to ſtand before GOD in his temple above, and ſing his praiſes eternally?—<hi>O, then,</hi> if you entertain theſe hopes <hi>as the people of</hi> GOD, <hi>then rehearſe his mercies now;</hi> utter the memory of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming love, and ſovereign grace.

with us—and finally we ſhall meet in his preſence, <hi>where is fulneſs of joy,</hi> and join in the ſeraphic anthems of redeeming love— and now while we view the great goodneſs of GOD on every ſide: Let us join in the language of the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Thy mercy O Lord is great unto the Heavens, and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds—I will extol thee my</hi> GOD, <hi>O King: I will bleſs thy name for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever—I will ſpeak of the glorious honor of thy majeſty and of thy wonderous works—All thy works ſhall praiſe thee, and thy Saints ſhall bleſs thee—they ſhall ſpeak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—Sing praiſes to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion, declare among the people his doings.

            <p>Finally—<hi>Praiſe</hi> GOD <hi>in his ſanctuary—Praiſe him for his mighty acts—Praiſe him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his excellent greatneſs—Praiſe him with the ſound of the trumpet—Praiſe him with the Pſaltery and harp—Praiſe him upon the loud cymbals—let every thing that hath breath, Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi>
