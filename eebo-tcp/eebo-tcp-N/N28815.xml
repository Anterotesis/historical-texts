            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>HAIL, ſweet aſylum of my infancy! Content and innocence reſide beneath your humble roof, and charity unboaſtful of the good it renders. Hail, ye ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable trees! my happieſt hours of childiſh gaiety were paſt beneath your ſhelter—then, careleſs as the birds that ſung upon your boughs, I laughed the hours away, nor knew of evil.</p>
                     <p>Here ſurely I ſhall be guarded from duplicity; and if not happy, at leaſt in ſome degree tranquil. Here unmoleſted may I wait, till the rude ſtorm of ſorrow is overblown, and my father's arms are again expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive me.</p>
                     <p>Such were the words of Amanda, as the chaiſe (which ſhe had hired at a neighbouring village on quitting the mail) turned down a little verdant lane, almoſt darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by old trees, whoſe interwoven branches allowed her ſcarcely a glimpſe of her nurſe's cottage, till ſhe had reached the door.</p>
                     <p>A number of tender recollections ruſhing upon her mind, rendered her almoſt unable to alight; but the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038416_0005_1011E130EA3BFF18"/>
nurſe and her huſband, who had been impatiently watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the arrival of their fondling, aſſiſted her; and the former, obeying the dictates of nature and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, half ſtifled her with careſſes; the latter reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kiſſed her hand, and dropt a tear of unutterable joy upon it. Lort, he ſaid, he was ſurpriſed to be ſure, at the alteration a few years had made in her perſon—Why, it ſeemed to him as if it was only the other day ſince he had carried her about in his arms, quite a little fairy. Then he begged to know how his tear old cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was, and Mr. Oſcar—and whether the latter was not grown a very fine youth. Amanda, ſmiling through her tears, endeavoured to anſwer his enquiries; but ſhe was ſo much affected by her feelings, as to be ſcarcely able to ſpeak; and when, by her deſire, he went out to diſcharge the chaiſe, and aſſiſt the young man (who had travelled with her from London) to bring in her luggage, her head ſunk upon her nurſe's boſom, whoſe arms encircled her waiſt. "My dear faithful nurſe," ſhe ſobbed, "your poor child is again returned to ſeek an aſylum from you."—"And ſhe is heartily welcome," replied the good creature, crying herſelf, "and I have taken care to have every thing ſo nice, and ſo tidy, and ſo comfortable, that I warrant you the greateſt laty in the land need not diſdain your apartments; and here are two little girls, as well as myſelf, that will always be ready to attend, and ſerve, and obey you. This is El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, your own foſter ſiſter; and this is Betſy, the little thing I had in the cradle when you went away—and I have beſides, though I ſay it myſelf, that ſhould not ſay it, two as fine lads as you could wiſh to ſee: they are now at work at a farmer's hard by; but they will be here preſently. Thank Cot, we are all happy, though obliged to earn our own bread; but 'tis ſweeter for that reaſon, ſince labour gives us health to enjoy it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment bleſſes us all." Amanda affectionately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the two girls, who were the pictures of health and cheerfulneſs, and was then conducted into a little parlour, which, with a ſmall bed-chamber adjoining it, was appropriated to her uſe. The neatneſs of the room
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038416_0006_1011E1338CC42488"/>
was truly pleaſing; the floor was nicely ſanded; the hearth was dreſt with "flowers and fennel gay;" and the chimney-piece adorned with a range of broken tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cups, "wiſely kept for ſhew;" a clock ticked behind the door; and an ebony cupboard diſplayed a profuſion of the ſhowyeſt ware the country could produce.</p>
                     <p>And now the nurſe, on "hoſpitable thought intent," hurried from Amanda to prepare her dinner. The chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, as ſhe ſaid herſelf, was ready to pop down in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute; Ellen tied the aſparagus, and Betſy laid the cloth; Edwin drew his beſt cyder, and having brought it in himſelf, retired to entertain his gueſt in the kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, (Amanda's travelling companion) before whom he had already ſet ſome of his moſt ſubſtantial fare.</p>
                     <p>Dinner, in the opinion of Amanda, was ſerved in a moment; but her heart was too full to eat, though preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do ſo with the utmoſt tenderneſs; a tenderneſs which in truth was the means of overcoming her.</p>
                     <p>When inſulted by malice, or oppreſſed by cruelty, the heart can aſſume a ſtern fortitude foreign to its nature; but this ſeeming apathy vaniſhes at the voice of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the rigid froſt of winter melts before the gentle influence of the ſun; and tears, guſhing tears of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſenſibility expreſs its yielding feelings. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred are ſuch tears; they flow from the ſweet ſource of ſocial affection: the good alone can ſhed them.</p>
                     <p>Her nurſe's ſons ſoon returned from their labour; two fine nut-brown youths. They had been the companions of her infant ſports, and ſhe ſpoke to them with the moſt engaging affability.</p>
                     <p>Domeſtic bliſs and rural felicity Amanda had always been accuſtomed to, till within a ſhort period; her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to them was ſtill as ſtrong as ever; and had her father been with her, ſhe would have been happy.</p>
                     <p>It was now about the middle of June, and the whole country was glowing with luxuriant beauty. The cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was in reality a comfortable, commodious farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; it was ſituated in North Wales, and the roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſcenery ſurrounding it was highly pleaſing to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition like Amanda's, which delighted equally in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038416_0007_1011E13519498E78"/>
ſublime and beautiful. The front of the cottage was almoſt covered with woodbine, intermingled with vines; and the lane already mentioned, formed a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy avenue up to the very door; one ſide overlooked a deep valley, winding amongſt hills clad in the livelieſt verdure; a clear ſtream, running through it, turned a mill in its courſe, and afforded a ſalutary coolneſs to the herds which ruminated on its banks; the other ſide commanded a view of rich paſtures, terminated by a thick grove, whoſe natural viſtas gave a view of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated farms, a ſmall irregular village, the ſpire of its church, and a fine old caſtle, whoſe ſtately turrets roſe above the trees ſurrounding them.</p>
                     <p>The farm yard, at the back of the cottage, was ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with poultry, and all the implements of rural induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; the garden was divided from it by a rude paling, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with honey ſuckles and wild roſes; the part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated for vegetables divided from the part ſacred to Flora by rows of fruit trees; a craggy precipice hung over it, covered with purple and yellow flowers, thyme and other odoriferous herbs, which afforded browzage to three or four goats that ſkipped about in playful gambols; a ſilver ſtream trickled down the precipice, and winding round a plantation of ſhrubs, fell with a gentle murmur into the valley. Beneath a projecting fragment of the rock a natural receſs was formed, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lined with moſs, and planted round with a ſucceſſion of beautiful flowers.</p>

                     <p>Of thoſe ſcenes Amanda had but an imperfect recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; ſuch a faint idea as we retain of a confuſed but agreeable dream, which, though we cannot explain, leaves a pleaſing impreſſion behind.</p>
                     <p>Peculiar circumſtances had driven her from the ſhelter of a parent's arms, to ſeek ſecurity in retirement at this
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038416_0008_1011E136D449F458"/>
abode of ſimplicity and peace. Here the perturbation of fear ſubſided; but the ſoft melancholy of her ſoul at times was heightened, when ſhe reflected, that in this very place an unfortunate mother had expired almoſt at the moment of giving her birth.</p>
                     <p>Amanda was now about nineteen; a deſcription of her face and perſon would not do her juſtice, as it never could convey a full idea of the ineffable ſweetneſs and ſenſibility of the former, or the ſtriking elegance and beautiful proportion of the latter.</p>
                     <p>Sorrow had faded her vived bloom: for the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of her father weighed heavy on her heart, and the bloſſom drooped with the tree that ſupported it. Her agonized parent witneſſing this ſudden change, ſent her into Wales, as much for health as for ſecurity; ſhe was ordered goat's whey and gentle exerciſe; but ſhe firmly believed, that conſolation on her father's account could alone effect a cure.</p>
                     <p>Though the roſe upon her check was pale, and the luſtre of her eyes was fled, ſhe was from thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (if leſs dazzling to the eye) more affecting to the heart. Cold and unfeeling indeed muſt that one have been, which could ſee her unmoved: for her's was that intereſting face and figure, which had power to fix the wandering eye, and change the gaze of admiration into the throb of ſenſibility; nor was her mind inferior to the form that enſhrined it.</p>
                     <p>She now exerted her ſpirits in gratitude to her humble but benevolent friends. Her arrival had occaſioned a little feſtival at the cottage: the tea-things, which were kept more for ſhow than uſe in the ebony cupboard, were now taken out, and carried by her deſire to the receſs in the garden; whither Mrs. Edwin followed the family with a hot cake, Amanda thought large enough to ſerve half the principality.</p>
                     <p>The ſcene was delightful, and well calculated to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all ſadneſs but deſpair; Amanda was therefore cheered: for ſhe was too much the child of pity ever to have felt its baneful influence. In the midſt of her troubles ſhe ſtill looked up with humble confidence to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038416_0009_1011E13973E4FD08"/>
that Power, who has promiſed never to forſake the righteous.</p>
                     <p>The harmleſs jeſt, the jocund laugh went round, and Amanda enjoyed the innocent gaiety; for a benevolent mind will ever derive pleaſure from the happineſs of others. The declining ſun now gave ſofter beauties to the extenſive ſcenery; the lowing of the cattle was faintly echoed by the neighbouring hills; the cheerful carol of the peaſant floated on the evening gale, that ſtole perfumes from beds of flowers, and wafted them around; the buſy bees had now completed the delicious labour of the day, and with inceſſant humming ſought their various hives, while

                           <l>Were prodigal of harmony.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>To complete the concert, a blind harper, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported himſelf by ſummer rambles through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſtroled into the garden; and after a plentiful repaſt of bread and cheeſe, and nut brown ale, began playing.</p>
                     <p>The venerable appearance of the muſician, the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple melody of his harp, recalled to Amanda's recollection the tales of other times, in which ſhe had ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted; it ſent her ſoul back to the ages of old, to the days of other years, when bards rehearſed the exploits of heroes, and ſung the praiſes of the dead. "While the ghoſts of thoſe they ſung, came in their ruſtling winds, and were ſeen to bend with joy towards the ſound of their praiſe." To proceed in the beautiful language of Oſſian, the ſound was mournful and low, like the ſong of the tomb; ſuch as Fingal heard when the crowded ſighs of his boſom roſe; and, "ſome of my heroes are low," ſaid the grey haired king of Morven: "I hear the ſound of death on the harp. Oſſian, touch the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtring. Bid the ſorrow riſe, that their ſpirits may fly with joy to Morven's woody hills." He touched the harp before the king: the ſound was mournful and low.</p>
                     <p>"Bend forwards from your clouds," he ſaid, "ghoſts
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038416_0010_1011E13D6FAD8548"/>
of my fathers bend. Lay by the red terror of your courſe. Receive the falling chief; whether he comes from a diſtant land, or riſes from the rolling ſea, let his robe of miſt be near; his ſpear, that is formed of a cloud, place an half-extinguiſhed meteor by his ſide, in the form of the hero's ſword. And, oh! let his countenance be lovely, that his friends may delight in his preſence. Bend from your clouds," he ſaid, "ghoſts of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, bend."</p>
                     <p>The ſweet enthuſiaſm which aroſe in Amanda's mind from her preſent ſituation her careful nurſe ſoon put an end to, by reminding her of the heavy dew then falling. Amanda could have ſtaid for hours in the garden; but reſigning her inclination to her nurſe's, ſhe immediately accompanied her into the houſe. She ſoon felt inclined to retire to reſt; and after a ſlight ſupper of ſtrawberries and cream, (which was all they could prevail on her to touch) ſhe withdrew to her chamber, attended by the nurſe and her two daughters, who all thought their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices requiſite; and it was not without much difficulty Amanda perſuaded them to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Left to ſolitude, a tender awe ſtole upon the mind of Amanda, when ſhe reflected, that in this very room her mother had expired. The recollection of her ſufferings, the ſorrows her father and ſelf had experienced ſince the period of her death, the diſtreſſes they ſtill felt and might yet go through, all raiſed a ſudden agony in her ſoul, and tears burſt forth, ſhe went to the bed, and knelt beſide it. "Oh! my mother," ſhe cried, "if thy departed ſpirit is permitted to look down upon this world, hear and regard the ſupplications of thy child, for thy protection amidſt the ſnares which may be ſpread for her. Yet," continued ſhe after a pauſe, "that Being, who has taken thee to himſelf, will, if I continue inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, extend his guardian care; to Him therefore, to Him be raiſed the fervent prayer for rendering abortive every ſcheme of treachery."</p>
                     <p>She prayed with all the fervency of devotion; her wandering thoughts were all reſtrained, and her paſſions gradually ſubſided into a calm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:038416_0011_1011E13F010DA740"/>
Warmed by a pure and ardent piety, that ſacred pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which comes with healing on its wings to the afflicted children of humanity, ſhe felt a placid hope ſpring in her heart, that whiſpered to it, all would yet be well.</p>
                     <p>She roſe tranquil and animated. The inhabitants of the cottage had retired to repoſe; and ſhe heard no ſound ſave the ticking of the clock from the outſide room. She went to the window, and raiſing the white calico curtain, looked down the valley; it was illumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the beams of the moon, which tipt the trees with a ſhadowy ſilver, and threw a line of radiance on the clear rivulet. All was ſtill, as if creation ſlept upon the boſom of ſerenity. Here, while contemplating the ſcene, a ſudden flutter at the window ſtartled her; and ſhe ſaw in a moment after a bird flit acroſs, and perch on a tree whoſe boughs ſhaded the caſement: a ſoft ſerenade was immediately begun by the ſweet and plaintive bird of night.</p>
                     <p>Amanda at length dropt the curtain, and ſought repoſe; it ſoon bleſt her eye-lids, and ſhed a ſweet obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion over all her cares.</p>

                     <p>FITZALAN, the father of Amanda, was the deſcendant of an ancient Iriſh family, which had how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unfortunately, attained the ſummit of its proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty long before his entrance into life; ſo that little more than the name, once dignified by illuſtrious actions, was left to its poſterity. The parents of Fitzalan were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by an employment under government, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled them to ſave a ſmall ſum for their ſon, and only child, who at an early period became its ſole maſter, by their dying within a ſhort period of each other. As ſoon as he had in ſome degree recovered the ſhock of ſuch calamities, he laid out his little pittance in the purchaſe of a commiſſion, as a profeſſion beſt ſuiting his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and finances.</p>
                     <p>The war between America and France had then juſt commenced; and Fitzalan's regiment was amongſt the firſt forces ſent to the aid of the former. The ſcenes of war, tho' dreadfully affecting to a ſoul of exquiſite ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, ſuch as he poſſeſſed, had not power to damp the ardour of his ſpirit: for with the name, he inherited the hardy reſolution of his progenitors.</p>
                     <p>He had once the good fortune to ſave the life of a Britiſh ſoldier: he was one of a ſmall party, who, by the treachery of their guides, were ſuddenly ſurpriſed in a wood, through which they were obliged to paſs, to join
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038416_0013_1011E145582AD038"/>
another detachment of the army. Their only way in this alarming exigence was to retreat to the fort from whence they had but lately iſſued; encompaſſed as they were by the enemy, this was not atchieved without the greateſt difficulty. Juſt as they had reached it, Fitzalan ſaw far behind them a poor ſoldier, who had been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the firſt onſet, juſt overtaken by two Indians. Yielding to the impulſe of compaſſion in which all idea of ſelf was loſt, Fitzalan haſtily turned to his aſſiſtance, and flinging himſelf between the purſued and the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he kept them at bay till the poor creature had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a place of ſafety. This action, performed at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent hazard of his life, ſecured him the laſting grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the ſoldier, whoſe name was Edwin; the ſame that now afforded an aſylum to his daughter.</p>
                     <p>Edwin had committed ſome juvenile indiſcretions, which highly incenſed his parents: in deſpair at incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their reſentment, he enliſted with a recruiting party in their neighbourhood; but accuſtomed all his life to peace and plenty, he did not by any means reliſh his new ſituation. His gratitude to Fitzalan was unbounded; he conſidered him as the preſerver of his life; and, on the man's being diſmiſſed, who had hitherto attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as a ſervant, entreated he might be taken in his place. This entreaty Fitzalan complied with; he was pleaſed with Edwin's manner; and, having heard the little hiſtory of his misfortunes, promiſed on their return to Europe, to intercede with his friends for him.</p>
                     <p>During his ſtay abroad, Fitzalan was promoted to a captain-lieutenancy: his pay was his only ſupport, which of neceſſity checked his benevolence of ſpirit "open as day to melting charity."</p>
                     <p>On the regiment's return to Europe, he obtained Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win's diſcharge, who longed to re-enter upon his former mode of life. He accompanied the penitent himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wales, where he was received with the trueſt rapture.</p>
                     <p>In grief for his loſs, his parents had forgotten all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment for his errors, which indeed had never been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great: they had loſt their two remaining children du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his abſence, and now received him as the ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and hope of their age.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="unknown:038416_0014_1011E147B96924C0"/>
His youthful protector was bleſt with the warmeſt gratitude; tears filled his fine eyes, as he beheld the pleaſure of the parents, and contrition of the ſon; and he departed with that heart-felt pleaſure, which ever attends and rewards, an action of humanity.</p>
                     <p>He now accompanied his regiment into Scotland: they were quartered at a fort in a remote part of that kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Near the fort was a fine old abbey belonging to the family of Dunreath; the high hills which nearly encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed it, were almoſt all covered with trees, whoſe dark ſhades gave the appearance of gloomy ſolitude to the building.</p>
                     <p>The preſent poſſeſſor, the Earl of Dunreath, was now far advanced in life: twice had he married, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a male heir to his large eſtates, and twice had he been diſappointed. His firſt lady had expired immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the birth of a daughter. She had taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her protection a young female, who by unexpected viciſſitudes of her family, was left deſtitute of ſupport. On the demiſe of her patroneſs, ſhe retired from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey to the houſe of a kinſwoman in its vicinity: the Earl of Dunreath, accuſtomed to her ſociety, felt his ſolitude doubly augmented by her abſence. He had ever followed the dictates of inclination, and would not diſobey them now: ere the term of mourning was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, he offered his hand, and was accepted.</p>
                     <p>The fair orphan, now triumphant miſtreſs of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, found there was no longer occaſion to check her natural propenſities. Her ſoul was vain, unfeeling, and ambitious; and the ſudden elevation broke down all bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers which prudence had hitherto oppoſed to her paſſions.</p>
                     <p>She ſoon gained an abſolute aſcendency over her lord—ſhe knew how to aſſume the ſmile of complacence, and the accent of ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>Forgetful of the kindneſs of her late patroneſs, ſhe treated the infant ſhe had left, with the crueleſt neglect; a neglect, which was, if poſſible, increaſed, on the birth of her own daughter, as ſhe could not bear that Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, (inſtead of poſſeſſing the whole) ſhould only ſhare
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038416_0015_1011E14949B050F0"/>
the affection and eſtates of her father. She contrived by degrees to alienate the former from the innocent Malvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na; and ſhe truſted ſhe ſhould yet find means to deprive her of the latter.</p>
                     <p>Terrified by violence, and depreſſed by ſeverity, the child looked dejected and unhappy: and this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Lady Dunreath made the Earl believe, proceeded from ſulkineſs and natural ill humour. Her own child, unreſtrained in any wiſh of her heart, was, from her playful, gaiety, a conſtant ſource of amuſement to the Earl; her mother had taken care to inſtruct her in all the little endearments, which, when united with infantine ſweetneſs, allure almoſt imperceptibly the affections.</p>
                     <p>Malvina, ere ſhe knew the meaning of ſorrow, thus became its prey: but in ſpite of envy or ill treatment ſhe grew up with all the graces of mind and form, that had diſtinguiſhed her mother: her air was at once ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and commanding; her face replete with ſweetneſs; and her fine eyes had a mixture of ſenſibility and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in them, which ſpoke to the feeling ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Auguſta was alſo a fine figure; but unpoſſeſſed of the winning graces of elegance and modeſty, which adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſiſter, her form always appeared decorated with the moſt ſtudied art, and her large eyes had a confident aſſurance in them, that ſeemed to expect and demand univerſal homage.</p>
                     <p>The warriors of the fort were welcome viſitants at the Abbey, which lady Dunreath contrived to render a ſcene of almoſt conſtant gaiety, by keeping up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual intercourſe with all the adjacent families, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining all the ſtrangers who came into its neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                     <p>Lord Dunreath had long been a prey to infirmities, which at this period generally confined him to his room; but though his body was debilitated, his mind retained all its active powers.</p>
                     <p>The firſt appearance of the officers at the Abbey was at a ball given by lady Dunreath, in conſequence of their arrival near it; the gothic apartments were decorated, and lighted up with a ſplendor that at once diſplayed taſte
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038416_0016_1011E14B0432C888"/>
and magnificence; the lights, the muſic, the brilliancy and unuſal gaiety of the company, all gave to the ſpirits of Malvina an agreeable flutter they had never before experienced; and a brighter bloom than uſual ſtole ov'r her lovely cheek.</p>
                     <p>The young co-heireſſes were extremely admired by the military heroes. Malvina as the eldeſt, opened the ball with the colonel; her form had attracted the eyes of Fitzalan, and vainly he attempted to withdraw them, till the lively converſation of Auguſta who honoured him with her hand, forced him to reſtrain his glances, and pay her the ſprightly attention ſo generally expected—when he came to turn to Malvina, he involuntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her hand for a moment; ſhe bluſhed and the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beam that ſtole from her half-averted eyes, agitated his whole ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Partners were changed in the courſe of the evening, and he ſeized the firſt opportunity that offered, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging her: the ſoftneſs of her voice, the ſimplicity yet elegance of her language, now captivated his heart, as much as her form had charmed his eyes.</p>
                     <p>Never had he before ſeen an object he thought half ſo lovely or engaging; with her he could not ſupport that lively ſtrain of converſation he had done with her ſiſter. Where the heart is much intereſted, it will not admit of trifling.</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan was now in the meredian of manhood; his ſtature was above the common ſize, and elegance and dignity were conſpicuous in it; his features were regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handſome, and the fairneſs of his forehead proved what his complection had been, till change of climate and hardſhip had embrowned it; the expreſſion of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was ſomewhat plaintive; his eyes had a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, that ſpoke a ſoul of the tendereſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and the ſmile that played around his mouth would have adorned a face of female beauty.</p>
                     <p>When the dance with lady Malvina was over, Lady Auguſta took care for the remainder of the evening to engroſs all his attention. She thought him by far the handſomeſt man in the room, and gave him no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038416_0017_1011E14D8C4EC5A8"/>
of avoiding her; gallantry obliged him to return her aſſiduities, and he was by his brother officers ſet down in the liſt of her adorers. This miſtake he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; he could bear raillery on an indifferent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and joined in the mirth, which the idea of his laying ſiege to the young heireſs occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>He deluded himſelf with no falſe hopes relative to the real object of his paſſion; he knew the obſtacles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them were inſuperable; but his heart was too proud to complain of fate: he ſhook off all appearance of melancholy, and ſeemed more animated than ever.</p>
                     <p>His viſits at the Abbey became conſtant; Lady Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta took them to herſelf, and encouraged his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: as her mother rendered her perfect miſtreſs of her own actions, ſhe had generally a levee of red coats eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning in her dreſſing room. Lady Malvina ſeldom appeared; ſhe was at thoſe times almoſt always employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reading to her father; when that was not the caſe, her own favourite avocations often detained her in her room; or elſe ſhe wandered out, about the romantic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Fitzalan went one morning as uſual to the Abbey to pay his cuſtomary viſit: as he went through the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery which led to Lady Auguſta's dreſſing-room, his eyes were caught by two beautiful portraits of the Earl's daughters; an artiſt, by his expreſs deſire, had come to the Abbey to draw them; they were juſt finiſhed, and that morning placed in the gallery.</p>

                     <p>Lady Malvina was repreſented in the ſimple attire of a peaſant girl, leaning on a little graſſy hillock whoſe foot was waſhed by a clear ſtream; while her flock browſed

                     <p>"Beautiful portrait," cried Fitzalam, "ſweet reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a ſeraphic form."</p>
                     <p>He heard a ſoft ſigh behind him; he ſtarted, turned, and perceived. Lady Malvina; in the utmoſt confuſion he faultered o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t his admiration of the pictures, and not knowing what he did, fixed his eyes on Lady Auguſta's, exclaiming, "How beautiful."—"'Tis very handſome indeed," ſaid Malvina, with a more penſive voice than uſual, and led the way to her ſiſters dreſſing-room.</p>
                     <p>Lady Auguſta was ſpangling ſome ribbon; but at Fitzalan's entrance ſhe threw it aſide, and aſked him if he had been admiring her picture. Yes he ſaid, 'twas that alone had prevented his before paying his homage to the original. He proceeded in a ſtrain of compliments, which had more gallantry than ſincerity in them. In the courſe of their trifling, he ſnatched a knot of the ſpangled ribbon, and pinning it next hit heart, declared it ſhould remain there as a taliſman againſt all future impreſſions.</p>
                     <p>He ſtole a glance at Lady Malvina, ſhe held a book in her hand; but her eyes were turned towards him, and a deadly paleneſs overſpread her countenance.</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan's ſpirits vaniſhed; he ſtarted up and declared he muſt be gone immediately. The dejection of Lady Malvina dwelt upon his heart; it flattered its fondneſs but pained its ſenſibility. He le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The ſcene was wild and ſolemn; the ſhadows of evening were beginning to deſcend; the waves ſtole with low murmurs upon the ſhore, and a ſoft breeze gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly agitated the marine plants that grew amongſt the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the rocks; already were the ſea fowl, with harſh and melancholy cries, flocking to their neſts, ſome lightly ſkimming over the ſurface of the water, while others were ſeen, like dark clouds riſing from the long heath of the neighbouring hills. Fitzalan purſued his way in deep and melancholy meditation, from which a

                        </gap>ouſed him. He looked towards the ſpot from whence the ſound proceeded, and beheld Lady Malvina ſtanding on a low rock, a projection of it afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſupport. Nothing could be more pictureſque, than her appearance; ſhe looked like one of the beautiful forms, which Oſſian ſo often deſcribes; her white dreſs fluttered in the wind, and her dark hair hung diſhevel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led around her. Fitzalan moved ſoftly, and ſtopt behind her; ſhe wept as ſhe ſung, and wiped away her tears as ſhe ceaſed ſinging: ſhe ſighed heavily. "Ah my mother," ſhe exclaimed, "why was Malvina left behind you?"</p>
                     <p>"To bleſs and improve mankind," cried Fitzalan," She ſcreamed and would have fallen, had he not caught her in his arms: he prevailed on her to ſit down upon the rock, and allow him to ſupport her, till her agitation had ſubſided. "And why," (cried he) "ſhould Lady Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina give way to melancholy, bleſt as ſhe is with all that can render life deſirable; Why ſeek its indulgence, by rambling about thoſe dreary rocks, fit haunts alone, he might have added, for wretchedneſs and me? Can I help wondering at your dejection," (continued he) "when to all appearance (at leaſt) I ſee you poſſeſſed of every thing requiſite to conſtitute felicity?</p>
                     <p>"Appearances are often deceitful," ſaid Malvina, (forgetting in that moment the caution ſhe had hitherto inviolably obſerved, of never hinting at the ill treament ſhe had received from the Counteſs of Dunreath and her daughter.) "Appearances are often deceitful," ſhe ſaid, "as I, alas! too fatally experience. The glare, the oſtentation of wealth, a ſoul of ſenſibility would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly reſign for privacy and plainneſs, if they were to be attended with real friendſhip and ſympathy."</p>
                     <p>"And how few," cried Fitzalan, turning his expreſſive eyes upon her face, "can know Lady Malvina without feeling friendſhip for her virtues, and ſympathy for her ſorrows." As he ſpoke, he preſſed her hand againſt his heart, and ſhe felt the knot of bibbon, he had ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her ſiſter: ſhe inſtantly withdrew her hand, and darting a haughty glance at him, "Captain Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan,"
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038416_0020_1011E155D8B8E350"/>
ſaid ſhe, "you were going, I believe, to Lady Auguſta; let me not detain you."</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan's paſſions were no longer under the dominion of reaſon; he tore the ribbon from his breaſt, and flung it into the ſea—"Going to Lady Auguſta?"—he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—"and is her lovely ſiſter then really deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Ah! Lady Malvina, I now gaze on the dear at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction that drew me to the Abbey. The feelings of a real, a hopeleſs paſſion could ill ſupport raillery or obſervation: I hid my paſſion within the receſs of my heart, and gladly allowed my viſits to be placed to the account of an object truly indifferent, that I might have opportunities of ſeeing an object I adored." Malvina bluſhed and trembled. "Fitzalan," cried ſhe, after a pauſe, "I deteſt deceit."</p>
                     <p>"I abhor it too, Lady Malvina," ſaid he; "but why ſhould I now endeavour to prove my ſincerity, when I know it ſo very immaterial? Excuſe me for what I have already uttered, and believe that though ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I am not aſpiring." He then preſented his hand to Malvina; ſhe deſcended from her ſeat, and they walked towards the Abbey. Lady Malvina's pace was ſlow; and her bluſhes, had Fitzalan looked at her, would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed more pleaſure than reſentment: ſhe ſeemed to expect a ſtill further declaration; but Fitzalan was too confuſed to ſpeak; nor indeed was it his intention again to indulge himſelf on the dangerous ſubject. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in ſilence; at the Abbey gate they ſtopt, and he wiſhed her good night. 'Shall we not ſoon ſee you at the Abbey?" exclaimed Lady Malvina in a flurried voice, which ſeemed to ſay ſhe thought his adieu rather an haſty one. "No my lovely friend," cried Fitzalan, pauſing, while he looked on her with the moſt compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned tenderneſs—"in future I ſhall chiefly confine myſelf to the fort." "Do you dread an invaſion?" aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, ſmiling, while a ſtolen glance of her eye gave a peculiar meaning to her words. "I long dreaded that," cried he, in the ſame ſtrain, "and my fears were well founded; but I muſt now muſter all my powers to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038416_0021_1011E158EC316290"/>
the enemy." He kiſſed her hand, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately retired.</p>
                     <p>Lady Malvina repaired to her chamber, in ſuch a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of pleaſure as ſhe had never before experienced She admired Fitzalan from the firſt evening ſhe beheld him; though his attentions were directed to her ſiſter, the language of his eyes to her contradicted any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, theſe attentions might have intimated; his gentleneſs and ſenſibility ſeemed congenial to her own. Hitherto ſhe had been the ſlave of tyranny and caprice; and now, for the firſt time, experienced that ſoothing tenderneſs, her wounded feelings had ſo long ſighed for. She was agitated and delighted; ſhe overlooked every obſtacle to her wiſhes, and waited impatiently a farther explanation of Fitzalan's ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>Far different were his feelings from her's: to know he was beloved, could ſcarcely yield him pleaſure, when he reflected on his hopeleſs ſituation, which forbad his availing himſelf of any advantage that knowledge might have afforded. Of an union indeed he did not dare to think, ſince its conſequences, he knew, muſt be deſtruction: for rigid and auſtere as the Earl was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, he could not flatter himſelf he would ever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſuch a ſtep; and the means of ſupporting Lady Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina, in any degree of comfort, he did not poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He determined as much as poſſible, to avoid her preſence, and regretted continually having yielded to the impulſe of his heart, and revealed his love, ſince he believed it had augmented her's.</p>
                     <p>By degrees he diſcontinued his viſits at the Abbey; but often met Lady Malvina at parties in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; caution, however, always ſealed his lips, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appearance of particularity was avoided. The time now approached for the departure of the regiment from Scotland; and Lady Malvina, inſtead of the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe ſo fondly expected, ſo ardently deſired, ſaw Fitzalan ſtudious to avoid her.</p>
                     <p>The diſappointment this conduct gave riſe to, was too much for the tender and romantic heart of Malvina to bear without ſecretly repining. Society grew irkſome; ſhe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038416_0022_1011E15B7B056BB8"/>
became more than ever attached to ſolitary rambles, which gave her opportunities of indulging her ſorrows without reſtraint: ſorrows, pride often reproached her for experiencing.</p>
                     <p>It was within a week of the change of garriſon, when Malvina repaired one evening to the rock, where Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan had diſcloſed his tenderneſs; a ſimilarity of feeling led him thither; he ſaw his danger, but he had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to retreat; he ſat down by Malvina, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed for ſome time on indifferent ſubjects: at laſt, after the pauſe of a minute, Malvina exclaimed, "you go then, Fitzalan, never, never, I ſuppoſe, to return here again." "'Tis probable I may not indeed," ſaid he. "Then we ſhall never meet again," cried ſhe, while a trickling tear ſtole down her lovely cheek, which tinged, as it was with the fluſh of agitation, looked now like a half-blown roſe moiſtened with the dews of early morning.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my lovely friend," ſaid he, "we ſhall meet again—we ſhall meet in a better place; in that heaven," continued be, ſighing, and laying his cold trembling hand upon her's, "which will recompence all our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings." "You are melancholy to-night, Fitzalan," cried Lady Malvina in a voice ſcarcely articulate.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! can you wonder at it?" exclaimed he, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by her emotion, and forgetting in a moment all his reſolutions—"Oh! can you wonder at my melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, when! know not but that this is the laſt time I ſhall ſee the only woman I ever loved—when I know, that in bidding her adieu, I reſign all the pleaſure, the happineſs of my life."</p>
                     <p>Malvina could no longer reſtrain her feelings; ſhe ſunk upon his ſhoulder, and wept. "Good heavens," cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fitzalan, almoſt trembling beheath the lovely burthen he ſupported—"What a cruel ſituation is mine! But, Malvina, I will not, cannot plunge you in deſtruction. Led by neceſſity, as well as choice to embrace the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a ſoldier, I have no income, but what is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from that profeſſion: though my own diſtreſſes I could bear with fortitude, yours would totally unman me;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038416_0023_1011E15D0B91E618"/>
nor would my honour be leſs injured than my peace, were you involved in difficulties on my account. Our ſeparation is therefore, alas, inevitable.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! no," exclaimed Malvina, "the difficulties you have mentioned, will vaniſh. My father's affections were early alienated from me; and my fate is of little conſequence to him—nay, I have reaſon to believe he will be glad of an excuſe for leaving his large poſſeſſions to Auguſta; and oh! how little ſhall I envy her thoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, if the happy deſtiny I now look forward to is mine." As ſhe ſpoke her mild eyes reſted on the face of Fitzalan, who cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ped her to his boſom in a ſudden tranſport of tenderneſs. "But though my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is partial to Auguſta," ſhe continued, "I am ſure he will not be unnatural to me; and though he may withhold affluence, he will, I am confident allow me a competence—nay, Lady Dunreath, I believe, in pleaſure at my removal from the Abbey, would, if he heſitated, in that reſpect become my interceſſor."</p>
                     <p>The energy with which Malvina ſpoke, convinced Fitzalan of the ſtrength of her affection. An extacy, never before felt, pervaded his ſoul at the idea of being ſo beloved: vainly did prudence whiſper, that Malvina might be deluding herſelf with falſe hopes; the ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of love triumphed over every conſideration and again folding the fair being he held in his arms, to his heart, he ſoftly aſked, would ſhe, at all events unite her deſtiny with his.</p>
                     <p>Lady Malvina, who firmly believed what ſhe had ſaid to him would really happen, and who deemed a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from him the greateſt misfortune which could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly befall her, bluſhed, and faultering yielded a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling conſent.</p>
                     <p>The means of accompliſhing their wiſhes now occupied their thoughts: Fitzalan's imagination was too fertile, not ſoon to ſuggeſt a ſcheme, which had a probability of ſucceſs; he reſolved to entruſt the chaplain of the regiment with the affair, and requeſt his attendance the enſuing night in the chapel of the Abbey, where Lady Malvina
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038416_0024_1011E15E98375740"/>
promiſed to meet them with her maid, on whoſe ſecrecy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he thought ſhe could rely.</p>
                     <p>It was ſettled that Fitzalan ſhould pay a viſit the next morning to the Abbey, and give Malvina a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign, if he ſucceeded with the chaplain.</p>
                     <p>The increaſing darkneſs at length reminded them of the lateneſs of the hour: Fitzalan conducted Malvina to the Abbey gate, where they ſeparated, each involved in a tumult of hopes, fears, and wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>The next morning Lady Malvina brought her work into her ſiſter's dreſſing-room; at laſt Fitzalan entered; he was attacked by Auguſta for his long abſence, which he excuſed by pleading regimental buſineſs. After tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling ſome time with her, he prevailed on her to ſit down to the harpſichord; and then glancing at Malvina he gave her the promiſed ſignal.</p>
                     <p>Her conſcious eyes were inſtantly bent to the ground; a crimſon glow was ſuddenly ſucceeded by a deadly pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; her head ſunk upon her boſom; and her agitation, muſt have excited ſuſpicions, had it been perceived; but Fitzalan purpoſely bent over her ſiſter, and thus gave her an opportunity of retiring unnoticed from the room. As ſoon as ſhe had regained a little compoſure, ſhe called her maid, and after receiving many promiſes of ſecrecy, unfolded to her the whole affair. It was long paſt midnight hour ere Malvina would attempt repairing to the chapel; when ſhe at laſt roſe for that purpoſe, ſhe trembled univerſally; a kind of horror chilled her heart; ſhe began to fear ſhe was about doing wrong, and heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but when ſhe reflected on the noble generoſity of Fitzalan, and that ſhe herſelf had precipitated him to the meaſure they were about taking, her heſitation was over; and leaning on her maid, ſhe ſtole through the winding galleries, and lightly deſcending the ſtairs, entered the long hall, which terminated in a dark arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſage, that opened into the chapel.</p>
                     <p>This was a wild and gloomy ſtructure, retaining every where veſtiges of that monkiſh ſuperſtition which had erected it; beneath it were the vaults which contained
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038416_0025_1011E162A9C2D778"/>
the anceſtors of the Earl of Dunreath, whoſe deeds and titles were enumerated on gothic monuments; their duſt covered banners waving around in ſullen dignity to the rude gale, which found admittance through the broken windows.</p>
                     <p>The light, which the maid held, produced deep ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, that heightened the ſolemnity of the place.</p>
                     <p>"They are not here." ſaid Malvina, caſting her fearful eyes around. She went to the door, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a thick wood; but here ſhe only heard the breeze ruſtling amongſt the trees; ſhe turned from it, and ſinking upon the ſteps of the altar, gave way to an agony of tears and lamentations. A low murmur reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ear; ſhe ſtarted up; the chapel door was gently puſhed open, and Fitzalan entered with the chaplain: they had been watching in the wood for the appearance of light. Malvina was ſupported to the altar, and a few minutes made her the wife of Fitzalan.</p>
                     <p>She had not courage, till within a day or two previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the regiment's departure from Scotland, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Earl with her marriage: the Counteſs already knew it, through the means of Malvina's woman, who was a creature of her own. Lady Dunreath exulted at the proſpect of Malvina's ruin; it at once gratified the malevolence of her ſoul, and the avaricious deſires ſhe had of increaſing her own daughter's fortune: ſhe had, beſides, another reaſon to rejoice at it: this was, the attachment lady Auguſta had formed for Fitzalan, which, her mother feared, would have precipitated her into a ſtep as imprudent as her ſiſter's, had ſhe not been before hand with her.</p>
                     <p>This fear the impetuous paſſions of Lady Auguſta naturally excited. She really loved Fitzalan: a degree of frantic rage poſſeſſed her at his marriage; ſhe curſed her ſiſter in the bitterneſs of her heart, and joined with lady Dunreath in working up the Earl's naturally auſtere and violent paſſion into ſuch a paroxyſm of fury and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, that he at laſt ſolemnly refuſed forgiveneſs to Malvina, and bid her never more appear in his preſence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="unknown:038416_0026_1011E16438676078"/>
She now began to tread the thorny path of life; and though her guide was tender and affectionate, nothing could allay her anguiſh for having involved him in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which his noble ſpirit could ill brook, or ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle againſt. The firſt year of their union ſhe had a ſon, who was called after her father, Oſcar Dunreath: the four years that ſucceeded his birth were paſſed in wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that baffles deſcription. At the expiration of this period their debts were ſo increaſed, Fitzalan was compelled to ſell out on half-pay. Lady Malvina now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected an addition to her family; her ſituation, ſhe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, would move her father's heart, and reſolved to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay every thing, which afforded the ſmalleſt proſpect of obtaining comfort for her huſband and his babes: therefore ſhe prevailed on him to carry her to Scotland.</p>
                     <p>They lodged at a peaſant's in the neighbourhood of the Abbey: he informed them, that the Earl's infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were increaſing; and that Lady Dunreath had juſt celebrated her daughter's marriage with the Marquis of Roſeline. This nobleman had paſſionately admired La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Malvina; an admiration the Counteſs always wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to transfer to her daughter. On the marriage of Malvina he went abroad: his paſſion was conquered ere he returned to Scotland: and he diſdained not the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made for his alliance from the Abbey. His favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite propenſities, pride and avarice, were gratified by the Earl of Dunreath's ſole heireſs.</p>
                     <p>The day after her arrival, Lady Malvina ſent little Oſcar, with the old peaſant, to the Abbey: Oſcar was a perfect cherubim.</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>The bloom of op'ning flowers, unſully'd beauty,</l>
                        <l>Softneſs and ſweeteſt innocence he wore,</l>
                        <l>And look'd like nature in the world's firſt ſpring.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>Lady Malvina gave him a letter for the Earl, in which, after pathetically deſcribing her ſituation, ſhe beſought him, to let the uplifted hands of innocence plead her cauſe. The peaſant watched, till the hour came for Lady Dunreath to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o out in her carriage, as was her daily cuſtom: he then deſired to be conducted
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038416_0027_1011E16686D98270"/>
to the Earl, and was accordingly uſhered into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; he found him alone, and briefly informed him of his errand. The Earl frowned and looked agitated, but did not by any means expreſs that diſpleaſure which the peaſant had expected: feeling for himſelf, indeed, had lately ſoftened his heart; he was unhappy; his wife and daughter had attained the completion of their wiſhes, and no longer paid him the attention his age required. He refuſed however, to accept the letter: little Oſcar, who had been gazing on him from the moment he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the apartment, now ran forward gently ſtroking his hand; he ſmiled in his face and exclaimed "ah! pray do—take poor Mamma's letter." The Earl involuntarily took it; as he read, the muſcles of his face began to work, and a tear dropt from him. "Poor mamma cries too," ſaid Oſcar, upon whoſe hand the tear fell. "Why did your mamma ſend you to me?" ſaid the Earl. "Becauſe ſhe ſaid," cried Oſcar, "that you were my grandpapa—and ſhe bids me love you, and teaches me every day to pray for you." "Heaven bleſs you my lovely pratler," exclaimed the Earl, with ſudden emotion, pattinp his head as he ſpoke. At this moment Lady Dunreath ruſhed into the apartment; one of her favourites had followed her, to relate the ſcene that was going forward within it; and ſhe returned with all poſſible expedition, to counteract any dangerous impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that might be made upon the Earl's mind. Rage inflamed her countenance; the Earl knew the violence of her temper; he was unequal to contention, and haſtily motioned for the peaſant to retire with the child. The account of his reception excited the moſt flattering hopes in the boſom of his mother; ſhe counted the tedious hours, in expectation of a kind ſummons to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; but no ſuch ſummons came. The next morning the child was ſent to it; but the porter refuſed him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, by the expreſs command of the Earl, he ſaid. Frightened at his rudeneſs, the child returned weeping to his mother, whoſe blaſted expectations wrung her heart with agony, and tears and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations broke from her. The evening was far advanced, when ſuddenly her features brightened:
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038416_0028_1011E16865162400"/>
"I will go," cried ſhe, ſtarting up—"I will again try to melt his obduracy. Oh! with what lowlineſs ſhould a child bend before an offended parent. Oh! with what fortitude, what patience, ſhould a wife, a mother, try to overcome difficulties, which ſhe is conſcious of having precipitated the objects of her tendereſt effecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into."</p>
                     <p>The night was dark and tempeſtuous: ſhe would not ſuffer Fitzalan to attend her, but ſhe proceeded to the Abbey, leaning on the peaſant's arm. She would not be repulſed at the door, but forced her way into the hall: here Lady Dunreath met her, and, with mingled pride and cruelty, refuſed her acceſs to her father, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was by his deſire ſhe did ſo. "Let me ſee him but for a moment," ſaid the lovely ſupplient, claſping her white and emaciated hands together—"by all that is tender in humanity, I beſeech you to grant my requeſt."</p>
                     <p>"Turn this frantic woman from the Abbey," ſaid the implacable Lady Dunreath trembling with paſſion—"at your peril ſuffer her to continue here. The peace of your Lord is too precious to be diſturbed by her exclamations."</p>
                     <p>The imperious order was inſtantly obeyed, though, as Cordelia ſays, "it was a night when one would not have turned an enemy's dog from the door." The rain poured down in torrents; the ſea roared with aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful violence; and the wind raged through the wood as if it would tear up the trees by the roots. The peaſant charitably flung his plaid over Malvina; ſhe moved me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically along; her ſenſes appeared quite ſtupified Fitzalan watched for her at the door; ſhe ruſhed into his extended arms, and fainted; and it was long ere ſhe ſhewed any ſymptoms of returning life. Fitzalan wept over her in the anguiſh and diſtraction of his ſoul; and ſcarcely could he forbear execrating the Being who had ſo grievouſly afflicted her gentle ſpirit: by degrees ſhe revived; and, as ſhe preſſed him feebly to her breaſt, exclaimed, "the fatal ſtroke is given—I have been turned from my father's door."</p>
                     <p>The cottage in which they lodged afforded but few of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038416_0029_1011E169F8DA3EB8"/>
the neceſſaries, and none of the comforts of life; ſuch, at leaſt, as they had been accuſtomed to. In Malvina's preſent ſituation, Fitzalan dreaded the loſs of her life, ſhould they continue in their preſent abode; but whither could he take her, wanderer as he was upon the face of the earth? At length the faithful Edwin occurred to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection: his houſe, he was confident, would afford them a comfortable aſſylum, where lady Malvina would experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence all that tenderneſs and care her ſituation demanded.</p>
                     <p>He immediately ſet about procuring a conveyance, and the following morning Malvina bid a laſt adieu to Scotland.</p>
                     <p>Lady Dunreath, in the mean time, ſuffered torture: after ſhe had ſeen Malvina turned from the Abbey, ſhe returned to her apartment; it was furniſhed with the moſt luxurious elegance, yet could ſhe not reſt within it. Conſcience already told her, if Malvina died, ſhe muſt conſider herſelf her murderer; her pale and woe-worn image ſeemed ſtill before her; a cold terror oppreſſed her heart, which the horrors of the night augmented; the tempeſt ſhook the battlements of the Abbey; and the wind, which howled through the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, ſeemed like the laſt moans of ſome wandering ſpirit of the pile, bewailing the fate of one of its faireſt daughters. To cruelty and ingratitude Lady Dunreath had added deceit: her Lord was yielding to the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his child, when ſhe counteracted his intentions b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> a tale of falſehood. The viſions of the night were alſo dreadful: Malvina appeared expiring before her; and the late Lady Dunreath, by her bed-ſide, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her barbarity. "Oh cruel!" the ghaſtly figure ſeemed to ſay, "is it you, whom I foſtered in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, that have done this deed—driven forth my child, a forlorn and wretched wanderer.</p>
                     <p>Oh conſcience, how awful are thy terrors! thou art the vicegerent of heaven, and anticipate its vengeance, ere the final hour of retribution arrives. Guilt may be triumphant, but never, never can be happy: it finds no ſhield againſt thy ſtings and arrows. The heart thou ſmiteſt, bleeds in every pore, and ſighs amidſt gaiety and ſplendor.</p>

The unfortunate travellers were welcomed with the trueſt hoſpitality by the grateful Edwin: he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ſoon after his return from America, a young girl, to whom from his earlieſt youth, he was attached. His parents died ſoon after his union, the whole of their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle patrimony devolved to him. Soothed and attended with the utmoſt tenderneſs and reſpect, Fitzalan hoped lady Malvina would here regain her health and peace: he intended, after her recovery to endeavour to be put on full pay; and truſted he ſhould prevail on herto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at the farm.</p>
                     <p>At length the hour came, in which ſhe gave a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his arms. From the beginning of her illneſs the people about her were alarmed; too ſoon was it proved, their alarms were well founded: ſhe lived after the birth of her infant but a few minutes, and died embracing her huſband, and bleſſing his children.</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan's feelings cannot well be deſcribed: they were at firſt too much for reaſon, and he continued ſome time in perfect ſtupefaction. When he regained his ſenſibility, his grief was not outrageous; it was that deep, ſtill ſorrow, which faſtens on the heart, and cannot vent itſelf in tears or lamentations: he ſat with calmneſs by the bed, where the remains of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina lay; he gazed, without ſhrinking, on her pale face which death, as if in pity to his feelings, had not disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured; he kiſſed her cold lips, continually exclaiming, "Oh! had we never met, ſhe might ſtill have been liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing." His language was ſomething like that of a poet of her own country.</p>
                     <lg>

                     <p>It was when he ſaw them about removing her that all the tempeſt of his grief broke forth. Oh! how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to deſcribe the anguiſh of the poor widower's heart when he returned from ſeeing his Malvina laid in her laſt recepticle; he ſhut himſelf up in the room where ſhe had expired, and ordered no one to approach him; he thew himſelf upon the bed; he laid his cheek upon her pillow, he graſped it to his boſom, he wetted

"Deep, ſtill, and profound." cried he "is the ſleep of my Malvina—the voice of love cannot awake her from it; nor does ſhe now dream of her midnight mourner."</p>
                     <p>The cold breeze of night brew upon his forehead; but he heeded it not; his whole ſoul was full of Malvina, whom torturing fancy repreſented to his view, in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments of the grave. "And is this emaciated form, this pale face," he exclaimed as if he had really ſeen her, "all that remains of elegance and beauty, once unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led."</p>
                     <p>A native ſenſe of religion only checked the tranſports of his grief: that ſweet, that ſacred power, which pours balm upon the wounds of ſorrow, and ſaves its children from deſpair; that Power whiſpered to his heart, a patient ſubmiſſion to the will of heaven was the ſureſt means he could attain, of again rejoining his Malvina.</p>
                     <p>She was interred in the village church-yard: at the head of her grave a ſtone was placed, on which was rudely cut,

                     </p>
                     <p>Fitzalan would not permit her empty title to be put on it; "ſhe is buried," he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

wretched ſoldier, not as the daughter of a wealthy peer."</p>
                     <p>She had requeſted her infant might be called after her own mother; her requeſt was ſacred to Fitzalan and it was baptized by the united names of Amanda Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina. Mrs. Edwin was then nurſing her firſt girl; but ſhe ſent it out, and took the infant of Fitzalan in its place to her boſom.</p>
                     <p>The money, which Fitzalan had procured by diſpoſing of his commiſſion, was now nearly exhauſted; but his mind was too enervated to allow him to think of any project for future ſupport. Lady Malvina was deceaſed two months, when a nobleman came into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, with whom Fitzalan had once been intimately acquainted: the acquaintance was now renewed; and Fitzalan's appearance, with the little hiſtory of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes ſo much affected and intereſted his friend, that without ſolicitation he procured him a company in a regiment, then ſtationed in England. Thus did Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan again enter into active life; but his ſpirits were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and his conſtitution injured. Four years he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the army; when pining to have his children, (all that now remained of a woman he adored) under his own care, he obtained, through the intereſt of a friend, leave to ſell out: Oſcar was then eight, and Amanda four; the delighted father, as he held them to his heart wept over them tears of mingled pain and pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>He had ſeen in Devonſhire, where he was quartered for ſome time, a little romantic ſolitude, quite adapted to his taſte and finances: he propoſed for it, and ſoon became its proprietor. Hither he carried his children, much againſt the inclination of the Edwins, who loved them as their own: two excellent ſchools in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood gave them the uſual advantages of genteel edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but as they were only day ſcholars the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or rather forming of their morals, was the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing taſk of their father. To his aſſiduous care too they were indebted for the rapid progreſs they made in their ſtudies; and for the graceful ſimplicity of their manners; they rewarded his care, and grew up as amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lovely as his fondeſt wiſhes could deſire. As Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038416_0033_1011E175253BC8B8"/>
advanced in life, his father began to experience new cares; for he had not the power of putting him in the way of making any proviſion for himſelf. A military life was what Oſcar appeared anxious for: he had early conceived a predilecton for it, from hearing his father ſpeak of theſe rvices he had ſeen; but though he poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quite the ſpirit of a hero, he had the trueſt tenderneſs, the moſt engaging ſoftneſs of diſpoſition; his temper was indeed at once mild, artleſs and affectionate. He was about eighteen, when the proprietor of the eſtate, on which his father held his farm, died, and his heir, a colonel in the army, immediately came down from London to take formal poſſeſſion: he ſoon became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Fitzalan, who, in the courſe of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one day, expreſſed the anxiety he ſuffered on his ſon's account. The colonel ſaid he was a fine youth, and it was a pity he was not provided for: he left Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, however, ſhortly after this, without appearing in the leaſt intereſted about him.</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan's heart was oppreſſed with anxiety; he could not purchaſe for his ſon, without depriving himſelf of ſupport. With the nobleman who had formerly ſerved him ſo eſſentially, he had kept up no intercourſe, ſince he quitted the army; but he frequently heard of him, and was told he had become quite a man of the world, which was an implication of his having loſt all feeling: an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to him, therefore, he feared would be unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he felt too proud to ſubject himſelf to a repulſe.</p>
                     <p>From this diſquietude he was unexpectedly relieved by a letter from the Earl of Cherbury, his yet kind friend, informing him, he had procured an enſigncy for Oſcar, in colonel Belgrave's regiment, which he conſidered a very fortunate circumſtance, as the colonel, he was confident, from perſonally knowing the young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, would render him every ſervice in his power. The Earl chid Fitzalan for never having kept up a correſpondence with him; aſſured him, he had never forgotten the friendſhip of their earlier years; and that he had gladly ſeized the firſt opportunity which offered,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:038416_0034_1011E17854129C60"/>
of ſerving him in the perſon of his ſon; which opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he was indebted to colonel Belgrave for.</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan's ſoul was filled with gratitude and rapture; he immediately wrote to the Earl and the colonel, in terms expreſſive of his feelings Colonel Belgrave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his thanks, as if he had really deſerved them; but this was not by any means the caſe; he was a man devoid of ſenſibility, and had never once thought of ſerving Fitzalan and his ſon; his mentioning them was merely accidental.</p>
                     <p>In a large company, of which the earl of Cherbury was one, the diſcourſe happened to turn on the Dunreath family, and by degrees led to Fitzalan, who was ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally blamed and pitied for his connexion with it; the ſubject was, in the opinion of Col. Belgrave, ſo apropos, he could not forbear deſcribing his preſent ſituation, and inquietude about his ſon, who, he ſaid he fancied, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Lord Cherbury loſt no part of this diſcourſe; though immerſed in politics and other intricate concerns, he yet retained, and was ready to obey, the dictates of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, particularly when they did not interfere with his own intereſts; he therefore directly conceived the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſerving his old friend.</p>
                     <p>Oſcar ſoon quitted Devonſhire after his appointment, and brought a letter from his father to the colonel, in which he was ſtrongly recommended to his protection, as one unſkilled in the ways of men.</p>
                     <p>And now all Fitzalan's care devolved upon Amanda; and moſt amply did ſhe recompenſe it. To the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of her genius, the cultivation of her talents, the promotion of her father's happineſs, ſeemed her firſt incentive; without him no amuſement was enjoyed, without him no ſtudy entered upon; he was her friend, guardian, and protector; and no language can expreſs, no heart (except a paternal one) conceive the rapture he felt, at ſeeing a creature grow under
<q>
                           <l>—his forming hand</l>
                           <l>—So fair,</l>

                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:038416_0035_1011E179DFF80D30"/>
That what ſeemed fair in all the world, ſeem'd now Mean, or in her contained.</p>
                     <p>Some years had elapſed ſince Oſcar's departure, ere Col. Belgrave returned into their neighbourhood; he came ſoon after his nuptials had been celebrated in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with a lady of that country, whom Oſcar's letters deſcribed as poſſeſſing every perſonal and mental charm, which could pleaſe or captivate the heart. Col. Belgrave came unaccompanied by his fair bride. Fitzalan, who believed him his benefactor, and conſequently regarded him as a friend, (ſtill thinking it was through his means Lord Cherbury had ſerved him) immediately waited upon him, and invited him to his houſe. The invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after ſome time was accepted; but had he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined what an attraction the houſe contained, he would not have long heſitated about entering it: he was a man, indeed, of the moſt depraved principles, and an object he admired, no tie, or ſituation, however ſacred, could guard from his purſuit.</p>
                     <p>Amanda was too much a child, when he was laſt in the country, to attract his obſervation; he had therefore no idea that the bloſſom he then ſo careleſsly overlooked, had ſince expanded into ſuch beauty.</p>
                     <p>How great was then his rapture and ſurpriſe, when Fitzalan led into the room where he had received him, a tall, elegantly formed girl, whoſe roſy cheeks were dimpled with the ſofteſt ſmile of complacence, and whoſe fine blue eyes beamed with modeſty and gratitude upon him: he inſtantly marked her for his prey, and bleſſed his lucky ſtars, which had inſpired Fitzalan with the idea of his being his benefactor; ſince that would give him a freer acceſs to the houſe than he could other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have hoped for.</p>
                     <p>From this time he became almoſt an intimate at it, except when he choſe to contrive little parties at his own, for Amanda: he took every opportunity that offered, without obſervation, to try to ingratiate himſelf into her favour; thoſe opportunities the unſuſpecting temper of Fitzalan allowed to be frequent; he would as ſoon
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:038416_0036_1011E17B98A7C868"/>
have truſted Amanda to the care of Belgrave, as to that of her brother, and never therefore, prevented her walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with him, when he deſired it, or receiving him in the morning, while he (himſelf) was abſent about the affairs of his farm; delighted to think the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation or talents of his daughter (for Amanda frequently ſung and played for the Colonel) could contribute to the amuſement of his friend. Amanda innocently increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his flame, by the attention ſhe paid, which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered but a juſt tribute of gratitude for his ſervices: ſhe delighted in talking to him of her dear Oſcar; and often mentioned his lady, but was ſurpriſed to find he always waved the latter ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Belgrave could not long reſtrain the impetuoſity of his paſſions; the ſituation of Fitzalan, (which he knew to be a diſtreſſed one) would, he fancied, forward his deſigns on his daughter; and what thoſe deſigns were, he, by degrees, in a retired walk one day, unfolded to Amanda.</p>
                     <p>At firſt ſhe did not perfectly underſtand him; but when, with increaſe audacity, he explained himſelf more fully, horror, indignation, and ſurpriſe took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of her breaſt, and yielding to their feelings, ſhe turned, and fled to the houſe, as if from a monſter. Belgrave was provoked and mortified: the ſoftneſs of her manners had tempted him to believe, he was not indifferent to her, and that ſhe would prove an eaſy conqueſt.</p>
                     <p>Poor Amanda would not appear in the preſence of her father, till ſhe had in ſome degree regained com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, as ſhe feared the ſmalleſt intimation of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair might occaſion fatal conſequences; as ſhe ſat with him, a letter was brought her; ſhe could not think B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

How great was the ſhock ſhe ſuſtained, on finding it from him; having thrown off the maſk, he determined no longer to aſſume any diſguiſe. Her pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confuſion alarmed her father, and he inſtantly
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:038416_0037_1011E17EC0510248"/>
demanded the cauſe of her agitation: ſhe found longer concealment was impoſſible, and throwing herſelf at her father's feet, beſought him, as ſhe put the letter into his hands to reſtrain his paſſion. When he peruſed it, he raiſed her up, and commanded her, as ſhe valued his love or happineſs, to inform him of every particular, relative to the inſult ſhe had received; ſhe obeyed, though terrified to behold her father trembling with emotion. When ſhe concluded, he tenderly embraced her, and bidding her confine herſelf to the houſe, roſe, and took down his hat; it was eaſy to gueſs whither he was going; her terror increaſed; and in a voice ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly articulate, ſhe beſought him not to riſk his ſafety. He commanded her ſilence with a ſternneſs never before aſſumed: his manner awed her, but when ſhe ſaw him leaving the room, her feelings could no longer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled; ſhe ruſhed after him, and flinging her arms round his neck, fainted on it. In this ſituation the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py father was compelled to leave her to the care of a maid, leſt her pathetic remonſtrances ſhould delay the vengeance he reſolved to take on a wretch, who had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated a deed of ſuch atrocity againſt his peace; but Belgrave was not to be found. Scarcely, however, had Fitzalan returned to his half-diſtracted daughter, ere a letter was brought him from the wretch, in which he made the moſt degrading propoſals, and bid Fitzalan beware how he anſwered them, as his ſituation had put him entirely into his power.</p>
                     <p>This was a fatal truth; Fitzalan had been tempted to make a large addition to his farm, from an idea of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little money he poſſeſſed, to advantage, but was more ignorant of agriculture than he imagined; and this ignorance, joined to his own integrity of heart, rendered him the dupe of ſome deſigning wretches in his neighbourhood: his whole ſtock dwindled away in unprofitable experiments, and he was now conſiderably in arrears with Belgrave.</p>

Belgrave ſoon found no temptation of proſperity would prevail on the father or daughter to accede to his wiſhes; he therefore reſolved to try whether the preſſure of adverſity would render them more complying, and left the country, having firſt ordered his ſteward to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed directly againſt Fitzalan.</p>
                     <p>The conſequence of his order was an immediate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution on his effects; and, but for the aſſiſtance of a good-natured farmer, he would have been arreſted. By his means, and under favour of night, he and Amanda ſet out for London; they arrived there in ſafety, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to obſcure lodgings. In this hour of diſtreſs, Fitzalan conquered all falſe pride, and wrote to Lord Cherbury, entreating him to procure ſome employment, which would relieve his preſent diſtreſſing ſituation; he cautiouſly concealed every thing relative to Belgrave; he could not bear that it ſhould be known he had ever been degraded by his infamous propoſals.</p>
                     <p>Oſcar's ſafety, too, he knew, depended on his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy; as he was well convinced, no idea of danger, or elevation of rank, would ſecure the wretch from his fury, who had meditated ſo great an injury againſt his ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>He had the mortification of having the letter he ſent to Lord Cherbury returned, as his Lordſhip was then abſent from town; nor was he expected for ſome months, having gone on an excurſion of pleaſure to France. Some of theſe months had lingered away in all the horrors of anxiety and diſtreſs, when Fitzalan form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſolution of ſending Amanda into Wales, whoſe health had conſiderably ſuffered from the complicated uneaſineſs and terror ſhe experienced on her own and her father's account.</p>
                     <p>Belgrave had traced the fugatives; and though Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan was guarded againſt all the ſtratagems he uſed to have him arreſted, he found means to have letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to Amanda, full of baſe ſolicitations, and inſolent declarations; that the rigor he treated her father with, was quite againſt his feelings, and ſhould inſtantly be
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:038416_0039_1011E18370AF0340"/>
withdrawn, if he acceded to the prepoſals he made for her.</p>
                     <p>But though Fitzalan had determined to ſend Amanda into Wales with whom could he truſt his heart's beſt treaſure? At laſt the ſon of the worthy farmer, who had aſſiſted him in his journey to London, occurred to his remembrance: he came often to town, and always called upon Fitzalan. The young man, the moment it was propoſed, expreſſed the greateſt readineſs to attend Miſs Fitzalan. As every precaution was neceſſary, her father made her take the name of Dunford, and travel in the mail coach for the greater ſecurity. He divided the contents of his purſe with her; and recommending this lovely and moſt beloved child to the protection of heaven, ſaw her part with mingled pain and pleaſure, promiſing to give her the earlieſt intelligence of Lord Cherbury's arrival in town, which he ſuppoſed would fix his future deſtiny. Previous to his departure he wrote to the Edwins, informing them of her intended viſit, and alſo her change of name for the preſent. This latter circumſtance, which was not ſatisfactorily account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, excited their warmeſt curioſity; and not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it proper to aſk Amanda to gratify it, they, to uſe their own words, ſifted her companion, who heſitated not to inform of the indignities ſhe had ſuffered from Colonel Belgrave, which were well known about his neighbourhood.</p>

                     <p>A GENTLE noiſe in her chamber rouſed Amanda from a light refreſhing ſlumber, and ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her nurſe ſtanding by her bed-ſide, with a bowl of goat's whey; Amanda took the ſalubrious draught with a ſmile, and inſtantly ſtarting up, was dreſſed in a few minutes. She felt more compoſed than ſhe had done for ſome time paſt; the tranſition from a narrow dark ſtreet to a fine open country, would have excited a lively tranſport in her mind, but for the idea of her father ſtill remaining in the gloomy ſituation ſhe had quitted.</p>
                     <p>On going out ſhe found the family all buſily employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Edwin and his ſons were mowing in a meadow near the houſe, the nurſe was churning; Ellen waſhing milk pails by the ſtream in the valley; and Betſey turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cake for her breakfaſt.</p>
                     <p>The tea-table was laid by a window, through which a woodbine crept, diffuſing a delightful fragrance: the bees feaſted on its ſweetneſs, and the gaudy butterflies fluttered around it; the refulgent ſun gladdened the face of nature; the morning breeze tempered its heat, and bore upon its dewy wings the ſweets of opening flowers; birds carolled their matins almoſt on every ſpray; and ſcattered peaſants, buſied in their various labours, enlivened the extenſive proſpect.</p>
                     <p>Amanda was delighted with all ſhe ſaw, and wrote to her father, that his preſence was only wanting to complete her pleaſure. The young man who had attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, on receiving her letter, ſet out for the village
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:038416_0041_1011E189706BE790"/>
from whence he was to return in a ſtage coach to London.</p>
                     <p>The morning was paſſed by Amanda in arranging her little affairs, walking about the cottage, and convers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the nurſe relative to paſt times and preſent avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. When the hour for dinner came, by her deſire it was carried out into the receſs in the garden, where the balmy air, the lovely ſcene which ſurrounded her, rendered it doubly delicious.</p>
                     <p>In the evening ſhe aſked Ellen to take a walk with her, to which ſhe joyfully conſented. "And pray, Miſs," ſaid Ellen, after ſhe had ſmartened herſelf with a clean white apron, her Sunday cap, and a hat loaded with pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-coloured ribbons, ſmiling as ſhe ſpoke at the pretty image her glaſs reflected, "where ſhall we go?"</p>
                     <p>"To the church-yard," replied Amanda. "Oh Lord, Miſs," cried Ellen, "won't that be rather a diſmal place to go to?" Indulge me, my dear Ellen," ſaid Amanda, "in ſhewing me the way thither: there is one ſpot in it, my heart wants to viſit." Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard lay at the entrace of the little village; the church was a ſmall ſtructure, whoſe gothic appearance proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its ancient date; it was rendered more venerable by the lofty elms and yews which ſurrounded it, apparently coeval with itſelf, and which caſt dark ſhades upon the ſpots, where the rude "forefather of the hamlet ſlept," which
<q>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it was a tribute Amanda paid, as ſhe proceeded to the grave of Lady Malvina, which Ellen pointed out: it was over-grown with graſs and the flag, which bore her name, green, from time and damp. Amanda in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily ſunk on her knees, and kiſſed the hallowed earth: her eyes caught the melancholy inſcription, "Sweet ſpirit," ſhe ſaid, "Heaven now rewards your ſufferings. Oh, my mother! if departed ſpirits are ever allowed to review this world, with love ineffable you may now be regarding your child. Oh! if ſhe is doomed to tread as thorny a path as the one you trod,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:038416_0042_1011E18BDA325068"/>
may the ſame ſweetneſs and patience that diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, ſupport her through it: with the ſame pious awe, the ſame meek ſubmiſſion, may ſhe bow to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of her Creator.</p>
                     <p>The affecting cataſtrophe drew tears from the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Ellen, who beſought her not to continue longer in ſuch a diſmal place. Amanda now roſe weeping; her ſpirits were entirely overcome; the buſy objects of the day had amuſed her mind and prevented it from meditating on its ſorrows; but in the calm ſolitude of the evening they gradually revived in her remembrance. Her father's ill health, ſhe feared, would increaſe for want of her tender attentions; and when ſhe thought of his diſtreſs, his confinement, his dejection, ſhe felt an agony at their ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>Her melancholy was noticed at the cottage. Ellen informed the nurſe of the diſmal walk they had taken, which at once accounted for it; and the good woman exerted herſelf to enliven her dear child; but Amanda, though ſhe faintly ſmiled, was not to be cheered, and ſoon retired to bed—pale, languid, and unhappy.</p>
                     <p>Returning light, in ſome degree, diſpelled her melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; ſhe felt, however, for the firſt time, that her hours would hang heavy on her hands, deprived as ſhe was of thoſe delightful reſources, which had hitherto diverſified them. To paſs her time in liſtleſs inaction, or idle ſaunters about the houſe, was inſupportable; and beſides ſhe found her preſence in the morning was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on her humble friends, who did not deem it good manners to work before her; and to them, who like bees, were obliged to lay up their wintry hoard in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the loſs of time was irreparable.</p>
                     <p>In the diſtraction of her father's affairs ſhe had loſt her books, implements for drawing and muſical inſtruments; and in the cottage ſhe could only find a bible, family prayer book, and a torn volume of old ballads.</p>

age of Mathuſalem himſelf, and very pretty reading to be ſure amongſt them, or our Parſon Howel would not have been going there as often as he did, to ſtudy, till he got a library of his own. The family are all away; and as the door is opened every fine day to air the room, you will not be noticed by nopoty going into it; though for that matter poor old Mrs Abergwilly would make you welcome enough, if you promiſed to take none of the books away with you. But as I know you to be a little baſhful or ſo, I will if you chooſe, ſtep over, and aſk her leave for you to go."—"If you pleaſe," ſaid Amanda; "I ſhould not like to go without it."—"Well, I ſhan't be long," continued the nurſe, "and Ellen ſhall ſhow you the way to-day; it will be a pretty pit of a walk for you to take every morning." The nurſe was as good as her word; ſhe returned ſoon, with Mrs. Abergwilly's permiſſion for Amanda to read in the library whenever ſhe pleaſed. In conſequence of this ſhe immediately proceeded to the Hall, whoſe white turrets were ſeen from the cottage: it was a large and antique building, emboſomed in a grove; the library was on the ground floor, and entered by a ſpacious folding door. As ſoon as ſhe had reached it, Ellen left her, and returned to the cottage; and Amanda began with pleaſure to examine the apartment, whoſe elegance and ſimplicity ſtruck her with immediate admiration.</p>
                     <p>On one ſide was a row of large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, arched quite in the Gothic ſtyle; oppoſite to them were correſponding arches, in whoſe receſſes the book-caſes were placed; round theſe arches were feſtoons of laurel, elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in ſtucco work and above them medalions of ſome of the moſt celebrated poets; the chimney-piece, of the fineſt Italian marble, was beautifully inlaid and ornamented; the paintings on the ceiling were highly finiſhed, and of the allegorical kind; and it was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to determine, whether the taſte that deſigned, or the hand that executed them, merited moſt praiſe; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on marble pedeſtals ſtood a celeſtial and terreſtrial globe, and one receſs was entirely hung with maps. It was a room, from its ſituation and appearance, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:038416_0044_1011E18F4830A630"/>
adapted for ſtudy and contemplation, all around was ſolitude and ſilence, ſave the ſoft ruſtling of the trees, whoſe dark foliage caſt a ſolemn ſhade upon the windows. Oppoſite the entrance was another folding door, which being a little opened, Amanda could not reſiſt the deſire ſhe felt, of ſeeing what was beyond it; ſhe entered a large vaulted apartment, whoſe airy light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs formed a pleaſing contraſt to the gloomy one ſhe had left: the manner in which it was fitted up, and the muſical inſtruments, declared this to be a muſic-room. It was hung with pale green damaſk, ſpotted with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and bordered with feſtoons of roſes, intermingled with light ſilver ſprays; the ſeats correſponded to the hangings; the tables were of fine inlaid wood; and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb luſtres were ſuſpended from the ceiling, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, in a maſterly ſtyle, ſcenes from ſome of the paſtoral poets; the orcheſtra, about the centre of the room, was incloſed with a light balluſtrading of white marble elevated by a few ſteps.</p>
                     <p>The windows of this room commanding a pleaſant proſpect of a deep romantic dale; the hills, through which it wound, diſplaying a beautiful diverſity of woody ſcenery, interſperſed with green paſtures and barren points of rocks: a fine fall of water fell from one of the higheſt of the hills, which, broken by intervening roots and branches of trees, run a hundred different ways, ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the ſun beams as they emerged from the ſhade.</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſtood long at a window, enjoying this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful proſpect, and admiring the taſte which had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen this room for amuſement; thus at once gratifying the eye and ear. On looking over the inſtruments, ſhe ſaw a piano forte unlocked; ſhe gently raiſed the lid, and touching the keys, found them in tolerable order. Amanda adored muſic; her genius for it was great, had received every advantage her father could poſſibly give it: in cultivating it he had laid up a fund of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light for himſelf, for "his ſoul was a ſtream, that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at pleaſant ſounds."</p>
                     <p>Amanda could not reſiſt the preſent opportunity of gratifying her favourite inclination. "Harmony and I,"
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:038416_0045_1011E19191E2A4D0"/>
cried ſhe, "have long been ſtrangers to each other." She ſat down, and played a little tender air: thoſe her father loved recurred to recollection, and ſhe played a few of them with even more than uſual elegance. "Ah dear and valued object," ſhe mournfully ſighed, "why are you not here to ſhare my pleaſure?" ſhe wiped away a ſtarting tear of tender remembrance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a little ſimple air.</p>

                     <p>AMANDA went every morning to the Hall, where ſhe alternately played and read; in the evening ſhe again returned to it; but, inſtead of ſtaying in the library, generally took a book from thence, and read at the foot of ſome old moſs-covered tree, delighted to hear its branches gently ruſtling over head, and myriads of ſummer flies buzzing in the ſunny ray, from which ſhe was ſheltered. When ſhe could no longer ſee to read, ſhe depoſited her book in the place ſhe had taken it from, and rambled to the deepeſt receſſes of the grove: this was the time ſhe loved to ſaunter careleſsly along, while all the jarring paſſions that obtruding care excited, were huſhed to peace by the ſolemnity and ſilence of the hour, and the ſoul felt at once compoſed and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:

this was the time ſhe loved to think on days de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and ſketch thoſe ſcenes of felicity, which, ſhe truſted, the days to come would realize.

                     <p>She returned one evening from her uſual ramble with one of thoſe unaccountable depreſſions on her ſpirits to which to a greater or leſſer degree, almoſt every one is ſubject. When ſhe retired to bed, her ſleeping thoughts took the tincture of her waking ones, and images of the moſt affecting nature aroſe in her mind: ſhe went through the whole ſtory of her mother's ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſuddenly dreamt ſhe beheld her expiring under the greateſt torture; and that while ſhe wept her fate, the clouds opened, and diſcovered her adorned with ſeraphic beauty, bending with a benignant look towards her child, as if to aſſure her of her preſent happineſs. From this dream Amanda was rouſed, by the ſofteſt, ſweeteſt ſtrains of muſic ſhe had ever heard: ſhe ſtarted with amazement; ſhe opened her eyes, and ſaw a light around her, far exceeding that of twilight. Her dream had made a deep impreſſion on her, and a ſolemn awe diffuſed itſelf over her mind; ſhe trembled univerſally; but ſoon did the emotion of awe give way to that of ſurprize, when ſhe heard on the outſide of the window the following lines from cowley, ſung in a manly and

exquiſitely melodious voice, the muſic which woke her being only a ſymphony to them.</p>

                     <p>Ere the voice ceaſed, Amanda had quite ſhaken off the effects of her dream; and when all again was ſilent, ſhe drew back the curtain, and ſaw it was the moon, then at the full, which, beaming through the calico win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow curtains, caſt ſuch a light around her. The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the night was paſſed in ruminating on this ſtrange
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:038416_0049_1011E19BD7363ED8"/>
incident: it was evident the ſerenade was addreſſed to her; but ſhe had not ſeen any one ſince her arrival in the neighbourhood, from whom ſhe could have expected ſuch a compliment, or, indeed, believed capable of paying it; that the perſon who paid it, was one of no mean accompliſhments, from his performance ſhe could not doubt. She reſolved to conceal the incident, but to make ſuch inquiries the next morning, as might poſſibly lead to a diſcovery. From the anſwers thoſe inquiries received, the clergyman was the only perſon, whom with any degree of probability, ſhe could fix on: ſhe had never ſeen him and was at a loſs to conceive how he knew any thing of her, till it occurred he might have ſeen her going to Tudor Hall, or rambling about it.</p>
                     <p>From the moment this idea aroſe, Amanda deemed it imprudent to go to the Hall; yet, ſo great was the pleaſure ſhe experienced there, ſhe could not think of relinquiſhing it without the greateſt reluctance. She at laſt conſidered, if ſhe had a companion, it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move any appearance of impropriety; Ellen was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally employed at knitting; Amanda therefore ſaw, that going to the Hall could not interfere with her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and accordingly aſked her attendance thither, which the other joyfully agreed to.</p>
                     <p>"While you look over the books," ſaid Ellen, as they entered the library, "I will juſt ſtep away about a little buſineſs." "I beg you may not be long abſent," cried Amanda. Ellen aſſured her ſhe would not, and flew off directly. She had in truth ſeen, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure near the Hall, Tim Chip the carpenter, at work, who was the rural Adonis of theſe ſhades: he had long ſelected Ellen for the fair nymph of his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which diſtinction excited not a little jealouſy among the village girls, and conſiderably increaſed the vanity of Ellen, who triumphed in a conqueſt that at once gratified her love, and exalted her above her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
                     <p>Amanda entered the muſic room; the melodious ſtrain ſhe had heard the preceding night, dwelt upon her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and ſhe ſat down to the piano, and attempted them; her ear ſoon informed her the attempt was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful;
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:038416_0050_1011E19F27A206D0"/>
and her voice (as the words were familiar to her) then accompanied the inſtrument. "Heavenly ſounds!" exclaimed ſome one behind her, as ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded ſinging. Amanda ſtarted in terror and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the chair, and beheld a tall and elegant young man ſtanding by it. "Good heaven!" cried ſhe, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and haſtily moving to the door, ſcarcely knowing what ſhe ſaid, "where can Ellen be?" "And do you think," ſaid the ſtranger, ſpringing forward, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting her paſſage, "I ſhall let you eſcape in this manner? No, really, my charming girl, I ſhould be the moſt inſenſible of beings, if I did not avail myſelf of the happy opportunity chance afforded, of entreating leave to be introduced to you." As he ſpoke, he gently ſeized her hand, and carried it to his lips. "Be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Sir," ſaid Amanda, "the chance, as you call it, which brought us together, is to me moſt unpleaſant, as I fear it has expoſed me to greater freedom than I have been accuſtomed to."</p>
                     <p>"And is it poſſible," ſaid he, "you really feel an emotion of anger? Well, I will relinquiſh my lovely captive, if ſhe condeſcendingly promiſes to continue here a few minutes longer, and grants me permiſſion to attend her home."</p>
                     <p>"I inſiſt on being immediately releaſed," exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Amanda. "I obey," cried he, ſoftly preſſing her hand, and then reſigning it—"yon are free, would to heaven I could ſay the ſame."</p>
                     <p>Amanda hurried to the grove; but in her confuſion took a wrong path, and vainly caſt her eyes around in ſearch of Ellen. The ſtranger followed, and his eyes wandered with her's in every direction they took. "And why," cried he, "ſo unpropitious to my wiſh of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction? A wiſh, it was impoſſible not to feel from the moment you were ſeen." Amanda made no reply, but ſtill hurried on; and her fatigue and agitation were ſoon too much for her preſent weak ſtate of health; and quite overpowered, ſhe was at laſt compelled to ſtop, and lean againſt a tree for ſupport. Exerciſe had diffuſed its ſofteſt bloom over her cheek; her hair
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:038416_0051_1011E1A0B5BCAB08"/>
fluttered in the breeze that played around her; and her eyes, with the beautiful embarraſſment of modeſty, were bent to the ground, to avoid the ſtranger's ardent gaze: he watched her with looks of the moſt impaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed admiration, and ſoftly exclaimed, as if the involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary exclamation of rapture, "good heavens, what an angel!"</p>
                     <p>Fatigue has made you ill," he ſaid, "and 'tis your haſte to avoid me, has occaſioned this diſorder. Could you look into my heart, you would then find there was no reaſon to fly from me: the emotions that lovely face excites in a ſoul of ſenſibility, could never be inimical to your ſafety."</p>
                     <p>At this moment Amanda perceived Ellen leaping over a ſtile, ſhe had at laſt left Mr. Chip, after promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to meet him in the evening at the cottage, where the blind harper was to attend to give them a dance. She ran forward: but, on ſeeing the ſtranger, ſtarted back in the utmoſt amazement. "Bleſs me," ſaid Amanda, "I thought you would never come."</p>
                     <p>"You go then," ſaid the ſtranger, "and give me no hope of a ſecond interview. Oh ſay, taking her hand, "will you not allow me to wait upon you?" "It is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible," replied Amanda, "and I ſhall be quite diſtreſſed, if longer detained."</p>
                     <p>"See then," ſaid he, opening a gate which led from the grove into the road, "how like a courteous knight I releaſe you from painful captivity. But think not, thou beautiful though cruel fair one," he continued gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "I ſhall reſign my hopes of yet conquering thy obduracy."</p>
                     <p>"Oh Lord!" cried Ellen, as they quitted the grove, "how did you meet Lord Mortimer?" "Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?" repeated Amanda. "Yes, himſelf, indeed," ſaid Ellen, "and I think in all my por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Amanda's ſpirits were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flurried, when ſhe heard he was the maſter of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:038416_0052_1011E1A374D544C0"/>
the manſion, where he had found her ſeated with as much compoſure as if poſſeſſor of it.</p>
                     <p>As they were entering the cottage, Ellen, twitching Amanda's ſleeve, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ried, "look, look." Amanda has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily turning round, perceived Lord Mortimer, who had ſlowly followed them half way down the lane; on being obſerved, he ſmiled and kiſſing his hand, retired.</p>
                     <p>Nurſe was quite delighted at her child being ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Amanda's heart fluttered with an agreeable ſenſation, as Ellen deſcribed to her mother the tender looks with which Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer regarded her. She was at firſt inclined to believe that in his lordſhip ſhe had found the perſon, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody ſo agreeably diſturbed her ſlumbers; but a minute's reflection convinced her this belief muſt be erroneous: it was evident (or ſhe would have heard of it) that Lord Mortimer had only arrived that day at Tudor-Hall; and even had he ſeen her before, upon conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe thought it improbable, that he ſhould have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the trouble of coming in ſuch a manner to a perſon in a ſtation, to all appearance, ſo infinitely beneath his own. Yes, it was plain, chance alone had led him to the apartment where ſhe ſat; and the common place gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry faſhionable men are accuſtomed to, had dictated the language <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Well, ſhe was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, if ever he came in her way, and dropt a hint of an attachment, ſhe would immediately cruſh any hopes he might have the vanity to entertain.</p>

                     <p>AFTER tea Amanda aſked little Betſey to accompany her in a walk: for Ellen, (dreſt in all her rural finery) had gone early in the evening to the dance. But Amanda did not begin her walk with her uſual ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity: her bonnet was ſo heavy, and then it made her look ſo ill, that ſhe could not go out till ſhe had made ſome alterations in it; ſtill it would not do; a hat was tried on; ſhe liked it better, and at laſt ſet out; but not as uſual did ſhe pauſe, whenever a new or lovely feature in the landſcape ſtruck her view, to expreſs her admiration: ſhe was often indeed ſo abſorbed in thought as to ſtart when Betſey addreſſed her, which was often the caſe; for little Betſey delighted to have Miſs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda trace figures for her in the clouds, and aſſiſt her in gathering wild flowers. Scarcely knowing which way they went, Amanda rambled to the village; and feeling herſelf fatigued, turned into the church-yard to reſt upon one of the raiſed flags.</p>
                     <p>The graves were ornamented with garlands of cut pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, interwoven with flowers; tributes of love from the village maids to the memory of their departed friends.</p>
                     <p>As Amanda reſted herſelf, ſhe twined a garland of the wild flowers ſhe had gathered with Betſey, and hung it over the grave of Lady Malvina: her fine eyes raiſed to heaven, as if invoking at the moment the ſpirit of her mother, to regard the vernal offering of her child; while her white hands were folded on her heart, and ſhe ſoftly exclaimed, "Alas, is this the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tribute left for me to pay!"</p>

                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:038416_0054_1011E1A8E753DF00"/>
A low murmur, as if from voices near, ſtartled her at the inſtant; ſhe turned with quickneſs and ſaw Lord Mortimer with a young clergyman, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>alf hid by ſome trees, attentively obſerving her. Bluſhing and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhe drew her hat over her face, and catching Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey's hand, haſtened to the cottage.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer had wandered about the ſkirts of the cottage, in hopes of meeting her in the evening: on ſeeing the direction ſhe had taken from it, he followed her: and juſt as ſhe entered the church-yard, unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly met the curate. His company, at a moment ſo propitious for joining Amanda, he could well have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with: for he was more anxious than he choſe to acknowledge to himſelf, to become acquainted with her.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was now in the glowing prime of life: his perſon was ſtrikingly elegant, and his manners inſinuatingly pleaſing; ſeducing ſweetneſs dwelt in his ſmile, and, as he pleaſed, his expreſſive eyes could ſparkle with intelligence, or beam with ſenſibility; and to the eloquence of his language, the harmony of his voice imparted a charm, that ſeldom failed of being irreſiſtible; his ſoul was naturally the ſeat of every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but an elevated rank, and ſplendid fortune, had placed him in a ſituation ſomewhat inimical to their intereſts, for he had not always ſtrength to reſiſt the ſtrong temptations which ſurrounded him; but though he ſometimes wandered from the boundaries of virtue he had never yet entered upon the confines of vice, never really injured innocence, or done a deed which could wound the boſom of a friend; his heart was alive to every noble propenſity of nature; compaſſion was one of its ſtrongeſt feelings, and never did his hand refuſe obedience to the generous impulſe. Among the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous accompliſhments he poſſeſſed, was an exquiſite taſte for muſic, which, with every other talent, had been cultivated to the higheſt degree of poſſible perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; his ſpending many years abroad had given him every requiſite advantage for improving it. The ſoft, melodious voice of Amanda would of itſelf almoſt have
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:038416_0055_1011E1AA78772F58"/>
made a conqueſt of his heart; but aided by the charms of her face and perſon altogether were irreſiſtible.</p>
                     <p>He had come into Wales, on purpoſe to pay a viſit to an old friend in the Iſle of Angleſey: he did not mean to ſtop at Tudor-Hall; but within a few miles of it the phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in which he travelled, (from the fineneſs of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) was overturned, and he ſeverely hurt. He procured a hired carriage, and proceeded to the Hall, to put himſelf into the hands of the good old houſekeeper, Mrs. Aberg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willy; who, poſſeſſing as great a ſtock of medical knowledge as Lady Bountiful herſelf, he believed would cure his bruiſes with as much, or rather more expedition, than any country ſurgeon whatever. He gave ſtrict or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that his being at the Hall ſhould not be mentioned, as he did not chuſe the few days he hoped and believed he ſhould continue there, to be diſturbed by viſits, which he knew would be paid, if an intimation of his being there was received. From an apartment adjoining the muſic room he had diſcovered Amanda; though ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to move, at the firſt ſound of her voice he ſtole to the door, which being a little open, gave him an opportunity of ſeeing her perfectly; and nothing but his ſituation prevented his immediately appearing before her, and expreſſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he admiration ſhe had inſpired him with. As ſoon as ſhe departed, he ſent for the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, to inquire who the beautiful ſtranger was. Mrs. Abergwilly only knew ſhe was a young lady lately come from London to lodge at David Edwin's cottage, whoſe wife had intreated permiſſion for her to read in the libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which ſhe added, ſhe had given, ſeeing that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip read in the dreſſing-room; but, if he pleaſed, ſhe would ſend Miſs Dunford word not to come again. "By no means," his Lordſhip ſaid. Amanda therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her viſits as uſual, little thinking with what cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical regard and fond admiration ſhe was obſerved. Lord Mortimer daily grew better; but the purpoſe for which he had come into Wales, ſeemed utterly forgotten; he had a tincture of romance in his diſpoſition and availed himſelf of his recovery to gratify it, by taking a lute, and ſerenading his lovely cottage girl. He could no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:038416_0056_1011E1AD1300F5B0"/>
reſtrain his impatience to be known to her: and the next day ſtealing from his retirement, ſurpriſed her as already related.</p>
                     <p>As he could not, without an utter violation of good manners, ſhake off Howell, he contented himſelf with following Amanda into the church-yard, where, ſhaded by the trees, he and his companion ſtood watching her unnoticed, till an involuntary exclamation of rapture from his Lordſhip diſcovered their ſituation. When ſhe departed, he read the inſcription on the tomb-ſtone; but, from the difference of names, this gave no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into any connexion between her and the perſon it mentioned: Howell could give no information of either; he was but a young man, lately appointed to the parſonage, and had never ſeen Amanda till that evening.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer, was ſolicitous even to a degree of anxiety, to learn the real ſituation of Amanda: as Howell in his paſtoral function, had free acceſs to the houſes of his pariſhioners, it occurred to him, that he would be an excellent perſon, to diſcover it; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as if from curioſity alone, expreſſed his wiſh of knowing who ſhe was, and requeſted Howell, if conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, to follow her directly to Edwin's cottage, (where, he ſaid, by chance, he heard ſhe lodged) and endeavor to find out from the good people every thing about her. This requeſt Howell readily complied with; the face, the figure, the melancholy, and above all the employment of Amanda, had intereſted his ſenſibility, and excited his curioſity.</p>
                     <p>He arrived ſoon after her at the cottage, and found her laughing at her nurſe, who was telling her, ſhe was certain ſhe ſhould ſee her a great laty. Amanda roſe to retire at his entrance; but he perceiving her intention, declared, if he diſturbed her, he would immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: ſhe accordingly re-ſeated herſelf, ſecretly pleaſed at doing ſo, as ſhe thought, either from ſome look or word of the curate's, ſhe might diſcover if he really was the perſon who had ſerenaded her; from this idea ſhe ſhewed no averſeneſs to enter into converſation with him.</p>
                     <p>

The whole family, nurſe excepted, had followed Ellen to the dance; and that good woman thought ſhe could do no leſs for the honor of Howell's viſit, than prepare a little comfortable ſupper for him. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of his diſpoſition, and innocent gaiety of his temper, had rendered him a great favorite amongſt his ruſtic neighbours, whom he frequently amuſed with ſimple ballads and pleaſant tales. Amanda and he were left tete-a-tete, while the nurſe was buſied in preparing her entertainment; and ſhe was ſoon as much pleaſed with the elegance and ſimplicity of his manners, as he was with the innocence and ſweetneſs of her's. The objects about them naturally led to rural ſubjects, and from them to what might almoſt be termed a diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on poetry: this was a theme peculiarly agreeable to Howell, who wooed the penſive muſe beneath the ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van ſhade; nor was it leſs ſo to Amanda; ſhe was a zealous worſhipper of the Muſes, though diffidence made her conceal her invocations to them. She was led to point out the beauties of her favorite authors; and the ſoft ſenſibility of her voice raiſed a kind of tender enthuſiaſm in Howell's ſoul: he gazed and liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, as if his eye could never be ſatisfied with ſeeing, or his ear with hearing. At his particular requeſt, Amanda recited the pathetic deſcription of the curate and his lovely daughter, from the Deſerted village; a tear ſtole down her cheek as ſhe proceeded. Howell ſoftly laid his hand on her's, and exclaimed, "Good heavens, what an angel!"</p>
                     <p>"Come, come," ſaid Amanda, ſmiling at the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy with which he ſpoke, "you, at leaſt, ſhould have nothing to do with flattery."</p>
                     <p>"Flattery!" repeated he emphatically, "Oh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, did you but know my ſincerity—"</p>
                     <p>"Well, well," cried ſhe, wiſhing to change the ſubject, "utter no expreſſion in future, which ſhall make me doubt it."</p>
                     <p>"To flatter you," ſaid he, "would be impoſſible; ſince the higheſt eulogium muſt be inadequate to your merits."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:038416_0058_1011E1B2ACD41300"/>
"Again!" ſaid Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Believe me," he replied, "flattery is a meanneſs I abhor; the expreſſions you denominate as ſuch, proceed from emotions, I ſhould contemn myſelf for want of ſenſibility, if I did not experience—"</p>
                     <p>The nurſe's duck and green peas were now ſet upon the table, but in vain did ſhe preſs Howell to eat; his eyes were too well feaſted, to allow him to attend to his palate. Finding her entreaties ineffectual in one reſpect, ſhe tried them in another, and begged he would ſing a favourite old ballad; this he at firſt heſitated to do, till Amanda, (from a ſecret motive of her own) joined in the entreaty; and the moment ſhe heard his voice, ſhe was convinced he was not the perſon who had been at the outſide of the window. After his complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to her, ſhe could not refuſe him one ſong: the melodious ſounds ſunk into his heart; he ſeemed faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to the ſpot, nor thought of moving, till the nurſe gave him a hint for that purpoſe, being afraid of Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's ſitting up too late.</p>
                     <p>He ſighed as he entered his humble dwelling; it was perhaps the firſt ſigh he had ever heaved for the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his fortune. "Yet," cried he, caſting his eyes around, "in this abode, low and humble as it is, a ſoul like Amanda's might enjoy felicity.</p>
                     <p>The purpoſe for which Lord Mortimer ſent him to the cottage, and Lord Mortimer himſelf, were forgotten. His Lordſhip had engaged Howell to ſup with him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the performance of his embaſſy, and impatiently waited his arrival: he felt diſpleaſed, as the hours wore away without bringing him; and unable at laſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the impetuoſity of his feelings, proceeded to the parſonage, which he entered a few minutes after Howell. He aſked, with no great complacency, the reaſon he had not fulfilled his engagement. Abſorbed in one idea, Howell felt confuſed, agitated, and unable to frame any excuſe; he therefore ſimply ſaid, what in reality was true, that he had utterly forgotten it.</p>
                     <p>"I ſuppoſe then," exclaimed Lord Mortimer in a ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:038416_0059_1011E1B43AE247A0"/>
voice, "you have been very agreeably entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."</p>
                     <p>"Delightfully," ſaid Howell.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer grew more diſpleaſed; but his anger was now levelled againſt himſelf as well as Howell. He repented and regretted the folly which had thrown Howell in the way of ſuch temptation, and had perhaps raiſed a rival to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"Well," cried he, after a few haſty paces about the room, "and pray, what do you know about Miſs Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford?"</p>
                     <p>"About her?" repeated Howell, as if ſtarting from a reverie—"why—nothing."</p>
                     <p>"Nothing!" re-echoed his Lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Howell, "except that ſhe is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was now thoroughly convinced, all was over with the poor parſon; and reſolved in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this conviction, to loſe no time himſelf. He could not depart, without inquiring how the evening had been ſpent, and envied Howell the happy minutes he ſo eloquently deſcribed.</p>

                     <p>WHILE Amanda was at breakfaſt the next morning, Betſey brought a letter to her; expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear from her father, ſhe eagerly opened it, and to her great ſurpriſe peruſed the following lines:</p>

"From Lord Mortimer!" ſaid Amanda, with invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary emotion. "Well, this really has aſtoniſhed me."</p>
                     <p>"Oh lort, my tear!" cried the nurſe in a rapture.</p>
                     <p>Amanda waved her hand to ſilence her, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſtood in the outſide room. She called Betſey: "tell the ſervant," ſaid ſhe,—</p>
                     <p>"Lort," cried the nurſe ſoftly, and twitching her ſleeve, "write his Lortſhip a little pit of a note, juſt to let him ſee what a pretty ſcribe you are."</p>
                     <p>Amanda could not refrain ſmiling; but diſengaging herſelf from the good woman, ſhe aroſe and going to the ſervant, deſired him to tell his Lord ſhe thanked him for his polite attention; but that in future it would not be in her power to go to the library. When ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the room, the nurſe bitterly lamented her not writing. "Great matters," ſhe ſaid '"had often ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from ſmall beginnings." She could not conceive why his Lortſhip ſhould be treated in ſuch a manner: it was not the way ſhe had ever ſerved her Edwin. Lort, ſhe remembered, if ſhe got but the ſcrawl of a pen from him, ſhe uſed to ſit up to anſwer it. Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da tried to perſuade her it was neither neceſſary or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for her to write. An hour paſſed in arguments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, when two ſervants came from Tudor Hall to the cottage, with a ſmall book-caſe, which they ſent in to Amanda, and their Lord's compliments, that in a few minutes he would have the honor of paying his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to her.</p>
                     <p>Amanda felt agitated by this meſſage; but it was the agitation of involuntary pleaſure. Her room was always perfectly neat, yet did the nurſe and her two daughters now buſy themſelves with trying, if poſſible, to put it into nicer order: the garden was ranſacked for the choiceſt flowers to ornament it; nor would they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, till they ſaw Lord Mortimer approaching. Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, who had opened the book-caſe, then ſnatched up a book, to avoid the appearance of ſitting in expectation of his coming.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="unknown:038416_0062_1011E1BC12D3A038"/>
He entered with an air at once eaſy and reſpectful, and taking her hand beſought forgiveneſs for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion the preceding day. Amanda bluſhed, and faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered out ſomething of the confuſion ſhe had experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from being ſo ſurpriſed: he re-ſeated her, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a chair cloſe to her's, ſaid he had taken the liberty of ſending her a few books to amuſe her, till ſhe again condeſcended to viſit the library, which he entreated her to do; promiſing that, if ſhe pleaſed, both it and the muſic-room ſhould be ſacred to her alone. She thanked him for his politeneſs; but declared ſhe muſt be ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſed from going. Lord Mortimer regarded her with a degree of tender admiration; an admiration heightened by the contraſt he drew in his mind between her and the generality of faſhionable women he had ſeen, whom he often ſecretly cenſured for ſacrificing too largely at the ſhrine of art and faſhion. The pale and varied bluſh which mantled the cheek of Amanda, at once announced itſelf to be an involuntary ſuffuſion; and her dreſs was only remarkable for its ſimplicity: ſhe wore a plain robe of dimity, and an abbey cap of thin muſlin, that ſhaded without concealing her face, and gave to it the ſoft expreſſion of a Madona; her beautiful hair fell in long ringlets down her back, and curled upon her forehead.</p>
                     <p>"Good Heaven!" cried Lord Mortimer, "how has your idea dwelt upon my mind ſince laſt night: if in the morning I was charmed, in the evening I was enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. Your looks, your attitude, were then beyond all that imagination could conceive of lovelineſs and grace: you appeared as a being of another world, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a kindred ſpirit. I felt</p>
                     <p>Awe-ſtruck, and as I paſſed, I worſhipped."</p>
                     <p>Confuſed by the energy of his words, and the ardent glances he directed towards her, Amanda, ſcarcely knowing what ſhe did, turned over the leaves of the book ſhe ſtill held in her hand: in doing ſo, ſhe ſaw written on the title-page, the Earl of Cherbury "Cherbury!" repeated ſhe, in aſtoniſhment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="unknown:038416_0063_1011E1BD9F9E3148"/>
"Do you know him?" aſked Lord Mortimer.</p>
                     <p>"Not perſonally; but I revere, I eſteem him: he is one of the beſt, the trueſt friends, my father ever had."</p>
                     <p>"Oh how happy," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, "would his ſon be, were he capable of inſpiring you with ſuch ſentiments as you avow for him."</p>
                     <p>"His ſon!" repeated Amanda, in a tone of ſurpriſe, and looking at Lord Mortimer.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied he. "Is it then poſſible," he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, "that you are really ignorant of his being my father!"</p>
                     <p>Surpriſe kept her ſilent a few minutes; for her father had never given her any account of the earl's family, till about the period he thought of applying to him; and her mind was ſo diſtracted at that time on his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that ſhe ſcarcely underſtood a word he uttered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the country ſhe had never heard Lord Cherbury mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for Tudor-Hall belonged not to him, but to Lord Mortimer, to whom an uncle had bequeathed it.</p>
                     <p>"I thought, indeed, my Lord," ſaid Amanda, as ſoon as ſhe recovered her voice, "that your Lordſhip's title was familiar to me: though why, from the hurry and perplexity in which peculiar circumſtances involved me I could not tell."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, ſuffer," cried Lord Mortimer, with one of his moſt inſinuating ſmiles, "the friendſhip our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents feel to be continued to their children—let this," taking her ſoft hand, and preſſing his lips to it, "be the pledge of amity between us." He now inquired, when the intimacy between her father and his had commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and where the former was; but from thoſe inquiries Amanda ſhrunk. She reflected that without her father's permiſſion ſhe had no right to anſwer them; and that, in a ſituation like his and her's, too much caution could not be obſerved. Beſides both pride and delicacy made her ſolicitous at preſent to conceal her father's real ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Lord Mortimer; ſhe could not bear to think it ſhould be known, his ſole dependence was on Lord Cherbury, uncertain, as it was, whether that nobleman would ever anſwer his expectations. She repented having
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:038416_0064_1011E1C032F2E090"/>
ever dropped a hint of the intimacy ſubſiſting between them, which ſurpriſe alone had made her do; and tried to wave the ſubject. In this deſign Lord Mortimer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted her; for he had too much penetration, not inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to perceive it confuſed and diſtreſſed her. He requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed permiſſion to renew his viſit; but Amanda, though well inclined to grant his requeſt, yielded to prudence inſtead of inclination, and begged he would excuſe her; the ſeeming diſparity, (ſhe could not help ſaying) in their ſituations would render it very imprudent in her to receive ſuch viſits; ſhe bluſhed, half-ſighed, and bent her eyes to the ground, as ſhe ſpoke. Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer continued to entreat, but ſhe was ſteady in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; he would not depart however, till he had obtained permiſſion to attend her in the evening to a part of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Grove, which ſhe had never yet ſeen, and he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed as particularly beautiful. He wanted to call for her at the appointed hour, but ſhe would not ſuffer this; and he was compelled to be contented with leave to meet her near the cottage, when it came.</p>
                     <p>With a beating heart ſhe kept her appointment, and found his lordſhip not many yards diſtant from the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, impatiently waiting her approach. A brighter bloom than uſual glowed upon her cheek, as ſhe liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his ardent expreſſions of admiration; yet not to ſuch expreſſions, which would ſoon have ſated an ear of delicacy like Amanda's, did Lord Mortimer confine himſelf; he converſed on various ſubjects; and the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his languge, the livelineſs of his imagination, and the juſtneſs of his remarks, equally amuſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted his fair companion. There was indeed, in the diſpoſition and manners of Lord Mortimer, that happy mixture of animation and ſoftneſs, which at once amus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the fancy and attracts the heart; and never had Amanda experienced ſuch minutes as ſhe now paſſed with him; ſo delightful in their progreſs, ſo rapid in their courſe. On entering the walk he had mentioned to her, ſhe ſaw he had not exaggerated its beauties: after paſſing through many long and ſhaded alleys, they
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:038416_0065_1011E1C353E648B8"/>
came to a ſmooth green lawn, about which the trees roſe in the form of an amphitheatre, and their dark, lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant, and chequered ſhades proclaimed, that amongſt them
<q>
                           <l>The rude ax, with heaved ſtroke,</l>
                           <l>Was never heard, the nymphs to daunt,</l>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The lawn gently ſloped to a winding ſtream, ſo clear as perfectly to reflect the beautiful ſcenery of heaven, now glowing with the gold and purple of the ſetting ſun, from the oppoſite bank of the ſtream roſe a ſtupendous mountain, diverſified with little verdant hills and dales, and ſkirted with a wild ſhrubbery, whoſe bloſſoms per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed the air with the moſt balmy fragrance. Lord Mortimer prevailed on Amanda to ſit down upon a ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic bench beneath the ſpreading branches of an oak, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreathed with ivy; here they had not ſat long, ere the ſilence which reigned around, was ſuddenly interrupted by ſtrains, at once low, ſolemn, and melodious, that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to creep along the water, till they had reached the place where they ſat; and then, as if a Naiad of the ſtream had left her ruſhy couch to do them homage, they ſwelled by degrees into full melody, which the mountain echoes alternately revived and heightened. It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like enchantment to Amanda, and her eyes, turned to Lord Mortimer, ſeemed to ſay, it was to his magic it was owing After enjoying her ſurpriſe ſome minutes he acknowledged the muſic proceeded from two ſervants of his, who played on the clarinet and French horn, and were ſtationed in a dell of the oppoſite mountain. Notwithſtanding all her former thoughts to the contrary, Amanda now conceived a ſtrong ſuſpicion, that Lord Mortimer was really the perſon who had ſerenaded her: that ſhe conceived pleaſure from the idea, is ſcarcely neceſſary to ſay; ſhe had reaſon ſoon to find, ſhe was not miſtaken. Lord Mortimer ſolicited her for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's ſong in Comus, ſaying the preſent ſituation was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly adapted to it: on her heſitating, he told her ſhe
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:038416_0066_1011E1C5C9CBCC18"/>
had no plea to offer for not complying, as he himſelf had heard her enchanting powers in it. Amanda ſtarted, and eagerly enquired when or by what means. It was too late for his Lordſhip to recede; and he not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his concealment near the muſic-room, but his viſit to her window. A ſoft confuſion, intermingled with pleaſure, pervaded the ſoul of Amanda at this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and it was ſome time ere ſhe was ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to comply with Lord Mortimer's ſolicitations for her to ſing: ſhe at laſt allowed him to lead her to the centre of a little ruſtic bridge thrown over the ſtream, from whence her voice could be ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed for the muſic to keep time to it, as Lord Mortimer had directed. Her plaintive and harmonious invocation, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the low breathing of the clarinet, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like the ſofteſt echo of the mountain, had the fineſt effect immaginable, and "took the impriſon'd ſoul, and wrapt it in Elyſium."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer, for the firſt time in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Duſky twilight now warned her to return home; but Lord Mortimer would not ſuffer her to depart, till ſhe had partaken of this collation.</p>
                     <p>He was not by any means ſatisfied with the idea of only beholding her for an hour or two of an evening; and when they came near the cottage, deſired to know whether it was to chance alone he was in future to be indebted for ſeeing her. Again he entreated permiſſion to viſit her ſometimes in the morning, promiſing he would never diſturb her avocations, but would be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied merely to ſit and read to her, whenever ſhe choſe to work, and felt herſelf inclined for that amuſement: Amanda's refuſals grew fainter, and at laſt ſhe ſaid, on the above-mentioned conditions, he might ſometimes come. That he availed himſelf of this permiſſion is ſcarcely neceſſary to ſay; and from this time few hours paſſed without their ſeeing each other.</p>

The cold reſerve of Amanda by degrees wore away; from her knowledge of his family, ſhe conſidered him as more than a new or common acquaintance. The emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe felt for him, ſhe thought ſanctioned by that knowledge, and the gratitude ſhe felt for Lord Cherbury for his former conduct to her father, which claimed, ſhe thought, her reſpect and eſteem for ſo near and valuable a connexion of his; the worth, ſhe could not help acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging to herſelf, of Lord Mortimer, would, of itſelf alone, have authorized them. Her heart felt he was one of the moſt amiable, the moſt pleaſing of men: ſhe could ſcarcely diſguiſe, in any degree, the lively pleaſure ſhe experienced in his ſociety; nay, ſhe ſcarcely thought it neceſſary to diſguiſe it, for it reſulted as much from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence as ſenſibility, and was placed to the account of friendſhip. But Lord Mortimer was too penetrating, not ſoon to perceive he might aſcribe it to a ſofter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe; with the moſt delicate attention, the moſt tender regard, he daily, nay hourly, inſinuated himſelf into her heart, and ſecured for himſelf an intereſt in it, ere ſhe was aware, which the efforts of ſubſequent reſolution could not overcome. He was the companion of her rambles, the alleviator of her griefs, the care which ſo often ſaddened her brow, always vaniſhed at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and in converſing with him ſhe forgot every cauſe of ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>He once or twice delicately hinted at thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which at his firſt viſit ſhe had mentioned, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſtreſſing to bewilder her recollection: Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, with bluſhes, always ſhrunk from the ſubject, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening at the idea of his knowing, that her father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on his for future ſupport. If he ever addreſſed her ſeriouſly on the ſubject of the regard he profeſſed for her, (which, from his attentions, ſhe could not help ſometimes flattering herſelf would be the caſe) then indeed there would be no longer room for concealment; but except ſuch a circumſtance took place, ſhe could not bring herſelf to make any humiliating diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>Tudor Grove was the favorite ſcene of their rambles: ſometimes ſhe allowed him to lead her to the muſic-room;
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:038416_0068_1011E1C9E837F1B8"/>
but as theſe viſits were not frequent, a lute was brought from it to the cottage, and in the receſs in the garden ſhe often ſung and played for the enraptured Mortimer; there too he frequently read for her, always ſelecting ſome elegant and pathetic piece of poetry, to which the harmony of his voice gave additional charms; a voice which ſunk into the heart of Amanda, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted her ſenſibility even more than the ſubject he peruſed.</p>

                     <p>Seated ſometimes on the brow of a ſhrubby hill, as they viewed the ſcattered hamlets beneath, he would expatiate on the pleaſure he conceived there muſt be, in paſſing a tranquil life with one lovely, and beloved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: his inſidious eyes, turned towards Amanda, at theſe minutes, ſeemed to ſay, ſhe was the being who could realize all the ideas he entertained of ſuch a life; and when he aſked her opinion of his ſentiments, her diſordered bluſhes, and faultering accents, too plainly betrayed her conſcious feelings. Every delicacy which Tudor Hall contained, was daily ſent to the cottage, notwithſtanding Amanda's prohibition to the contrary; and ſometimes Lord Mortimer was permitted to dine with her in the receſs. Three weeks ſpent in this fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, endeared and attached them to each other more than months would have done, paſſed in ſituations liable to interruption.</p>

                        </gap> hours rolled away at the cottage; he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered round it, and ſeized every interval of Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer's abſence, to preſent himſelf before Amanda; his emotions betrayed his feelings, and Amanda affected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve towards him, in hopes of ſuppreſſing his paſſion; a paſſion, ſhe <hi>now</hi> began to think, when hopeleſs, muſt be dreadful.</p>
                     <p>Howell was a prey to melancholy; but not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone did he mourn: fears for the ſafety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Amanda added to his dejection; he dreaded that Lord Mortimer perhaps, like too many of the faſhionable men, might make no ſcruple of availing himſelf of any advantage which could be derived from a predilection in his favor.</p>
                     <p>He knew him, 'tis true, to be amiable; but in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to that, he knew him to be volatile, and ſometimes wild, and he trembled for the unſuſpecting credulity of Amanda. "Though loſt to me," exclaimed the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py young man, "oh never, ſweeteſt Amanda, mayeſt thou be loſt to thyſelf."</p>
                     <p>He had received many proofs of eſteem and friendſhip from Lord Mortimer; he therefore ſtudied, how he
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:038416_0070_1011E1CF5261BFE0"/>
might admoniſh without offending, and ſave Amanda without injuring herſelf. It at laſt occurred that the pulpit would be the ſureſt way of effecting his wiſhes, where the ſubject addreſſed to all, might particularly ſtrike the one for whom it was intended, with out appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as if deſigned for that purpoſe; and timely convince him, if, indeed, he meditated any injurious deſign againſt Amanda of its flagrance.</p>
                     <p>On the following Sunday, as he expected, Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer and Amanda attended ſervice; his Lordſhip's pew was oppoſite the one ſhe ſat in, and we fear his eyes too often wandered in that direction.</p>
                     <p>The youthful monitor at laſt aſcended the pulpit: his text was from Jeremiah, and to the following effect:</p>
                     <p>"She weepeth ſore in the night, and her tears <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>After a ſlight introduction in which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> that the declenſion of moral principles demanded ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation as he was about giving, he commenced his ſubject: he deſcribed a youg female, adorned with beauty and innocence, walking forward in the path of integrity, which a virtuous education had early marked for her to take, and rejoicing, as ſhe went, with all around her; when, in the midſt of her happineſs, unexpected calamity ſuddenly ſurpriſed, and precipitated her from proſperity into the deepeſt diſtreſs; he deſcribed the benefits ſhe derived in this trying period, from early implanted virtue and religion; taught by them, (he proceeded) the lovely mourner turns not to the world for conſolation—no, ſhe looks up to her Creator for comfort, whoſe ſupporting aid is ſo particularly promiſed to afflicted worth. Cheered by them, ſhe is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert the little talents of genius and taſte, and draw upon induſtry for her future ſupport: her active virtue, ſhe thinks the beſt proof of ſubmiſſion ſhe can give to the will of Heaven: and in theſe laudable exertions ſhe finds a conſcious peace, which the mere poſſeſſion of fortune never could beſtow. While thus employed, a

ſon of perfidy ſees and marks her for his prey, becauſe ſhe is at once lovely and helpleſs; her unſuſpecting cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity lays her open to his arts, and his blandiſhments by degrees allure her heart. The ſnare which he has ſpread at laſt involves her; with the inconſtancy of libertiniſm he ſoon deſerts her; and again is ſhe plunged into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. But mark the difference of her firſt and ſecond fall: conſcience no longer lends its oppoſing aid to ſtem her ſorrow; deſpair inſtead of hope, ariſes; without one friend to ſoothe the pangs of death, onepitying ſoul to whisper peace to her departing ſpirit; inſulted too, perhaps, by ſome unfeeling being, whom want of ſimilar temptations alone, perhaps ſaved from ſimilar impruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; ſhe ſinks an early victim to wretchedneſs. Howell pauſed; the fulneſs of his heart mounted to his eyes, which involuntarily turned and reſted upon Amanda: intereſted by his ſimple and pathetic eloquence, ſhe had riſen, and leaned over the pew, her head reſting on her hand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> her eyes faſtened on his face. Lord Mortimer had alſo riſen, and alternately gazed upon Howell and Amanda, particularly watching the latter to ſee how the ſubject would affect her. He at laſt ſaw the tears trickling down her cheeks; the diſtreſſes of her own ſituation, and the ſtratagems of Belgrave, made her, in ſome reſpects, perceive a reſemblance between herſelf and the picture Howell had drawn.—Lord Mortimer was unutterably affected by her tears, a faint ſickiſhneſs ſeized him, he ſunk upon his ſeat, and covered his face with his handkerchief, to hide his emotion; but by the time ſervice was over, it was pretty well diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ipated: Amanda returned home, and Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer waited for Howell's coming out of church. "What the devil Howell," ſaid he, "did you mean by giving us ſuch an exhortation? Have you diſcovered any little affair going on between ſome of your ruſtic neighbours?" The parſon coloured, but remained ſilent; Lord Mortimer rallied him a little more, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; but his gaiety was only aſſumed.</p>
                     <p>On his firſt acquaintance with Amanda, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of what he heard from Mrs. Abergwilly, and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:038416_0072_1011E1D33197C918"/>
obſerved himſelf, he had been tempted to think ſhe was involved in myſtery; and what but impropriety, he thought, could occaſion myſtery. To ſee ſo young, ſo lovely, ſo elegant a creature, an inmate of a ſequeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cottage, aſſociating with people (in manners at leaſt) ſo infinitely beneath her; to ſee her trembling and bluſhing, if a word was dropt that ſeemed tending to enquire into her motives for retirement; all theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, I ſay, conſidered, naturally excited a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion injurious to her, in the mind of Lord Mortimer; and he was tempted to think ſome deviation from pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had, by depriving her of the favor of her friends, made her retire to obſcurity; and that ſhe would not diſlike an opportunity of emerging from it, he could not help thinking. In conſequence of theſe ideas, he could not think himſelf very culpable in encouraging the wiſhes her lovelineſs gave riſe to: beſides he had ſome reaſon to ſuſpect ſhe deſired to inſpire him with theſe wiſhes; for Mrs. Abergwilly told him ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Mrs. Edwin of his arrival; an information he could not doubt her having immediately communicated to Amanda; therefore, her continuing to come to the Hall ſeemed as if ſhe wiſhed to throw herſelf in his way. Mrs. Edwin had indeed been told of his arrival, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it from Amanda, that ſhe ſhould not be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of going to the Hall, which ſhe knew if once informed of it, ſhe would not go to.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, Lord Mortimer ſaw Amanda wore, at leaſt, the ſemblance of innocence; but this could not remove his ſuſpicions, ſo often had he ſeen it aſſumed, to hide the artful ſtratagems of a depraved heart.</p>
                     <p>Ah! why will the lovely female, adorned with all that heaven and earth can beſtow to render her amiable, o'erleap the modeſty of nature, and by levity and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs looſe all pretenſions to the eſteem which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be her involuntary tribute.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it herſelf alone ſhe injures; ſhe hurts each child of purity, helps to point the ſting of ridicule, and weave the web of art.</p>
                     <p>

We ſhun the blazing ſun, but court his tempered beams; the roſe which glares upon the day is never ſo much ſought as the bud enwrapt in the foliage; and to uſe the expreſſion of a late much admired author, "the retiring graces have ever been reckoned the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful."</p>
                     <p>He had never heard the Earl mention a perſon of the name of Dunford: and he knew not, or rather ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, little credit was to be given to her aſſertion of an intimacy between them, particularly as he ſaw her, whenever the ſubject was mentioned, ſhrinking from it in the greateſt confuſion.</p>
                     <p>Her reſerve he imputed to pretence; and flattering himſelf it would ſoon wear off, determined for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at leaſt, to humor her affectation.</p>
                     <p>With ſuch ideas, ſuch ſentiments, had Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's firſt viſits to Amanda commenced: but they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced an immediate change, as the decreaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of her manners gave him greater and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent opportunities of diſcovering her mental perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the ſtrength of her underſtanding, the juſtneſs of her remarks, the livelineſs of her fancy, above all, the purity which mingled in every ſentiment, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty which accompanied every word, filled him with delight and amazement: his doubts gradually leſſened, and at laſt vaniſhed, and with them every deſign, which they alone had ever given riſe to. Eſteem was now united to love, and real reſpect to admiration: in her ſociety he only was happy, and thought not, or rather would not ſuffer himſelf to think, on the conſequence of ſuch an attachment. It might be ſaid he was entranced in pleaſure, from which Howell completely rouſed him, and made him ſeriouſly aſk his heart, what were its intentions relative to Amanda. Of ſuch views as he perceived Howell ſuſpected him of harbouring, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience entirely acquitted him; yet ſo great were the obſtacles he knew in the way of an union between him and Amanda, that he almoſt regretted (as every one does who acts againſt their better judgment) that he had not fled at the firſt intimation of his danger. So
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:038416_0074_1011E1D89FACF2A0"/>
truly formidable indeed did theſe obſtacles appear, that he at times reſolved to break with Amanda, if he could fix upon any plan for doing ſo, without injuring his honor, after the great attention he had paid her.</p>
                     <p>Ere he came to any final determination, however, he reſolved to try and diſcover her real ſituation: if he even left her, it would be a ſatisfaction to his heart to know whether his friendſhip could be ſerviceable: and if an oppoſite meaſure was his plan, it could never be put in execution, without the deſired information. He accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly wrote his ſiſter, Lady Araminta Dormer, who was then in the country with Lord Cherbury, to requeſt ſhe would inquire from his father, whether he knew a perſon of the name of Dunford; and if he did, what his ſituation and family were. Lord Mortimer begged her Ladyſhip not to mention the inquiries being dictated by him, and promiſed at ſome future period to explain the reaſon of them. He ſtill continued his aſſiduities to Amanda, and at the expected time received an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his letter; but how was he ſhocked and alarmed, when informed, Lord Cherbury never knew a perſon of the name of Dunford. His doubts began to revive; but before he yielded entirely to them, he reſolved to go to Amanda, and inquire from her, in the moſt explicit terms, how, and at what time, her father and the Earl had become acquainted: determined, if ſhe anſwered him without embarraſſment, to mention to his ſiſter whatever circumſtances ſhe related, leſt a forgetfulneſs of them had alone made the Earl deny his knowledge of Dunford. Juſt as he was paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing the Grove with this intent, he eſpied Edwin and his wife coming down a croſs-road from the village, where they had been with poultry and vegetables: it inſtantly occurred to him, that theſe people, in the ſimplicity of their hearts, might unfold the real ſituation of Amanda, and ſave him the painful neceſſity of making enquiries, which ſhe perhaps would not anſwer, without his real motives for making them aſſigned, which was what he could not think of doing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="unknown:038416_0075_1011E1DB6BE1AC50"/>
Inſtead, therefore, of proceeding, he ſtopt till they came up to him, and then with the moſt engaging affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility addreſſed them, inquiring whether they had been ſucceſsful in the diſpoſal of their goods; they anſwered bowing and curtſeying; and he then inſiſted that, as they appeared tired, they ſhould repair to the Hall, and reſt themſelves. This was too great an honor to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; and they followed their noble conductor, who haſtened forward, to order refreſhment into a parlour for them. The nurſe, who in her own way was a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning woman, inſtantly ſuſpected, from the great and uncommon attention of Lord Mortimer, that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inquire into the ſituation of Amanda. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw him at ſome diſtance, "David," cried ſhe, "as ſure as eggs are eggs, (unpinning her white apron, and ſmoothing it nicely down as ſhe ſpoke) this young Lort wants to have our company, that he may find out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing apout Miſs Amanda. Ah! pleſs her pretty face, I thought how it would be; but we muſt be as cunning as foxes, and not tell too much or too little; becauſe if we told too much, it would offend her, and ſhe would aſk us how we got all our intelligence, and would not think us over and apove genteel, when ſhe heard we had ſifted Jemmy Hawthorn for it, when he came down from London with her. All we muſt do is juſt to drop ſome hints, as it were, of her ſituation, and then his Lortſhip, to be ſure, will make his advantage of them, and aſk her every thing apout herſelf, and then ſhe will tell him of her own accord: ſo, David, mind what you ſay, I charge you." "Ay, ay," cried David, "leave me alone; I'll warrant you'll always find an old ſoldier cute enough for any poty." When they reached the Hall, they were ſhewn into a parlour, where Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer was expecting them; with difficulty he made them ſit down at the table, where meat and wine were laid out for them: after they had partaken of them, Lord Mortimer began with aſking Edwin ſome queſtions about his farm, (for he was a tenant on the Tudor eſtate) and whether there was any thing wanting to render it more comfortable. No, Edwin replied with a low bow,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:038416_0076_1011E1DFEA988E68"/>
thanking his honourable Lordſhip for his enquiry. Lord Mortimer ſpoke of his family. "Ay Cot pleſs the poor things," Edwin ſaid, "they were to be ſure a fine thriving ſet of chil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ren." Still Lord Mortimer had not touched on the ſubject neareſt his heart; he felt embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed and agitated: at laſt, with as much compoſure as he could aſſume, he aſked, how long they imagined Miſs. Dunford would ſtay with them. Now was the nurſe's time to ſpeak: ſhe had hitherto ſat ſimpering and bowing. "That depended on circumſtances," ſhe ſaid. "Poor tear young laty, though their little cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was ſo obſcure, and ſo unlike any thing ſhe had before been accuſtomed to, ſhe made herſelf quite hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with it." "Her father muſt miſs her ſociety very much," exclaimed Lord Mortimer. "Tear heart, to be ſure he does," cried nurſe. "Well, ſtrange things happen every tay; but ſtill I never thought what did happen would have happened, to make the poor old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and his daughter part." "What happened?" exclaimed lord Mortimer, ſtarting, and ſuddenly ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the middle of the room; for hitherto he had been walking backwards and forwards. 'Twas not her buſineſs, the nurſe replied, by no manner of means, to be ſpeaking apout the affairs of her petters; put for all that ſhe could not help ſaying, becauſe ſhe thought it a pity his Lortſhip, who was ſo good and ſo affable, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in ignorance of every thing; that Miſs Amanda was not what ſhe appeared to be; no if the truth was told, not the perſon ſhe paſſed for at all; "but lort, ſhe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgive me," cried the nurſe, "if your Lordſhip told her, it was from me your Lortſhip heard this. Poor tear thing ſhe is very unwilling to have her ſituation known, though ſhe is not the firſt poty who has met with a pad man; and ſhame and ſorrow be upon him, who tiſtreſt herſelf and her father.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer had heard enough; every doubt, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuſpicion was realized; and he was equally unable and unwilling to enquire further. It was plain Amanda was unworthy of his eſteem; and to enquire into the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:038416_0077_1011E1E262D3CD50"/>
which occaſioned that unworthineſs, would only have tortured him. He rung the bell abruptly, and ordering Mrs. Abergwilly to attend the Edwins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew immediately to another room. Now was there an opportunity for Lord Mortimer to break with Amanda, without the ſmalleſt imputation on his honour. Did it give him pleaſure? No: it filled him with ſorrow, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and anguiſh; the ſoftneſs of her manners, even more than the beauty of her perſon, had faſcinated his ſoul, and made him determine, if he found her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, (of which indeed he had then but little doubt) to ceaſe not, till every obſtacle which could impede their union ſhould be overcome. He was inſpired with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at the idea of the ſnare he imagined ſhe had laid for him; thinking her modeſty all a pretext for drawing him into making honourable propoſals. As ſhe ſunk in his eſteem, her charms leſſened in his fancy; and he thought it would be a proper puniſhment for her, and a noble triumph over himſelf, if he conquered, or at leaſt reſiſted his paſſion, and forſook her entirely. Full of this idea, and influenced by reſentment for her ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed deceit, he reſolved without longer delay, to fulfil the purpoſe which brought him into Wales, namely, viſiting his friend; but how frail is reſolution and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when oppoſed by tenderneſs: without ſuffering himſelf to believe there was the leaſt abatement of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his mind, he forbid the carriage, in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after he had ordered it, merely, he perſuaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the purpoſe of yet more ſeverely mortifying A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda; as his continuing a little longer in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, without noticing her, might, perhaps, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her, ſhe was not quite ſo faſcinating as ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved herſelf to be. From the time his reſidence at Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor-Hall was known, he had received conſtant invitations from the ſurrounding families, (which on Amanda's account) he uniformly declined; this he reſolved ſhould no longer be the caſe: ſome were yet unanſwered, and theſe he meant to accept, as means indeed of keeping him ſteady in his reſolution of not ſeeing her, and baniſhing her, in ſome degree, from his thoughts.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038416_0078_1011E1E3F2F06BA8"/>
But he could not have fixed on a worſe method than theſe, for affecting either of his purpoſes: the ſociety he now mixed among, was ſo different from that he had lately been accuſtomed to, that he was continually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in drawing compariſons between them; he grew reſtleſs; his unhappineſs increaſed: and he at laſt felt, that if he deſired to experience any comfort, he muſt no longer abſent himſelf from Amanda; and alſo that, if ſhe refuſed to accede to the only propoſals now in his power to make her, he would be miſerable; ſo eſſential did he deem her ſociety to his happineſs; ſo much was he attached from the ſoftneſs and ſweetneſs of her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. At the time he finally determined to ſee her again, he was in a large party at a Welch Baronet's, where he had dined; and on the rack of impatience to put his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination in practice, he retired early, and took the road to the cottage.</p>
                     <p>Poor Amanda, during this time, was a prey to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet: The firſt day of Lord Mortimer's abſence, ſhe felt a little uneaſineſs, but ſtrove to diſſipate it, by thinking buſineſs had detained him. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe remained entirely at home, every moment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to behold him; but this expectation was totally deſtroyed, when from the outſide room ſhe heard one of the nurſe's ſons tell of all the company he met going to Sir Lewis ap Shenkin's, and amongſt the reſt Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, whoſe ſervants had told him, the day before their Lord dined at Mr. Jones's, where there was a deal of company, and a great ball in the evening. Amanda's heart almoſt died within her at theſe words; pleaſure then, not buſineſs, had prevented Lord Mortimer from coming to her, theſe amuſements, which he had ſo often declared were taſteleſs to him, from the ſuperior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light he experienced in her ſociety. Either he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere in ſuch expreſſions, or had now grown indifferent. She condemned herſelf for ever having permitted his viſits, or received his aſſiduities; ſhe reproached him for ever having paid thoſe aſſiduities, knowing, as he muſt, the inſincerity or inconſtancy of his nature. In ſpite of wounded pride, tears of ſorrow and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:038416_0079_1011E1E66747C558"/>
burſt from her; and her only conſolation was, that no one obſerved her. Her hours paſſed away heavily; ſhe could not attend to any thing, and in the evening walked out, to indulge in a lonely ramble, the dejection of her heart; ſhe turned from Tudor-Hall, and to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k, (without knowing it indeed) the very road which led to the houſe where Lord Mortimer had dined. With ſlow and penſive ſteps ſhe purſued her way, regardleſs of all around her, till an approaching footſtep made her raiſe her eyes, and ſhe beheld with equal ſurpriſe and confuſion, the very object who was then employing her thoughts. Obeying the impulſe of pride, ſhe haſtily turned away, till recollecting, that her precipitately avoiding him would at once betray her ſentiments, ſhe pauſed to liſten to his paſſionate inquiries after her health; having anſwered them with involuntary cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe again moved on; but her progreſs was ſoon ſtopt by Lord Mortimer; ſnatching her hand, he inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on knowing, why ſhe appeared ſo deſirous to avoid him. Amanda made no reply to this, but deſired he would let her go. "Never," he exclaimed, "till you wear another face to me. Oh! did you know the pain I have ſuffered ſince laſt we met, you would from pity, I am ſure, treat me with leſs coldneſs." Amanda's heart throbbed with ſudden pleaſure; but ſhe ſoon ſilenced its emotion, by reflecting, that a declaration of uneaſineſs, at the very time he was entering into gaiety, had ſomething too inconſiſtent in it, to merit credit. Hurt by ſuppoſing he wanted to impoſe on her, ſhe made yet more violent efforts to diſengage her hand; but Lord Mortimer held it too firmly for her to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; he ſaw ſhe was offended, and it gave him flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ideas of the eſtimation in which he ſtood with her, ſince to reſent his neglect, was the moſt convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proof he could receive of the value ſhe ſet upon his attention. Without hurting her feelings by a hint, that he believed the alteration in her manner occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his abſence, in indirect terms he apologized for it, ſaying what indeed was partly true, that a letter lately received had ſo ruffled his mind, he was quite unfit for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

hours of chagrin and uneaſineſs to accept invitations, which at ſome time or other he muſt have done, to avoid giving offence and by acting as he had done, he reſerved the precious moments of returning tranquility for her he adored. Ah! how readily do we receive any apology, do we admit of any excuſe, that comes from a beloved object. Amanda felt as if a weight was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly removed from her heart: her eyes were no longer bent to the earth, her cheek no longer pale; and a ſmile, the ſmile of innocence, and love, enlivened all her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. She ſeemed ſuddenly to forget her hand was detained by Lord Mortimer, for no longer did ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to free it; ſhe ſuffered him gently to draw it within his, and lead her to the favourite haunt in Tudor Grove.</p>
                     <p>Pleaſed, yet bluſhing and confuſed, ſhe heard Lord Mortimer with more energy, than he had ever yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf with, declare the pain he ſuffered the days he ſaw her not. From his ardent, his paſſionate expreſſions, what could the innocent Amanda infer, but that he intended, by uniting his deſtiny to her's, to ſecure to himſelf a ſociety he ſo highly valued; what could ſhe infer, but that he meant immediately to ſpeak in explicit terms? The idea was too pleaſing to be received in tranquility, and her whole ſoul felt agitated. While they purſued their way through Tudor Grove the ſky, which had been lowering the whole day, became ſuddenly more darkened, and by its increaſing gloom foretold an approaching ſtorm. Lord Mortimer no longer oppoſed Amanda's returning home; but ſcarcely had they turned for that purpoſe, ere the vivid light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flaſhed acroſs their path, and the thunder was awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reverberated amongſt the hills. The Hall was much nearer than the cottage, and Lord Mortimer, throwing his arms around Amanda's waiſt, hurried her to it; but ere they reached the library, whoſe door was the firſt they came to, the rain began pouring with violence. Lord Mortimer ſnatched off Amanda's wet hat and cloak, the reſt of her cloathes were quite dry; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ordered tea and coffee, as ſhe refuſed any other refreſhments: he diſmiſſed the attendants, that he
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:038416_0081_1011E1E990DF9C50"/>
might, without obſervation or reſtraint, enjoy her ſociety. As ſhe preſided at the tea-table, his eyes, with the fondeſt rapture, were faſtened on her face, which never had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more lovely: exerciſe had heightened the pale tint of her cheek, o'er which her gloſſy hair curled in beautiful diſorder; the unuſual glow gave a greater ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diance to her eyes, whoſe ſoft confuſion denoted the pleaſure ſhe experienced from the attentions of Lord Mortimer. He reſtrained not, he could not reſtrain, the feelings of his ſoul. "Oh what happineſs," he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed. "No wonder I found all ſociety taſteleſs, after having experienced your's. Where could I find ſuch ſoftneſs, yet ſuch ſenſibility; ſuch ſweetneſs, yet ſuch animation; ſuch beauty, yet ſuch apparent unconſcious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. Oh my Amanda, ſmoothly muſt that life g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ide on, whoſe deſtiny you ſhall ſhare." Amanda en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to check theſe tranſports, yet ſecretly they filled her with delight, for ſhe regarded them as the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere effuſions of honourable love. Preſent happineſs, however, could not render her forgetful of propriety: by the time tea was over, the evening began to clear, and ſhe proteſted ſhe muſt depart; Lord Mortimer proteſted againſt this for ſome time longer, and at laſt brought her to the window, to convince her there was ſtill a ſlight rain falling. He promiſed to ſee her home as ſoon as it was over, and entreated in the mean time, ſhe would gratify him with a ſong. Amanda did not refuſe; but the raptures he expreſſed while ſinging, ſhe thought too violent, and roſe from the piano when ſhe had concluded in ſpite of his entreaties on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. She inſiſted on getting her hat and cloak, which had been ſent to Mrs. Abergwilly to dry; Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer at laſt reluctantly went out to obey her.</p>
                     <p>Amanda walked to the window: the proſpect from it was lovely: the evening was now perfectly ſerene, a few light clouds alone floated in the ſky, their lucid ſkirts tinged with purple rays from the declining ſun; the trees wore a brighter green, and the dew-drop that had heightened their verdure, yet glittered on their ſprays; acroſs a diſtant valley was extended a beautiful
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:038416_0082_1011E1EF476E3CA8"/>
rainbow, the ſacred record of heaven's covenant with man. All nature appeared revived and animated; the birds now warbled their cloſing lays, and the bleating of the cattle was heard from the neighbouring hills. "Oh! how ſweet, how lovely is the dewy land-ſcape," exclaimed Amanda, with that delight, which ſcenes of calm and vernal nature never fail of raiſing in minds of piety and tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis lovely indeed," repeated Lord Mortimer, who returned at the moment, aſſuring her the things would be ſent in directly. "I admire the proſpect," continued he, "becauſe you gaze upon it with me: were you abſent, like every other charm, it would loſe its beauty, and become taſteleſs to me. Tell me," cried he, gently encircling her waiſt, "why this hurry, why this wiſh to leave me? Do you expect elſewhere to meet with a being, who will value your ſociety more highly than I do? Do you expect to meet with a heart, more fondly, more firmly attached to you, than mine? Oh my Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, if you do, how miſtaken are ſuch expectations!"</p>
                     <p>Amanda bluſhed, and averted her head, unable to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>"Ah why," continued he, purſuing her averted eyes with his, "ſhould we create uneaſineſs to ourſelves, by again ſeparating?"</p>
                     <p>Amanda looked up at theſe words, with involuntary ſurpriſe in her countenance. Lord Mortimer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it: he ſaw ſhe had hitherto deluded herſelf with thinking, his intentions towards her very different from what they really were: to ſuffer her longer to deceive herſelf, would he thought, be cruelty. Straining her to his beating heart, he imprinted a kiſs on her tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous lips, and ſoftly told her, that the life which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her would loſe half its charms, ſhould be devoted to her ſervice; and that his fortune like his heart, ſhould be in her poſſeſſion. Trembling while ſhe ſtruggled to free herſelf from his arms, Amanda demanded what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e meant: her manner ſomewhat ſurpriſed and confuſed him; but recollecting that this was the moment for expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he, though with half-averted eyes, declared his
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:038416_0083_1011E1F0D7D75138"/>
hopes—his wiſhes and intentions. Surpriſe,—horror,—and indignation, for a few minutes overpowered Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da; but ſuddenly recovering her ſcattered ſenſes, with a ſtrength greater than ſhe had ever before felt, ſhe burſt from him, and attempted to ruſh from the room. Lord Mortimer caught hold of her: "whither are you going, Amanda?" exclaimed he, affrighted by her manner.</p>
                     <p>"From the baſeſt of men," cried ſhe, ſtruggling to diſengage herſelf.</p>
                     <p>He ſhut the door, and forced her back to a chair: he was ſhocked—amazed—and confounded by her looks; no art could have aſſumed ſuch a ſemblance of ſorrow as ſhe now wore; no feelings, but thoſe of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate nature, have expreſſed ſuch emotion as ſhe now betrayed; the enlivening bloom of her cheeks were fled, and ſucceeded by a deadly paleneſs; and her ſoft eyes, robbed of their luſtre, were bent to the ground with the deepeſt expreſſions of woe. Lord Mortimer began to think he had miſtaken, if not her character, her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and the idea of having inſulted either purity or penitence, was like a dagger to his heart. "Oh my love!" he exclaimed, laying his hand on her trembling one, "what do you mean by departing ſo abruptly?"</p>
                     <p>"My meaning, my Lord," cried ſhe, riſing, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his hand from her's, "is now as obvious as your own—I ſeek, forever, to quit a man who, under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of delicate attention, meditated ſo baſe a ſcheme againſt me. My credulity may have yielded you amuſement, but it has afforded you no triumph: the tenderneſs which I know you think, which I ſhall not deny your having inſpired me with, as it was excited by imaginary virtues, ſo it vaniſhed with the illuſion which gave it birth; what then was innocent, would now be guilty. Oh heavens!" continued Amanda, claſping her hands together, in a ſudden agony of tears, "is it me, the helpleſs child of ſorrow, Lord Mortimer ſought as a victim to illicit love! Is it the ſon of Lord Cherbury, deſtined ſuch a blow againſt the unfortunate Fitzalan!"</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer ſtarted. "Fitzalan!" repeated he.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:038416_0084_1011E1F38EE88740"/>
"Oh! Amanda, why did you conceal your real name? and what am I to infer from your having done ſo?"</p>
                     <p>"What you pleaſe, my Lord," cried ſhe, "The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a perſon I deſpiſe can be of little conſequence to me. Yet," continued ſhe, as if ſuddenly recollecting herſelf, "that you may have no plea for extenuating your conduct, know, that my name was concealed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of my father, who, involved in unexpected diſtreſs, wiſhed me to adopt another, till his affairs were ſettled."</p>
                     <p>"This concealment has undone me," exclaimed Lord Mortimer: "it has led me into an error, I ſhall never ceaſe repenting. Oh! Amanda, deign to liſten to the circumſtances which occaſioned this error, and you will then, I am ſure, think me at leaſt leſs culpable than I now appear to be; you will then, perhaps, allow me to make ſome atonement."</p>
                     <p>"No, my Lord," cried Amanda, "willingly I will not allow myſelf to be deceived: for without deceit, I am convinced you could mention no circumſtance, which could poſſibly palliate your conduct, or what you ſo gently term an error."</p>
                     <p>"Had I, my Lord, by art or coquetry, ſought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract your notice, your crime would have been pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but when you purſued, I retired: and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your being Lord Cherbury's ſon, firſt induced me to receive your viſits. I ſuffered their continuance, becauſe I thought you amiable: ſad miſtake! Oh! cruel, ungenerous Mortimer, how have you abuſed my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting confidence!"</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ended theſe words, ſhe moved towards the door. Awed by her manner, confounded by her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, tortured by remorſe, and half offended at her refuſing to hear his vindication, he no longer attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prevent her quitting the apartment: he followed her, however, from it. "What do you mean, my Lord," aſked ſhe, "by coming after me?"</p>
                     <p>"I mean to ſee you ſafely home," replied he, in a tone of proud ſullenneſs.</p>
                     <p>"And is it Lord Mortimer," cried ſhe, looking ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly in his face, "pretends to ſee me ſafe?"</p>
                     <p>

He ſtampt, ſtruck his hand violently againſt his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and exclaimed, "I ſee—I ſee—I am deſpicable in your eyes; but, Amanda, I cannot endure your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. Pauſe for a few minutes, and you will find I am not ſo deſerving of them as you imagine."</p>
                     <p>She made no reply, but quickened her pace: within a few yards of the cottage Lord Mortimer caught her with a diſtracted air. "Amanda," ſaid he, "I cannot bear to part with you in this manner: you think me the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Moſt aſſuredly, my Lord," replied ſhe in a ſolemn voice.</p>
                     <p>"Cannot compunction then extenuate my error?"</p>
                     <p>"'Tis not compunction, 'tis regret you feel, for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your deſigns unſucceſsful."</p>
                     <p>"No: by all that is ſacred, 'tis remorſe for ever hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meditated ſuch an injury. Yet I again repeat, if you liſten to me, you will find I am not ſo culpable as you believe. Oh! let me beſeech you to do ſo; let me hope, that my life may be devoted to you alone, and that I may thus have opportunities of apologizing for my conduct. Oh! deareſt Amanda," kneeling before her "drive me not from you in the hour of penitence."</p>
                     <p>"You plead in vain, my Lord," cried ſhe breaking from him.</p>
                     <p>He ſtarted in an agony from the ground, and again ſeized her. "Is it thus," he exclaimed, "with ſuch unfeeling coldneſs I am abandoned by Amanda? I will leave you, if you only ſay I am not deteſted by you; if you only ſay, the remembrance of the ſweet hours we have ſpent together will not become hateful to you."</p>
                     <p>He was pale, and trembled; a tear wet his cheek. Amanda's began to flow: ſhe averted her head, to hide her emotion; but he had perceived it. "You weep, my Amanda." ſaid he, "and you feel the influence of pity!"</p>
                     <p>"No, no," cried ſhe, in a tone ſcarcely articulate.</p>
                     <p>"I will acknowledge," continued ſhe, "I believe you poſſeſſed of ſenſibility; and an anticipation of the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful feelings it will excite on the reflection of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

                     <p>Amanda darted from Lord Mortimer; and entering the cottage, haſtily cloſed the door. Her looks terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the nurſe, who was the only one of the family up, and who, by means of one of her ſons, had diſcovered that Amanda had taken refuge from the thunder ſtorm in Tudor Hall.</p>
                     <p>Amanda had neither hat or cloak on; her face was pale as death: her hair, blown by the wind, and wet from the rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>, hung diſhevelled about her; and to the inquiries of the nurſe ſhe could only anſwer by ſobs and tears. "Lack a tay," ſaid the nurſe, "what ails my ſweet chilt?"</p>
                     <p>Relieved by tears, Amanda told her nurſe ſhe was not very well, and that ſhe had been reflecting on the great impropriety there was in receiving Lord Mortimer's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, whom ſhe begged her nurſe (if he came again) not to admit.</p>
                     <p>The nurſe ſhook her head, and ſaid ſhe ſuppoſed there had been ſome quarrel between them; but if Lord Mortimer had done any thing to vex her tear chilt, ſhe would make him pay for it. Amanda charged her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to addreſs him on ſuch a ſubject, and having made her promiſe not to admit him, ſhe retired to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber faint, weary and diſtreſſed. The indignity offered her by Colonel Belgrave had inſulted her purity, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her pride, but it had not wounded the ſofter feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of her ſoul; it was Mortimer alone had power to work them up to agony.</p>
                     <p>The charm which had ſoothed her ſorrows was fled; and while ſhe glowed with keen reſentment, ſhe wept from diſappointed tenderneſs. "Alas! my father," ſhe cried, "is this the ſecure retreat you fondly thought you
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:038416_0087_1011E1FA52A55890"/>
had diſcovered for me. Sad miſtake! leſs had I to dread from the audacious front of vice than the inſidious form of virtue: delicacy ſhrinking from one, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately announced the danger; but innocence inſpired confidence in the other; and credulity, inſtead of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, occupied the mind. Am I doomed to be the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of deception? and except thy honeſt, tender heart, my father, find every other fraught with deceit and treachery to me? Alas! if in the early ſeaſon of youth perpetual perfidy makes us relinquiſh candor and hope, what charms can the world retain? The ſoul ſickening recoils within itſelf, and no longer ſtartles at diſſolution. Belgrave aimed at my peace—but Mortimer alone had power to pierce the "vital vulnerable heart." Oh! Mortimer, from you alone the blow is ſevere—you, who, in divine language I may ſay, wert my guide, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and my familiar friend.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was now a prey to all the pangs which an ingenuous mind, oppreſſed with a conſciouſneſs of error, muſt ever feel: the moſt implacable vengeance could not deviſe a greater puniſhment for him, than his own thoughts inflicted; the empire of inordinate paſſion was o'erthrown, and honor and reaſon regained their full and natural aſcendency over him. When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the uniform appearance of innocence Amanda had always worn, he wondered at his weakneſs in ever having doubted its reality—at his audacity, in ever hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſulted it; when he reflected on her melancholy, he ſhuddered as if having aggravated it.</p>
                     <p>"Your ſorrows, as well as purity, my Amanda," he cried, "ſhould have rendered you a ſacred object to me."</p>
                     <p>A ray of conſolation darted into his mind, at the idea of prevailing on her to liſten to the circumſtances which had led him into a conduct ſo unworthy of her and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſuch an explanation, he truſted, would regain her love and confidence, and make her accept, what he meant immediately to offer—his hand: for pride and ambition could raiſe no obſtacle to oppoſe this deſign of reparation; his happineſs depended on its being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:038416_0088_1011E1FC8E0C7750"/>
Amanda was dearer to him than life, and hope could ſketch no proſpect, in which ſhe was not the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt object. Impetuous in his paſſions, the lapſe of the hours was inſupportably tedious; and the idea of waiting till the morning to declare his penitence, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and again implore her forgiveneſs, filled him with agony: he went up to the cottage, and laid his hand upon the latch; he heſitated; even from the ruſtics he wiſhed to conceal his ſhame and confuſion. All within and without the cottage was ſtill; the moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams ſeemed to ſleep upon the thatch, and the trees were unagitated by a breeze.</p>
                     <p>"Happy ruſtics," exclaimed Lord Mortimer. "Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of content and undeviating integrity, ſleep preſſes ſweetly on your eye-lids. My Amanda too reſts, for ſhe is innocent."—He deſcended to the valley, and ſaw a light from her window; he advanced within a few yards of it, and ſaw her plainly walk about with an agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated air—her handkerchief raiſed to her eyes, as if ſhe wept. His feelings roſe almoſt to frenzy at this ſight, and he execrated himſelf for being the occaſion of her tears. The village clock ſtruck one: Good heavens, how many hours muſt intervene, ere he could kneel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lovely mourner, implore her ſoft voice to accord his pardon, and (as he flattered himſelf would be the caſe) in the fulneſs of reconciliation, preſs her to his throbbing heart, as the ſweet partner of his future days. The light was at laſt extinguiſhed; but he could not reſt, and continued to wander about like a perturbed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, till the day began to dawn, and he ſaw ſome early peaſants coming to their labours.</p>

                     <p>THE moment he thought he could ſee Amanda, Mortimer haſtened to the cottage: the nurſe, as ſhe had promiſed, would not reproach him, though ſhe ſtrongly ſuſpected his having done ſomething to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her child: but her ſullen air declared her diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. "Miſs Fitzalan was too ill," ſhe ſaid, "to ſee company:" (for Lord Mortimer had enquired for Amanda by her real name, deteſting the one of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, to which, in a great degree, he imputed his unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate conduct to her.) The nurſe ſpoke truth in ſaying Amanda was ill; her agitation was too much for her frame, and in the morning ſhe felt ſo feveriſh, ſhe would not riſe; ſhe had not ſpirits, indeed, to attempt it. Sunk to the loweſt ebb of dejection, ſhe felt ſolitude alone congenial to her feelings. Hitherto the morning had been impatiently expected; for with Mortimer ſhe enjoyed its
<q>
                           <l>"Cool, its fragrant, and its ſilent hour."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But no Mortimer was now deſired. In the evening he made another attempt; and finding Ellen alone, ſent in a ſupplicatory meſſage by her to Amanda. She was juſt riſen, and Mrs. Edwin was making tea for her: a fluſh of indignation overſpread her pale face, on receiving his meſſage. "Tell him," ſaid ſhe, "I am aſtoniſhed at his requeſt, and never will grant it. Let him ſeek elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where a heart more like his own, and trouble my repoſe no more."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:038416_0090_1011E201A9D29AA0"/>
He heard her words, and in a fit of paſſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment flew out of the houſe. Howell entered ſoon after, and heard from Ellen an account of the quarrel: a ſecret hope ſprung in his heart at this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and he deſired Ellen to meet him in about half an hour in the valley, thinking by that time he could dictate ſome meſſage to ſend by her to Amanda.</p>
                     <p>As the parſon had never paid Miſs Fitzalan any of thoſe attentions which ſtrike a vulgar eye, and had often laughed and familiarly chatted with Ellen, ſhe took into her head he was an admirer of her's; and if being the object of Chip's admiration excited the envy of her neighbours, how much would that increaſe, when the parſon's predilection was known. She ſet about adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf for her appointment; and while thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, the honeſt, faithful Chip entered, attired in his holiday cloaths to eſcort her to a little dance. Ellen bridled up at the firſt intimation of it; and delighted with the meſſage Amanda had ſent to Lord Mortimer, which in her opinion was extremely eloquent, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved now to imitate it.</p>
                     <p>"Timothy," ſaid ſhe, drawing back her head, "your requeſt is the moſt impropereſt that can be conceived, and it is by no means convenient for me to adhere to it. I tell you, Tim," cried ſhe, waving the corner of her white apron, for white handkerchief ſhe had not, "I wonder at your preſumptioneſs in making it—ceaſe your flattering expreſſions of love—look out amongſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority for a heart more like your own—and trouble my pleaſure no more."</p>
                     <p>Chip pauſed for a moment, as if wanting to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend her meaning. "The ſhort and the long of it then, Nell," ſaid he, "is, that you and I are to have nothing more to ſay to each other.</p>
                     <p>"True" cried his coque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iſh miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>"Well, well, Nell," ſaid he half crying, "the time may come, when you will repent ever having ſerved a true hearted lad in this manner." So ſaying, he ran from the houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="92" facs="unknown:038416_0091_1011CFAD159ABF18"/>
Ellen ſurveyed herſelf with great admiration, and expected nothing leſs than an immediate offer of the parſon's hand. She found him punctual to his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and after walking ſometime about the valley, they ſat down together upon a little bank. "Ellen," ſaid he, taking her hand, "do you think there is any hope for me?"</p>
                     <p>"Nay now, intead, Mr. Howell," cried ſhe, with affected coyneſs, "that is ſuch a ſtrange queſtion."</p>
                     <p>"But the quarrel, perhaps," ſaid he, "may be made up."</p>
                     <p>"No, I aſſure you," replied ſhe, with quickneſs, "it was entirely on your account it ever took place."</p>
                     <p>"Is it poſſible," exclaimed he, pleaſure ſparkling in his eyes, "then I may re-urge my paſſion."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, tear now, Mr. Howell, you are ſo very preſſing."</p>
                     <p>"Do you think," aſked he, "ſhe is too ill to ſee me?"</p>
                     <p>"Who too ill?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, Miſs Fitzalan." (For the moment Ellen knew Lord Mortimer acquainted with Amanda's name, ſhe thought there was no longer reaſon for concealing it from any one, and had informed Howell of it.)</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Fitzalan! repeated ſhe, ſtaring and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colour.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Ellen, the dear, lovely Miſs Fitzalan, whom I adore more than language can expreſs, or imagination conceive."</p>
                     <p>Adieu to Ellen's airy hopes; her chagrin could not be concealed, and tears burſt from her. The curate tenderly enquired the cauſe of her emotion: though vain ſhe was not artful, and could not diſguiſe it.—"Why really you made ſuch ſpeeches, I thought—and then you looked ſo. But it is no matter: I pelieve all men are teceitful."</p>
                     <p>From her tears and disjointed ſentences, he began to ſuſpect ſomething, and his gentle mind was hurt at the idea of giving her pain; anxious however to receive his doom from Amanda, he again aſked if ſhe thought he could ſee her. Ellen anſwered him ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>appiſhly, ſhe could
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:038416_0092_1011E20338862F30"/>
not tell: and hurried to the cottage, where a flood of tears ſoon relieved her diſtreſs. To be dreſſed ſo charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and for no purpoſe was a pity: ſhe therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on going to the dance, conſoling herſelf with the old ſaying of having more than one ſtring to her bow; and that if Chip was not as genteel, he was quite as perſonable a man as the curate. Walking down the lane ſhe met a little boy, who gave her a letter from Chip: full of the idea of its containing ſome overtures for a reconciliation, ſhe haſtily broke it open, and read to the following effect:</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>ELLEN, after your cruelty I could not bear to ſtay in the village, as I never could work another ſtroke with a light heart; and every tree and meadow would remind me of the love my dear girl once bore her poor Chip. So before this comes to hand, I ſhall be on my way to enter one of the king's ſhips, and heaven knows whether we ſhall ever meet again: but this I know, I ſhall always love Ellen, though ſhe was ſo cruel to her own faithful</p>

                     <p>Thus did the vanity of Ellen receive a ſpeedy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Her diſtreſs for ſome days was unabated, but at laſt yielded to the mild arguments of Amanda, and the hopes ſhe inſpired of ſeeing the wandering hero again.</p>
                     <p>Howell at laſt obtained an interview, and ventured to plead his paſſion. Amanda thanked him for his regard, but declared her inability of returning it as he wiſhed; aſſuring him however, at the ſame time of her ſincere friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>"This then ſhall ſuffice," ſaid he. "Neither ſorrow or diſappointment are new to me; and when they oppreſs me, I will turn to the idea of my angel friend, and forget (for ſome moments at leaſt) my heavy burthen."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer made ſeveral attempts for again ſeeing Amanda but without ſucceſs: he then wrote, but his letters were not more ſucceſsful. In deſpair at finding neither letters nor meſſages received by Amanda, he, at laſt, by ſtratagem, effected an interview: meeting one
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:038416_0093_1011E205A789CF98"/>
of the young Edwins returning from the poſt-town with a letter, he inquired, and heard it was for Miſs Fitzalan; a little perſuaſion prevailed on the young man to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh it, and Lord Mortimer flew directly to the cottage. "Now," cried he, "the inexorable girl muſt appear, if ſhe wiſhes to receive her letter." The nurſe informed. Amanda of it; but ſhe ſuſpecting it to be a ſcheme, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to appear. "By heaven, I do not deceive her," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, "nor will I give the letter into any hand but her's.</p>
                     <p>"This, my Lord," ſaid Amanda, coming from her chamber, "is really cruel; but give me the letter," im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently ſtretching out her hand for it.</p>
                     <p>"Another-condition remains to be complied with," cried he, ſeizing her ſoft hand, which ſhe, however, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly withdrew. "You muſt read it, Miſs Fitzalan, in my preſence."</p>
                     <p>"Good heavens how you torment me!" ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.</p>
                     <p>"Do you comply, then?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſhe replied, and received the letter from him.</p>
                     <p>The pity and compunction of his Lordſhip increaſed, as he gazed on her pale face, while her eyes eagerly ran over the contents of the letter, which was as follows:</p>

                           <p>TO be able to communicate pleaſure to my Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, rewards me for tedious months of wretchedneſs.

The emotions of Amanda were irrepreſſible: the letter dropt from her trembling hands, and her ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes were raiſed to heaven. "Oh bleſs him," ſhe exclaimed. "Gracious heaven, bleſs the benefactor of my father, for this good deed. May ſorrow or misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune never come acroſs his path."</p>
                     <p>"And who, may I aſk," ſaid Lord Mortimer," mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its ſo ſweet a prayer from Amanda?"</p>
                     <p>"See," cried ſhe preſenting him the letter, as if happy at the moment to have ſuch a proof of the truth of what ſhe had alledged to him.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was affected by the letter: his eyes filled with tears, and he turned aſide to hide his emotion; recovering himſelf, he again approached her. "And while you ſo ſweetly pray for the felicity of the father," ſaid he, "are you reſolved on dooming the ſon to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair? If ſincere penitence can extenuate error, and merit mercy, I deſerve to be forgiven."</p>
                     <p>Amanda roſe, as if with an intention of retiring; but Lord Mortimer caught her hand. "Think not," cried he, "I will loſe the preſent opportunity, (which I have ſo long deſired, and with ſuch difficulty obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) of entering into a vindication of my conduct: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be received by you, it is a juſtice I owe my own character to make; for as I never wilfully injured innocence, ſo I cannot bear to be conſidered its violator. Amidſt the wildneſs, the extravagance of youth, which with compunction I acknowledge being too often led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, my heart ſtill acquitted me of ever committing an act, which could entail upon me the pangs of conſcience. Sacred to me has virtue ever been, how lowly ſoever in ſituation.</p>
                     <p>The idea of his being able to vindicate himſelf, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afforded leſs pleaſure to Amanda, than it did to Lord Mortimer. She ſuffered him to reſeat her, while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the circumſtances which had led him aſtray in his opinion of her. Oh! how fervent was the rapture that pervaded Amanda's heart, when as ſhe liſtened to him, ſhe found he was ſtill the amiable, the noble, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous character, her fancy had firſt conceived him to be.
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:038416_0095_1011E20AE4A4D048"/>
Tears of pleaſure, as exquiſite as thoſe ſhe had lately ſhed, again fell from her: for oh! what delight is there in knowing, that an object we cannot help loving, we may ſtill eſteem. "Thus," continued Lord Mortimer, "I have accounted for my error; an error, which except on account of your diſpleaſure, I know not whether I ſhould regret; as it has convinced me more forcibly than any other circumſtance could have done, of the perfections of your mind; and has beſides removed from mine prejudices which cauſeleſſly I did not entertain againſt your ſex. Was every woman in a ſimilar ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to act like you,
<q>
                           <l>—Such numbers would not in vain,</l>
                           <l>Of broken vows and faithleſs men complain.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"To call you mine, is the height of my wiſhes: on your deciſion I reſt for happineſs. Oh! my Amanda, let it be a fovourable deciſion, and ſuffer me to write to Mr. Fitzalan, and requeſt him to beſtow on me, the greateſt treaſure one being could poſſibly receive from another, a woman lovely and educated as you have been."</p>
                     <p>When he mentioned appealing to her father, Amanda could no longer doubt the ſincerity of his intentions. Her own heart pleaded as powerfully as his ſolicitations did for pardoning him; and if ſhe did not abſolutely extend her hand, ſhe at laſt ſuffered it to be taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reluctance. "I am forgiven then," ſaid Lord Mortimer, preſſing her to his boſom. "Oh, my Amanda, years of tender attention can never make up for this goodneſs!"</p>
                     <p>When his tranſports were a little abated, he inſiſted on writing immediately to Fitzalan: as he ſealed the letter, he told Amanda he had requeſted an expeditious anſwer. The happineſs of the youthful pair was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the honeſt ruſtics, whom Lord Mortimer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally rewarded for their fidelity to his Amanda, and whom ſhe readily excuſed for their ambiguous expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to him; knowing they proceeded from ſimplicity of heart, and a wiſh of ſerving her, yet without injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:038416_0096_1011E20C705273F0"/>
themſelves, by betraying the manner in which they had procured intelligence of her ſituation.</p>
                     <p>The day after the reconcileation, Lord Mortimer told Amanda, he was compelled, for a ſhort time to leave her; with what reluctance, he hoped, he ſaid, ſhe could eaſily perceive; but the viſit which he had come into Wales for the purpoſe of paying, had been ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, his friend was growing impatient, and threatened to come to Tudor Hall to ſee what detained him there. To prevent ſuch a meaſure, which he knew would be a total interruption to the happineſs he enjoyed in her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, Lord Mortimer added, he intended to paſs a few days with him; hoping by the time he returned there would be a letter from Mr. Fitzalan, which would authorize his immediate preparations for their nuptials. Amanda wiſhed (but could not) totally hide the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe felt at the proſpect of a ſeparation: the idea, however, of his ſpeedy return rendered it but tranſient, and he departed in a few hours after he had mentioned his intention.</p>
                     <p>Amanda had never before experienced ſuch happineſs as ſhe now enjoyed: ſhe now ſaw herſelf on the point of being elavated to a ſituation, (by a man too ſhe adored) which would give her ample opportunities of ſerving the deareſt connexions of her heart, and of gratifying the benevolence of her diſpoſition, and the elegance of her taſte. Oh! how delightful to think, ſhe ſhould be able to ſoothe the declining period of her father's life, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for him all the requiſite indulgences of age: oh! how delightful to think, ſhe ſhould be acceſſary to her dear Oſcar's promotion; how rapturous to imagine, at her approach the drooping children of miſery would brighten with pleaſing preſages of relief, which ſhe ſhould amply realize. Such were Amanda's anticipations of what ſhe termed the bleſſings of an affluent fortune: felicity, in her opinion, was to be diffuſed to be enjoyed. Of Lord Cherbury's ſanction to the attachment of his ſon, ſhe entertained not a doubt: her birth was little inferior to his, and fortune was entirely out of the queſtion; for
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:038416_0097_1011E20E9B731980"/>
a liberal mind, ſhe thought, could never look to that, when on one ſide was already poſſeſſed more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for even the luxuries of life. Such were the ideas of the innocent and romantic Amanda; ideas, which made her ſeem to tread on air, and which ſhe entertained till ſubſequent experience convinced her of their fallacy.</p>

                     <p>AMANDA was ſitting in the receſs in the garden, the fourth evening of Lord Mortimer's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, when ſuddenly ſhe heard the rattling of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: her heart bounded, and ſhe flew into the houſe; at the very moment a chaiſe ſtopt at the door, from which, to her inexpreſſible amazement, her father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.</p>
                     <p>Transfixed to the ſpot, it was many minutes ere ſhe had power to bid him welcome, or return the fond ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes he beſtowed upon her. "I am come, Amanda," ſaid he, eagerly interrupting the joyful ſpeeches of the Edwins, "to take you away with me; and one hour is all I can give you to prepare yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Good heaven," ſaid Amanda, ſtarting, "to take me away immediately."</p>
                     <p>"Immediately," he repeated, "And as I know you are attached to this good girl," (turning to Ellen) "I ſhall be happy, if her parents permit, to procure her attendance for you."</p>
                     <p>

The Edwins, who would have followed themſelves, or allowed any of their family to follow Fitzalan and his daughter round the world, gladly conſented to her going; and the girl, excluſive of her attachment to Amanda, which was very great, having pined ever ſince her lover's departure, rejoiced at the idea of a change of ſcene.</p>
                     <p>Not ſo Amanda: it made her ſuffer agony, to be torn from Lord Mortimer in the hour of reconciliation and explanation, was more than ſhe could ſupport with forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Her father, perhaps, had not received his letter; it was but juſtice then to him and Lord Mortimer to reveal her ſituation. She left her trunk half-packed, and went out for that purpoſe; but as ſhe ſtood before him with quivering lips and half averted eyes at a loſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, he took her hand, and ſoftly exclaimed, "My love, let us for the preſent wave every ſubject; the moments are precious, haſten to put on your habit, or we ſhall be too late at the ſtage where I propoſe reſting to night." Amanda turned in ſilence to her chamber to comply with his deſire, tears ran down her cheeks, and for the firſt time ſhe conceived the idea of being hurried away to avoid Lord Mortimer; but why ſhe co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="unknown:038416_0099_1011E235F8A60B70"/>
prevailed—all the travellers were equally though differently affected; the cottage and the ſpire of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage church had awakened the moſt affecting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances in the mind of Fitzalan, and tears fell from him to the memory of his unfortunate Malvina; ſighs burſt from Amanda as ſhe viewed the white turrets of Tudor Hall and Ellen ſobbed on paſſing the forſaken cottage of poor Chip. From all theſe affecting and beloved objects the rapidity of the carriage ſoon conveyed them, but the impreſſions they left upon their mind were not ſo eaſily eradicated; Fitzalan was the firſt to break the unſocial ſilence, and it ſeemed as if he did ſo for the purpoſe of rouſing the dejection of his daughter: a croſs road from the cottage ſhortly brought them to Conway ferry, which they were obliged to paſs, and here had Amanda's mind been at eaſe, ſhe would have felt truly gratified by viewing the remains of a gothic magnificence which Caſtle Conway exhibited; as it was ſhe could not behold them unmoved, and, whilſt ſhe admired, ſhe gave the paſſing tribute of a ſigh to grandeur and decay. They only continued in Conway till a carriage was provided for them, and ſoon came beneath the ſtupendous projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Penmaenmawr; this was a ſcene as new as aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Amanda: "well, Cot in heaven pleſs their ſouls," Ellen ſaid, "what a tefil of a way they ſhould be in if one of them huge ſtones rolled down upon the carriage." They ſtopped not again till they reached Bangor ferry where they were to reſt for the night; Amanda's ſtrength and ſpirits were now ſo entirely exhauſted, that had not a glaſs of wine been immediately procured her, ſhe would have fainted from weakneſs; this a little revived her, and the tears ſhe ſhed relieved in ſome degree the oppreſſions of her heart; her father left her and Ellen together, while he went to give directions about the journey of the enſuing day.</p>
                     <p>Amanda went to the window and threw up the ſaſh, the air from the mountains ſhe thought refreſhed her; the darkneſs of the hour was oppoſed by a bright moon, which call a trembling radiance upon the water, and by its partial gleams exhibited a beautiful ſcene of light

Amanda motioned her to ſilence, unwilling to loſe the ſmalleſt ſound of Lord Mortimer's voice, and determined, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious as ſhe was to ſee him, never to act in oppoſition to her father.

Amanda, in ſpite of ſadneſs, beheld the charming ſcene with admiration, and Fitza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan contemplated it with delight. "All nature," he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "points out to man the gratitude due to the divine Diſpenſer of good; hardened muſt that heart be againſt the feelings of ſenſibility, which the harmony and fragrance of this early hour awakens not to a perfect ſenſe of it:" Amanda aſſented more by a ſmile than words (for ſhe was ill able to ſpeak) to his remark. They ſtopped not till they reached Gwintey, where they break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted, and then proceeded, without reſting again, to Holley head, which place Fitzalan announced as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it; and now Amanda firſt conceived the idea of being brought to another kingdom, in which her father ſoon confirmed her, for as ſoon as they alighted, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired when a packet would ſail, and heard with evident pleaſure about ſix in the afternoon; he directly deſired three paſſages to be engaged; and having ordered an early dinner, diſmiſſed Ellen into another room, and ſeating himſelf by Amanda, he took her hand, and with a tender voice thus addreſſed her:—"To give pain to your gentle heart has inflicted torture on mine, but honour compelled me to the conduct which I have adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which, I truſt and believe, Amanda will excuſe, when ſhe knows my motive for it, which in due order ſhe ſhall hear—On Lord Cherbury's arrival in town, I was immediately informed of it, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his domeſtics, and directly ſent him my letter; ſcarcely had he read it, ere, with all the ardor of real friendſhip, he came and brought me to his houſe, where we might ſecurely reflect on what was to be done; his Lordſhip ſoon formed a plan that at once inſpired me with gratitude and pleaſure, as it promiſed me compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, without depriving me of independence—this was to accept the agency of a conſiderable eſtate in the

                     <p>Dinner was brought in, to which they ſat down in their uſual ſocial manner, and Amanda, happy in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſmiles, felt a ray of returning cheerfulneſs.

                     <p>THE raptures of this meeting ſurpaſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; to Oſcar they were heightened by ſurpriſe; he was unfortunately that day on guard at the bank, therefore could only pay them a few ſhort and ſtolen vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, but the next morning, the moment he was reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he came to them. Fitzalan had given Amanda money to purchaſe whatever ſhe deemed neceſſary for her conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and amuſement, and Oſcar attended her to the moſt celebrated ſhops to make her purchaſes: having ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied herſelf with a pretty faſhionable aſſortment for her wardrobe, ſhe procured a ſmall collection of books ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient however, from their excellence to form a little libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in themſelves, and every requiſite for drawing; nor did ſhe forget the little want and vanities of Ellen: they returned about dinner time to the hotel, where they found their father, who had been tranſacting buſineſs for Lord Cherbury in different parts of the town. We may now ſuppoſe him in the poſſeſſion of happineſs, bleſſed as he was in the ſociety of his children, and the certainty of a competence; but, alas! happineſs has almoſt ever an attendant draw-back, and he now experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced one of the moſt corroding kind from the alteration

he witneſſed in his ſon: Oſcar was improved in perſon, but his eyes no longer beamed with animation, and the roſe upon his cheek was pale, his cheerfulneſs no longer appeared ſpontaneous, but conſtrained, as if aſſumed for the purpoſe of veiling deep and heartfelt ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan, with all the anxiety and tenderneſs of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, delicately expreſſed his wiſh of learning the ſource of his uneaſineſs, that by ſo doing he might be better qualified to alleviate it, hinting at the ſame time, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct terms, that if occaſioned by any of the impruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which youth is ſometimes inadvertently led into, he would readily excuſe them, from a certainty that he who repented never would again commit them. Oſcar ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the remoteſt hint of divulging his uneaſineſs; he begged his father, however, to believe, (ſince he had unfortunately perceived it) that it was not derived from imprudence; he pretended to ſay it was but a ſlight chagrin which would ſoon wear away of itſelf if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by inquiries. Fitzalan, however, was too much affected by the ſubject to drop it as readily as Oſcar wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After regarding him for a few minutes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention as mournful as fixed (while they ſac round the table after dinner) he ſuddenly exclaimed, "Alas, my dear boy, I fear things are worſe within than you will allow." "Now, indeed, Oſcar," cried Amanda, ſweetly ſmiling on him, anxious to relieve him from the embarraſſmet theſe words had involved him in, and to diſſipate the deep gloom of her father's brow, "tho' never in the wars, I fancy you are not quite heart whole!" He anſwered her with affected gaiety; but, as if wiſhing to change the diſcourſe, ſuddenly ſpoke of Colonel Belgrave, who, at preſent, he ſaid, was abſent from the regiment; occupied by his own feelings, he obſerved not the glow which mantled the cheeks of his father and ſiſter at that name.</p>
                     <p>"You know Mrs. Belgrave," ſaid Amanda, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to regain compoſure. "Know her!" repeated he, with an involuntary ſigh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "oh, yes!" Then after the pauſe of a few minutes, turning to his father, "I

believe I have already informed you, Sir," he ſaid, "that ſhe is the daughter of your brave old friend, General Honeywood, who, I aſſure you, paid me no little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention on your account, his houſe is quite the temple of hoſpitality, and ſhe the little preſiding goddeſs." "She is happy, I hope," ſaid Amanda. "Oh, ſurely!" replied Oſcar, little thinking of the ſecret motive his ſiſter had for aſking ſuch a queſtion, "ſhe poſſeſſes what the world thinks neceſſary to conſtitute felicity."</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan had accounted to his ſon for leaving Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, by ſaying the air had diſagreed with Amanda: he told him of the friendſhip of Lord Cherbury, from which he ſaid he truſted ſhortly to be able to have him promoted. "Be aſſured, my dear Oſcar, moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would I relinquiſh many of the comforts of life to attain the ability of haſtening your advancement, or adding to your happineſs." "My happineſs!" Oſcar mournfully repeated, tears filled his eyes; he could no longer reſtrain them, and ſtarting up, hurried to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Amanda followed, unutterably affected at his emotion: "Oſcar, my dear Oſcar, ſaid ſhe, as ſhe flung her arms round his neck, "you diſtreſs me beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion." He ſat down, and leaning his head on her boſom, as ſhe ſtood before him, his tears fell through her handkerchief. "Oh, heavens!" exclaimed Fitza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, claſping his hands together, "what a ſight is this! Oh! my children, from your felicity alone could I ever derive any; if the hope I entertained of that felicity is diſappointed, the heart which cheriſhed it muſt ſoon be ſilent." He aroſe, and went to them: Yet," continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, "amidſt the anguiſh of this moment, I feel a ray of pleaſure at perceiving an affection ſo ſtrong and tender between you; it will be a mutual conſolation and ſupport when the feeble help and protection I can give is finally removed: oh then, my Oſcar." He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded while he folded their united hands in his, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſoothing friend and guardian of this dear, this amiable, this too lovely girl—let her not too ſeverely feel—too bitterly mourn—the loſs of an unhappy father."</p>

Amanda's tears began to ſtream, and Oſcar's for a few minutes were increaſed. "Excuſe me," at laſt he ſaid, making an effort to exert himſelf, to his father, "and be aſſured, to the utmoſt of my ability I will ever obey your wiſhes, and fulfil your expectations: I am aſhamed of the weakneſs I have betrayed—I will yield to it no more—forget therefore your having ſeen it, or at leaſt remember it without pain, as I ſolemnly aſſure you, no effort on my part ſhall be untried to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it entirely; and now let the ſhort time we have to continue together be devoted to cheerfulneſs."</p>

The green was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely crouded, particularly with officers, whoſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering glances were ſoon attracted to Amanda, as one of the moſt elegant girls preſent. Oſcar was ſoon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by them, and compelled, not only to gratify their curioſity, by diſcovering who ſhe was, but their gallantry by introducing them to her. Their compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſoon diverted her attention from the exhibition; and Ellen, who ſat behind her on a bench, afforded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent mirth by her remarks. "Pleſs her ſoul and poty too," ſhe ſaid "it was the moſt comical and wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſight ſhe had ever ſeen in her porn tays." A ſtring of red coats would have attended Amanda to the hotel, had not Oſcar prevented it.</p>
                     <p>The next day was devoted to viſiting the public build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the park, and a few of the moſt beautiful places in its vicinage. On the enſuing morn Fitzalan and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda continued their journey to the north, where Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car aſſured them he expected leave to viſit them the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſummer, after the reviews were over; as he help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſiſter into the carriage, ſhe put a pocket book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand (given by her father for that purpoſe) which contained ſomething to repleniſh his purſe.</p>

                     <p>OSCAR's regiment, on his firſt joining it in Ireland, was quartered in Enniſkellen, the corps was agreeable, and the inhabitants of the town hoſpitable and polite. He felt all the delight of a young and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing mind, entering, to what appeared to him, the road to glory and pleaſure; many of his idle morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ſpent in rambling about the country, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times accompanied by a party of officers, and ſometimes alone.</p>
                     <p>In one of his ſolitary excurſions along the beautiful banks of Lough Erne, with a light fuſee on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the woods, that almoſt deſcended to the edge of the water abounded in game, after proceeding a few miles he felt quite exhauſted by the heat, which as it was now the middle of ſummer, was intenſe; at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance he perceived an orchard, whoſe glowing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples promiſed a delightful repaſt; knowing that the fruit in many of the neighbouring places was kept for ſale, he reſolved on trying if any was to be purchaſed here, and accordingly opened a ſmall gate and aſcended
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:038416_0112_1011E230C16099A0"/>
through a graſs grown path in the orchard to a very plain white cottage, which ſtood on a gently ſloping lawn, ſurrounded by a rude pailing, he knocked againſt the door with his fuſee, and immediately a little roſy girl appeared, "tell me my pretty laſs," cried he "whether I can purchaſe any of theſe fine apples I ſee here." "Anan!" exclaimed the girl, with a fooliſh ſtare. Oſcar glancing at the moment into the paſſage, ſaw from a half cloſed door nearly oppoſite the one at which he ſtood, a beautiful fair face peeping out; he involuntarily ſtarted, and puſhing aſide the girl, made a ſtep into the paſſage, the room door directly opened, and an elderly woman, of a genteel figure, and pleaſing countenance, appeared. "Good heavens!" cried Oſcar, taking off his hat, and reteating. I fear I have been guilty of the higheſt impertinence, the only apology I can offer is by ſaying it was not intentional, I am quite a ſtranger here, and having been informed moſt of the orchards here abouts contained fruit for ſale I intruded under that idea." "Your miſtake, Sir," ſhe replied, with a benevolent ſmile, "is too trifling to require an apology, nor ſhall it be attended with any diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you.</p>

muſlin, ſhe poſſeſſed an air of faſhion, and even conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequence: the eaſy manner in which ſhe bore the looks of Oſcar proclaimed her at once unaccuſtomed to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor diſpleaſed with that ſhe now received: for that Oſcar admired her could not but be viſible, and he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fancied he ſaw an arch ſmile playing over her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, at the involuntary glances he directed towards her.</p>
                     <p>A fine baſket of apples and ſome delicious cyder was brought to Oſcar, and he found his entertainer as hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in diſpoſition as ſhe was pleaſing in converſation.</p>
                     <p>The beautiful interior of the cottage by no means correſponded with the plainneſs of the exterior, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture was elegantly neat, and the room ornamented with a variety of ſine prints and landſcapes; a large folding glaſs door opened from it into a pleaſure garden.</p>
                     <p>Adela, ſo was the charming young ſtranger called, chatted in the moſt lively and familiar terms, and at laſt running over to the baſket, toſt the apples all about the table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and picking out the fineſt preſented them to Oſcar.

"Delicious game, indeed!" cried he, interrupting the archneſs of her look, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by it to touch her hand, "but only tantalizing to a keen ſportſman, who ſees it elevated above his reach." "Come, come," exclaimed the old lady, with a ſudden gravity, "we are detaining the gentleman." She took her fair companion by the arm and haſtily turned to the cottage. Oſcar gazed after them a moment, then with a half ſmothered ſigh, deſcended to the road. He could not help thinking this incident of the morning very like the novel adventures he had ſometimes read to his ſiſter Amanda as ſhe ſat at work, and to compleat the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, thought he, I muſt fall in love with the little he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine. Ah! Oſcar, beware of ſuch imprudence, guard your heart with all your care againſt tender impreſſions, till fortune has been more propitious to you; thus would my father ſpeak, muſed Oſcar, and ſet his own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in terrible array before me, were he now preſent; well I muſt endeavour to act as if he were here to exhort me.

                     <p>The next morning the fuſee was again taken down, and he ſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Upon his arrival at the orchard, finding the gate open, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced a few ſteps up the path, and had a glimpſe of the cottage, but no object was viſible. Oſcar was too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt to attempt entering it uninvited, he therefore turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, yet often caſt a look behind him; no one howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was to be ſeen; he now began to feel the heat op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, and himſelf fatigued with his walk, and ſat down upon a moſs covered ſtone, on the margin of the lake, at a little diſtance from the cottage, beneath the ſpreading branches of a hawthorn, his hat and fuſee were laid at his feet, and a cool breeze from the water refreſhed him; upon its ſmooth ſurface a number of boats and ſmall ſail veſſels were now gliding about in various directions, and enlivened the enchanting proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:038416_0115_1011E2378A44EBE8"/>
which was ſpread upon the boſom of the lake: from contemplating it he was ſuddenly rouſed by the warble of a female voice; he ſtarted, turned, and beheld Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la juſt by him. "Bleſs me!" cried ſhe, "who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Then ſitting down on the ſeat he had reſigned, ſhe toſt off her bonnet, declaring it was inſupportably warm, and began rummaging a ſmall work bag ſhe held on her arm. Oſcar ſnatching the bonnet from the ground, Adela flu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He ſat down at her feet, and never perhaps felt ſuch a variety of emotions as at the preſent moment: his cheeks glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a brighter colour, and his eyes were raiſed to her's with the moſt ardent admiration; yet not to them alone could he confine the expreſſion of his feelings, they broke in half formed ſentences from his lips, which Adela heard with the moſt perfect compoſure, deſiring him either to eat or pocket his apples quickly, as ſhe wanted her bonnet, being in a great hurry to return to the cottage, from which ſhe had made a kind of ſtolen march. The apples were inſtantly committed to his pocket and he was permitted to tye on the bonnet. A depraved man might have miſinterpreted the gaiety of Adela, or at leaſt endeavoured to take advantage of it, but the ſacred impreſſion of virtue, which nature and education had ſtamped upon the heart of Oſcar, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delibly fixed, and he neither ſuſpected, nor for worlds would have attempted, injuring the innocence of Adela; he beheld her (in what indeed was a true light) as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle playful nymph, whoſe actions were the offspring of innocence.</p>
                     <p>"I aſſure you," exclaimed ſhe riſing, "I am very loath to quit this pleaſant ſeat, but if I make a much longer delay, I ſhall find the lady of the cottage in anxious expectation. "May I advance?" ſaid Oſcar, as he puſhed open the gate for her. "If you do," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, "the leaſt that will be ſaid from ſeeing us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is that we were in ſearch of each other the
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:038416_0116_1011E239ABD33530"/>
whole of the morning." "Well," cried, Oſcar, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this careleſs ſpeech, "and if they do ſay ſo, it would not be doing me injuſtice." "Adieu, adieu," ſaid ſhe, waving her hand, "not another word for a kingdom."</p>
                     <p>What a compound of beauty and giddineſs it is, thought Oſcar, watching her till ſhe entered the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. As he returned from the ſweet ſpot he met ſome labourers, from whom he enquired concerning its owner and learned ſhe was a reſpectable widow lady of the name of Marlowe.</p>
                     <p>On Oſcar's return from Enniſkellen, he heard from the officers that General Honeywood, an old veteran, who had a fine eſtate about fourteen miles from the town, was that morning to pay his compliments to them, and that cards had been left for a grand fete and ball, which he annually gave on the firſt of July, to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate one of the glorious victories of King William. Every perſon of any faſhion in and about the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was on ſuch occaſions ſure of an invitation, and the officers were pleaſed with theirs, as they had for ſome time wiſhed for an opportunity of ſeeing the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's daughter, who was very much admired.</p>
                     <p>The general, like a true veteran, retained an enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic attachment for the profeſſion of arms, to which not only the morning, but the meridian of his life had been devoted, and which he had not quitted till compelled by a debilitated conſtitution. Seated in his paternal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. he began to experience the want of a faithful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, who would heighten the enjoyments of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil hour, and ſoothe the infirmities of age; this want was ſoon ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ppled by his union with a young lady in the neighbourhood, whoſe only dowry was innocence and beauty; from the great diſparity of their ages, it was concluded ſhe had married for convenience, but the tenor of her conduct changed this opinion, by proving the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral poſſeſſed her tendereſt affections, a happier couple were not known; but this happineſs was terminated as ſuddenly as fatally by her death, which happened two years after the birth of her daughter; all the general's
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:038416_0117_1011E23B36B74B30"/>
love was then centered in her child. Many of the ladies in the neighbourhood, induced by the well known felicity his lady had enjoyed, or by the largeneſs of his fortune, made attempts to engage him again in matrimonial toils, but he ſought ſhy of them all, ſolemnly declaring, "he would never bring a ſtep mother over his dear girl." In her infancy ſhe was his plaything, and as ſhe grew up, his comfort; careſſed, flattered, adored, from her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſhe ſcarcely knew the meaning of harſhneſs and contradiction; a naturally ſweet diſpoſition, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending care of an excellent woman, prevented any pernicious effect from ſuch exceſſive indulgence as ſhe received; to diſguiſe, or duplicity, ſhe was a perfect ſtranger, her own feelings were never concealed, and others ſhe ſuppoſed equally ſincere in revealing theirs; true, the open avowal of her regard or contempt often incurred the imputation of imprudence, but had ſhe even heard of it, ſhe would only have laughed at it, for the general declared whatever ſhe ſaid was right, and her own heart aſſured her of the innocence of her intentions. As ſhe grew up the houſe again became the ſeat of gaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the General, though very infirm, felt his convivial ſpirit revive, he delighted in the ſociety of his friends, and could ſtill</p>

                     <p>Oſcar, actuated by an impulſe, which if he could, he, at leaſt, did not ſtrive to account for, continued daily to parade before the orchard, but without again ſeeing Adela.</p>
                     <p>At length the day for General Honeywood's entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment arrived, and the officers, accompanied by a large party, ſet off early for Woodlawn, the name of the General's ſeat; it was ſituated on the borders of the lake, where they found barges waiting to convey them to a ſmall iſland, which was the ſcene of the morning's amuſement; the breakfaſt was laid out amidſt the ruins of an ancient building, which, from the venerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of its gothic elegance, was moſt probably, in the days of religious enthuſiaſm, the ſeat of ſacred p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="119" facs="unknown:038416_0118_1011E23D07242000"/>
the old trees in groups formed a thick canopy over head, and the ivy that crept along the walls filled up many of the niches where the windows had formerly been; thoſe that ſtill remained open, by deſcending to the ground, afforded a moſt enchanting proſpect of the lake; the long ſucceſſion of arches which compoſed the body of the chapel, were in many places covered with creeping moſs, and ſcattered over with wall flowers, blue hair bells, and other ſpontaneous productions of nature, while between them were placed ſeats and breakfaſt tables, ornamented in a fanciful manner.</p>
                     <p>The officers experienced a moſt agreeable ſurpriſe on entering, but how inferior were their feelings to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations which Oſcar felt, when introduced with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the General to his daughter, he beheld in Miſs Honeywood the lovely Adela. She ſeemed to enjoy his ſurpriſe, and Mrs. Marlowe, from the oppoſite ſide of the table, beckoned him to her with an arch look; he flew round, and ſhe made room for him by herſelf: "Well, my friend," cried ſhe, "do you think you ſhall find the General's fruit as tempting as mine." "Ah!" exclaimed Oſcar, half ſighing half ſmiling, "heſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fruit, I fear which I can never hope to obtain." Adela's attention during breakfaſt was too much engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the company to allow her to notice Oſcar more than by a few haſty words and ſmiles. There being no dancing till the evening, the company, after breakfaſt diſperſed according to their various inclinations.</p>
                     <p>The iſland was diverſified with little acclivities, and ſcattered over with wild ſhrubs, which embalmed the air; temporary arbors of laurel, intermingled with lilies, were erected and laid out with fruits, ices, and other refreſhments; upon the edge of the water a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quee was pitched for the regimental band, which Colonel Belgrave had politely complimented the General with; a flag was hoiſted on it, and upon a low eminence a few ſmall field-pieces were mounted, attendants were every where diſperſed, dreſſed in white ſtreamers, ornamented with a profuſion of orange coloured ribbons, the boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were dreſſed in the ſame livery, and the barges, in
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:038416_0119_1011E241CA5439E0"/>
which ſeveral of the party were to viſit the other iſlands, made a pictureſque appearance with their gay ſtreamers, fluttering in the breeze; the muſic now ſoftly dying away upon the water, now gradually ſwelling on the breeze, and echoed back by the neighbouring hills, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the pleaſures of the ſcene.</p>
                     <p>Oſcar followed the ſteps of Adela, but at the very moment on which he ſaw her diſengaged from a large party, the General hallooed after him from a ſhady bank on which he ſat; Oſcar could not refuſe the ſummons, and as he approached, the general, extending his hand, gave him a cordial ſqueeze, and welcomed him as the ſon of a brave man he had once intimately known. "I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected the name of Fitzalan," ſaid he, "the moment I heard it mentioned, and had the happineſs of learning from colonel Belgrave I was not miſtaken in believing you to be the ſon of my old friend." He now made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inquiries concerning Fitzalan, and the affectionate manner in which he mentioned him was truly pleaſing to Oſcar. "He had once," he ſaid, "ſaved his life at the imminent danger of his own, and it was an obligation, while that life remained, he never could forget."</p>
                     <p>Like Don Guzman in Gil Blas, the general delighted in fighting over his battles, and now proceeded to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate many incidents which happened during the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can war, when he and Fitzalan ſerved in the ſame regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Oſcar could well have diſpenſed with ſuch an enumeration; but the General, who had no idea that he was not as much delighted in hearing as he was in ſpeaking, ſtill went on. Adela had been watching them for ſome time; her patience at length, like Oſcar's, being exhauſted, ſhe ran forward, and told her father" he muſt not detain him another minute, for they were going upon the lake, and you know papa," cried ſhe, "againſt we come back, you can have all your battles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged in proper form, though by the bye, I don't think it is the buſineſs of an old ſoldier to intimidate a young one with ſuch dreadful tales of iron wars." The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral called her a ſaucy baggage, kiſſed her with rapture, and ſaw her trip off with his young friend, who ſeized
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:038416_0120_1011E2435A81C440"/>
the favourable opportunity to engage her for the firſt ſet in the evening. About four the company aſſembled in the Abbey to dinner, the band played during the repaſt, the toaſts were proclaimed by ſound of trumpet, and anſwered by an immediate diſcharge from the Mount. At ſix the ladies returned to Woodlawn to change their dreſſes for the ball, and now
<q>
                           <l>"Awful beauty put on all its charms."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tea and coffee were ſerved in the reſpective rooms, and by eleven the ball-room was completely crowded with company, at once brilliant and lively, particularly the gentlemen, who were not a little elevated by the General's potent libations to the glorious memory of him whoſe victory they were celebrating.</p>
                     <p>Adela, adorned in a ſtile ſuperior to what Oſcar had yet ſeen, appeared more lovely than he had even firſt thought her; her dreſs, which was of thin muſlin ſpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, was ſo contrived as to give a kind of aerial light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to her figure. Oſcar reminded her of the promiſe of the morning at the very moment the Colonel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for the purpoſe of engaging her; ſhe inſtantly informed him of her engagement to Mr. Fitzalan. "Mr. Fitzalan!" repeated the Colonel, with the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty air of a man who thought he had reaſon to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; "he has been rather precipitate indeed, but though we may envy, who ſhall wonder at his anxiety to engage Miſs Honeywood."</p>
                     <p>Dancing now commenced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the elegant figure of Adela never appeared to greater advantage; the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported General watched every movement, and, "incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable by Jove!—what a ſweet angel ſhe is!" were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of admiration which involuntarily broke from him in the pride and fondneſs of his heart. Oſcar too, whoſe figure was remarkably fine, ſhared his admiration, and he declared to Colonel Belgrave he did not think the world could produce ſuch another couple; this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was by no means pleaſing to the Colonel; he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed as much vanity, perhaps, as ever fell to the ſhare
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:038416_0121_1011E245CA97C2F0"/>
of a young belle, conſcious of perfections, and deteſted the idea of having any competitor (at leaſt ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful one as Oſcar) in the good graces of the ladies. Adela having concluded the dance, complained of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and retired to an alcove, whither Oſcar followed her; the window commanded a view of the lake, the little iſland and the ruined abbey; the moon, in full ſplendor, caſt her ſilvery light over all thoſe objects, giving a ſoftneſs to the landſcape even more pleaſing than the glowing charms it had derived from the radian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of day. Adela in dancing had dropped the bandeau from her hair, Oſcar took it up, and ſtill retained it; Adela now ſtretched forth her hand to take it; "Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me," cried he, gently-taking her hand, "to keep it; to-morrow you would caſt it away as a trifle, but I would treaſure it as a relique of ineſtimable value; let me have ſome memento of the charming hours! have paſſed to-day." "Oh! a truce," ſaid Adela, "with ſuch expreſſions, (who did not, however, oppoſe his put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her bandeau in his boſom) they are quite common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and have already been repeated to hundreds, and will again, I make no doubt."—"This is your opinion."—"Yes, really."—"Oh! would to heaven," exclaimed Oſcar, "I durſt convince you how miſtaken a one it is." Adela, laughing, aſſured him that would be a difficult matter. Oſcar grew penſive; "I think," cried he, if oppreſſed by misfortune, I ſhould of all places on earth like a ſecluſion in the old Abbey." "Why, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly," ſaid Adela, "it is tolerably calculated for an her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, and if you take a ſolitary whim, I beg I may be apprized of it in time, as I ſhould receive peculiar pleaſure in preparing your moſſy couch and frugal fare." "The reaſon for my liking it," replied he, "would be the proſpect I ſhould have from it of Woodlawn."—"And does Woodlawn," aſked Adela, "contain ſuch particular charms, as to render a view of it ſo very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful?"</p>
                     <p>At this moment they were ſummoned to call a new dance, a ſummons, perhaps, not agreeable to either, as it interrupted an intereſting tete-a-tete. The Colonel
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:038416_0122_1011E249229948D8"/>
engaged Adela for the next ſet; and though Oſcar had no inclination to dance, to avoid particularity, he ſtood up with a young lady who was eſteemed extremely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Adela, as if fatigued, no longer moved with animation, and ſuddenly interrupted the Colonel in a gallant ſpeech he was making her, to inquire "if he thought Miſs O Neal (Oſcar's partner) pretty—ſo very pretty as ſhe was generally thought?" the Colonel was too keen not to diſcover at once the motive which ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted this inquiry. "Why, faith, cried he, after examining Miſs O'Neal ſome minutes through an opera glaſs, "the girl has charms, but ſo totally eclipſed at preſent, (looking languiſhingly at Adela) in my eyes, that I cannot do them the juſtice they may perhaps me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Fitzalan, however, by the homage he pays her, ſeems as if he would make up for the deficiency of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other perſon." Adela turned pale, and took the firſt opportunity of demanding her bandeau from Oſcar: he, ſmiling, refuſed it, declaring it was a trophy of the happineſs he had enjoyed that day, and that the General ſhould have informed her a ſoldier never relinquiſhed ſuch a glorious memento." "Reſign mine," replied Adela, "and procure one from Miſs O'Neal."—"No!" cried he, "I would not pay her charms and my own ſincerity ſo bad a compliment, as to aſk what I ſhould not in the leaſt degree value." Adela's ſpirits reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhe repeated her requeſt no more.</p>
                     <p>The dancing continued after ſupper, with little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, till ſeven, when the company repaired to the ſaloon to breakfaſt, after which they diſperſed. The General particularly and affectionately bid Oſcar fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and charged him to conſider Woodlawn as his head quarters. "Be aſſured" ſaid the good natured old man, "the ſon of my brave, worthy and long reſpected friend, will ever be valuable to my heart and welcome to my home; and would to heaven, in the calm evening of life, your father and I had pitched our tents nearer each other."</p>
                     <p>From this period Oſcar became almoſt an inmate of his houſe, and the general ſhortly grew ſo attached to
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:038416_0123_1011E24AAEF85A60"/>
him, that he felt unhappy if deprived of his ſociety; the attentions he received from Oſcar were ſuch as an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate ſon would pay a tender father, he ſupported his venerable friend whenever he attempted to walk, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in all the excurſions he made about his domain, read to him when he wanted to be lulled to ſleep, and lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, without betraying any ſymptoms of fatigue, to his long, and often truly tireſome ſtories of former battles and campaigns; in paying theſe attentions Oſcar obeyed the dictates of gratitude and eſteem, and alſo gratified a benevolent diſpoſition, happy in being able

The confidence which he thought the general repoſed in him, by allowing ſuch an intercourſe with his daughter, was too ſacred in his eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be abuſed, but though honour reſiſted, his health yielded to his feelings.</p>
                     <p>Adela, from delighting in company, ſuddenly took a penſive turn; ſhe declined the conſtant ſociety ſhe had hither to kept up, and ſeemed in a ſolitary ramble with Oſcar to enjoy more pleaſure than the gayeſt party ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to afford her, the favourite ſpot they viſited almoſt every evening, was a path on the margin of the lake, at the foot of a woody mountain; here often ſeated, they viewed the ſun ſinking behind the oppoſite hills, and while they enjoyed the benignancy of his departing

beams, beheld him tinge the trembling waves with gold and purple; the low whiſtle of the ploughman returning to his humble cottage, the plaintive coral of birds from the adjacent grove, and the low bleating of cattle from paſtures which ſwelled above the water, all theſe, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoftneſs and moſt pleaſing charms of nature to the hour, contrived to touch yet more ſenſibly, hearts alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prepoſſeſſed in favour of each other. Adela would ſometimes ſing a little ſimple air, and careleſſly leaning on the arm of Oſcar, appear to enjoy perfect felicity; not ſo poor Oſcar, the feelings of his ſoul at theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments trembled on his lips, and to repreſs them was great agony.</p>
                     <p>An incident ſoon occurred which endeared him yet more to the General; driving one day in a low phaeton along a road cut over a mountain, the horſes, frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſudden firing from the lake, began rearing in a moſt frightful manner; the carriage ſtood near a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous precipice, and the ſervants, appalled by terror, had not power to move. Oſcar ſaw that nothing but an effort of deſperate reſolution could keep them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, he leaped out, and ruſhing before the horſes, ſeized their heads at the imminent hazard of being tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled down the precipice, on whoſe very verge he ſtood; the ſervants, a little relieved from their terror, haſtened to his aſſiſtance, the traces were cut, and the poor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whoſe infirmities had weakened his ſpirits, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed home in almoſt a ſtate of inſenſibility. Adela, perceiving him from her dreſſing room window, flew down, and, learned his danger, fell upon his neck in an agony of mingled joy and terror; her careſſes ſoon revived him, and as he returned them, his eyes eagerly ſought his deliverer. Oſcar ſtood near, with mingled tenderneſs and anxiety in his looks, the General took his hand, and whilſt he preſſed it along with Adela's to his boſom, tears fell on them.—"You are both my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren!" he exclaimed; "the children of my love, and from your felicity I muſt derive mine." This expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Oſcar conceived to be a mere effuſion of gratitude,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:038416_0125_1011E24ED8C06918"/>
little thinking what a project relative to him had entered the general's head, who had firſt, however, conſulted and learned from his daughter it would be agreeable to her. This generous, ſome will ſay romantic, old man, felt for Oſcar the moſt unbounded love and gratitude, and as the beſt proof of this he reſolved to beſtow on this young ſoldier his rich and lovely heireſs, who had acknowledged to her father her predilection for him. He knew both his birth to be noble, his diſpoſition amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and his ſpirit brave; beſides, by this union he ſhould ſecure the ſociety of Adela; he wiſhed her married, yet dreaded, whenever that event took place, he ſhould be deprived of her, but Oſcar, he ſuppoſed, bound to him by gratitude, would, unlike others, accede to his wiſhes of reſiding at Woodlawn during his lifetime; his project he reſolved on communicating to Colonel Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, whom, on Oſcar's account he regarded, as Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car had ſaid (what indeed he believed) that he was partly indebted to him for his commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>What a thunder ſtroke was this to Belgrave, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Woodlawn the morning after the reſolution was finally ſettled, and was aſked to accompany the General, about a little buſineſs, to the ſummer houſe in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; poor Oſcar trembled, he felt a preſentiment he ſhould be the ſubject of diſcourſe, and had no doubt but the General meant to complain to colonel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Colonel was indeed in a ſtate of torture; he had long meditated the conqueſt of Adela, whoſe fortune and beauty rendered her a truly deſirable object, to reſign her without one effort of circumventing Oſcar, was not to be thought of, to blaſt his promiſed joys, even if it did not lead to the accompliſhment of his own wiſhes, he felt would give him ſome comfort, and he reſolved to leave no means untried for ſo doing.</p>

                     <p>"WELL, Colonel," ſaid Oſcar, "I fancy I was not miſtaken in thinking the General wanted to ſpeak with you concerning me, I am convinced you will not conceal any particulars of a converſation it may be ſo eſſential to my honour to hear." "Why, faith," cried the Colonel, delighted to commence his operations, "he was making a kind of complaint about you, though he acknowledges you a brave lad, yet hang him, he has not generoſity enough to reward that bravery with his daughter, or any of his treaſure." "Heaven is my witneſs!" exclaimed the unſuſpicious Oſcar, "I never aſpired to either; I always knew my paſſion for his daughter as hopeleſs as fervent, and my eſteem for him as diſintereſted as ſincere; I would have ſooner died than abuſed the confidence he repoſed in me by revealing my attachment; I ſee, however, in future I muſt be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile to Woodlawn." "Not ſo, neither," replied the Colonel, "only avoid ſuch particularity to the girl: I believe in my ſoul ſhe has more pride than ſuſceptibility in her nature; in your next viſit, therefore, which for that purpoſe I would have you ſoon make, declare, in a cavalier manner, your affections were engaged previous to your coming to Ireland, this declaration will ſet all to rights with the General, he will no longer dread you on his daughter's account, you will be as welcome as ever to Woodlawn, and enjoy, during your continuance in the country, the ſociety you have hitherto been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:038416_0128_1011E257F883C9E8"/>
to." "No," ſaid Oſcar, "I cannot aſſert ſo great a falſhood." "How ridiculus," replied the Colonel: "for heaven's ſake, my dear boy, drop ſuch romantic notions; I ſhould be the laſt man in the world to deſire you to invent a falſhood which could injure any one, but no prieſt in chriſtendom would blame you for this." "And ſuppoſe I venture, what will it do, but bind faſter round my heart chains already too galling, and deſtroy in the end all remains of peace."</p>
                     <p>"Faith, Fitzalan," ſaid the Colonel, "by the time you have had a few more love affairs with ſome of the pretty girls of this kingdom, you will talk no more in this way; conſider (and be not too ſcrupulous) how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable it will be to reſign the General's friendſhip, and the pleaſing ſociety you enjoyed at Woodlawn; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it will appear ſtrange to thoſe who knew your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intimacy; in honour too you are bound to do as I deſire you, for ſhould the girl have been imprudent enough to conceive an attachment for you, this will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly remove it, for pride would not allow its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance after hearing of a favourite rival, and the General will be eſſentially ſerved." "My dear Colonel," ſaid Oſcar, his eyes ſuddenly ſparkling, "do you think ſhe has been imprudent enough to conceive a partiality for me?" "I am ſure," ſaid the Colonel, "that is a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I cannot poſitively anſwer; but to give my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I think from her gay, unembarraſſed manner, ſhe has not." "I ſuppoſe not, indeed," cried Oſcar, mournfully ſighing, "why then ſhould I be guilty of a falſhood for a perſon who is already indifferent to me." "I have told you my reaſon," replied the Colonel cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "do as you pleaſe." They were now both ſilent, but the converſation was ſoon renewed, and many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments paſſed on both ſides. Oſcar's heart ſecretly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Colonel's plan, as it promiſed the indulgence of Adela's ſociety; to be an exile from Woodlawn was inſupportable to his thoughts, reaſon yielded to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of paſſion, and he at laſt fell into the ſnare the perfidious Belgrave had ſpread, thus, by a deviation
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:038416_0129_1011E25A6C8078A8"/>
from truth, forfeiting the bleſſing a bounteous provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had prepared for him.</p>
                     <p>Oh! never let the child of integrity be ſeduced from the plain and undeviating path of ſincerity; oh! never let him hope by illicit means to attain a real pleaſure, the hope of obtaining any good through ſuch means will, like a meteor of the night, allure but to deceive.</p>
                     <p>Soon after his fatal promiſe to the Colonel, a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoted victim, he accompanied him to Woodlawn, on their arrival Miſs Honeywood was in the garden, and Oſcar trembling went to ſeek her, he found her ſitting in a flower-woven arbour,
<q>
                           <l>Herſelf the faireſt flower.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Never had ſhe looked more lovely, the natural bloom of her cheeks was heightened by the heat, and glowed beneath the careleſs curls that fell over them, and her eyes, the moment ſhe beheld Oſcar, beamed with the ſofteſt tenderneſs, the moſt bewitching ſenſibility. "My dear! dear Fitzalan!" cried ſhe, throwing aſide the book ſhe had been reading, and extending her hand, "I am glad to ſee you, I hope you are come to take up your reſidence for ſome time at Woodlawn." "You hope," repeated Oſcar mournfully. "I do indeed! but bleſs me what is the matter, you are ſo pale and thin, you look but the ſhadow of yourſelf, or rather like a deſpairing ſhepherd, ready to hang himſelf, on the firſt willow tree he meets." "I am indeed unhappy! cried Oſcar, "Nor will you wonder at my being ſo when I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I at this preſent time feel a paſſion which I muſt believe hopeleſs." "Hopeleſs! well now I inſiſt on being your confidant, and then (ſmiling ſomewhat archly) I ſhall ſee what reaſon you have to deſpair." "Agreed," exclaimed Oſcar; "and now to my ſtory," then pauſing a minute, he ſtarted up "no," continued he, "I find it impoſſible to tell it—let this dear, this eſtimable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, drawing a miniature of his ſiſter from his boſom, ſpeak for me, and declare, whether he who loves ſuch a being can ever loſe that love, or help being wretched at knowing it is without hope." Adela ſnatched it haſtily
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:038416_0130_1011E25CEB44F720"/>
from him, and by a ſudden ſtart betrayed her ſurpriſe; words indeed are inadequate to expreſs her heart-rending emotions as ſhe contemplated the beautiful countenance of her imaginary rival; and was Oſcar then—that Oſcar whom ſhe adored—whoſe happineſs ſhe had hoped to conſtitute—whoſe fortune ſhe delighted to think ſhe ſhould advance—really attached to another; alas! too true he was—of the attachment ſhe held a convincing proof in her hand; ſhe examined it again and again, and in its mild beauties thought ſhe beheld a ſtriking proof of the ſuperiority over the charms ſhe herſelf poſſeſſed; the roſes forſook her cheeks, a miſt overſpread her eyes, and with a ſhivering horror ſhe dropped it from her hand. Oſcar had quitted the arbour to conceal his agonies. "Well," ſaid he, now returning, with forced calmneſs, "is it not worthy of inſpiring the paſſion I feel?" Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to anſwer him, ſhe could only point to the place where it lay, and haſtened to the houſe. "Sweet image," cried Oſcar, taking it from the ground, "what an unworthy purpoſe have I made you anſwer—alas! all is now over—Adela—my Adela!—is loſt for ever—loſt—ah heavens! had I ever hopes of poſſeſſing her—oh no! to ſuch happineſs never did I dare to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward." Adela, on reaching the parlour which opened into the garden, found her father there: "Ah! you lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle baggage, do I not deſerve a kiſs for not diſturbing your tete-a tete? Where is that young rogue, Fitza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan?" "I beg, I entreat, Sir," ſaid Adela, whoſe tears could no longer be reſtrained, "you will never mention him again to me, too much has already been ſaid about him." "Nay, pr'ythe, my little girl," exclaimed the General, regarding her with ſurpriſe, "ceaſe thy ſighs and tears, and tell me what's the matter." "I am hurt," replied ſhe, in a voice ſcarcely articulate, "that ſo much has been ſaid about Mr. Fitzalan, who I can never regard in any other light than that of a common acquaintance." The Colonel, who had purpoſely lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered about the wood, now entered. Adela ſtarted, and precipitately retreated through another door:—"Faith, my dear Colonel," ſaid the general, "I am
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:038416_0131_1011E25E777C0A60"/>
glad you are come, the boy and girl have had a little ſkirmiſh, but, like other love quarrels, I ſuppoſe it will ſoon be made up, ſo let me know how the lad bore the announcement of his good fortune." "It fills a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al mind with regret," exclaimed the Colonel, ſeating himſelf gravely, and inwardly rejoicing at the ſucceſs of his ſtratagem, "to find ſuch a fatality prevalent among mankind, as makes them reject a proffered good and ſigh for that which is unattainable: like wayward children neglecting their ſports to purſue a rainbow, and weeping as the airy pageant mocks their graſp." "Very true, indeed," ſaid the General, "very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent upon my word; I doubt if the chaplain of a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ever delivered ſuch a pretty piece of morality; but dear Colonel," laying his hand on his knee, "what did the boy ſay?" "I am ſorry, Sir," he replied, that what I have juſt ſaid is ſo applicable to him; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the lady's merit, extolled her generoſity, but pleaded a prior attachment againſt accepting your offer, which even one more exalted would not tempt him to forego, though he knows not whether he will ever ſucceed in it." "The devil he did!" exclaimed the General, as ſoon as rage and ſurpriſe would allow him to ſpeak, the little impertinent puppy! the ungrateful young dog! a prior attachment—reject my girl—my Adela—who has had ſuch ſuitors already: ſo, I ſuppoſe I ſhall have the whole affair blazed about the country; I ſhall hear from every quarter how my daughter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and by whom?—why, by a little Enſign, whoſe whole fortune lies in his ſword knot—A fine game I have played, truly; but if the jackanapes opens his lips about the matter, may powder be my poiſon if I do not trim his jacket for him!" "Dear General," ſaid the Colonel, "you may depend on his honour, but even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he did mention the affair, ſurely you ſhould know it would not be in his power to injure Miſs Honeywood—amiable—accompliſhed—in ſhort, poſſeſſed, as ſhe is, of every perfection, I know men, at leaſt one man, of conſequence, both from birth and fortune, who has long ſighed for her, and who would, if he received the leaſt
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:038416_0132_1011E260E3AFC1E8"/>
encouragement, openly avow his ſentiments." "Well," cried the general, ſtill panting for breath, "we will talk about him at ſome future time, for I am reſolved on ſoon having my little girl married, and to her own liking too."</p>

                     <p>The general was a ſtranger to diſſimulation, and as he had no longer felt, he no longer treated Oſcar with uſual kindneſs; when pale, trembling, and diſordered, he appeared before him, he received him with a ſtern frown, an air ſcarcely complaiſant; this increaſed the agitation of Oſcar, every feeling of his ſoul was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion he was no longer the life of the company, their happineſs and mirth formed a ſtriking contraſt to his miſery and dejection, he felt a forlorn wretch, a mere child of ſorrow and dependence; ſcalding tears drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from him a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

noticed; in loſing the general's attention he ſeemed to loſe that of his gueſts, his ſituation grew too irkſome to be borne, he roſe unregarded, and a ſecret impulſe led him to the drawing room. Here Adela oppreſſed by the dejection of her ſpirits, had flung herſelf upon a couch, and gradually ſunk into a ſlumber: Oſcar ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped lightly forward and gazed on her with a tenderneſs as exquiſite as a mother would have felt in viewing her ſleeping babe; her cheek, which reſted on her fair hand, was tinged with a bluſh, by the reflection of a crimſon curtain through which the ſun darted, and the traces of a tear was yet diſcernable upon it. "Never!" cried Oſcar, with folded hands, as he hung over the intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing figure, "never may any tear, except that of ſoft ſenſibility for the woes of others, bedew the cheek of Adela—perfect as her goodneſs be her felicity—may every bleſſing ſhe now enjoys be rendered permanent by that power who ſmiles benignly upon innocence like hers.—Oh! Adela, he who now prays for your felicity never will loſe your idea, he will cheriſh it in his heart, to meliorate his ſorrows, and, from the dreary path which may be appointed for him to tread, ſometimes look back to happier ſcenes." Adela began to ſtir, ſhe murmured out ſome inarticulate words, and, ſuddenly riſing from the couch, beheld the motionleſs form of Fitzalan; haughtily regarding him, ſhe aſked the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch an intruſion. "I did not mean indeed to intrude," "ſaid he, "but when I came and found you, can you wonder at my being faſcinated to the ſpot?" The plaintive tone of his voice ſunk deep into Adela's heart, ſhe ſighed heavily, and turning away ſeated her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a window. Oſcar followed; he forgot the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he had aſſumed in the morning, and gently ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hand, preſſed it to his boſom; at this critical minute, when mutual ſympathy appeared on the point of triumphing over duplicity, the door opened, and Colonel Belgrave appeared; from the inſtant of Oſcar's departure he had been on thorns to follow him, fearful of the conſequences of a tete-a-tete, and was attended by the reſt of the gentlemen.</p>

Oſcar was determined on not ſtaying another night at Woodlawn, and declared his intention by aſking Colonel Belgrave if he had any commands for Enniſkellen, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Why hang it boy," cried the General, in a rough grumbling voice, "ſince you have ſtaid ſo long, you may as well ſtay the night, the clouds look heavy over the lake, and threaten a ſtorm." "No, Sir!" ſaid Oſcar, colouring and ſpeaking in the agitation of his heart, "the raging of a tempeſt would not make me ſtay. Adela ſighed, but pride prevented her ſpeaking. Fitzalan approached her—"Miſs Honeywood," ſaid he—he ſtopped—his voice was quite ſtifled. Adela, equally unable to ſpeak, could only encourage him to proceed by a mild glance.

"My Adela," he exclaimed extending his arms as if ſhe could have heard and flown into them, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedly dropping them, "ſhe thinks not on ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn wretch at me, oh! what comfort to lay my poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted head for one moment on her ſoft boſom, and hear her ſweet voice ſpeak pity to my tortured heart."

protects the unſheltered head of the ſoldier, and afflicted. The twittering of the birds rouſed him from an uneaſy ſlumber, or rather lethargy, into which he had fallen, and ſtarting up, he haſtened to the road, fearful, as day was beginning to dawn, of being ſeen by any of General Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neywood's workmen: it was late ere he arrived at En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſkellen, and before he gained his room he was met by ſome of the officers, who viewed him with evident aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; his regimentals were quite ſpoiled, his fine hair, from which the rain had waſhed all the powder, hung diſhevelled about his ſhoulders, the feather of his hat was broken, and the diſorder of his countenance was not leſs ſuſpicious than that of his dreſs; to their inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he ſtammered out ſomething of a fall, and extricated himſelf with difficulty from them.</p>
                     <p>In an obſcure village, fifteen miles from Enniſkellen, a detachment of the regiment lay, the officer who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it diſliked his ſituation extrmely, but company being irkſome to Oſcar it was juſt ſuch a one as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and he obtained leave to relieve him; the agitation of his mind aided by the affects of the ſtorm he had been expoſed to, was too much for his conſtitution: immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately on arriving at his new quarters he was ſeized with a violent fever, an officer was obliged to be ſent to do duty in his place, and it was long ere any ſymptom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared which could flatter thoſe who attended him with hopes of recovery; when able to ſit up he was ordered to return to Enniſkellen, where he could be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the care of the regimental ſurgeon.</p>
                     <p>Oſcar's ſervant accompanied him in the carriage, and as it drove ſlowly along he was agreeably ſurpriſed by a view of Mrs. Marlowe's orchard, he could not reſiſt the wiſh of ſeeing her and making inquiries relative to the inhabitants of Woodlawn: for with Mrs. Marlowe, I ſhould previouſly ſay, he had not only formed an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but a ſincere friendſhip; ſhe was a woman of the moſt pleaſing manners, and to her ſuperintending care Adela was indebted for many of the graces ſhe poſſeſſed
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:038416_0137_1011E26C0B12DAA8"/>
and at her cottage paſſed many delightful hours with Oſcar.</p>
                     <p>The evening was far advanced when Oſcar reached the orchard, and leaning on his ſervant ſlowly walked up the hill; had a ſpectre appeared before the old lady ſhe could not have ſeemed more ſhocked than ſhe now did at the unexpected and emaciated appearance of her young friend—with all the tenderneſs of a fond mother, ſhe preſſed his cold hands between her own, and ſeated him by the cheerful fire which blazed on her hearth, then procured him refreſhments that, joined to her converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a little revied his ſpirits; yet, at this moment the recollection of the firſt interview he ever had with her, recurred with pain to his heart: "our friends at Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawn I hope—" cried he, he pauſed—but his eyes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the inquiry his tongue was unable to make.—"They are well and happy," replied Mrs. Marlowe, "and you know, I ſuppoſe, of all that has lately happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there." "No, I know nothing. I am as one awoke from the ſlumbers of the grave." "Ere I inform you then," cried Mrs. Marlowe, "let me, my noble Oſcar, expreſs my approbation, my admiration, of your conduct, of that diſintereſted nature which preferred the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſtancy to the ſplendid independency offered to your acceptance." "What ſplendid independency did I refuſe?" aſked Oſcar, wildly ſtaring at her. "That which the General offered." "The General!" "Yes, and appointed Colonel Belgrave to declare his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions." "Oh heavens!" exclaimed Oſcar ſtarting from his chair, "did the General indeed form ſuch intentions, and has Belgrave then deceived me, he told me my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Miſs Honeywood were noticed and diſliked—he filled my ſoul with unutterable anguiſh, and perſuaded me to a falſhood which has plunged me into deſpair!" "He is a monſter," cried Mrs. Marlowe, "and you are a victim to his treachery." "Oh no! I will fly to the General and open my whole ſoul to him, at his feet I will declare the falſe ideas of honor which miſled me, I ſhall obtain his forgiveneſs, and Adela will yet be mine." "Alas! my child," ſaid Mrs. Marlowe, ſtopping him
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:038416_0138_1011E26EA891F4B0"/>
as he was hurrying from the room, "it is now too late, Adela can never be yours, ſhe is married, and married unto Belgrave." Oſcar ſtaggered back a few paces, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a deep groan, and fell ſenſeleſs at her feet. Mrs. Marlowe's cries brought in his ſervant as well as her own to his aſſiſtance, he was laid upon a bed, but it was long ere he ſhewed any ſigns of recovery; at length opening his heavy eyes, he ſighed deeply, and exclaimed, "ſhe is loſt to me for ever!"</p>
                     <p>The ſervants were diſmiſſed and the tender hearted Mrs. Marlowe knelt beſide him. "Oh! my friend," ſaid ſhe, "my heart ſympathizes in your ſorrow, but 'tis from your own fortitude, more than my ſympathy, you muſt now derive reſources of ſupport." "Oh hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible! to know the cup of happineſs was at my lips, and that it was my own hand daſhed it from me." "Such, alas!" ſaid Mrs. Marlowe, ſighing as if touched at the moment with a ſimilar pang of ſelf regret, "is the waywardneſs of mortals; too often do they deprive themſelves of the bleſſings of a bounteous providence by their own folly and imprudence—oh! my friend, born as you were, with a noble ingenuity of ſoul, never let that ſoul again be ſullied by the ſmalleſt deviation from ſincerity." "Do not aggravate my ſufferings," ſaid Oſcar, "by dwelling on my error." "No—I would ſooner die than be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch barbarity; but admonition never ſinks ſo deeply on the heart as in the hour of trial; young, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as you are, life teems, I doubt not, with various bleſſings for you—bleſſings which you will know how to value properly, for early diſappointment is the nurſe of wiſdom." "Alas!" exclaimed he, "what bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" "Thoſe at leaſt," cried Mrs. Marlowe, "are in your power, the peace, the happineſs, which ever proceeds from a mind conſcious of having diſcharged the incumbent duties of life, and patiently ſubmitted to its trials." "But do you think I will calmly ſubmit to his baſeneſs?" ſaid Oſcar, interrupting her, "No! Belgrave ſhall never triumph over me with impunity!" He ſtarted from the bed, and ruſhing into the outer room, ſnatched <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="140" facs="unknown:038416_0139_1011E270DE356600"/>
had flung it at his entrance: Mrs. Marlowe caught his arm, "raſh young man!" exclaimed ſhe, "whither would you go—is it to ſcatter ruin and deſolation around you? Suppoſe your vengeance was gratified, would that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore your happineſs?

                     <p>Mrs. Marlowe ſeized this moment of yielding ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to adviſe and reaſon with him, her tears mingled with his, as ſhe liſtened to his relation of Belgrave's perfidy; tears augmented by reflecting, that Adela, the darling of her care and her affections, was alſo a victim to it; ſhe convinced Oſcar, however, that it would be prudent to confine the fatal ſecret to their own breaſts; the agitation of his mind was too much for the weak ſtate of his health, the fever returned and he felt unable to quit the cottage: Mrs. Marlowe prepared a bed for him, truſting he would ſoon be able to remove, but ſhe was diſappointed, it was long ere Oſcar could quit the bed of ſickneſs: ſhe watched over him with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal tenderneſs, while he like a blaſted flower, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed haſtening to decay.</p>
                     <p>The General was ſtung to the ſoul by the rejection of his offer, which he thought would have inſpired the ſoul of Oſcar with rapture and gratitude; never had his pride been ſo ſeverely wounded, never before had he felt humbled in his own eyes: his mortifying reflections the Colonel ſoon found means to remove, by the moſt delicate flattery and the moſt aſſiduous attention, aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general that his conduct merited not the cenſure, but the applauſe of the world: the ſophiſtry which can reconcile us to ourſelves is truly pleaſing, the colonel

gradually became a favourite, and when he inſinuated his attachment for Adela, was aſſured he ſhould have all the General's intereſt with her; he was now more anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than ever to have her advantageouſly ſettled, there was ſomething ſo humiliating in the idea of her being rejected, that it drove him at times almoſt to madneſs: the colonel poſſeſſed all the advantages of fortune, but theſe weighed little in his favor with the general, (whoſe notions we have already proved very diſintereſted) and much leſs with his daughter; on the firſt overture about him ſhe requeſted the ſubject might be entirely dropped, the mention of love was extremely painful to her; wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her diſappointment, in the ſevereſt manner, her heart required time to heal it, her feelings delicacy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to her own boſom, but her languid eyes and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cheeks, denoted their poignancy; ſhe avoided compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and was perpetually wandering through the roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and ſolitary paths which ſhe and Oſcar had trod toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; here more than ever ſhe thought of him, and feared ſhe had treated her poor companion unkindly, ſhe ſaw him oppreſſed with ſadneſs, and yet ſhe had driven him from her by the repulſive coldneſs of her manner; a manner too, which, from its being ſo ſuddenly aſſumed, could not fail of conveying an idea of her diſappointment; this hurt her delicacy as much as her tenderneſs, and ſhe would have given worlds, had ſhe poſſeſſed them, to recall the time when ſhe could have afforded conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Oſcar, and convinced him, that ſolely as a friend ſhe regarded him. The colonel was not diſcouraged by her coldneſs—he was in the habit of conquering dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and doubted not he ſhould overcome any ſhe threw in his way; he ſometimes, as if by chance, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to meet her in her rambles, his converſation was always amuſing, and confined within the limits ſhe had preſcribed, but his eyes, by the tendereſt expreſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the pain he ſuffered from this preſcription, and ſecretly pleaſed Adela, as it convinced her of the impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit deference he paid to her will.</p>
                     <p>Some weeks had elapſed ſince Oſcar's voluntary exile from Woodlawn, and ſanguine as were the colonel's

hopes, he found without a ſtratagem they would not be realized (at leaſt as ſoon as he expected): fertile in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, he was not long in concerting one; he followed Adela one morning into the garden, and ſound her reading in the arbour; ſhe laid aſide the book at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and they chatted for ſome time on indifferent ſubjects; the colonel's ſervant at laſt appeared with a large pacquet of letters, which he preſented to his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who, with an heſitating air, was about putting them into his pocket, when Adela prevented him; "make no ceremony colonel," ſaid ſhe, "with me, I ſhall reſume my book till you have peruſed your letters; the colonel bowed for her permiſſion, and began: her attention was ſoon drawn from her book by the ſudden emotion he betrayed—he ſtarted, and exclaimed, "Oh heavens! what a wretch!" then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if ſuddenly recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting his ſituation, looked at Adela, appeared confuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtammered out a few inarticulate words, and reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his letter; when finiſhed, he ſeemed to put it into his pocket, but in reality dropped it at his feet for the baſeſt purpoſe; he ran over the remainder of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and riſing, entreated Adela to excuſe his leaving her ſo abruptly, to anſwer ſome of them; ſoon after his departure Adela perceived an open letter lying at her feet, ſhe immediately took it up with an intention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the houſe with it, when the ſight of her own name, in capital letters, and the well known hand of Fitzalan, ſtruck her ſight, ſhe threw the letter on a table, an univerſal; tremor ſeized her, ſhe would have given any conſideration to know why ſhe was mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a correſpondence between Belgrave and Fitzalan, her eye involuntarily glanced at the letter, ſhe ſaw ſome words in it which excited ſtill more ſtrongly her curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, it could no longer be repreſſed, ſhe ſnatched it up, and read as follows:</p>

I merit, but why, becauſe, I have been too ſuſceptible to thoſe of another, which, in the fond eſtimation of a lover, (at leaſt) appear infinitely ſuperior. The General's offer was certainly a moſt generous and flattering one, and has gratified every feeling of my ſoul, by giving me an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſacrificing at the ſhrine of love, ambition, and ſelf-interſt; my diſintereſted conduct has confirmed me in the affections of my dear girl, whoſe vanity I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help thinking a little elevated by the triumph I have told her ſhe obtained over Adela; but this is excuſable indeed when we conſider the object I relinquiſhed for her. Would to heaven the General was propitious to your wiſhes, it would yield me much happineſs to ſee you, my firſt and beſt friend, in poſſeſſion of a treaſure you have long ſighed for; I ſhall, no doubt, receive a long lecture from you for letting the affair relative to Adela be known, but faith I could not reſiſt telling my charmer; heaven grant diſcretion may ſeal her lips, if not, I ſuppoſe I ſhall be ſummoned to a formidable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with the old General.

                     <p>"Wretch!" cried the agitated Adela, dropping the letter (which it is ſcarce neceſſary to ſay was an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous forgery) in an agony of greif and indignation, "is this the baſe return we meet for our wiſhes to raiſe you to proſperity; oh! cruel Fitzalan, is it Adela, who thought you ſo amiable, and who never thoroughly valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wealth till ſhe believed it had given her the power of conducing to your felicity, whom you hold up as an object of ridicule, for unfeeling vanity to triumph over." Wounded pride and tenderneſs raiſed a whirl of contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſions in her breaſt, ſhe ſunk upon the bench, her head reſted on her hand, and ſighs, and tears burſt from her: ſhe now reſolved to inform Fitzalan ſhe knew the baſeneſs of his conduct, and ſting his heart with keen reproaches, now reſolved to paſs it over in ſilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; while thus fluctuating the Colonel ſoftly advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and ſtood before her, in the tumult of her mind ſhe had quite forgot the probability of his returning, and involuntarily ſcreamed and ſtarted at his appearance; by her confuſion ſhe doubted not but he would ſuſpect her of having peruſed the fatal letter; oppreſſed by the idea, her head ſunk on her boſom, and her face was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with bluſhes. "What a careleſs fellow I am," ſaid the Colonel, taking up the letter, which he then pretended to perceive, he glanced at Adela, "curſe it!" continued he, "I would rather have had all the letters read than this one." He ſuſpects me, thought Adela, her bluſhes faded, and ſhe fell back on her ſeat, unable to ſupport the oppreſſive idea of having acted againſt the rules of propriety. Belgrave flew to ſupport her, "lovelieſt of women," he exclaimed, with all the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he could aſſume, "what means this agitation?" "I have been ſuddenly affected," anſwered Adela, a little recovering, and riſing, ſhe motioned to return to the houſe. "Thus," reſumed the Cononel, "you always fly me, but go, Miſs Honeywood, I have no right, no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, indeed to detain you, yet, be aſſured," and he ſummoned a tear to his aid, while he preſſed her hand to his boſom, "a heart more truly devoted to you than mine, you can never meet; but I ſee the ſubject is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and again I reſume the rigid ſilence you have impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on me; go then, moſt lovely, and beloved, and ſince I dare not aſpire to a higher, allow me, at leaſt, the title of your friend" "Moſt willingly," ſaid Adela, penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his gentleneſs; ſhe was now tolerably recovered, and he prevailed on her to walk inſtead of returning to the houſe: ſhe felt ſoothed by his attention, his inſiduous tongue dropped man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Colonel was too penetrating not to diſcover her ſentiments, and too artful not to take advantage of them; had Adela indeed obeyed the real
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:038416_0144_1011E27DE73406A8"/>
feelings of her heart ſhe would have declared againſt marrying, but pride urged her to a ſtep which would prove to Fitzalan his conduct had not affected her; the General rejoiced at obtaining her conſent, and received a promiſe that for ſome time ſhe ſhould not be ſeparated from him. The moſt ſplendid preparations were made for the nuptials, but though Adela's reſentment remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unabated, ſhe ſoon began to wiſh ſhe had not been ſo precipitate in obeying it, an involuntary repugnance roſe in her mind againſt the connection ſhe was about form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and honor alone kept her from declining it for ever. Her beloved friend, Mrs. Marlowe, ſupported her throughout the trying occaſion, and, in an unauſpicious hour, Adela gave her hand to the perfidious Belgrave.</p>
                     <p>About a fortnight after her nuptials ſhe heard from ſome of the officers of Oſcar's illneſs, ſhe bluſhed at his name: "faith" cried one of them, "Mrs. Marlowe is a charming woman, it is well he got into ſuch ſnug quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I really believe elſewhere he would have given up the ghoſt." "Poor fellow," ſighed ſhe heavily, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſenſible of it. Belgrave roſe, he caught her eyes, a dark frown loured on his brow, and he looked as if he would pierce into the receſſes of her heart; ſhe ſhuddered, and, for the firſt time, felt the tyranny ſhe had impoſed upon herſelf; as Mrs. Marlowe choſe to be ſilent on the ſubject, ſhe reſolved not to mention it to her, but ſhe ſent every day to invite her to Woodlawn, expecting by this to hear ſomething of Oſcar, but ſhe was diſappointed. At the end of a fortnight Mrs. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe made her appearance, ſhe looked pale and thin, Adela gently reproved her for her long abſence, truſting this would oblige her to alledge the reaſon of it, but no ſuch thing; Mrs. Marlowe began to converſe on indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubjects, Adela ſuddenly grew peeviſh, and ſullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſat at her work.</p>
                     <p>In a few days after Mrs. Marlowe's viſit, Adela, one evening immediately after dinner ordered the carriage to the Cottage; by this time ſhe ſuppoſed Oſcar had left it, and flattered herſelf in the courſe of converſation, ſhe

ſhould learn whether he was perfectly recovered, ere he departed; propoſing to ſurpriſe her friend, ſhe ſtole by a winding path to the cottage, and ſoftly opened the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour door, but what were her felings when ſhe perceived Oſcar ſitting at the fire ſide with Mrs. Marlowe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a deep converſation; ſhe ſtopped unable to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, Mrs. Marlowe embraced and led her forward, the emotions of Oſcar were not inferior to Adela's, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to riſe, but could not, a glance from the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive eyes of Mrs Marlowe, which ſeemed to conjure him not to yield to a weakneſs which would betray his real ſentiments to Adela, ſomewhat reanimated him, he roſe and tremblingly approached her, "allow, me madam," cried he, "to—" the ſentence died unfiniſhed on his lips, he had not power to offer congratulations on an event which had probably deſtroyed the happineſs of Adela as well as his own. "Oh! a truce with compliments," ſaid Mrs. Marlowe, forcing herſelf to aſſume a cheerful air, "prithee good folks, let us be ſeated, and enjoy, this cold evening, the comforts of a good fire;" ſhe forced the trembling, the almoſt fainting, Adela, to take ſome wine, and, by degrees, the flutter of her ſpirits and Oſcar's abated; but the ſadneſs of their countenances, the anguiſh of their ſouls, increaſed the cold formality, the diſtant reſerve, they both aſſumed, filled each with ſorrow and regret; ſo pale, ſo emaciated, ſo woe begone, did Fitzalan appear, ſo much the ſon of ſorrow and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, that had he half murdered Adela, ſhe could not at that moment have felt for him any other ſentiments than thoſe of pity and compaſſion. Mrs. Marlowe, in a laughing way, told her of the trouble ſhe had had with him, "for which, I aſſure you," ſaid ſhe, "he rewards me badly, for the moment he was enlarged from the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, he either forgot or neglected all the rules I had laid down for him, pray do join your commands to mine, and charge him to take more care of himſelf." "I would moſt willingly," cried Adela, "if I thought they would influence him to do ſo." "Influence!" repeated Oſcar emphatically, "oh heavens!" then, ſtarting up, he hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the window, as if to hide and to indulge his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy;
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:038416_0146_1011E282157491A8"/>
the ſcene he viewed from it was dreary and deſolate, it was now the latter end of autumn, the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was cold, a ſavage blaſt howled from the hills, and the ſky was darkened by a coming ſtorm. Mrs. Marlowe rouſed him from his reverie, "I am ſure," ſaid ſhe, "the proſpect you view from the window can have no great attractions at preſent." "And yet," cried he, "there is ſomething ſadly pleaſing in it, the leafleſs trees, the fading flowers of autumn, excite in my boſom a kind of mournful ſympathy; they are emblems, to me, of him whoſe tendereſt hopes have been diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, but, unlike him, they after a ſhort period ſhall again flouriſh with primeval beauty." "Nonſenſe!" exclaimed Mrs. Marlowe, "your illneſs has affected your ſpirits, but this gloom will vaniſh long before my orchard reaſſumes its ſmiling appearance, and haply at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts another ſmart red coat to viſit an old woman." "Oh! with what an enthuſiaſm of tenderneſs," cried Oſcar, "ſhall I ever remember the dear though danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moment, I firſt entered this cottage." "Now, no flattery, Oſcar," ſaid Mrs. Marlowe, "I know your fickle ſex too well to believe I have made a laſting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; why the very firſt fine old woman you meet at your enſuing quarters will, I dare ſay, have ſimilar praiſe beſtowed on her." "No," replied he, with a languid ſmile, "I can aſſure you ſolemnly, the impreſſion which had been made on my heart will never be effaced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" He ſtole a look at Adela, her head ſunk upon her boſom, and her heart began to beat violently: Mrs. Marlowe wiſhed to change the ſubject entirely; ſhe felt the trueſt compaſſion for the unhappy young couple, and had fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently deſired their union; but ſince irrevocably ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhe wiſhed to check any intimation of a mutual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment which could now anſwer no purpoſe but that of increaſing their miſery; ſhe rung for tea, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by her converſation to enliven the tea-table, the effort, however, was not ſeconded: "You have often," cried ſhe, addreſſing Adela, as they again drew their chairs round the fire, "deſired to hear the exact parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of my life, unconquerable feelings of regret hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

prevented my acquieſcing in your deſire; but as nothing better now offers for paſſing away the hours, I will, if you pleaſe, relate them." "You will oblige me by ſo doing," cried Adela, "my curioſity, you know, has been long excited."</p>

                     <p>TO begin, then, as they ſay in a novel, without further preface, I was the only child of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try curate, in the ſouthern part of England; who, like his wife, was of a good but reduced family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contented diſpoſitions and an agreeable neighbourhood, ready on every occaſion to oblige them, rendered them, in their humble ſituation, completely happy. I was the idol of both their hearts—every one told my mother I ſhould grow up a beauty, and ſhe, poor ſimple woman believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the flattering tale; naturally ambitious, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what romantic, ſhe expected nothing leſs than my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by my charms, an elevated ſituation; to fit me for it, therefore, according to her idea, ſhe gave me all the ſhewy, inſtead of ſolid, advantages of education; my father being a meek, or rather an indolent man, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted entirely to her direction: thus, without knowing the grammatical part of my own language, I was taught to gabble bad French by herſelf, and, inſtead of mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or making my clothes, to flouriſh upon catgut and embroider ſatin; I was taught dancing by a man who kept a cheap ſchool for that purpoſe in the village; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038416_0148_1011E2875FF630A0"/>
I could not aſpire to, my mother's finances being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to purchaſe an inſtrument; ſhe was therefore obliged to content herſelf with my knowing the vocal part of that delightful ſcience, and inſtructed me in ſinging a few old faſhioned airs, with a thouſand graces, in her opinion at leaſt.</p>
                     <p>To make me excel by my dreſs, as well as my accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, all the miſſes of the village, the remains of her finery were cut and altered into every form which art or ingenuity could ſuggeſt; and, heaven forgive me, but, my chief inducement in going to meeting on Sunday, was to exhibit my flounced ſilk petticoat, and painted chip hat.</p>
                     <p>When I attained my ſixteenth year, my mother thought me, (and ſuppoſed every one elſe muſt do the ſame) the moſt perfect creature in the world; I was lively and thoughtleſs, vain and ambitious, to an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant degree, yet, truly innocent in my diſpoſition, and often forgetting the appearance I had been taught to aſſume, indulged the natural gaiety of my heart, in a game of hide and go ſeek, amongſt the haycocks in a meadow, by moon light, enjoyed perfect felicity.</p>
                     <p>Once a week, accompanied by my mother, I attended the dancing maſter's ſchool, to practiſe country dances; one evening, we had juſt concluded a ſet, and were reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves, when an elegant youth, in a faſhionable riding dreſs, entered the room; his appearance at once excited admiration and ſurpriſe, never ſhall I forget the palpitation of my heart at his approach, every girl expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the ſame, every cheek was fluſhed, and every eye ſparkled with hope and expectation; he walked round the room with an eaſy unembarraſſed air, as if to take a ſurvey of the company; he ſtopped by a very pretty girl, the miller's daughter—good heavens! what were my agonies,—my mother too, who ſat beſide me, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pale, and would actually, I believe, have fainted, had he taken any farther notice of her; fortunately he did not, but advanced, my eyes caught his, he again pauſed, looked ſurpriſed and pleaſed, and after a moment
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:038416_0149_1011E289D6DBEDC0"/>
paſſed in ſeeming conſideration, bowed with the utmoſt elegance, and requeſted the honour of my hand for the enſuing dance; my politeneſs had hitherto only been in theory, I aroſe, dropped him a profound courteſy, aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the honour would be all on my ſide, and I was happy to grant his requeſt; he ſmiled, I thought, a little archly, and coughed to avoid laughing; I bluſhed and felt embarraſſed, but he led me to the head of the room to call a dance, and my triumph over my companions ſo exhilerated my ſpirits, that I immediately loſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
                     <p>I had been engaged to a young farmer, and he was enraged, not only at my breaking my engagement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his permiſſion, but at the ſuperior graces of my partner, who threatened to be a formidable rival to him; "by jingo!" ſaid Clod, coming up to me in a ſurly manner, "I think, Miſs Fanny, you have not uſed me genteelly, I don't ſee why this here fine ſpark ſhould take the lead of us all." "Creature!" cried I, with an ineffable look of contempt, which he could not bear, and retired grumbling. My partner could no longer refrain from laughing, the ſimplicity of my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, notwithſtanding the airs I endeavoured to aſſume, highly delighted him—"No wonder," cried he, "the poor ſwain ſhould be mortified at loſing the hand of his charming Fanny."</p>
                     <p>The dancing over, we rejoined my mother, who was on thorns to begin a converſation with the ſtranger, that ſhe might let him know we were not to be ranked with the preſent company; "I am ſure, Sir," ſaid ſhe, "a gentleman of your elegant appearance muſt feel rather aukward in the preſent party; it is ſo with us, as indeed it muſt be with every perſon of faſhion; but in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure little village like this, we muſt not be too nice in our ſociety, except, like a hermit, we could do without any." The ſtranger aſſented to whatever ſhe ſaid, and accepted an invitation to ſup with us; my mother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſent an intimation of her will to my father, to have, not the fatted calf indeed, but the fatted duck pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; and he and the maid uſed ſuch expedition, that by
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:038416_0150_1011E28C9FC51E20"/>
the time we returned, a neat, comfortable ſupper was ready to lay on the table. Mr. Marlowe, the ſtranger's name, as he informed us, was all animation and affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; it is unneceſſary to ſay that my mother, father, and myſelf, were all complaiſance, delight and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; on departing, he aſked and obtained permiſſion of courſe to renew his viſit the next day, and my mother immediately ſet him down as her future ſon in-law.</p>
                     <p>As every thing is ſpeedily communicated in ſuch a ſmall village as we reſided in, we learned, on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding evening he had ſtopped at the inn, and hearing muſic, had enquired from whence it proceeded, and had gone out of curioſity to the dance; we alſo learned that his attendants reported him to be heir to a large fortune: this report, vain as I was, was almoſt enough of itſelf to engage my heart; judge, then, whether it was not an eaſy conqueſt to a perſon who, beſides the above mentioned attraction, poſſeſſed thoſe of a graceful fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and cultivated mind; he viſited continually at our cottage, and I, uncultivated as I was, daily ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened myſelf in his affections; in converſing with him, I forgot the precepts of vanity and affectation, and obeyed the dictates of nature and ſenſibility. He ſoon declared the motives of his viſits to me—"to have immediately demanded my hand," he ſaid, "would have gratified the tendereſt wiſh of his ſoul—but—in his preſent ſituation, that was impoſſible—leſt, at an early age, deſtitute and diſtreſſed, by the death of his parents, an old whimſical uncle, married to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man equally capricious, had adopted him as heir to their large poſſeſſions—he found it difficult," he ſaid, "to ſubmit to their ill humour, and was confident, if he took any ſtep againſt their inclinations, he ſhould forever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their favour; therefore, if my parents would allow a reciprocal promiſe to paſs between us, binding each to each, the moment he became maſter of expected fortune, or obtained an independence, he would make me a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of it." They conſented, and he enjoined us to the ſtricteſt ſecrecy, ſaying, "one of his attendants was placed about him as a kind of ſpy, he had hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:038416_0151_1011E28F141BCBF0"/>
him with reſpect to us, declaring my father was an intimate friend, and that his uncle knew he intended viſiting him." But my unfortunate vanity betrayed the ſecret it was ſo material for me to keep, I burned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to reveal it; one morning a young girl, who had been an intimate acquaintance of mine till I knew Marlowe came to ſee me—"Why, Fanny," cried ſhe, "you have given us all up for Mr. Marlowe, take care, my dear, he makes you amends for the loſs of all your other friends." "I ſhall take your advice," ſaid I, with a ſmile and a conceited toſs of my head. "Faith for my part," continued ſhe, "I think you were very fooliſh not to ſecure a good ſettlement for yourſelf with Clod." "With Clod!" repeated I, with the utmoſt haughtineſs, "Lord, child, you forget who I am!" "Who you are!" exclaimed ſhe, provoked at my inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, "oh yes! to be ſure, I forget that you are the daughter of a poor country curate, with more pride in your head than money in your purſe." "Neither do I forget," ſaid I, "that your ignorance is equal to your impertinence, if I am the daughter of a poor country curate, I am the affianced wife of a rich man, and as much elevated by expectation, as ſpirit, above you." Our converſation was repeated throughout the Village, and reached the ears of Marlowe's attendant, who inſtantly developed the real motive, which detained him ſo long in the Village; he wrote to his Uncle an account of the whole affair, the conſequence of this was a Letter to poor Marlowe, full of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt reproaches, charging him, without delay, to return home; this was like a thunder ſtroke to us all, but there was no alternative between obeying, or forfeiting his uncle's favour. I fear my dear Fanny," cried he, as he folded me to his boſom, a little before his departure, "it will be long ere we ſhall meet again, nay, I alſo fear, I ſhall be obliged to promiſe not to write; if both theſe fears are realized impute not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſence or ſilence to a want of the tendereſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>on for you." He went, and with him all my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; my mother, ſhortly after his departure, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:038416_0152_1011E290A40ABEE0"/>
by a nervous fever, which terminated her days; my father, naturally of weak ſpirits and delicate conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, was ſo ſhocked by the ſudden death of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and faithful companion, that he ſunk beneath his grief. The horrors of my mind I cannot deſcribe; I ſeemed to ſtand alone in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, without one friendly hand to prevent my ſinking into the grave, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the deareſt objects of my love. I did not know where Marlowe lived, and even if I had, durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an application, which might be the means of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: the eſteem of my neighbours I had forfeited by my conceit, they paid no attention but what common humanity dictated, merely to prevent my periſhing; and that they made me ſenſibly feel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this diſtreſs I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an invitation from a ſchool fellow of mine, who had married a rich farmer about forty miles from our village to take up my reſidence with her, till I was ſufficiently recovered to fix on ſome plan for future ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; I gladly accepted the offer, and, after paying a farewell viſit to the grave of my regretted parents, I ſet off, in the cheapeſt conveyance I could find, to her habitation, with all my worldly treaſure packed in a portmanteau.</p>
                     <p>With my friend I truſted I ſhould enjoy a calm and happy aſylum, till Marlowe was able to fulfil his promiſe, and allow me to reward her kindneſs; but, this idea ſhe ſoon put to flight, by informing me, as my health return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I muſt think of ſome method for ſupporting myſelf, I ſtarted, as at the utter annihilation of all my hopes, for vain and ignorant of the world, I imagined Marlowe would never think of me if once diſgraced by ſervitude; I told her, I underſtood little of any thing except fancy work; ſhe was particularly glad, ſhe ſaid, to hear I knew that, as it would, in all probability, gain me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to the ſervice of a rich old lady in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, who had long been ſeeking for a perſon who could read agreeably and do fancy works, with which ſhe delighted to ornament her houſe; ſhe was a little whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, to be ſure, ſhe added, but well timed flattery might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

reputation, I ſhould not reject ſo reſpectable a protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: there was no alternative; I inquired particularly about her, but how great was my emotion, when I learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe was the aunt of Marlowe—my heart throbbed with exquiſite delight at the idea of being in the ſame houſe with him, beſides, the ſervice of his aunt would not, I flattered myſelf, degrade me as much in his eyes as that of another perſon's; it was neceſſary, however, my name ſhould be concealed, and I requeſted my friend to comply with my wiſh in that reſpect; ſhe rallied me about my pride, which ſhe ſuppoſed had ſuggeſted the requeſt, but promiſed to comply with it; ſhe had no doubt but her recommendation would be ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me immediate admittance, and, accordingly, taking ſome of my work with me, I proceeded to the habitation of Marlowe. It was an antique manſion, ſurrounded with neat clipped hedges, level lawns, and formal planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; two ſtatues, caſt in the ſame mould, and reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nothing either in heaven, earth, or ſea, ſtood grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning horribly upon the pillars of a maſſy gate, as if to guard the entrance from impertinent intruſion: on knocking, an old porter appeared, I gave him my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, but he, like the ſtatues, ſeemed ſtationary, and would not, I believe, have ſtirred from his ſituation to deliver an embaſſy from the king; he called, however, to a domeſtic, who happening to be a little deaf, was full half an hour before he heard him; at laſt, I was uſhered up ſtairs into an apartment, from the heat of which one might have conjectured it was under the torrid zone; though in the middle of July, a heavy hot fire burned in the grate, a thick carpet, repreſenting birds, beaſts and flowers, was ſpread on the floor, and the windows, cloſely ſcrewed down, were heavy with wood work, and darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with duſt; the maſter and miſtreſs of the Manſion, like Derby and Joan, ſat in arm chairs on each ſide of the fire, three dogs and as many cats, ſlumbered at their feet; he was leaning on a ſpider table, poring over a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous book, and ſhe was ſtitching a counterpane, ſickneſs and ill-nature were viſible in each countenance. "So! ſaid ſhe, raiſing a huge pair of ſpectacles at my
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:038416_0154_1011E2972DF219A8"/>
entrance, and examining me from head to foot, "you are come from Mrs. Wilſon's, why, bleſs me child, you are quite too young for any buſineſs—pray what is your name, and where did you come from? I was prepared for theſe queſtions, and told her the truth, only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing my real name, and the place of my nativity. "Well let me ſee thoſe works of yours," cried ſhe, I produced them, and the ſpectacles were again drawn down; "Why, they are neat enough, to be be ſure," ſaid ſhe, "but the deſign is bad—very bad indeed; there is taſte! there is execution!" directing me to ſome pictures in heavy gilt frames, hung round the room. I told her, with ſincerity, "I had never ſeen any thing like them." "To be ſure, child," exclaimed ſhe, pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at what ſhe conſidered admiration in me, "'tis run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a great riſk to take you, but if you think you can conform to the regulations of my houſe, I will from compaſſion, and as you are recommended by Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, venture to engage you; but remember, I muſt have no gad-a-bout, no fly-flapper, no chatterer, in my family; you muſt be decent in your dreſs and carriage, diſcreet in your words, induſtrious at your work, and ſatisfied with the indulgence of going to church on a Sunday." I ſaw I was about entering on a painful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, but the idea of its being ſweetened by the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of Marlowe, a little reconciled me to it. On promiſing all ſhe deſired, every thing was ſettled for my admiſſion into her family, and ſhe took care I ſhould perform the promiſes I made her. I ſhall not recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate the various trials I underwent from her auſterity and peeviſhneſs; ſuffice it to ſay, my patience as well as taſte, underwent a perfect martyrdom, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſeated at a frame, working pictures of her own invention, which were every thing that was hideous in nature. I was never allowed to go out, except on a Sunday to Church, or on a chance evening when it was too dark to diſtinguiſh colours.</p>
                     <p>Marlowe was abſent on my entering the family, nor durſt I aſk when he was expected; my health and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits gradually declined from my cloſe confinement, when
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:038416_0155_1011E299CC6E6750"/>
allowed, as I have before ſaid of a chance time to go out, inſtead of enjoying the freſh air, I have ſat down to weep over ſcenes of former happineſs. I dined conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the old houſe-keeper, ſhe informed me one day, that Mr. Marlowe, her maſter's young heir, who had been abſent ſome time on a viſit, was expected home on the enſuing day; fortunately the good Dame was too buſily employed to notice my agitation, I retired as ſoon as poſſible from the table, in a ſtate of indeſcribable pleaſure, never ſhall I forget my emotions, when I heard the trampling of his horſes feet, and ſaw him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the houſe; vainly I endeavoured to reſume my work, my hands trembled, and I ſunk back on my chair, to indulge the delightful idea of an interview with him, which I believed to be inevitable: my ſevere taſk-miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ſoon awakened me from my delightful dream, ſhe came to tell me, "I muſt confine myſelf to my own and the houſe-keeper's room, which, to a virtuous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet maiden, ſuch as I appeared to be, ſhe ſuppoſed would be no hardſhip, while her nephew, who was a young, perhaps rather a wild young man, remained in the houſe; when he again left it, which would ſoon be the caſe, I ſhould regain my liberty. My heart ſunk within me at her words, but when the firſt ſhock was over, I conſoled myſelf by thinking I ſhould be able to elude her vigilance; I was, however, miſtaken, ſhe and the houſe-keeper, were perfect Argus's: to be in the ſame houſe with Marlowe, yet, without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, drove me almoſt diſtracted.</p>
                     <p>I at laſt thought of an expedient, which, I hoped, would effect the diſcovery I wanted; I had juſt finiſhed a piece of work, which my miſtreſs was delighted with; it was an enormous flower baſket, mounted on the back of a cat, which held beneath its paw a trembling mouſe; the raptures the old lady expreſſed at ſeeing her own deſign ſo ably executed, encouraged me to aſk permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to embroider a picture of my own deſigning, for which I had the ſilks lying by me; ſhe complied, and I ſet about it with alacrity, I copied my face and figure as exactly as I could, and, in mourning drapery and a
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:038416_0156_1011E29B5A2EAEB8"/>
penſive attitude, placed the little image by a ruſtic grave, in the church yard of my native village, at the head of which, half embowered in trees, appeared the lowly cottage of my departed parents: theſe well known objects, I thought, would revive, if indeed ſhe was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from it, the idea of poor Fanny in the mind of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe. I preſented the picture to my miſtreſs, who was pleaſed with the preſent, and promiſed to have it framed; the next day, while I ſat at dinner, the door ſuddenly opened, and Marlowe entered the room; I thought I ſhould have fainted, my companion dropped her knife and fork with great precipitation, and Marlowe told her he was very ill, and wanted a cordial from her; ſhe roſe with a diſſatisfied air to comply with his requeſt; he, taking this opportunity of approaching a little nearer, darted a glance of pity and tenderneſs, and ſoftly whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, "to night, at eleven, meet me in the front par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour." You may conceive how tardily the hours paſt till the appointed time came, when ſtealing to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, I found Marlowe expecting me; he folded me to his heart, and his tears mingled with mine, as I related my melancholy tale. "You are now, my fanny," he cried, "entirely mine, deprived of the protection of your tender parents, I ſhall endeavour to fulfil the ſacred truſt they repoſed in my honor, by ſecuring mine to you, as far as lies in my power; I was not miſtaken," continued he, "in the idea I had formed of the treatment I ſhould receive from my flinty hearted relations on leaving you, had I not promiſed to drop all correſpondence with you, I muſt have relinquiſhed all hopes of their favour; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indeed," cried he, while a tear ſtarted in his eye, "is the bread of dependence, ill could my ſoul ſubmit to the indignities I received; but, I conſoled myſelf throughout them, by the idea of future happineſs with my Fanny; had I known her ſituation, (which indeed it was impoſſible I ſhould, as my uncle's ſpy attended me wherever I went) no dictate of prudence would have prevented my flying to her aid!" "Thank Heaven then you were ignorant of it," ſaid I. My aunt," he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:038416_0157_1011E29D88C43B70"/>
"ſhewed me your work, laviſhing the higheſt encomiums on it, I glanced my eye careleſſly upon it, but, in a moment, how was that careleſs eye attracted by the well known objects preſented to it; this, I ſaid to my heart, can only be Fanny's work; I tried to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from my aunt whether my conjectures were wrong, but without ſucceſs; when I retired to dreſs, I aſked my ſervant if there had been any addition to the family during my abſence, he ſaid a young woman was hired to do fine works, but ſhe never appeared among the ſervants."</p>
                     <p>Marlowe proceeded to ſay, "he could not bear I ſhould longer continue in ſervitude, and that without delay he was reſolved to unite his fate to mine." I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this reſolution a little, but ſoon, too ſelf-intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I fear, acquieſced in it; it was agreed I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his aunt my health would not longer permit my continuing in her family, and that I ſhould retire to a village ſix miles off where Marlowe undertook to bring a young clergyman, a particular friend of his, to perform the ceremony; our plan, as ſettled, was carried into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and I became the wife of Marlowe. I was now, you will ſuppoſe, elevated to the pinnacle of happineſs, I was ſo indeed, but my own folly precipitated me from it; the ſecrecy I was compelled to obſerve mortified me exceedingly, as I panted to emerge from the invidious cloud which had ſo long concealed my beauty and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments from a world, that I was confident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ſeen, would pay them the homage they merited. The people with whom I lodged had been obliged by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe and therefore, from intereſt and gratitude, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the injunction he gave them of keeping my reſidence at their houſe a ſecret; they believed or affected to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I was an orphan committed to his care, whom his uncle would be diſpleaſed to know he had taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his protection; three or four times a week I received ſtolen viſits from Marlowe, when, one day (after a month had elapſed in this manner) ſtanding at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour window, I ſaw Mrs. Wilſon walking down the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; I ſtarted back, but too late to eſcape her obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:038416_0158_1011E29FBB75A248"/>
ſhe immediately bolted into the room, with all the eagerneſs of curioſity; I bore her firſt interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tolerably well, but when ſhe upbraided me for leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the excellent ſervice ſhe had procured for me, for duplicity in ſaying I was going to another, and for my indiſcretion in reſpect to Marlowe, I loſt all command of my temper, and remembering the inhumanity with which ſhe had forced me into ſervitude, I reſolved to mortify her completely, by aſſuming all the airs I had heretofore ſo ridiculouſly aſpired to; lolling in my chair, with an air of the moſt careleſs indifference, I bid her no longer petrify me with her diſcourſe; this raiſed all the violence of rage, and ſhe plainly told me, "from my conduct with Marlowe, I was unworthy her notice." "Therefore," cried I, forgetting every dictate of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, "his wiſe will neither deſire nor receive it in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture." "His wife!" ſhe repeated, with a look of ſcorn and incredulity. I produced the certificate of my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, thus, from an impulſe of vanity and reſentment, putting myſelf in the power of a woman, a ſtranger to every liberal feeling, and whoſe mind was inflamed with envy toward me; the hint I forced myſelf at parting to give her, to keep the affair ſecret, only determined her more ſtrongly to reveal it; the day after her viſit Marlowe entered my apartment, pale, agitated, and breathleſs, he ſunk into a chair; a pang like conſcious guilt ſmote my heart, and I trembled as I approached him; he repulſed me when I attempted to touch his hand: "Cruel, inconſiderate woman," he ſaid, "to what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lengths has your vanity hurried you, it has drawn deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction upon your own head as well as mine." Shame and remorſe tied my tongue, had I ſpoken, indeed, I could not have vindicated myſelf, and I turned aſide and wept. Marlowe, mild, tender, and adoring, could not long retain reſentment; he ſtarted from his chair, and claſped me to his boſom—"Oh Fanny!" he cried, "though you have ruined me, you are ſtill dear as ever to me." This tenderneſs affected me even more than reproaches, and tears, and ſighs, declared my penitence; his expectations relative to his uncle were finally deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

We ſet off for London, and found his dependence was not ill placed; for, ſoon after our arrival, he obtained a place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable emolument in one of the public offices; my huſband delighted in gratifying me, though I was often both extravagant and whimſical, and almoſt ever on the wing for admiration and amuſement. I was reckoned a pretty woman, and received with rapture the nonſenſe and adulation addreſſed to me; I became acquainted with a young widow, who concealed a depraved heart under a ſpecious appearance of innocence and virtue, and by aiding the vices of others, procured the means of gratifying her own; yet, ſo ſecret were all her tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that calumny had not yet attacked her, and her houſe was the rendezvous of the moſt faſhionable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; my huſband who did not diſlike her manner, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged our intimacy, and at her parties I was noticed by a young nobleman, then at the head of the ton: he declared I was one of the moſt charming objects he had ever beheld, and for ſuch a declaration, I thought him the moſt polite I had ever known; as Lord T—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to wear my chains, I muſt certainly, I thought, become quite the rage; my tranſports, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, were a little checked by the grave remonſtrances of my huſband, who aſſured me Lord T—was a famous, or rather an infamous, libertine, and that if I did not avoid his lordſhip's particular attentions, he muſt inſiſt on my relinquiſhing the widow's ſociety; this I thought cruel, but I ſaw him reſolute, and promiſed to act as he deſired—a promiſe I never adhered to, except when he was preſent. I was now in a ſituation to promiſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe

I denied this; ſtill, however, ſhe dwelt on the ſacrifices I muſt make, the amuſements I muſt give up, and at laſt completely conquered my reſolution; I pretended to Marlowe my health was too delicate to allow me to bear ſuch fatigue, and he immediately ſacrificed his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to mine; I have often wondered at the kind of infatuation with which he complied with all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; my little girl, almoſt as ſoon as born, was ſent from me; but on being able to go out again, I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable ſhock, from hearing my noble admirer was gone to the Continent, owing to a trifling derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his affairs. The vain purſuits of pleaſure and diſſipation were ſtill continued; three years paſt in this manner, during which I had a ſon, and my little girl was brought home. I have ſince often felt aſtoniſhed at the cold indifference with which I regarded my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe and our lovely babe, on whom he doated with all the enthuſiaſm of tenderneſs; alas! vanity had then abſorbed my heart, and deadened every feeling of nature and ſenſibility: it is the parent of ſelf-love and apathy, and degrades thoſe who harbour it below humanity.</p>

Marlowe on the point of departing, preſſed me to his breaſt—"My heart, my beloved Fanny," ſaid he, "feels unuſually heavy, I truſt the feeling is no preſentiment of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill—oh! my Fanny, on you and my babe, I reſt for happineſs—take care of our little cherub, and above all, (his meek eye encountering mine) of yourſelf, that with accuſtomed rapture, I may, on my return, receive you to my arms." There was ſomething ſo ſolemn, and ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in this addreſs, that my heart melted and my tears mingled with thoſe which trickled down his pale cheeks; for two days I attended my child aſſiduouſly, when the widow made her appearance; ſhe aſſured me I ſhould injure myſelf by ſuch cloſe confinement, and that my cheeks were already faded by it, ſhe mentioned a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful maſquerade, which was to be given that night, and for which Lord T—had preſented her with tickets for me and herſelf; but, ſhe declared, except I would accompany her, ſhe would not go. I had often wiſhed to go to a maſquerade, I now, however, declined this opportunity of gratifying my inclination, but ſo faintly as to prompt a renewal of her ſolicitations, to which I at laſt yielded, and, committing my babe to the care of a ſervant, ſet off with the widow to a warehouſe to chooſe dreſſes. Lord T—dined with us, and we were all in the higheſt ſpirits imaginable; about twelve we went in his chariot to the Haymarket, and I was abſolutely intoxicated with his flattery, and the dazzling objects around me; at five we quitted this ſcene of gaiety, the widow took a chair, I would have followed her example, but my Lord abſolutely liſted me into his chariot, and there began talking in a ſtrain which provoked my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and excited my apprehenſions. I expreſſed my deſpleaſure in terms which checked his boldneſs, and convinced him he had ſome difficulties yet to overcome, ere he completed his deſigns: he made his apologies with ſo much humility that I was ſoon appeaſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to accept them. We arrived at the widow's

We agreed to his propoſal, and retired to reſt; about noon we aroſe, and, while I was dreſſing myſelf for the projected excurſion, a letter was brought in to me, "Good Lord, Halcot," exclaimed I, turning to the widow, "if Marlowe is returned, what will become of me?" "Oh! read my dear creature," cried ſhe, "and then we can think of excuſes." I have the letter here, continued Mrs. Marlowe, laying her hand to her breaſt and drawing it forth, after a ſhort pauſe, I laid it to my heart to guard againſt future ſolly.</p>

                           <p>The preſages of my heart were but too true—we parted never to meet again—oh! Fanny, beloved of my ſoul, how are you loſt to yourſelf and Marlowe. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, ſplendour, riches, which I gave up for your ſake were mean ſacrifices, in my eſtimation, to the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I fondly expected to have enjoyed with you through life—your beauty charmed my mind, but, it was your ſimplicity captivated my heart—I took, as I thought, the perfect child of innocence and ſincerity to my boſom; reſolved, from duty, as well as from inclination, to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you in that boſom, to the utmoſt of my power, from every adverſe ſtorm; whenever you were indiſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what agonies did I endure, yet, what I then dreaded, could I have poſſibly foreſeen, would have been compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative happineſs, to my preſent miſery; for, oh! my Fanny, far preferable would it have been, to behold you in the arms of death than infamy.</p>
                           <p>I returned immediately after witneſſing the laſt pangs of my friend—oppreſſed with the awful ſcene of death, yet, cheering my ſpirits by an anticipation of the
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:038416_0163_1011E2AC4AF75B98"/>
conſolation I ſhould receive from my Fanny's ſympathy.—Good God! what was my horror, when I found my little babe, inſtead of being reſtored to health, by a mother's care, nearly expiring through her neglect—the angel lay gaſping on her bed, deſerted by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary wretch to whoſe care ſhe was conſigned. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and the fatal truth ruſhed upon my ſoul, yet, when the firſt tumult of paſſion had ſubſided, I felt that, without yet ſtronger proofs, I could not abandon you; alas! too ſoon did I receive thoſe proofs—I traced you, Fanny, through your giddy round, till I ſaw you borne in the arms of the vile Lord T—into the houſe of his vile paramour—You will wonder, perhaps, I did not tear you from his graſp—could ſuch a procedure have reſtored you to me, with all your unſullied innocence, I ſhould not have heſitated, but, that was impoſſible, and my eyes then gazed upon Fanny for the laſt time. I returned to my motherleſs babe, and am not aſhamed to ſay, I wept over it with all the agonies of a fond and betrayed heart.</p>
                           <p>Ere I bid an irrevocable adieu, I would, if poſſible, endeavour to convince you that conſcience cannot always be ſtifled, that illicit love is conſtantly attended by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and diſappointment; for, when familiarity or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, have diminiſhed the charms which excited it, the frail fetters of admiration are broken by him who looks only to an exterior for delight; if indeed your conſcience ſhould not be awakened till this hour of deſertion comes, when it does arrive, you may perhaps think of Marlowe—Yes, Fanny, when your cheeks are faded by care, when your wit is enfeebled by deſpondency, you may think of him whoſe tenderneſs would have outlived both time and change, and ſupported you, without abatement, through every ſtage of life.</p>
                           <p>To ſtop ſhort in the career of vice is, they ſay, the nobleſt effort of virtue; may ſuch an effort be yours, and may you yet give joy to the angels of heaven, who, we are taught to believe, rejoice over them that truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.

affection of my huſband was all of felicity I could deſire to poſſeſs; full of the idea of being able to affect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, I ſtarted up, but ere I reached the door, ſunk into an agony of tears, recollecting that ere this he was probably far diſtant from me; my baſe compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tried to aſſuage my grief, and make me in reality the wretch poor Marlowe ſuppoſed me to be: I heard them in ſilent contempt, unable to move, till a ſervant informed me a gentleman below ſtairs deſired to ſee me; the idea of a relenting huſband inſtanly occurred, and I flew down, but how great was my diſappointment only to ſee a particular friend of his; our meeting was pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the extreme; I aſked him if he knew any thing of Marlowe, and he ſolemnly aſſured me he did not. When my confuſion and diſtreſs had a little ſubſided, he informed me, that in the morning he had received a letter from him, with an account of our ſeparation, and the fatal cauſe of it; the letter contained a deed of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement on me, of a ſmall paternal eſtate, and a bill of fifty pounds, which Marlowe requeſted his friend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf to me; he alſo added my clothes were ſent to his houſe, as our lodgings had been diſcharged. I did not find it difficult to convince this gentleman of my innocence, and, putting myſelf under his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was immediately conveyed to lodgings in a retired part of the town; here he conſoled me with aſſurance of uſing every effort to diſcover the reſidence, of my huſband, all, alas! proved unſucceſsful, and my health gradually declined; as time wore away, my hope yet left ſtill undiminiſhed my deſire of ſeeing him; change of air was at laſt deemed requiſite to preſerve my exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and I went to Briſtol. I had the good fortune to lodge in the houſe with an elderly Iriſh Lady, whoſe ſweet and benevolent manners ſoon gained my warmeſt eſteem, and tempted me to divulge my melancholy tale, where ſo certain of obtaining pity; ſhe had alſo ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeverely from the preſſure of ſorrow, but hers, as it proceeded not from imprudence, but the common viciſſitudes of life, was borne without that degree of anguiſh mine occaſioned: as the period approached for

her return to her native country, I felt the deepeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret at the proſpect of our ſeparation, which ſhe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, removed, by aſking me to reſide entirely with her; eight years had elapſed ſince the loſs of my huſband, and no latent hope of his return remained in my heart ſufficiently ſtrong to tempt me to forego the advantages of ſuch ſociety; ere I departed, however, I wrote to ſeveral of his friends informing them of the ſtep I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended taking, and, if any tidings of Marlowe occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, where I was to be found. Five years I paſſed with my valuable friend in retirement, and had the pleaſure of thinking I had contributed to the eaſe of her laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this cottage, with a few acres adjoining it, and four hundred pounds, was all her wealth, and to me ſhe bequeathed it, having no relations whoſe wants gave them any claim upon her."</p>

Mrs. Marlowe, however, was too well convinced of the expediency and propriety of this to preſs her longer ſtay, though the eyes of Oſcar, ſuddenly turned to her, ſeemed to entreat ſhe would do ſo. The night was dark and wet, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Mrs. Marlowe from accompanying Adela to the carriage; not ſo Oſcar, he took the umbrella from the ſervant who held it for his miſtreſs, and bid him haſte on to have the carriage door opened. "Oſcar," cried Mrs. Marlowe, extremely unwilling to allow even this ſhort tete-a-tete, "Mrs. Belgrave will diſpence with your gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, for you are really too great an invalid to venture out ſuch a night as this." Adela attempted to diſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="169" facs="unknown:038416_0168_1011E2B84656F490"/>
ſcarcely to be articulate; Oſcar gently ſeized her hand and pulled it under his arm, he felt it tremble as he did ſo, the touch became contagious, an univerſal tremor affected his frame, and never, perhaps, had he and Adela experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced a moment of greater unhappineſs. Adela at laſt found herſelf obliged to ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſcious that her ſilence muſt appear particular, and ſaid, ſhe feared he would be injured by his attentions to her. More fatally injured than he already was, he might have replied, he could not be; but he checked the words ready to burſt from his lips and only anſwered that he would be unfit for a ſoldier if he could not endure the inclemency of the wintry blaſt. The light from the globes of the carriage gave him a view of her pale lovely cheeks, and he ſaw ſhe was weeping—confuſed at the idea of betraying her diſtreſs ſhe averted her head, and haſtily aſcended the ſteps; yet for a moment, her trembling hand reſted upon Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car's, as if, in this manner, ſhe would have given the adieu ſhe had not the power of pronouncing. Loſt in agony, he remained like a ſtatue on the ſpot where ſhe had left him, till rouſed by the friendly voice of Mrs. Marlowe, who, alarmed at his long abſence, came to ſeek him; ſoothed by her kind ſolicitude, he directly returned with her to the houſe, where his indignation againſt the perfidious Belgrave again broke forth—he execrated him, not only as the deſtroyer of his peace, but a peace infinitely more precious than his own, that of the charming Adela's.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Marlowe eſſayed every art of conſolation, and, by ſympathy and mildneſs, at laſt ſubdued the violence of his feelings; ſhe acknowledged the loſs he ſuſtained in being deprived of Adela, but, ſince irrevocable, both virtue and reaſon required him to ſtruggle againſt his grief, and conceal it; by their ſacred dictates ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to avoid ſeeing Adela; he felt ſhe was right in the entreaty, and ſolemnly promiſed to comply with it; her friendſhip was balm to his wounded heart, and her ſociety the only pleaſure he was capable of enjoying, whenever he could abſent himſelf from quarters he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:038416_0169_1011E2B9D2EDDB10"/>
to her, and frequently ſpent three or four days at a time in her cottage. By diſcontinuing his viſits in the gay neighbourhood of Woodlawn, he avoided all opportunities of ſeeing Adela, yet often on a clear froſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty night has he ſtole from the fire ſide of Mrs. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, to the beloved and beautiful haunts about the lake, where he and Adela paſt ſo many happy hours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; here he indulged in all the luxury of woe, and ſuch are the pleaſures of virtuous melancholy, that Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car would not have reſigned them for any of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place enjoyments of life.</p>
                     <p>Often did he wander to the grove from whence he had a view of Adela's chamber, and if a lucky chance gave him a glimpſe of her, as ſhe paſſed through it, a ſudden ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy would pervade his boſom; he would pray for her felicity, and return to Mrs. Marlowe as if his heart was lightened of an oppreſſive weight. That tender friend flattered herſelf, from youth, and the natural gaiety of his diſpoſition, his attachment, no longer fed by hope, would gradually decline; but ſhe was miſtaken—the bloom of his youth was faded, and his gaiety converted into deep deſpondency: had he never been undeceived with regard to the General and Adela, pride, no doubt, would quickly have leſſened the poignancy of his feelings; but when he reflected on the generous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the one, and the ſincere affections of the other, and the ſupreme happineſs he might have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he loſt all fortitude: thus by perpetually brooding over the bleſſings once within his reach, looſing all reliſh for thoſe which were yet attainable, his ſorrow, inſtead of being meliorated, was increaſed by time; the horror and indignation with which he beheld Belgrave, after the firſt knowledge of his baſeneſs, could ſcarcely be reſtrained; though painful, he was pleaſed the effort had proved a ſucceſsful one, as, excluſive of his ſacred promiſe to Mrs. Marlowe, deli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The unfortunate Adela pined in ſecret, her interview with Oſcar had deſtroyed the ſmall remainder of her peace; his pale and emaciated figure haunted her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, in vain, by dwelling on his unkind letter, did ſhe endeavour to leſſen her tenderneſs; ſhe felt the emotion of pity ſtronger than that of reſentment, and that the friendſhip of Oſcar would have been ſweeter to her ſoul, than the love or attention of any other object; by obeying the impulſe of paſſion, ſhe feared ſhe had doomed herſelf to wretchedneſs. Belgrave was a man, whom, upon mature deliberation, ſhe could never have choſen, the ſoftneſs of his manners gradually vaniſhed, when the purpoſe for which they had been aſſumed was completed—unfeeling and depraved, the virtues of Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la could excite no eſteem in his boſom, and the love (if it can merit that appellation) which he felt for her, quickly ſubſided after their marriage; but, as the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral retained the greateſt part of his fortune in his own power, he continued tolerably guarded in his conduct—a ſlave, however, to the moſt violent paſſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, he was often unable to controul them, and forgetful of all prudential motives, delighted at thoſe times in mortifying Adela, by ſly ſarcaſms on her attachment for Oſcar; though deeply wounded, ſhe never complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe had partly forged her chains, and reſolved to bear them without repining; tranquil in appearance, the poor General, who was not penetrating, thought his child perfectly happy, ſuch, however, was not the opinion of thoſe who viſited at Woodlawn; the roſe of health no longer ſpread its beautiful tints on the cheek of Adela, nor were her eyes eradiated by vivacity.</p>
                     <p>The Colonel never went to Enniſkellen except about military buſineſs, but he made frequent excurſions to the metropolis, and other parts of the kingdom, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of pleaſure. Adela felt relieved by his abſence, and the General, ſatisfied at his not attempting to take her along with him, never murmured at it; the period now arrived for the departure of the regiment; Adela had not ſeen Oſcar ſince the interview at Mrs. Marlowe's, ſhe declined going to the reviews which preceded the
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:038416_0171_1011E2C03B539B58"/>
change of garriſon, and ſincerely hoped no chance would again throw him in her way. Oſcar ſickened at the idea of quitting the country without ſeeing her, he knew ſhe was not to accompany the colonel; the officers were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pay a farewell viſit to Woodlawn, and he could not reſiſt being one of the party, they were ſhewn into the drawing room, where Adela and the General ſat: ſhe was ſtartled at the appearance of Oſcar, but, though a bluſh tinged her pale face, ſhe ſoon recovered her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, and entered into converſation; the General preſſed them to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ay to dinner, but they had many viſits to pay and begged to be excuſed. "My dear Fitzalan," ſaid the General, who had long dropped his diſpleaſure, "I wiſh you happineſs and ſucceſs, and hope I ſhall ſoon hear of your being at the head of a company, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I ſay ſoon, for I am an old veteran, and ſhould be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to drop into the trench till I had heard of the good fortune of my friends; your father was a brave fellow, and, in the ſpeedy advancement of his ſon, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a reward for his paſt ſervices." Oſcar preſſed the General's hand to his breaſt, he caſt his tearful eyes on Adela, ſhe ſighed and bent her's to the ground.—"Be aſſured, Sir," he cried, "no gratitude can be more fervent than that your goodneſs has inſpired me with, no wiſhes can be more ſincere than mine for the happineſs of the inhabitants of Woodlawn." "Ineffectual wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es," ſoftly exclaimed Adela, "happineſs from one of its inhabitants, at leaſt, has, I fear, fled for ever."</p>
                     <p>The general's wiſhes for the ſucceſs of Oſcar may be conſidered as mere words of courſe, ſince not enforced by more ſubſtantial proofs of regard; but, in reality, ſoon after his daughter's marriage, in his uſual blunt manner, he had mentioned to the colonel his giving a thouſand or two to help the promotion of Oſcar. Belgrave, who could not bear that the man whom he had injured ſhould have a chance of obtaining equal rank with himſelf, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this truly generous deſign, by ſaying, Oſcar was taken under the patronage of Lord Cherbury, and that the general's bounty might, therefore, at ſome future period, be better applied in ſerving a perſon without his

intereſt. To this the general aſſented, declaring, "that he never yet met with a brave ſoldier, or his offspring, in diſtreſs, without feeling, and anſwering the claim they had upon his heart."</p>
                     <p>Oſcar obtained a ready promiſe from Mrs. Marlowe, of correſponding with him, he bluſhed, and faltered, as he beſought her ſometimes to acquaint him with the health of their friends at Woodlawn.</p>
                     <p>Change of ſcene produced no alteration in him, ſtill pining with regret, and languid from ill health, his father and ſiſter found him, the comforts of ſympathy could not be his, as the anguiſh which preyed on his heart, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of too ſacred a nature to divulge; he hoarded up his grief like a miſer hoarding up his treaſure, fearful that the eye of ſuſpicion ſhould glance at it; as he preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his lovely ſiſter to his heart, had he imagined ſhe was the object of Colonel Belgraves licentious paſſion, the bounds he had hitherto preſcribed to his reſentment, would in a moment have been overturned, and he would, had it been neceſſary, have purſued the monſter round the world, to avenge the injury he had meditated, as well as the one he had committed.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall now bid adieu to Oſcar for the preſent, and, drawing on our boots of ſeven leagues, ſtep after Fitzalan and Amanda.</p>

                     <p>CASTLE Carberry, to which our travellers were going, was a large Gothic pile, erected in the rude and diſtant period when ſtrength, more than elegance, was deemed neceſſary in a building; the depredations of war, as well as time, were diſcernible on its exterior, ſome of its lofty battlements were broken, and others mouldering to decay, while about its ancient towers,

                     <p>It ſtood upon a rocky eminence overhanging the ſea, and commanding a delightful proſpect of the oppoſite coaſt of Scotland; about it were yet to be traced irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fortifications, a moat, and the remains of a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, with a well, long ſince dry, which had been dug in the rock, to ſupply the inhabitants, in times of ſiege, with water; on one ſide roſe a ſtupendous hill, covered to the very ſummit with trees, and ſcattered over with relics of druidical antiquity; before it ſtretched an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and gently ſwelling lawn, ſheltered on each ſide with groves of intermingled ſhade, and refreſhed by a clear and meandering rivulet, that took its riſe from the adjoining hill, and murmured o'er a bed of pebbles.</p>
                     <p>After a pleaſant journey, on the evening of the fourth day, our travellers arrived at their deſtined habitation, an old man and woman who had the care of it, were appriſed of their coming, and on the firſt approach of the carriage opened the maſſy door, and waited to receive them;
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:038416_0174_1011E2C7CE467EC8"/>
they reached it when the ſober grey of twilight had clad every object. Amanda viewed the dark and ſtupendous edifice, whoſe gloom was now heightened by the ſhadows of evening, with venerable awe; the ſolitude, the ſilence which reigned around, the melancholy murmur of the waves, as they daſhed againſt the feet of the rocks, all heightened the ſadneſs of her mind, yet it was not quite an unpleaſing ſadneſs, for with it was now mingled a degree of that enthuſiaſm, which plaintive and romantic ſpirits are ſo peculiarly ſubject to feel in viewing the venerable grandeur of an ancient fabric renowned in hiſtory. As ſhe entered a ſpacious hall, curiouſly, wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcotted with oak, ornamented with coats of arms, ſpears, lances, and old armour; ſhe could not avoid caſting a retroſpective eye to former times, when, perhaps, in this very hall, bards ſung the exploits of thoſe heroes whoſe uſeleſs arms now hung upon the walls; ſhe wiſhed, in the romance of the moment, ſome grey bard near her, to tell the deeds of other times, of kings renowed in our land, of chiefs we behold no more; in the niches in the hall were figures of chieftains, large as life, and rudely carved in oak, their frowning countenances ſtruck a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den panic upon the heart of Ellen.—"Cot pleſs their ſouls," ſhe ſaid, "what the tefil did they do there, except to frighten the people from going into the houſe?</p>
                     <p>They were ſhewn into a large parlour furniſhed in an old faſhioned manner, and found a comfortable ſupper prepared for them; oppreſſed with fatigue, ſoon after they had partaken of it they retired to reſt. The next morning, immediately after breakfaſt, Amanda, atted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the old woman and Ellen, ranged over the caſtle; its interior was quite as Gothic as its exterior, the ſtairs were winding, the galleries intricate, the apartments numerous, and moſtly hung with old tapeſtry, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iriſh battles, in which the Chiefs of Caſtle Carber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were particularly diſtinguiſhed; their portraits, with thoſe of their ladies, occupied a long gallery, whoſe arched windows caſt a dim, religious light upon them; this was terminated by a ſmall apartment in the centre of one of the towers that flanked the building; the room
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:038416_0175_1011E2CA39967A38"/>
was an octagon, and thus commanding a ſea and land proſpect, uniting at once the ſublime and beautiful in it; the furniture was not only modern but elegant, and excited the particular attention and inquiries of Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da; the old woman informed her this had been the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing room of the late Counteſs of Cherbury, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after her marriage, "one of the ſweeteſt, kindeſt ladies," continued ſhe, "I ever knew; the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle has been quite deſerted ſince ſhe died—a lack a day! I thought my poor heart would have broke when I heard of her death: ah! I remember the night I heard the Banſhee crying ſo pitifully." "And pray what is that?" interrupted Amanda. "Why, a little woman no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than a yard, who wears a blue petticoat, a red cloak, and a kerchief round her head; and when the head of any family, eſpecially a great family is to die, ſhe is always heard, by ſome of the old followers, bemoaning herſelf." "Lort ſave us! cried Ellen, "I hope his Lortſhip the Earl won't take it into his head to die while we are here, for I'd as lief ſee one of the faries of Penmaenmowr, as ſuch a little old witch." "Well, proceed," ſaid Amanda. "So, as I was ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I heard her crying diſmally one night in a corner of the houſe; ſo ſays I to my huſband, Johnaten, ſays I, I am ſure we ſhall hear ſomething about my good Lord or Lady, and ſure enough we did the next day, and ever ſince we have ſeen none of the family." Did you ever ſee the young Lord?" aſked Amanda, with involuntary precipitation. "See him, ay that I did, when he was about eight years old, there is his picture, (pointing to one which hung over the chimney) my lady had it done by a fine Engliſh painter, and brought it over with her, it is the moral of what he then was." The eager eyes of Amanda were inſtantly turned to it, and ſhe traced, or imagined ſhe did ſo, a reſemblance ſtill between it and him; the painter ſeemed as if he had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of pity in his mind, when he drew the picture, for Lord Mortimer was portrayed as ſhe is repreſented in the beautiful allegory, ſheltering a trembling dove in his boſom from a ferocious hawk. Oh! Mortimer,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:038416_0176_1011CFB16E76BEB0"/>
thought Amanda, thy feeling nature is here ably deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated, the diſtreſſed, or the helpleſs, to the utmoſt of your power, you would ſave from the gripe of cruelty and oppreſſion. Her father had deſired her to chuſe pleaſant apartments for her own immediate uſe, and ſhe accordingly fixed on this and the room adjoining it, which had been Lady Cherbury's chamber; her things were brought hither, and her books, works, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements for drawing depoſited in rich inlaid cabinets; pleaſed with the arrangements ſhe had made, ſhe brought her father as ſoon as he was at leiſure to view them; he was happy to find her ſpirits ſomewhat cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and compoſed, and declared in future he would call this Amanda's Tower: accompanied by him ſhe aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the battlements of the Caſtle, and was delighted with the extenſive and variegated proſpect ſhe beheld from them; a ſpacious edifice at ſome diſtance embow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in a grove of venerable oaks, attracted her admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; her father told her that was Ulſter lodge, a ſeat belonging to the Marquis of Roſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ine, who was an Iriſh as well as a Scotch peer, and had very extenſive poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Ireland; Fitzalan added, he had been enquiring of the old man about the neighbourhood, and learned from him that at the expiration of every three or four years, the Marquis uſually came over to Ulſter lodge, but had never been accompanied by the Marchioneſs, or Lady Euphraſia Sutherland, who was his only child.</p>
                     <p>The domeſtic economy of Caſtle Carberry was ſoon ſettled, a young man and woman were hired, as John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aten and his wife Kate were conſidered little more than ſupernumeraries; Ellen was appointed to attend Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and do whatever plain work was required. Fitza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan felt a pleaſing ſerenity diffuſed over his mind from the idea of being in ſome degree independent, and in the way of making ſome proviſion for his children. The firſt ſhock of a ſeparation from Lord Mortimer being over, the cheerfulneſs of Amanda gradually returned, the viſions of hope again revived in her mind, and ſhe indulged a ſecret pleaſure at living in the houſe he had once occupied; ſhe conſidered her father as particularly
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:038416_0177_1011E2CBC94B5560"/>
connected with his family, and doubted not, from this circumſtance, ſhe ſhould ſometimes hear of him; ſhe judged of his conſtancy by her own, and believed he would not readily forget her; ſhe acknowledged her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's motives for ſeparating them were equally juſt and delicate, but firmly believed if Lord Mortimer (as ſhe flattered herſelf he would) confeſſed a partiality in her favour to his father, that influenced by tenderneſs for his ſon, friendſhip for her father, and the knowledge of her deſcent, he would immediately give up every idea of another connexion, and ſanction theirs with his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; no obſtacle appeared to ſuch an union but want of fortune, and that want ſhe could never ſuppoſe would be conſidered as one, by the liberal minded Lord Cherbury, who had himſelf an income ſufficient to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify even luxurious wiſhes. Her time was agreeably diverſified by the ſources of amuſement ſhe drew from herſelf; her father, whoſe ſupreme felicity conſiſted in contributing to her pleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> purchaſed a delightful harp for her in Dublin; which arrived a few days after them at Caſtle Carberry, and with its dulcet lays ſhe often charmed not only his ſpirit but her own, from every mortal care; ſhe loved to riſe early and catch the firſt beams of the ſun, and as ſhe wandered o'er the dewy lawn, where the lowing cattle cropped the flowery herb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the milk maid ſung her plaintive ditty.</p>
                     <p>With her father ſhe took long walks about the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent country, he had viſited every ſcene before and now pointed out whatever was worthy her attention; the ſpots where the heroes of former ages had fallen, where the mighty ſtones of their fame were raiſed, that the children of the north might hereafter know the places where their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Amanda too often rambled by herſelf, particularly among the rocks, where were ſeveral natural grottos, ſtrewed with ſhells and ſea weeds; here, of a mild day, ſhe loved to read and liſten to the low murmurs of the tide; the oppoſite Scottiſh hills, among which her mother

firſt drew breath, often attracted and fixed her attention, freqently drawing tears from her eyes, by awaking in her mind, the recollection of that mother's ſufferings.</p>
                     <p>On a morning, when ſhe ſat at work in her apartment, Ellen, who was conſidered more as a friend than a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſometimes ſat with her; the converſation not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently turned on nurſe Edwin's cottage, from which Ellen, with an arch ſimplicity, would advert to Tudor Hall, thence naturally to Lord Mortimer, and conclude with poor Chip, exclaiming, what a pity true love ſhould ever be croſſed.</p>

                     <p>THE ſolitude of Caſtle Carberry was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in leſs than a fortnight, by viſits and invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the neighbouring families; the firſt they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted was to dine at Mr. Kilcorban's; he was a man of large fortune, which, in the opinion of many, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated for the want of poliſhed manners, and a culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated mind; but, to others of a more liberal way of thinking, could not poſſibly excuſe thoſe deficiencies, which were more apparent from his pretending to every excellence, and more intolerable from his deeming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf authorized, by his wealth and conſequence, to ſay and do almoſt whatever he pleaſed. His lady was like himſelf, a compound of ignorance, pride and vanity; their offspring was numerous, and the three who were ſufficiently old to make their appearance, were conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their parents and themſelves as the very models of
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:038416_0179_1011E2D0A67D1E70"/>
elegance and perfection; the young heir had been ſent to the univerſity, but, permitted to be his own maſter, he had profited little by his reſidence there; enough, however, perhaps he thought, for a man of fortune, who wanted not profeſſional knowledge; his face was coarſe, his perſon inelegant, and his taſte in adorning himſelf prepoſterouſly ridiculous; faſhion, Hoyle, and the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſs were his chief ſtudies, and, by his family and ſelf, he was conſidered quite the thing.</p>
                     <p>The young ladies were ſuppoſed to be very accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe they had inſtructors in almoſt every branch of education, but, in reality, they underſtood little more than the names of what they were attempted to be taught; nature had not been laviſh of her gifts, of this, however, they were conſcious, and patched, powdered, and painted, in the very extremity of the mode; their mornings were generally ſpent in rolling about in a coach and ſix, with their mamma, collecting news, and paying viſits; their evenings were conſtantly devoted to compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, without which they declared they could not exiſt; they ſometimes affected langour and ſentiment, talked of friendſhip; and profeſſed for numbers the moſt ſincere; yet to the very girls they pretended to regard, delighted in exhibiting their finery, if certain they could not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the ſame, and would feel mortified by ſeeing it.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Kilcorban had indulged his family in a trip to Bath one autumn, and, in ſo doing, had afforded a never failing ſubject for converſation; upon every occaſion, this delightful excurſion was mentioned, the novelties they ſaw, the admiration they excited, the elegant inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macies they formed, the amazing ſum they expended, were all deſcribed and exaggerated.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock, an ancient widow, was at preſent on a viſit to them, ſhe had known Fitzalan in his youth, and now, with pleaſure, renewed her intimacy with him, and the account ſhe gave of his family and connections, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed the neighbourhood in his favour: ſhe was a ſhrewd, ſenſible woman, the dignity of her perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded reſpect, but the ſarcaſtic expreſſion of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance prevented her con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

An old chariot belonging to the Earl of Cherbury, which had been for years unemployed in the coach houſe, was brought forth for the purpoſe of conveying Fitzalan and his daughter on their viſits; after a good deal of rubbing and waſhing, it was found tolerable decent, and they proceeded in it to Mr. Kilcorban's, which was about two miles from Caſtle Carberry; a numerous party was already aſſembled, while Amanda was paying her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to Mrs. Kilcorban and Lady Greyſtock, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral whiſper relative to her took place among the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger part of the company, who had formed themſelves into a group quite diſtant from the reſt. One gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſwore, "ſhe was a deviliſh fine girl!" he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded in the remark by another, who extolled her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. "You are a ſimpleton," cried a young lady, who was reckoned a great wit, "I'd engage, for half a crown, to get as fine a colour in Dublin." Her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions laughed, and declared ſhe only ſpoke truth in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo. Mr. Bryan Kilcorban, who leaned on her chair, ſaid, "a bill ſhould be brought into the houſe to tax ſuch complexions: for kill me," continued he, "the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ſo irreſiſtible from nature, it is quite unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to call in art as an auxiliary." He then ſtalked over to Amanda, who ſat by Lady Greyſtock, lolling over her chair, he declared, "he thought the tedious hours would never elapſe, till again bleſſed with her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; of her," he ſaid, "it was ſufficient to have but one glimpſe to make him pant for the ſecond." A ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to dinner relieved her from this nonſenſe; luxury and oſtentation were conſpicuous in the fare and decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the table, and Amanda never felt any hours ſo tedious as thoſe ſhe paſt at it; when the ladies returned to the drawing room, the Miſs Kilcorban's, and their companions, began to examine and admire her dreſs.—"What a pretty pattern this gown is worked in," ſaid one. "What a ſweet becoming cap this is," cried a ſecond. "Well, certainly the Engliſh mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

of you," drawing her at the ſame inſtant to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. I am ſure," ſaid Amanda, "any in my power to grant I ſhall with pleaſure." "Oh really, then, it is in your power; 'tis only to refuſe the pattern of your cap to any girls who may aſk you for it, and to give it to me and my ſiſter, you can't conceive how we doat on being the firſt in the faſhion, one is ſo ſtared at, and ſo envied, I deteſt any thing when it becomes common, you can't think how we are teazed every ſummer, when we return from Dublin, for faſhions, but we always make it a point to refuſe; I muſt tell you a delightful trick I played a friend of mine, ſhe received a large preſent of the moſt beautiful muſlins from India, which ſhe laid by till I returned from town, ſuppoſing I would let her ſee my things, as I always told her I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fond of her; well, I lent her a gown, which was quite old faſhioned, but, aſſured her it was the very neweſt mode, ſhe accordingly had her beautiful muſlins cut in imitation of it, and ſo ſpoiled them from making any other habit; well, we met at an aſſize ball, where all the elegant people of the county were aſſembled, and, I declare, I never ſaw ſo ridiculous a figure as ſhe made; when ſhe found herſelf unlike every one in the room, I really thought ſhe would have fainted, and that my ſiſter and I ſhould have expired with laughing; poor thing, the tears abſolutely trickled down her cheeks, don't you think it was a charming trick?" "Very much ſo," ſaid Amanda, "I think it gave a ſtriking ſpecimen of your humour." "Well my dear," exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miſs Kilcorban, without minding the marked em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis of Amanda's laſt words, "if you allow us, my ſiſter and I will call on you to-morrow and look over your things." "It would be giving yourſelves a great deal of unneceſſary trouble," replied Amanda coolly, who did not by any means reliſh this forward propoſal, "my things can boaſt of little but ſimplicity, and I am always my own milliner." "Really, well, I proteſt you have a great deal of taſte, my maid, who is very handy, would, I think, be able to make up things in pretty much the ſame ſtile, if you, were obliging enough to
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:038416_0182_1011E2D84763E820"/>
give her patterns; if you do, perhaps you will add to the favour, and allow us to ſay they are the neweſt Bath faſhions—was you ever at Bath?" "No." "Oh! then, I aſſure you, you have a monſtrous pleaſure to come; 'tis the ſweeteſt place on earth, quite a paradiſe, I declare I thought I ſhould have died with grief at leaving it; papa has been inexorable ever ſince to our entreaties for a ſecond trip, he ſays the firſt coſt too much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney—indeed it was an enormous ſum, only think how much." "I am the worſt perſon in the world," ſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, "for gueſſing," ſick of her impertinent volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and moving from the window; the evening was fine, and the grounds about the houſe beautiful, ſhe therefore propoſed a walk; at this propoſal, the young ladies, who had hitherto been in deep confab, looked at each other, and remained ſilent for ſome minutes; Miſs Kilcorban, then, who had no notion of gratifying the inclination of her gueſt, by the ſacrifice of her own, ſaid, "it blew a little, and that her hair would be ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Marchelle powder blown from it, by ſuch a walk." Another young lady looking down at her white ſatin ſlippers, vowed ſhe would not venture into the graſs for worlds. A third declared when once dreſſed ſhe could not bear to be tumbled. Amanda had too much politeneſs to repeat her wiſh, and it was therefore unanimouſly agreed among the fair Coterie, that they ſhould continue in the drawing room, to be in <hi>ſtatu quo</hi> for the reappearance of the beaux.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock now beckoned to our heroine to take a ſeat by her, ſhe gladly obeyed. "Well, my dear," ſaid her Ladyſhip, "I hope you have had enough of theſe country miſſes, thoſe would-be miſſes of the ton." Amanda ſmiled aſſentingly. "Heaven defend me, or any one I like," continued her Ladyſhip, "from their clack; the confuſion of Babel was, I really believe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to that their tongues create: yet ſome people have the abſurdity to reckon theſe girls accompliſhed—poor Mrs. Kilcorban torments one with the perfections of her daughters; againſt they are diſpoſed of (which ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines will be very ſoon) ſhe has a new brood of graces

training up to bring out—mercy on me! what a ſet of hoydens—I'd lay my life, at this very inſtant, they are gollopping about the nurſery, like a parcel of wild colts, tearing or tormenting an unfortunate French governeſs, who was formerly <hi>fille de chambre</hi> to a woman of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and does not even underſtand the grammatical part of her own language." "Mrs. Kilcorban's opinion of her children," ſaid Amanda, "is natural, conſidering the partiality of a parent." "Yes—but not more bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on that account," replied her ladyſhip, "and I ſhould endeavour to open her eyes to her folly, if I thought her acquaintance would forgive my depriving them of ſuch a fund of amuſement."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Bryan Kilcorban, with ſome gentlemen, now entered the room, and advanced to Amanda. "So," ſaid he, "you have got by the Dowager, hang me, but I would let my beard grow, if all women reſembled her in their diſpoſitions." "By way of appearing ſagacious I ſuppoſe," ſaid her ladyſhip, who was extremely quick, and had caught the laſt words; "alas! poor youth, no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhments on the exterior would ever be able to make us believe the tenement within well furniſhed;" her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip was now ſummoned to a whiſt table, and Miſs Kilcorban immediately took her vacant ſeat. "My dear creature," ſaid ſhe, are you bored to death? Lady Greyſtock is a queer piece, I can aſſure you; I ſuppoſe ſhe was aſking ſome favour from you, ſuch as to work her an apron, or handkerchief, ſhe is noted every where for requeſting ſuch little jobs, as ſhe calls them; indeed we ſhould never put up with the trouble ſhe gives us, but that ſhe is vaſtly rich, and papa's relation, and has no one ſo nearly connected with her as we are." "All very good reaſons for your complaiſance," replied Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, "but ſhould you not be careful in concealing them." "Oh! Lord, no—every one knows them as well as we do ourſelves; ſhe was here laſt ſummer, and took a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the pattern of an apron of mine, and made me the reaſonable requeſt of working one like it for her; all this ſhe pretended was to prevent my being idle. Well I ſaid I would, and wrote up to the Moravian houſe, in

Dublin, where I had got mine, for one exactly like it; in due time I received it, and preſented it to the Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, certain that in return I ſhould receive a few of her diamond pins, which ſhe had often heard me admire; they are the prettieſt I ever ſaw, and quite unfit for her, but ſhe had the cruelty to diſappoint me." "Upon my faith," cried Mrs. Kilcorban, who had taken a chair at the other ſide of Amanda, and liſtened with evident pleaſure to her daughter's voluble ſpeech, "Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock is an odd being, I never met with any one like her in all my travels through England, Ireland, and Wales; but ſhe is a great orator, and poſſeſſes the gift of the gab in a wonderful degree."</p>
                     <p>Aye indeed, thought Amanda, and you and your fair daughters reſemble her in that reſpect. After tea ſhe was prevailed on to ſit down to commerce, but ſhe ſoon grew as tired of the party as of the game, and loſt on purpoſe to be releaſed; ſhe had hoped for a little more chat with lady Greyſtock, but her ladyſhip was paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fond of cards, and at all times would have preferred the pleaſures of a card table, to the eloquence of a Cicero. Kilcorban, on finding her diſengaged, tormented her with abſurd compliments; a challenge to a brag table at length relieved her from his nonſenſe, and ſhe loiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the card tables till they broke up for ſupper.</p>
                     <p>Amanda always expreſſed to her father her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of any company ſhe had been in, and thoſe ſhe now delivered on quitting the party, perfectly coincided with his; he laughed at the account which the Kilcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans had given of Lady Greyſtock, to whom, he knew, they paid the moſt extravagant flattery, in hopes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome of her large fortune.</p>

                     <p>THE following evening they were engaged at a farmer's; the invitation was given with ſuch humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, yet preſſed with ſuch warmth, that they could not avoid accepting it, and accordingly ſoon after dinner walked to the houſe, which was about a mile from Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Carberry. It was a low thatched building, every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage to it beſpoke neatneſs and comfort, it was ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in a beautiful meadow, encloſed from the road by a hawthorn hedge, and on the oppoſite ſide lay an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive common, on which ſtood the ſtupendous and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ruins of an Abbey, called St. Catherine's; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a melancholy monument of the power of time o'er ſtrength and grandeur, and while they attracted the obſervation of the curious, excited a ſigh in the boſom of ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>The farmer's family conſiſted of three daughters and two ſons, who were now dreſſed in their beſt array; they had aſſembled a number of their neighbours, among whom was a little ſat prieſt, called father O'Gallag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han, conſidered the life of every party, and a blind pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; the room was ſmall, and crowded with furniture, as well as company, it was only divided from the kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by a ſhort paſſage, and the ſteam of hot cakes, and the ſmoke of a turf fire, which iſſued thence, ſoon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it diſtreſſingly warm.

"Oh! honey, father," cried he, "not yet a while, till I get a new ſuit of clothes on, which I ſhall by next Michaelmas." Amanda left them all laughing at this ſtory, and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engaged in converſation with ſome farmers, who were deſiring his intereſt with Lord Cherbury, for new leaſes on moderate terms.</p>
                     <p>Amanda had about a quarter of a mile to walk acroſs the common, the ground was marſhy and uneven, and numerous ſtumps of trees, denoted its having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

man immediately laid the foundation of this Abbey, which he called after his benefactreſs, and to which he and the community he belonged to, removed. The Chapel was roofleſs, but ſtill retained many relics of ſuperſtitious piety, which had eſcaped in a tolerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, both time and weather, ſaints and martyrs were curiouſly cut over the places where the altars and ciſterns for holy water had once ſtood, to which Amanda paſſed through a long ſucceſſion of elegant arches, among which were a number of tomb ſtones, with curious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and unintelligible inſcriptions; half hid in graſs and weeds, on a flag which ſhe perceived muſt have been lately placed there, ſhe ſaw ſome faded flowers ſtrewn, and looking at her companion ſaw a tear dropping from her on them; ſhe gently aſked the cauſe of it, and heard a favourite brother was interred there; the girl moved from the ſpot, but Amanda, detained by an irrepreſſible emotion, ſtaid a minute longer to contemplate the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcene—all was ſilent, ſad, and ſolitary, the graſs grown a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Miſs O'Flannaghan now led her through ſome more windings, when, ſuddenly emerging from them, ſhe found herſelf, to her great ſurpriſe, in a large garden, entirely encompaſſed by the ruins, and in the centre of it ſtood a long low building, which her companion inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her was a convent, a folding door at the ſide opened into the chapel, which they entered, and found a nun praying.</p>

Amanda, drew back, fearful of diſturbing her, but Miſs O'Flannaghan accoſted her whithout ceremony, and the nun returned the ſalutation, with the moſt cordial good humour; ſhe was fifty, as Amanda afterwards heard, for ſhe never could, from her appearance, have conceived her to be ſo much; her ſkin was fair, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free from wrinkle, the bloom and down upon her cheeks as bright and as ſoft as that upon a peach, though her accent at once proclaimed her country, it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harmonious, and the cheerful obligingneſs of her manner amply compenſated the want of elegance; ſhe wore the religious habit of the houſe, which was a looſe flannel dreſs, bound round her waiſt by a girdle, from which hung her beads and a croſs, a veil of the ſame ſtuff de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the ground, and a mob cap and forehead cloth quite concealed her hair<note n="*" place="bottom">

"Ah! my honey," cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, "I am ſorry ſhe is come at a time when ſhe'll ſee us all in the diſmals, for you know we are in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Prioreſs (the altar was hung with black); but my dear (turning to Amanda), do you mean to come here next Sunday, for if you do, you will find us all bright again." Upon Amanda's anſwering in the negative, ſhe continued, "Faith and I am ſorry for that, for I have taken a great fancy to you, and when I like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I always wiſh them as great a chance of happineſs as I have myſelf." Amanda ſmiling, ſaid ſhe believed none could deſire a greater; and the nun obligingly proceeded to ſhew her all the relics and finery of the Chapel; among the former was a head belonging to one of the eleven thouſand virgin martyrs, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a cheſt full of rich ſilks, which pious ladies had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the purpoſe of dreſſing the altar; pulling a drawer from under it, ſhe diſplayed a quantity of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial

flowers, which ſhe ſaid were made by the ſiſters and their ſcholars. Amanda wiſhed to make a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the trouble ſhe had given, and finding they were to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Ay, do," ſaid ſhe, "and you may be ſure of a ſincere welcome, you will ſee a ſet of happy poor creatures, and none hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than myſelf; I entered the convent at ten, I took vows at fifteen, and from that time to the preſent, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They aſcended a few ſteps to the place where the community ſat, it was divided from the body of the Chapel by ſlight raiſing; here ſtood the organ, the nun ſighed as ſhe looked at it, "poor ſiſter Agatha," cried ſhe, "we ſhall never get ſuch another organiſt, ſhe was always fit indeed for the heavenly choir, "oh! my dear," turning to Amanda, "had you known her you would have loved her, ſhe was our late prioreſs, and elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that office at twenty nine, which is reckoned an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly age for it, on account of the cleverneſs it requires, ſhe had held it but two years when ſhe died, and we were never ſo comfortable as during her time, ſhe managed ſo well; the mourning in the chapel, as I have already told you, will be over for her next Sunday, but that which is in our hearts will not be ſo ſpeedily removed." Miſs O'Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naghan now reminded Amanda it was time to return, to which with ſecret reluctance ſhe conſented, the nun preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to ſtay tea, but on hearing of her engagement only reminded her of the promiſed viſit. In their walk back her companion informed Amanda, that the ſociety conſiſted of twelve nuns, their little fortunes, though ſunk in one common fund, were inſufficient to ſupply their neceſſities which compelled them to keep a day ſchool, in which the neighbouring children were inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reading, writing, plain work, embroidery, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial flowers; ſhe alſo added, that the nuns were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go out, but few availed themſelves of that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:038416_0190_1011E2EC18C85088"/>
and that except in faſting, they were ſtrangers to the auſterities practiſed in foreign convents.</p>
                     <p>For ſuch a ſociety Amanda thought nothing could be better adapted than their preſent ſituation; ſheltered by the ruins, like the living entombed among the dead, their wiſhes, like their views, were bounded by the moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing walls, as no object appeared beyond them which could tempt their wandering from their uſual limits; the dreary common which met the view, could not be more bleak and inhoſpitable than the world in general would have proved to the children of poverty and nature.</p>
                     <p>Father O'Gallaghan met the ladies at the door, and, familiarly taking Amanda's hand, ſaid, "why you have ſtaid long enough to be made a nun of; here (ſaid he) the cakes are buttered, the tea made, and we all waiting for you, ah! you little rogue," ſmirking in her face, "by the head of St. Patrick, thoſe twinklers of yours were not given for the good of your ſoul; here you are come to play pell-mell among the hearts of the honeſt Iriſh lads; ah! the devil a doubt but you will have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief enough to anſwer for by and by, and then I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you will be coming to me to confeſs and abſolve you, but remember, my little honey, if you do I muſt be paid before hand." Amanda diſengaged her hand, and entered the parlour, where the company, by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of pocket handkerchiefs on their laps, ſeemed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to make a downright meal of the good things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; the Miſs O'Flannaghans, from the toils of the tea table, at laſt grew as red as the ribbon with which they were profuſely ornamented; the table at length removed, the chairs arranged, and the benches placed in the paſſage for the old folks, the ſignal for a dance was given, by the piper's playing an Iriſh gig, the farmer's eldeſt ſon, habited in a new ſky blue coat, his hair combed ſleek on his forehead, and his complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion as bright as a full blown poppy, advanced to our heroine, and begged with much modeſty, and many bows, ſhe would do him the favour to ſtand up with him; ſhe heſitated a little, when Father O'Gallaghan giving her a tap, or rather ſlap on the ſhoulder, made
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:038416_0191_1011E2EF5190BC10"/>
her ſtart ſuddenly from her ſeat; he laughed heartily at this, declaring, he liked to ſee a girl alive and merry; as he could not join in the dance, he conſoled himſelf with being maſter of the ceremonies, and inſiſted on A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda's dancing and leading off the Prieſt in his boots; ſhe felt little inclined to comply, but ſhe was one of thoſe who can ſacrifice their own inclination to that of others; being directed in the figure by the prieſt, ſhe went down the dance, but the floor being an earthen one, by the time ſhe concluded it, ſhe begged they would excuſe her ſitting the remainder of the evening, ſhe felt ſo extremely fatigued; ſhe and Fitzalan would gladly have declined ſtaying ſupper, but this they found im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, without either greatly mortifying, or abſolutely offending their hoſpitable entertainers.</p>
                     <p>The table was covered with a profuſion of good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try fare, and none ſeemed to enjoy it more truly than the Prieſt, in the intervals of eating, his jeſts flew about in every direction, the ſcope he gave to his vivacity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilerated the reſt, ſo that like Falſtaff, he was not only witty himſelf, but a promoter of wit in others. "Pray, father," ſaid a young man to him, "what do you give in return for all the good cheer you get?" "My bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be ſure," replied he, "what better could I give?" "Ay, ſo you may think, but that is not the caſe with us all, I promiſe you, 'tis ſo Pat, I muſt tell you a ſtory about that ſame thing called a Prieſt's bleſſing.—A poor man went one day to a prieſt, who had the name of being very rich and very charitable, but as all we hear is not goſpel, ſo the poor man doubted a little the truth of the latter report, and reſolved on trying him,—"Father," ſays he, "I have met with great loſſes, my cabin was burned, my pigs ſtolen, and my cow fell into a ditch and broke her neck; ſo I am come to aſk your reverence, for the love of heaven, to lend me a crown."—"A crown," repeated the angry and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prieſt, "oh! you rogue, where do you think I could get money to lend, except, like yourſelf, I had pilfered and ſtolen." "Oh! that is neither here nor there, replied the man, "you know I cleared the ſcore on my
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:038416_0192_1011E2F2E0A6C7A8"/>
conſcience with you long ago; ſo tell me, father, if you will lend me a half a crown?" "No, nor a ſhilling;" "Well, a farthing then, anything from ſuch a good man as you." "No," ſaid the prieſt, "not a mite." "Mayn't I have your bleſſing," then aſked the man? "Oh! that you ſhall and welcome, replied he, ſmiling. "Why then, father," returned the other, "I would refuſe it if you forced it upon me, for d'ye ſee, had it been worth one farthing you would have refuſed it to me."</p>
                     <p>"You have put me in mind of a very curious ſtory," exclaimed another young man, as this one concluded his. "A young knight went into a chapel in Spain one morning, where he obſerved a monk ſtanding in a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating attitude, with a box in his hand: he aſked him what this was for, and learned, to collect money for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſouls of fifty Chriſtians out of purgatory, whom the Moors had murdered; the knight threw a piece of money into the box, and the monk, after repeating a ſhort prayer, exclaimed, "there is one ſoul redeemed." The knight threw in a ſecond, and the prieſt, after the ſame ceremony, cried, "there is another free." Thus they both went on, one giving and the other praying, till by the monk's account all the ſouls were free: "Are you ſure of this?" inquired the knight, "Ay," replied the prieſt, they are all aſſembled together at the gate of heaven, which St. Peter gladly opened for them, and they are now joyfully ſeated in Paradiſe. "From whence they cannot be removed, I ſuppoſe," ſaid the knight. "Removed!" repeated the aſtoniſhed prieſt, "no, the world itſelf might be eaſier moved." "Then, if you pleaſe holy father, return me my ducats, they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the purpoſe for which they were given, and as I am only a poor cavalier, without a chance of being as happily ſituated, at leaſt for ſome years, as the ſouls we have mutually contributed to releaſe, I ſtand in great need of them."</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan was ſurpriſed at the freedom with which they treated the prieſt, but he laughed as merrily as the reſt at their ſtories, for he knew that though they ſometimes
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:038416_0193_1011E2F46F770BF8"/>
allowed themſelves a little latitude, they neither wiſhed nor attempted to ſhake off his power.</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan and Amanda withdrew as early as poſſible from the party, which if it wanted every other charm, had that of novelty, at leaſt to them. The next morning Amanda repaired to the Convent, and inquired for ſiſter Mary, the good natured nun ſhe had ſeen the preceding evening; ſhe immediately made her appearance, and was delighted at ſeeing Amanda, ſhe conducted her to the ſchool room, where the reſt of the nuns and the pupils were aſſembled, and Amanda was delighted with the content and regularity which appeared in the ſociety, as well as the obliging eagerneſs they ſhewed to gratify her curioſity; they led her through the houſe, which contained a number of apartments, every nun having one to herſelf, furniſhed with a bed, chair, table, and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Siſter Mary diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but returned in a few minutes with cakes and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant wine, which ſhe forced Amanda to take; the good ſiſter was enchanted with her young viſitor, and having no idea of concealing her feelings, ſhe openly expreſſed her admiration.—"Dear mother," ſaid ſhe, addreſſing the Prioreſs, "is ſhe not a lovely creature, what pretty eyes ſhe has got, and what ſweet little hands; oh! if our bleſſed Lady would but touch her heart and make her become one of us, I ſhould be ſo happy." The Prior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs ſmiled, ſhe was not ſo great an enthuſiaſt as ſiſter Mary, "it would be a pity," ſaid ſhe ſo ſweet a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:038416_0194_1011E2F6CDF7BAB8"/>
ſhould be hid amidſt the ruins of St. Catherine's."</p>
                     <p>Amanda made an addition to her flowers, ſhe was thanked by the nuns, and entreated to favour them often with a viſit; juſt as ſhe reached Caſtle Carberry ſhe ſaw the Kilcorban's carriage ſtop at it, from which Lady Greyſtock, and the young ladies alighted, they both ſpoke at once, and ſo extremely faſt, that Amanda ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood what they ſaid; they declared a thouſand impertinent viſitors had prevented their coming the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding morning, and looking at the things ſhe had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly promiſed to ſhew them. Amanda recollected no ſuch promiſe, but would not contradict them and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their taking what patterns they liked. Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock ſmiled ſarcaſtically at her young kinſ women, and expreſſed a wiſh to ſee the Caſtle, Amanda led her through it; her ladyſhip was particularly pleaſed with the dreſſing room; here the young ladies, with rude and eager curioſity, examined every thing, but her ladyſhip, who was full as curious as themſelves, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn freedoms ſhe took herſelf; obſerving a petticoat in a tambour frame, ſhe admired the pattern, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was deſigned by Amanda, extolled her fine taſte, and declared ſhe ſhould of all things like to have one worked in the ſame; this hint was too plain to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, Amanda wiſhed to oblige particularly any one advanced in life, and told her ladyſhip ſhe would work one for her. Lady Greyſtock ſmiled moſt graciouſly at this, and preſſing her hand, declared ſhe was a charming girl. The Miſs Kilcorbans winked ſlyly, and taking her hand in turn, aſſured her they had conceived a moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent friendſhip for her, and hoped ſhe would often fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them with her company. Amanda anſwered theſe inſincere profeſſions with cool civility, and the viſitors departed.</p>

                     <p>SOLITUDE to Amanda was a luxury, as it afforded her opportunities of indulging the ideas on which her heart delighted to dwell; ſhe yet believed ſhe ſhould ſee Lord Mortimer, and that Lord Cherbury's ſanctioning their attachment, would remove the delicate ſcruples of her father. From ſoothing his paſſing hours, beguiling her own with the accompliſhments ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and indulging the tender ſuggeſtions of hope, a pleaſure aroſe ſhe thought ill exchanged for the trifling gaiety of the parties ſhe was frequently invited to; ſhe was never at a loſs for amuſement within Caſtle Carber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or about its domain; the garden became the object of her peculiar care, its ſituation was romantic, and long neglect had added to its natural wildneſs. Amanda, in many places, diſcovered veſtiges of taſte, and wiſhed to reſtore all to primeval beauty; the fruit trees were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, the alleys graſs grown, and the flowers choaked with weeds; on one ſide lay a ſmall wilderneſs, which ſurrounded a Gothic temple, and on the other green ſlopes with maſſes of naked rock projecting thro' them; a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Under Amanda's ſuperintending care, the garden ſoon loſt its rude appearance, a new couch was procured for the Hermitage, which ſhe ornamented with ſhells and ſea weeds, rendering it a moſt delightful receſs, the trees were pruned, the alleys cleared of oppoſing bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and over the wall of the Gothic temple ſhe hung the flowers ſhe had purchaſed at St. Catherine's in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful wreaths.</p>
                     <p>She often aſcended the devious path of the mountain, which ſtretched beyond Caſtle Carberry, and beheld the waves glittering in the ſun beams, from which its foli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſheltered her. But no viſionary pleaſures, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful rambles, no domeſtic avocations, made her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful to the calls of benevolence; ſhe viſited the haunts of poverty, and relieved its neceſſities to the utmoſt of her power; the wretchedneſs ſo often conſpicuous among many of the lower rank, filled her not only with compaſſion, but ſurpriſe, as ſhe had imagined that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and a fruitful ſoil were generally attended with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and proſperity; her father to whom ſhe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this idea, informed her that the indigence of the peaſants proceeded, in a great degree, from the emigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their landlords; "their wealth," ſaid he, "is ſpent in foreign lands, inſtead of enriching thoſe from whence it was drawn; policy ſhould ſometimes induce them to viſit their eſtates, the revenue of half a year ſpent on them would neceſſarily benefit the poor wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038416_0198_1011D07548A9BE30"/>
whoſe labours have contributed to raiſe it, and by exciting their gratitude, and inclination to induſtry, and conſequently augment their profits.</p>
                     <p>"The clouds, which are formed by miſts and exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, return to the places from whence they were drawn, in fertalizing ſhowers and refreſhing dews, and almoſt every plant enriches the ſoil from which it ſprung; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, indeed, in all her works, is a glorious precedent to man, but, while enſlaved by diſſipation, he cannot follow her example, and what exquiſite ſources of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment does he loſe—to lighten the toils of labour, to cheer the child of poverty, to raiſe the drooping head of merit!—oh! how ſuperior to the revels of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the oſtentation of wealth.</p>
                     <p>"Real happineſs is forſaken for a gaudy phantom cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led pleaſure, ſhe is ſeldom graſped but for a moment, yet in that moment has power to fix envenomed ſtings within the breaſt; the heart which delights in domeſtic joys, which riſes in pious gratitude to Heaven, which melts at human woe, can alone experience true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The fortitude with which the peaſants bear their ſufferings, ſhould cure diſcontent of its murmurs, they ſupport adverſity without complaining, and thoſe who poſſeſs a pile of turf againſt the ſeverity of winter, a ſmall ſtrip of ground, planted with cabbage and potatoes, a cow, a pig, and ſome poultry, think themſelves complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, though one wretched hovel ſhelters all alike."</p>
                     <p>Oh! how rapturous, thought Amanda, the idea of Lord Mortimer's feeling recurring to her mind, to change ſuch ſcenes, to ſee the clay built hovel vaniſh, and a dwelling of neatneſs and convenience riſe in its ſtead; to wander, continued ſhe, with him whoſe ſoul is fraught with ſenſibility, and view the projects of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, realized by the hand of charity, the faded cheek of miſery regain the glow of health—

and content and cheerfulneſs ſport beneath its ſhades.</p>
                     <p>From ſuch an ecſtatic reverie as this, Amanda was rouſed one morning, by the entrance of the Kilcorbans
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038416_0199_1011D076CE900318"/>
and Lady Greyſtock, into the dreſſing room where ſhe was working, "Oh! my dear," cried the eldeſt of the young ladies, "we have ſuch enchanting news to tell you; only think who is coming down here immediately, your uncle, and aunt, and couſin; an expreſs came this morning from Dublin, where they now are, to the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard at Ulſter Lodge, to have every thing prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt next week for them; "I declare," ſaid Miſs Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, "I ſhall quite envy you the delightful amuſement you will have with them." Amanda bluſhed and felt a little confuſed; "you will have no reaſon then, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy," replied ſhe, "for I really do not know them."</p>
                     <p>"Oh lord!" exclaimed Mrs. Kilcorban, "well, that is very comical, not know your own relations; but perhaps they always lived in Scotland, and you were afraid to croſs the ſea to pay them a viſit." "If that was the only fear ſhe had," ſaid lady Greyſtock, with a ſatirical ſmile, "ſhe could eaſily have ſurmounted it; beſides, would it not have held good with reſpect to one place as well as another?" "Well, I never thought of that," cried Mrs. Kilcorban: "but pray Miſs, may I aſk the reaſon why you did not know them by letter?" "It can be of very little conſequence to you madam," replied Amanda coolly, "to hear it."</p>
                     <p>"They ſay Lady Euphraſia Sutherland is very accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed," exclaimed Miſs Kilcorban, "ſo a correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with her would have been delightful: I dare ſay you write ſweetly yourſelf; ſo if ever you leave Caſtle Carberry, I beg you will favour me with letters, for of all things I doat on a ſentimental correſpondence."</p>
                     <p>"No wonder," ſaid Lady Greyſtock, "you are ſo particularly well qualified to ſupport one."</p>
                     <p>"But, my dear," reſumed Miſs Kilcorban, "we are to give the moſt enchanting ball that ever was given in this world: Papa ſays, we ſhall have full liberty to do as we pleaſe reſpecting it." "It will be a troubleſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, I am afraid," ſaid Mrs. Kilcorban. "We are to have confectioners and French cooks from Dublin," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her daughter, without minding this interruption: "every thing is to be quite in ſtile, and prepared againſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038416_0200_1011D0874E950C28"/>
the third night of the Marquis and Marchioneſs's arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; ſo my dear, you and your papa will hold yourſelves in readineſs for our ſummons." Amanda bowed. "My ſiſter and I are to have dancing dreſſes from town, but I will not give you an idea of the manner in which we have ordered them to be made; I aſſure you, you will be abſolutely ſurpriſed and charmed, when you ſee them:—all the elegant men in the county will be at our entertainment: I dareſay you will be vaſtly buſy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for it."</p>
                     <p>"Nature ſaid Lady Greyſtock, "has been too boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to Miſs Fitzalan, to render ſuch preparations neceſſary."—Oh lord!" cried the young ladies, with a toſs of their heads, "Miſs Fitzalan is not ſuch a fool, I ſuppoſe, as to wiſh to appear unlike every one elſe in her dreſs;" but, riſing with their mamma, and ſaluting her much more formally than they had done at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, "ſhe is the beſt judge of that."</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan had never ſeen the Marchioneſs ſince his marriage, nor did he ever again wiſh to behold her; the inhumanity with which ſhe had treated her lovely ſiſter; the malice with which ſhe had augmented her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's reſentment againſt that poor ſufferer, had ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed his mind with ideas of the ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and implacability of her's, as to excite ſentiments of diſtaſte and averſion for her: he conſidered her as the uſurper of his children's rights; as acceſſary to the death of his adored Malvina, and conſequently the author of the agonies he endured—agonies which time, aided by religion could ſcarcely conquer.</p>

                     <p>AT the expected time, the Marquis and his family arrived, with great ſplendor, at Ulſter Lodge, which was immediately crouded with viſitors of the firſt conſequence in the county, among whom were the Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corbans, whoſe affluent fortune gave them great reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability. Mr. Kilcorban wiſhed, indeed, to be firſt in paying his compliments to the Marquis, who had a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough in his diſpoſal, he was deſirous of being returned for; diſappointed the laſt time he ſat up as one of the candidates for the county, this was his only chance of entering that houſe he had long been ambitious for a ſeat in; he knew, indeed his oratorical powers were not very great, often ſaying, he had not the gift of the gab like many of the honourable gentlemen; but then he ſhould ſtamp and ſtare, and look up to gods and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>The female part of his family went from Ulſter Lodge to Caſtle Carberry, which they entered with a more conſequential air than ever, as if they derived new conſequence from the viſit they had been paying; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of flying up to Amanda, as uſual, the young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſwam into the room, with what they imagined a moſt bewitching elegance, and making a ſliding curteſy,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038416_0202_1011D24CFB1624F8"/>
flung themſelves upon a ſofa, exactly oppoſite a glaſs, and alternately viewed themſelves, and purſued their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on Lady Euphraſia's dreſs: "Well, certainly, Alicia," ſaid Miſs Kilcorban, "I will have a morning gown made in imitation of her Ladyſhip's; that frill of fine lace about the neck, is the moſt becoming thing in nature; and the pale blue lining ſweetly adapted for a delicate complexion."—"I think, Charlotte," cried Miſs Alicia, "I will have my tambour muſlin in the ſame ſtile, but lined with pink to ſet off the work."</p>
                     <p>"This aunt of your's, my dear," exclaimed Mrs. Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corban, "is really a perſonable looking woman enough, and her daughter a pretty little ſort of body."</p>
                     <p>"Oh they are charming creatures," cried both the young ladies, "ſo elegant, ſo irreſiſtibly genteel."</p>
                     <p>"Your ideas and mine, then," ſaid lady Greyſtock, "differ widely about elegance and irreſiſtibility, if you aſcribe either to the ladies in queſtion: Mr. Kilcorban," continued ſhe, turning to Amanda, "feared, I believe, my Lord Marquis would fly acroſs the ſea in a few hours, and that he might catch him ere he took wing, never ceaſed tormenting us, from the time breakfaſt was over 'till we entered the carriage, to make haſte, though he might have known it was quite too early for fine folks to be viſible.</p>
                     <p>"Well, we poſted off to Ulſter Lodge, as if life and death depended on our diſpatch; Mr. Kilcorban was uſhered into the Marquis's ſtudy, and we into an empty room, to amuſe ourſelves, if we pleaſed, with the portraits of the Marquis's anceſtors. Whilſt bells in all quarters were tingling—maids and footmen run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up and down ſtairs, and cats, dogs, monkeys, and parrots, who I found compoſed part of their travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retinue, were ſcratching, barking, chattering, and ſcreaming in a room contigious to the one we occupied. At length a fine perfumed jeſſamy made his appearance, and ſaying the ladies were ready to have the honour of receiving us ſkipt up ſtairs like an Harlequin. The Marchioneſs advanced about two ſteps from her couch to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038416_0203_1011D25189FE1B00"/>
receive us, and Lady Euphraſia half roſe from her ſeat, after contemplating us for a minute, to know whether we were to be conſidered as human creatures or not, ſunk back into her former attitude of elegant l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ngour, and continued her converſation with a young Nobleman, who has accompanied them from England.</p>
                     <p>"Well, I hope you will allow he is a divine creature," exclaimed Miſs Kilcorban, in an accent of rapture; "Oh, what eyes he has," cried her ſiſter, "what an harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous voice, I really never beheld any one ſo exquiſitely handſome."</p>
                     <p>"Lord Mortimer, indeed," ſaid Lady Greyſtock: Amanda ſtarted, bluſhed, turned pale—panted as if for breath, and ſtared as if in amazement. "Bleſs me, Miſs Fitzalan," aſked her Ladyſhip, "are you ill?" No, madam," replied Amanda, in a trembling voice, "'tis only—'tis only a little palpitation of the heart I am ſubject to: I have interrupted your Ladyſhip, pray proceed."—"Well," continued Lady Greyſtock, "I was ſaying that Lord Mortimer was one of the moſt el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egant and engaging young men I had ever beheld; his expreſſive eyes ſeemed to reprove the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>olly of his fair companion, and her neglect made him doubly aſſiduous, which to me was a moſt convincing proof of a noble mind."</p>
                     <p>How did the heart of Amanda ſwell with pleaſure, at this warm eulogium on Lord Mortimer; the tear of delight, of refined affection, ſprung to her eye, and could ſcarcely be prevented falling.</p>
                     <p>"Lord madam," cried Miſs Kilcorban, whoſe pride was mortified at Amanda's hearing of the cool reception they had met with; "I can't conceive the reaſon you aſcribe ſuch rudeneſs and conceit to Lady Eaphraſia: 'tis really quite a miſconſtruction of the etiquette neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be obſerved by people of rank."</p>
                     <p>"I am glad, my dear," replied Lady Greyſtock, "you are now beginning to profit by the many leſſons I have given you on humility."</p>
                     <p>"I aſſure you Miſs," ſaid Mrs. Kilcorban, "I did not forget to tell the Marchioneſs ſhe had a niece in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038416_0204_1011D2531E227658"/>
neighbourhood: I thought, indeed, ſhe ſeemed a little ſhy on the ſubject, ſo I ſuppoſe there has been a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the families, particularly as you don't viſit her; but at our ball, perhaps, every thing may be ſettled." Amanda made no reply to this ſpeech, and the ladies departed.</p>
                     <p>Her boſom, as may well be ſuppoſed, was agitated with the moſt violent perturbations, on hearing of Lord Mortimer's being in the neighbourhood; the pleaſure ſhe felt at the firſt intelligence, gradually ſubſided, on reflecting he was an inmate, probably a friend of thoſe relations, who had contributed to the deſtruction of her mother; and who, from the character ſhe had heard of them, it was not uncharitable to think, would feel no great regret, if her children experienced a deſtiny equally ſevere, might they not imbibe ſome prejudices againſt her into his boſom; to know ſhe was the child of the unfortunate Malvina, would be enough to provoke their enmity; or if they were ſilent, might not lady Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, adorned, with every advantage of rank and fortune, have won, or at leaſt ſoon win, his affections.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſcarcely did theſe ideas obtrude, 'ere ſhe reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf for them, as injurious to Lord Mortimer, from whoſe noble nature ſhe thought ſhe might believe his conſtancy never would be ſhaken, except ſhe herſelf gave him reaſon to relinquiſh it.</p>
                     <p>She now cheered her deſponding ſpirits, by recalling the ideas ſhe had long indulged with delight, as her reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was ſtill a ſecret to the Edwins, whoſe letters to their daughter were, by Fitzalans orders, conſtantly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to a diſtant town from whence her's, in return, were ſent; ſhe concluded chance had informed Lord Mortimer of it, and flattered herſelf, that to avoid the ſuſpicion which a ſolitary journey to Ireland might create in the mind of Lord Cherbury, he had availed himſelf of the Marquis's party, and come to try whether ſhe was unchanged, and her father would ſanction their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'ere he avowed it to the Earl.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt fluctuating between hope and fear, Ellen, all pale and breathleſs, ran into the room, exclaiming, "He
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038416_0205_1011D25618A59DB8"/>
is come! he is come! Lord Mortimer is come."</p>
                     <p>"Oh heavens!" ſighed Amanda, ſinking back in her chair, and dropping her trembling hands before her El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len alarmed, blamed herſelf for her precipitation, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a cabinet, ſnatched a bottle of lavender water from it, which ſhe plentifully ſprinkled over her, and then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted her to a window. "I was ſo flurried," cried the good natured girl, as ſhe ſaw her miſtreſs recovering, "I did not know what I was about; heaven knows, the ſight of poor Chip himſelf could not have given me more pleaſure; I was croſſing the hall when I ſaw his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip alighting, and to be ſure, if one of the old warriors had ſtept out of his niche, and the teſil take them all, I ſay, for they grin ſo horribly, they frighten me out of my wits, if I go through the hall of a dark evening; ſo if one of them old fellows, as I was ſaying had jumped out, I could not have peen more ſtartled, and pack I ran into the little parlour, and there I heard his Lordſhip enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for my maſter; to be ſure the ſound of his voice did my heart good, for he is an old friend, as one may ſay; ſo as ſoon as he went into the ſtudy, I ſtole up ſtairs; and one may gueſs what he and my maſter are talking apout, I think."</p>
                     <p>The emotion of Amanda increaſed: ſhe trembled ſo ſhe could not ſtand: ſhe felt as if her deſtiny, her future happineſs, depended on this minute. In vain ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to regain compoſure; her ſpirits were wound up to the higheſt pitch of expectation, and the agitations inſeparable from ſuch a ſtate, were not to be repreſt.</p>
                     <p>She continued near an hour in this ſituation, when the voice of Mortimer ſtruck her ear; ſhe ſtarted up, and ſtanding in the centre of the room, ſaw him walking down the lawn with her father, who le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t him when he had reached the gate, where his ſervants and horſes were. The chill of diſappointment pervaded the heart of Amanda, and a ſhower of tears fell from her. Ellen, who had remained in the room, was almoſt as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed as her miſtreſs; ſhe muttered ſomething about the inconſtancy of men; they were all, for her part, ſhe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038416_0206_1011D257D9598468"/>
occaſion. The dinner bell now ſummoned Amanda; ſhe dried her eyes, and tied on a little ſtraw hat, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their redneſs. With much confuſion ſhe appeared before her father; his penetrating eye was inſtantly ſtruck with her agitation and pallid looks, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured ſhe knew of the viſit he had received; on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that viſit, he wondered not at the ſtrength of her attachment; the noble and ingenuous air of Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, had immediately prepoſſeſſed Fitzalan in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; he ſaw him adorned with all thoſe perfections which are calculated to make a ſtrong and permanent impreſſion on a heart of ſenſibility, and he gave a ſigh to the cruel neceſſity which compelled him to ſeparate two beings of ſuch congenial lovelineſs; but as that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity neither was or could be overcome, he rejoiced that Lord Mortimer, inſtead of viſiting him on account of his daughter, had merely come on account of affairs relative to the caſtle, and had inquired for her with a coolneſs which ſeemed to declare his love totally ſubdued; not the ſmalleſt hint relative to the letter, in which he had propoſed for, her, dropt from him; and Fitzalan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, his affections were transferred to ſome object, more the favourite of fortune, than his portionleſs Amanda.</p>
                     <p>This object, he was inclined to believe Lady Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia Sutherland, from what Lord Cherbury had ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſplendid alliance he had in view for his ſon, and from Lord Mortimer's accompanying the Roſline family to Ireland.</p>
                     <p>He felt he had not fortitude to mention thoſe conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to Amanda; he rather wiſhed ſhe ſhould imbibe them from her own obſervation, and pride, he then truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would come to her aid, and ſtimulate her to overcome her attachment. Dinner paſſed in ſilence; when the ſervant was withdrawn, he reſolved to relieve the anxiety which her looks informed him preſt upon her heart, by mentioning the viſit of Lord Mortimer; he came, he told her, merely to ſee the ſtate the caſtle was in, and thus proceeded: "Lord Mortimer is, indeed, an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038416_0207_1011D25D1B8CBC00"/>
and ſenſible young man, and will do honour to the houſe from whence he is deſcended: he had long wiſhed, he told me, to viſit this eſtate, which was endeared to him by the remembrance of his juvenile days; but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by its being the place of his mother's nativity, and her favourite reſidence, and the opportunity of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling with an agreeable party, had determined him no longer to defer gratifying this wiſh.</p>
                     <p>"He mentioned his mother in terms of the trueſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and tenderneſs, and his ſoftened voice, his tearful eye, proclaimed his heart the manſion of ſenſibility; his virtues, like his praiſes, will do honour to her memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He had been told the caſtle was in a very ruinous ſtate, and was agreeably ſurpriſed to find it in as good order as could be expected, from its ancient date. He deſired to ſee the garden, which had been laid out under the direction of his mother; he expected not to have found a veſtage of her taſte remaining, and was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently charmed to find himſelf miſtaken; every ſpot appeared to remind him of ſome happy hour, eſpecially the Gothic temple; how many happy minutes have I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this place, ſaid his Lordſhip, after a ſilence for ſome time, with the beſt of women. Upon my word, Amanda," continued Fitzalan, "you have ornamented it in a very fanciful manner; I really thought his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would have ſtolen ſome of your lilies or roſes, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined them ſo accurately." Amanda bluſhed, and her father ſtill perceiving expectation in her eyes, thus went on: "His Lordſhip looked at ſome of the adjacent grounds, and as he has mentioned what improvements he thought neceſſary to be made in then, I fancy he will not repeat his viſit or ſtay much longer in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom."</p>
                     <p>In a few minutes after this converſation, Fitzalan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to his library, and Amanda to the garden; ſhe haſtened to the temple—never had ſhe before thought it ſo pictureſque, or ſuch an addition to the landſcape; the ſilence of Lord Mortimer, on entering it, ſhe did not, like her father, believe proceeded altogether from retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſcenes of former happineſs with his mother: no,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038416_0208_1011D25EAC50AA60"/>
ſaid ſhe, in this ſpot he alſo, perhaps, thought of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda.</p>
                     <p>True, he had mentioned her with indifference to her father, but that might (and ſhe would flatter herſelf it did) proceed from reſentment, excited by her precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate flight from Wales, at a period when his received addreſſes gave him a right to information about all her actions; and by her total neglect of him ſince; their firſt interview, ſhe truſted, would effect a reconciliation, by producing an explanation; her father then, ſhe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered herſelf, tender as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e was, depending on her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and prepoſſeſſed in Lord Mortimer's favour, would no longer oppoſe their attachment, but allow Lord Cherbury to be informed of it, who, ſhe doubted not, would in this, as well as every other inſtance, prove himſelf truly feeling and diſintereſted.</p>
                     <p>Thus did Amanda, by encouraging ideas agreeable to her wiſhes, try to ſoften the diſappointment ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the morning. Fitzalen, on meeting his daughter at tea, was not ſurpriſed to hear ſhe had been in the Gothic temple, but he was to ſee her wear ſo cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an appearance; he was no ſtranger to the human heart, and he was convinced ſome flattering illuſion could alone have enabled her to ſhake off the ſadneſs with which, but an hour before, ſhe had been oppreſt; the ſooner ſuch an illuſion was removed, the better: and to allow her to ſee Lord Mortimer, he imagined would be the moſt effectual meaſure for ſuch a purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The more he reflected on that young nobleman's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and what he himſelf had heard from Lord Cherbury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more he was convinced Lady Euphraſia Sutherland was not only the object deſtined for Lord Mortimer, but the one who now poſſeſſed his affections; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his viſit to Caſtle Carberry had been purpoſely made, to announce the alteration of his ſentiments by the coldneſs of his conduct, and check any hopes which his appearance in the neighbourhood might have created.</p>
                     <p>He had heſitated about Amanda's accepting the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Kilcorban's ball, but he now determined ſhe ſhould go, impreſt with the idea of her being there
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038416_0209_1011D261E6583538"/>
convinced of the change in Lord Mortimer's ſentiments, a conviction he deemed neceſſary to produce one in her own.</p>
                     <p>Amanda impatiently longed for this night, which ſhe believed would realiſe either her hopes or ſears.</p>

                     <p>THE wiſhed for night at lenght arrived, and Amanda arrayed herſelf for it with a fluttering heart; the reflection of her mirror did not depreſs her ſpirits: hope had increaſed the brilliancy of her eyes, and given and additional glow to her complexion. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, who delighted in the charms of her dear young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, declared, many of the Iriſh ladies would have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to envy her that night; and Fitzalan, when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the parlour was ſtruck with her ſurpaſſing loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he gazed on her with a rapture that brought tears into his eyes, and felt a ſecret pride at the idea of the Marchioneſs beholding this ſweet deſcendant of her neglected ſiſter's:
<q>
                           <l>Into ſuch beauty ſpread, and blown ſo fair,</l>
                           <l>Tho' poverty's cold wind, and cruſhing rain</l>
                           <l>Beat keen and heavy on her tender years.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>"No," ſaid he to himſelf, "the titled Euphraſia, if ſhe equals, cannot at leaſt ſurpaſs my Amanda; meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

and innocence dwell upon the brow of my child—but the haughty Marchioneſs will teach pride to lower upon Lady Euphraſia."</p>
                     <p>Amanda, on reaching Grangeville, found the avenue full of carriages; the lights diſperſed through the houſe, gave it quite the appearance of an illumination; it ſeemed indeed the manſion of gaiety and ſplendour; her knees trembled as ſhe aſcended the ſtairs, ſhe wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for time to compoſe herſelf, but the door opened, her name was announced, and Mrs. Kilcorban came forward to receive her. The room, though ſpacious, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely crouded; it was decorated in a fanciful manner with feſtoons of flowers, intermingled with variegated lamps; immediately over the entrance was the orcheſtra, and oppoſite to it ſat the Marchioneſs, and her party. The heart of Amanda beat if poſſible, with increaſed quickneſs, on the approach of Mrs. Kilcorban, and her voice was loſt in her emotions; recollecting, however, that the ſcrutinizing eyes of Lord Mortimer, and her imperious relations were now on her, ſhe almoſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately recovered compoſure, and with her uſual elegance, walked up the room. Moſt of the company were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to her, and ſhe heard a general buzz of "Who is ſhe?" accompanied with expreſſions of admiration from the gentlemen, among whom were the officers of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon town near Grangeville. Confuſed by the notice ſhe attracted, ſhe haſtened to the firſt ſeat ſhe found va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, which was near the Marchioneſs.</p>
                     <p>Univerſal, indeed, was the admiration ſhe had excited among the male part of the company, by her beauty, unaffected graces, and ſimplicity of dreſs.</p>
                     <p>She wore a robe of pale white luteſtring, and a crape turban, ornamented with a plume of drooping feathers; ſhe had no appearance of finery, except a chain of pearls about her boſom, from which hung her mother's picture, and a light wreath of embroidered laurel, intermingled with ſilver bloſſoms round her petticoat. Her hair in its own native and gloſſy hue, floated on her ſhoulders and partly ſhaded a cheek, where the purity of the lily was tinted with the ſofteſt bloom of the roſe; on gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038416_0211_1011D269DC1675D0"/>
a ſeat, her confuſion ſubſided: ſhe looked up, and the firſt eyes ſhe met, were thoſe of Lord Mortimer (who leaned on Lady Euphraſia Sutherland's chair) faſtened on her face with a ſcrutinizing earneſtneſs, as if he wiſhed to penetrate the receſſes of her heart, and diſcover whether he yet retained a place in it; ſhe bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and looking from him, perceived ſhe was an object of critical attention to the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia; there was a malignant expreſſion in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which abſolutely ſhocked her; and ſhe felt a ſenſation of horror at beholding the former, who had ſo largely contributed to the ſorrows of her mother. "Can it be poſſible," ſaid Lady Euphraſia, replying to a young and elegant officer who ſtood by her, in a tone of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and with an impertinent ſneer, "that you think her handſome?" "Handſome!" exclaimed he with warmth, as if involuntarily repeating her Ladyſhip's word, "I think her bewitchingly irreſiſtible; they told me I was coming to the land of ſaints;" but glancing his ſparkling eyes around, and fixing them on Amanda, "I find it's the land of goddeſſes."</p>
                     <p>The Marchioneſs haughtily frowned—Lady Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia ſmiled ſatirically, toſſed her head, and played with her fan: the propenſities to envy and ill-nature, which the Marchioneſs had ſhewn in her youth were not leſs viſible in age; as they were then excited on her own account, ſo were they now on her daughter's, to engroſs praiſe and admiration for her, ſhe wiſhed beauty blaſted, and merit extirpated; nor did ſhe ever fail, when in her power, to depreciate one, and caſt an invidious cloud of calumny over the other. She beheld Amanda with envy and hatred, notwithſtanding her partiality to her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe could not avoid ſeeing her vaſt inferiority in point of perſonal charms, to her young relation. True, Lady Euphraſia poſſeſſed a fortune, which would always enſure her attention, but it was that unimpaſſioned and ſtudied attention ſelfiſhneſs dictates, the mere tribute of flattery. How different from the ſpontaneous attention which Amanda excited, who though portionleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038416_0212_1011D26B6AE58588"/>
was beheld with admiration, followed with praiſe, and courted with aſſiduity.</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia's mind was the counter-part of her mother's; but in her figure ſhe reſembled her father; her ſtature was low, and her features contracted, and though of the ſame age as Amanda, her harſh expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made her appear much older; though bleſſed with the abundant gifts of fortune, ſhe was unhappy, if, from any one's manner, ſhe conceived that they thought na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not been quite ſo liberal to her. In the dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic circle, conſtant flattery kept her in good humour; but when out, ſhe was frequently chagrined at ſeeing women infinitely below her in rank and fortune, more noticed than herſelf.</p>
                     <p>At the ball ſhe ſuppoſed ſhe ſhould have appeared as little leſs, at leaſt, than a demi goddeſs; art and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were exhauſted in adorning her, and ſhe entered the room with all the inſolence of conſcious rank and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of beauty. As ſhe walked ſhe appeared ſcarcely able to ſupport her delicate frame, and her languiſhing eyes were half cloſed. She could however ſee there was a number of pretty women preſent, and felt diſconcert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the reſpect however which ſhe was paid, a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived her; and having contrived to detain Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by her chair, and Sir Charles Bingley, the young officer already mentioned, who was a Colonel of a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment quartered in an adjacent town; ſhe ſoon felt her ſpirits uncommonly exhilerated, by the attentions of two of the moſt elegant men in the room: and like a proud ſultan, in the midſt of her ſlaves, was enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the compliments ſhe extorted from them by her prefatory ſpeeches. When the door opened, and Amanda, like an angel of light appeared, to diſſolve the miſts of vanity and ſelf importance, Lord Mortimer was ſilent, but his ſpeaking eyes confeſſed his feelings. Sir Charles Bingley, who had no ſecret motive for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing his, openly avowed his admiration, to which Lady Euphraſia replied, as has been already mentioned.</p>
                     <p>All the rapture Sir Charles expreſſed, Lord Mortimer felt; his ſoul ſeemed on the wing to fly to Amanda, to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038416_0213_1011D26D3561B5E0"/>
utter its feelings, to diſcover her's, and chide her for her conduct. This firſt emotion of tenderneſs, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, quickly ſubſided, on recollecting what that conduct had been—how cruelly, how ungratefully ſhe had uſed him:—ſled in the very moment of hope and expectation, leaving him a prey to diſtruſt, anxiety and regret: he dreaded ſome fatal myſtery, ſome improper attachment, (experience had rendered him ſuſpicious) which neither ſhe nor her father could avow: for never did he imagine that the ſcrupulous delicacy of Fitzalan alone had effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſeparation; he ſtill adored Amanda; he neither could or deſired to drive her from his thoughts, except well aſſured ſhe was unworthy of being harboured in them, and felt unutterable impatience to have her myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious conduct explained. From Tudor Hall he had repaired to London, reſtleſs and unhappy; ſoon after his arrival there, the Marquis propoſed his accompanying him to Ireland; this he declined, having reaſon to think Lord Cherbury meditated an alliance for him with his family. The Earl expreſſed regret at his refuſal; he ſaid he wiſhed he would join the Marquis's party, as he wanted his opinion relative to the ſtate of Caſtle Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, where a man of integrity then reſided; who would have any alterations or repairs he might think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, executed in the moſt elegant manner. He mentioned the name of Fitzalan; Lord Mortimer was ſurpriſed and agitated; he concealed his emotions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and with apparent careleſſneſs, aſked a few queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about him, and found that he was indeed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Amanda: ſhe was not mentioned, nor did he dare to enquire concerning her; but he immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that ſince his father wiſhed it ſo much, he would accompany the Marquis. This was extremely pleaſing to that nobleman as he and Lord Cherbury had, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, agreed upon an union between him and Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia, and meant, ſoon, openly to avow their intention. Lord Mortimer ſuſpected, and Lady Euphraſia was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready appriſed of it, and from vanity was pleaſed at the idea of being connected with a man ſo univerſally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired:
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038416_0214_1011D27249C079A8"/>
love was out of the queſtion, for ſhe had not ſufficient ſenſibility to experience it.</p>
                     <p>He, cautious of creating hopes, which he never meant to realize, treated her only with the attention which common politeneſs demanded, and on every occaſion ſeemed to prefer the Marchioneſs's converſation to her's, intending, by this conduct, to cruſh the projected ſcheme, in embrio, and ſpare himſelf the mortification of openly rejecting it; had his heart even been diſengaged, lady Euphraſia could never have been his choice: if Amanda, in reality proved as amiable as he had once reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her, he conſidered himſelf bound, by every tie of honour, as well as love, to fulfil the engagement he had entered into with her. He reſolved, however, to reſiſt every plea of tenderneſs in her favour, except he was thoroughly convinced ſhe ſtill deſerved it; he went to Caſtle Carberry, purpoſely to make a diſplay of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and prevent any ideas being entertained of his having followed her to Ireland; he deemed himſelf juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable in touching her ſenſibility, (if indeed ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed any for him) by an appearance of coldneſs and inattention; but determined after a little retaliation of this kind on her, for the pain ſhe had made him endure, to come to an explanation, and be guided by its reſult, relative to his conduct in future to her.</p>
                     <p>The character of a perfect ſtranger was the one he was to ſupport throughout the evening; but her loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the gallantry of Sir Charles Bingley, tempted him, a thouſand times to break through the reſtraint he had impoſed on himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia were not the only perſons diſpleaſed by the charms of Amanda; the Miſs Kilcorbans ſaw, with evident mortification, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with chiefly engroſſing; their diſappointment was doubly ſevere, after the pain, trouble and expence they had undergone, in ornamenting their perſons:—after the ſuggeſtions of their vanity, and the flattering encomiums of their mamma, who preſided herſelf at
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038416_0215_1011D276E94961B8"/>
their toilet, every moment exclaiming, "Well, well, heaven help the men to night, girls."</p>
                     <p>They fluttered acroſs the room to Amanda, ſweeping at leaſt two yards of painted tiffany after them: aſſured her they were extremely glad to ſee her, but were afraid ſhe was unwell, as ſhe never looked ſo ill. Amanda aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them ſhe was conſcious of no indiſpoſition, and the harmony of her features remained undiſturbed. Miſs Kilcorban, in a half whiſper, declared the Marchioneſs had never ſmiled ſince ſhe had entered the room. and feared her mamma had committed a great miſtake in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting them together. The rudeneſs of this ſpeech ſhocked Amanda: an indignant ſwell heaved her boſom, and ſhe was about replying to it as it deſerved, when Miſs Alicia ſtopt her, by proteſting, ſhe believed Lord Mortimer dying for Lady Euphraſia. Amanda invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily raiſed her eyes at this ſpeech, but inſtead of Lord Mortimer, beheld Sir Charles Bingley, who was ſtanding behind the young ladies. "Am I pardonable," cried he, ſmiling, "for diſturbing ſo charming a trio; but a ſoldier is taught never to neglect a good opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and one ſo propitious as the preſent for the wiſh of my heart, might not again offer." The Miſs Kilcorbans bridled up at this ſpeech; played their fans, and ſmiled moſt graciouſly on him, certainly concluding he meant to engage one or other for the firſt ſet; paſſing gently between them, he bowed gracefully to Amanda, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the honour of her hand; ſhe gave an aſſenting ſmile, and he ſeated himſelf beſide her, 'till the dancing commenced; the ſiſters caſt a malignant glance over them, and ſwam off with a contemptuous indifference.</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia had expected Sir Charles and Lord Mortimer would have been competitors for her hand, and was infinitely provoked by the deſertion of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to her lovely couſin; he was a faſhionable and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated young man, whom ſhe had often honoured with her notice in England, and wiſhed to enliſt in the train of her ſuppoſed adorers. Lord Mortimer could ſcarcely reſtore her good humo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r by engaging her. Almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after him young Milcorban advanced, for the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038416_0216_1011D031D3611EE0"/>
ſame purpoſe, and Lord Mortimer ſincerely regretted he had been beforehand with him. The little fop was quite chagrined at finding her ladyſhip engaged, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the next ſet he might have the ſupreme honour, and ecſtatic felicity, of her hand; this, with the moſt impertinent affectation, ſhe promiſed if able to endure the fatigue of another dance.</p>
                     <p>Amanda was next couple to Lady Euphraſia, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, therefore, to calm her ſpirits, which the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Miſs Kilcorban had diſcompoſed, and attend to the lively converſation of Sir Charles, who was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſing and entertaining. Lord Mortimer watched them with jealous attention; his wandering glances were ſoon noticed by Lady Euphraſia, and her frowns and ſarcaſtic ſpeeches evinced her diſpleaſure at them. He tried to recollect himſelf, and act as politeneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; ſhe, not ſatisfied with fixing his attention, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to attract Sir Charles's; ſhe ſpoke to him acroſs Amanda, but all her efforts were here ineffectual; he ſpoke and laughed with her ladyſhip, but his eyes could not be withdrawn from the angelic countenance of his partner. Amanda's hand trembled, as in turning ſhe preſented it to Lord Mortimer; but though he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his, he did not touch it; there was a ſlight in this, which pierced Amanda's heart; ſhe ſighed, unconſcious of doing ſo to herſelf: not ſo Sir Charles; he aſked her, ſmiling, to where, or whom, that ſigh was wafted. This made Amanda recall her wandering thoughts; ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed an air of ſprightlineſs, and went down the dance with much animation. When finiſhed, Sir Charles led her to a ſeat near the one Lady Euphraſia and Lord Mortimer occupied; ſhe ſaw the eyes of his lordſhip of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten directed towards her, and her heart fluttered at the pleaſing probability of being aſked to dance by him. Sir Charles regretted that the old faſhioned cuſtom of not changing partners was over, and declared he could not leave her, 'till ſhe had promiſed him her hand for the third ſet: this ſhe could not refuſe, and he left her with reluctance, (as the gentlemen were again ſtanding up) to ſeek a partner. At the ſame moment Lord Mortimer
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038416_0217_1011D27B6B5DBEE0"/>
quitted lady Euphraſia: oh! how the boſom of Amanda throb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed, when ſhe ſaw him approach and look at her; he pauſed—a faintiſhneſs came over her—he caſt another glance on her, and paſſed on;—her eye followed him, and ſhe ſaw him take out Miſs Kilcorban.</p>
                     <p>This, indeed, was a diſappointment; propriety, ſhe thought, demanded his dancing the firſt ſet with Lady Euphraſia, but if not totally indifferent, ſurely he would not have neglected engaging her for the ſecond: "Yes," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "he has totally forgotten me: Lady Euphraſia is now the object, and he only pays attention to thoſe who can contribute to her amuſement." Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gentlemen endeavoured to prevail on her to dance, but ſhe pleaded fatigue, and ſat ſolitary in a window, apparently regarding the gay aſſembly, but in reality, too much engroſſed by painful thoughts to do ſo. The woods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſilvered by the beams of the moon, recalled the venerable ſhades of Tudor Hall to memory, where ſhe had ſo often rambled by the ſame pale beams, and heard vows of unchangeable regard—vows regiſtered in her heart, yet now without the hope of having them fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The dancing over, the company repaired to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther room for refreſhments. Amanda, abſorbed in thought, heeded not their almoſt total deſertion, till young Kilcorban, capering up to her, declared ſhe looked as loneſome as a hermit in his cell, and laughing in her face, turned off with careleſs impertinence; he had not noticed her before that night: he was indeed one of thoſe little Fluttering inſects, who baſk in the rays of fortune, and court alone her favourites; elated by an acquaintance with the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia, he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly neglected Amanda, not only from deeming them more worthy of his attention, but from perceiving he could take no ſtep more certain of gaining their favour. His words made Amanda ſenſible of the ſingularity of her ſituation; ſhe aroſe immediately, and went to the other room. Every ſeat was already occupied; near the door ſat Lady Euphraſia and the Miſs Kilcorbans; Lord Mortimer leaned on the back of her Ladyſhip's chair, and young Kilcorban occupied one by her ſide, which
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038416_0218_1011D27D008F4B98"/>
he never attempted offering to Amanda; ſhe ſtood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt unpleaſantly by the door, and was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuſed at hearing a great many in a whiſpering way, remarking the ſtrangeneſs of her not being noticed by ſo near a relation as the Marchioneſs of Roſline. A general titter at her ſituation prevailed among Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia's party, Lord Mortimer excepted. "Upon my word," ſaid young Kilcorban, looking at Amanda, "ſome ladies ſtudy attitudes, which would be as well let alone."—"For the ſtudy of propriety," replied her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip, who appeared to have unbended from her haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, "ſhe would do admirably for the figure of Hope:" "If ſhe had but an anchor to recline on," rejoined he: "Yes," anſwered her Ladyſhip, "with her floating locks and die-away glances:" "or elſe Patience on a monument," cried he: "only ſhe has no grief here to ſmile at," returned Lady Euphraſia: "Pardon me there," ſaid he, "ſhe has the grief, not indeed that I believe ſhe would ſmile at it, of being totally eclipſed by your ladyſhip."</p>
                     <p>"Or what do you think," cried Lord Mortimer, whoſe eyes ſparkled with indignation during this dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, "of likening her to Wiſdom, pitying the follies of human-kind, and ſmiling to ſee the ſhafts of malice recoiling from the boſom of innocence and modeſty with contempt on thoſe who levelled them at it."</p>
                     <p>Amanda heard not theſe words, which were delivered in rather a low voice; her heart ſwelled with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the impertinence directed to her, and ſhe would have quitted the room, but that the paſſage was too much crouded for her to paſs. Sir Charles Bingley, occupied, in attending the young lady with whom he had danced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obſerved not Amanda till this moment: he inſtantly flew to her: "Alone, and ſtanding?" ſaid he, "Why did not I ſee you before?—you look fatigued." She was pale with emotion.—"Kilcorban," continued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, "I muſt ſuppoſe you did not ſee Miſs Fitzalan, or your ſeat would not have been kept:" then catching him by the arm, he raiſed him nimbly from his chair, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038416_0219_1011D282B76B0EB8"/>
directly carried it to Amanda; and having procured her refreſhments, ſeated himſelf at her feet, exclaiming, "this is my throne, let kings come bow to it." Her lovely unaffected graces had excited Sir Charles's admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but it was the neglect with which he ſaw her treated, diffuſed ſuch a ſoothing tenderneſs through his manner as he now diſplayed; it hurt his ſenſibility and had ſhe even been plain in her appearance, would have rendered her the peculiar object of his attention; he deteſted the Marchioneſs and her daughter for their rancorous envy, as much as he deſpiſed the Kilcorbans for their mean inſolence. The Marchioneſs told him a long tale of the ſhocking conduct of Amanda's parents, whoſe ill qualities ſhe declared her looks announced her to poſſeſs, and endeavoured to depreciate her in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but that was impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>"Lord!" ſaid Lady Euphraſia, riſing as ſhe ſpoke, "let me paſs, this ſcene is ſickening." Lord Mortimer remained behind her: he loitered about the room, and his looks were often directed towards Amanda: her hopes began to revive: the luſtre rekindled in her eyes, and a ſoft bluſh again ſtole over her cheek; though engaged to Sir Charles, ſhe felt ſhe ſhould be pleaſed to have Lord Mortimer make an overture for her hand. The company were now returning to the ball-room, and Sir Charles took her hand to lead her after them. At this moment Lord Mortimer approached;—Amanda pauſed, as if to adjuſt ſome part of her dreſs; he paſſed on to a very beautiful girl, whom he immediately engaged and led from the room; ſhe followed them with her eyes, and continued without moving, till the fervent preſſure Sir Charles gave her hand reſtored her to recollection.</p>
                     <p>When the ſet with him was finiſhed, ſhe would have left the houſe directly, had her ſervant been there; but after putting up the horſes, he had returned to Caſtle Carberry and ſhe did not expect him till a very late hour. She declared her reſolution of dancing no more, and Sir Charles having avowed the ſame, they repaired to the card room, as the leaſt crouded room they could find. Lady Greyſtock was playing at the table, with
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038416_0220_1011D285EFC172D8"/>
the Marquis and Marchioneſs; ſhe beckoned Amanda to her, and having had no opportunity of ſpeaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, expreſſed her pleaſure at then ſeeing her. The Marquis examined her through his ſpectacles—the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs frowned, and declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "She would take care, in future, to avoid parties, ſubject to ſuch diſagreeable intruders." This ſpeech was too pointed not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked; Amanda wiſhed to appear undiſturbed, but her emotions grew too powerful to be ſuppreſſed, and ſhe was obliged to move haſtily from the table. Sir Charles followed her: "Curſed malignity," cried he, endeavouring to ſcreen her from obſervation, while tears trickled down her cheeks; "but my dear Miſs Fitzalan, was your beauty and merit leſs conſpicuous, you would have eſcaped it; 'tis the vice of little minds to hate that excellence they cannot reach." "It is cruel, it is ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing," ſaid Amanda, "to ſuffer enmity to outlive the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject who excited it, and to hate the offspring on account of the parent; the original of this picture," and ſhe looked at her mother's, "merited not ſuch conduct." Sir Charles gazed on it;—it was wet with the tears of Amanda; he wiped them off, and preſſing the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief to his lips, put it in his boſom.</p>
                     <p>At this inſtant Lord Mortimer appeared; he had, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, been for ſome time an unnoticed obſerver of the progreſs of this tete-a-tete. As ſoon as he perceived he had attracted their regard, he quitted the room.</p>
                     <p>"His Lordſhip is like a troubled ſpirit to night, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering to and fro," ſaid Sir Charles, "I really believe every thing is not right between him and lady Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia." "Something then," cried Amanda, "is in agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between him and her ladyſhip," "So ſays the world," replied Sir Charles, "but I do not always give implicit credit to its reports; I have known Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer this long time, and from my knowledge of him, ſhould never have ſuppoſed Lady Euphraſia Sutherland a woman capable of pleaſing him: nay, to give my real opinion, I think him quite unintereſted about her ladyſhip; I will not ſay ſo much as to all other females preſent; I really imagined ſeveral times to night from

                     <p>Amanda, confuſed by this diſcourſe, endeavoured to change it, and at laſt ſucceeded; they converſed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly together on different ſubjects, till they went to ſupper, where Sir Charles ſtill continued his attention. Lord Mortimer was, or at leaſt appeared to be, entirely engroſſed with Lady Euphraſia, who from time to time tittered with the Miſs Kilcorbans, and looked ſatirically at Amanda. On quitting the ſupper room, ſhe found her ſervant in the hall, and immediately deſired him to have the carriage drawn up. Sir Charles, who held her hand, requeſted her to ſtay a little longer, yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legded it was ſelf alone which dictated the requeſt, as he knew ſhe would not promote her own pleaſure by complying with it. As he handed her into the carriage, he told her he ſhould ſoon follow her example in reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as the ſcene, ſo lately delightful, in loſing her, would loſe all its charms; he entreated and obtained permiſſion, to wait on her the next morning.</p>
                     <p>How different was now the appearance of Amanda, to what it had been at her departure from Caſtle Carber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; pale, trembling and languid, her father received her into his arms; for till ſhe returned, he could not think of going to reſt, and inſtantly gueſſed the cauſe of her dejection. His heart mourned for the pangs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on his child's. When ſhe beheld him gazing on her with mingled woe and tenderneſs, ſhe tried to recruit her ſpirits, and after relating a few particulars of the ball, anſwered the minute enquiries he made, relative to the conduct of the Marchioneſs, and Lady Euphraſia. He appeared unutterably affected on hearing it; "Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful power," exclaimed he, "what diſpoſitions: but you are too lovely—too like your mother, my Amanda, in every perfection, to eſcape their malice:—oh! may it never injure you, as it did her; may that Providence, whoſe protection I daily implore for the ſweet child of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038416_0222_1011D28AEC7BE4C8"/>
my love, the ſource of earthly comfort, render every ſcheme which may be formed againſt her, abortive; and oh! may it yet bleſs me with the ſight of her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                     <p>Amanda retired to her chamber, inexpreſſibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the language of her father: "Yes," cried ſhe, her heart ſwelling with pity and gratitude to him, "my ſorrow in future ſhall be concealed, to avoid exciting his:—the pain inflicted by thy inconſtancy, Mortimer, ſhall be hid within the receſſes of my heart, and never ſhall the peace of my father be diſturbed, by knowing the loſs of mine."</p>
                     <p>The grey dawn was now beginning to advance, but Amanda had no inclination for repoſe; as ſhe ſtood at the window, ſhe heard the ſolemn ſtillneſs of the ſcene frequently interrupted by the diſtant noiſe of carriages, carrying home the weary ſons and daughters of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "But a few hours ago," ſaid ſhe, "and how gay, how animated was my ſoul: how dull, how cheerleſs now:—Oh! Mortimer, but a few hours ago, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved myſelf the beloved of thine heart; but the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering illuſion is now over, and I no longer ſhall hope, or thou deceive:" She changed her clothes, and flinging herſelf on the bed, from mere fatigue, at length ſunk into a ſlumber.</p>

                     <p>THE next morning brought Sir Charles Bingley to Caſtle Carberry; Fitzalan was out, but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda received him in her dreſſing room. He told her, with evident concern, he was on the point of ſetting off for the metropolis, to embark from thence immediately for England, having received letters that morning, which recalled him there; he regretted that their inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, or rather friendſhip, as with inſinuating ſoftneſs he entreated permiſſion to call it, was interrupted at its very commencement; declared it gave him more pain than ſhe could imagine, or he expreſs; and that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Ireland would be expedited, for the purpoſe of renewing it; and requeſted he might be flattered with an aſſurance of not being totally forgotten during his abſence. Amanda anſwered him as if ſhe ſuppoſed mere politeneſs had dictated the requeſt; "her father," ſhe ſaid, "ſhe was ſure would be happy to ſee him, if he returned again to their neighbourhood." At his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>nce, he ſaid he could ſtay but a few minutes, yet he remained about two hours, and when he aroſe to depart, declared he had reaſon to think the caſtle an enchanted one, he found it ſo difficult to get from it; "yet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the knights of old," continued he, "I wiſh not to break the ſpell which detained me in it."</p>
                     <p>Day after day elapſed, and no Lord Mortimer appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Amanda, indeed, heard frequently of him, and always as the admirer of Lady Euphraſia; frequently, too, ſhe heard about the family at Ulſter Lodge; their ſuperb entertainments, and thoſe given in the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038416_0224_1011D291D5C47E98"/>
neighbourhood to them. The Kilcorbans ſeemed to have given her up entirely; Lady Greyſtock was the only one of the family who continued to pay her any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: ſhe called once or twice at Caſtle Carberry, to ſee whether her apron was finiſhed, and tell all the news ſhe had picked up to Amanda. The reſolution which Amanda had formed, of concealing her melancholy from her father, ſhe ſupported tolerably well, but ſhe only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged it more freely in ſolitude; the idea of Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer's union with Lady Euphraſia, haunted her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and embittered every moment: "Yes," ſhe would exclaim, (as ſhe wandered through the garden, which had been converted from a rude wilderneſs, into a ſcene of beauty, by her ſuperintending care) "I have planted flowers, but another ſhall enjoy their ſweets; I have planted roſes for Mortimer to ſtrew in the path of Lady Euphraſia;—I have adorned the landſcape, and ſhe ſhall enjoy its beauty.</p>
                     <p>About three weeks after the ball, as ſhe ſat at work one morning in the dreſſing room, beguiling her thoughts with a little plaintive ſong, ſhe heard the door ſoftly open behind her: ſhe ſuppoſed it to be Ellen; but not finding any one advance, turned round, and perceived not Ellen indeed, but Lord Mortimer himſelf: ſhe ſtarted from her chair—the work dropt from her hands, and ſhe had neither power of ſpeak or move.</p>
                     <p>"I fear I have ſurpriſed and alarmed you," ſaid Lord Mortimer. "I aſk pardon for my intruſion, but I was informed I ſhould find Mr. Fitzalan here."</p>
                     <p>"He is in the ſtudy, I believe, my Lord," replied A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda coolly, and with reſtored compoſure; "I will go and inform him your lordſhip wiſhes to ſee him."</p>
                     <p>"No," exclaimed he," I will not ſuffer you to have ſo much trouble: my buſineſs is not ſo urgent as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire my ſeeing him immediately." He re-ſeated Amanda, and drew a chair near her.</p>
                     <p>She pretended to be buſied with her work; whilſt the eyes of Lord Mortimer were caſt round the room, as if viewing well known objects, which at once pleaſed and pained his ſenſibility, by awakening the memory of paſt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:038416_0225_1011D29595E6F6D0"/>
delightful days. "This room," ſaid he, ſoftly ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "I well remember; it was the favourite retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one of the moſt amiable of women."</p>
                     <p>"So I have heard," replied Amanda, "the virtues of Lady Cherbury are remembered with the trueſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by many in the vicinity of the caſtle."</p>
                     <p>"I think," cried Lord Mortimer, gazing upon A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda with the ſofteſt tenderneſs, "the apartment is ſtill occupied by a kindred ſpirit."</p>
                     <p>Amanda's eyes were inſtantly bent on the ground, and a gentle ſigh heaved her boſom; but it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ather the ſigh of regret than pleaſure; with ſuch an accent as this, Lord Mortimer was wont to addreſs her at Tudor Hall, but ſhe had now reaſon to think it only aſſumed, for the purpoſe of diſcovering whether ſhe yet retained any ſenſibility for him. Had he not treated her with the moſt pointed neglect: was he not the declared ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of Lady Euphraſia: had he not confeſt, on enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the room, he came to ſeek not her, but her father? Theſe ideas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> through her mind, determined her to continue no longer with him: delicacy, as well as pride, urged her to this; for ſhe feared, if ſhe longer liſtened to his inſinuating language, it might lead her to betray the feelings of her heart; ſhe therefore aroſe, and ſaid ſhe would acquaint her father his lordſhip waited for him.</p>
                     <p>"Cold, inſenſible Amanda," cried he, ſnatching her hand, to prevent her departing, "Is it thus you leave me? when we parted in Wales, I could not have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we ſhould ever have had ſuch a meeting as this."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps not, my Lord," replied ſhe, ſomewhat haughtily, "but we have both thought more prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince that period."</p>
                     <p>"Then why," ſaid he, "did not prudence teach you to ſhun a conduct which could create ſuſpicion?"</p>
                     <p>"Suſpicion, my Lord!" repeated Amanda, with a kind of horror in her look.</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me," cried he, "the word is diſagreeable; but Miſs Fitzalan, when you reflect on the manner in which you have acted to me; your precipitate, your
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:038416_0226_1011D29780C92430"/>
clandeſtine departure, at the very period when a mutual acknowledgment of reciprocal feelings ſhould have been attended with the moſt explicit candour on both ſides, you cannot wonder at unpleaſant conjectures and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting doubts obtruding on my mind."</p>
                     <p>"Is it poſſible, my Lord," ſaid Amanda, "you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conceived the reaſon of my departure? Is it poſſible reflection never pointed it out?"</p>
                     <p>"Never, I ſolemnly aſſure you; nor ſhall I be happy till I know it." He pauſed, as if for a reply; but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, agitated by his words, had not power to ſpeak. Whilſt ſhe ſtood ſilent, trembling, and apparently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed, ſhe heard her father's voice, as he aſcended the ſtairs. This inſtantly reſtored her's. "I muſt go, my Lord," cried ſhe, ſtarting, and ſtruggling to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw her hand. "Promiſe then to meet me," he ſaid, "this evening at St. Catherine's, by ſeven, or I will not let you go; my ſoul will be in tortures till I have your actions explained." "I do promiſe," ſaid Amanda. Lord Mortimer releaſed her, and ſhe retired into her chamber juſt time enough to avoid her father.</p>
                     <p>Again her hopes began to revive: again ſhe believed ſhe was not miſtaken in ſuppoſing Lord Mortimer had come into Ireland on her account. His being mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the admirer of Lady Euphraſia, ſhe ſuppoſed ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his being a reſident in the houſe with her. About herſelf had he been indifferent, he never could have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed ſuch emotions: his looks, as well as language, expreſſed the feelings of a heart tenderly attached and truly diſtreſſed. Leaſt any circumſtance had happened, which would prevent a renewal of that attachment, ſhe felt as much impatience as he manifeſted, to give the deſired explanation of her conduct.</p>
                     <p>His Lordſhip was ſcarcely gone, ere Lady Greyſtock made her appearance. Amanda ſuppoſed, as uſual, ſhe only came to pay a flying viſit: how great then was her mortification and ſurpriſe, when her Ladyſhip told her ſhe was come to ſpend the day quite in the family way with her, as the ladies of Grangeville were ſo buſy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038416_0227_1011D29C203F91C8"/>
for a ſplendid entertainment they were to be at the enſuing day, that they had excluded all viſitors, and rendered the houſe quite diſagreeable.</p>
                     <p>Amanda endeavoured to appear pleaſed, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſhe found almoſt impoſſible, her thoughts were ſo engroſſed by an abſent object; happily her ladyſhip was ſo very loquacious herſelf, as at all times to require a liſtener more than a ſpeaker; ſhe was therefore well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the taciturnity of her fair companion. Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da tried to derive ſome comfort from the hope that her ladyſhip would depart early in the evening, to which ſhe flattered herſelf ſhe would be induced by the idea of a comfortable whiſt party at home. But ſix o'clock ſtruck, and ſhe manifeſted no inclination to move. Amanda was in agony; her cheek was fluſhed with agitation; ſhe roſe and walked to the window, to conceal her emotion, whilſt her father and Lady Greyſtock were converſing; the former at laſt ſaid he had ſome letters to write, and begged her ladyſhip to excuſe his abſence for a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. This ſhe moſt graciouſly promiſed to do, and pulling out her knotting, requeſted Amanda to read to her till tea time. Amanda took up a book, but was ſo confuſed, ſhe ſcarcely knew what, or how ſhe read.</p>
                     <p>"Softly, ſoftly, my dear child," at laſt exclaimed her ladyſhip, whoſe attention could by no means keep pace with the rapid manner in which ſhe read. "I proteſt you poſt on with as much expedition as my lady Blerner's ponies on the circular." Amanda bluſhed, and began to read ſlowly; but when the clock ſtruck ſeven, her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings could no longer be repreſſed. "Good heaven," cried ſhe, letting the book drop from her hand, and ſtarting from her chair, "this is too much."—"Bleſs me, my dear," ſaid lady Greyſtock, ſtaring at her, "What is the matter?" "Only a ſlight head-ache, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," anſwered Amanda, continuing to walk about the room.</p>
                     <p>Her buſy fancy repreſented Lord Mortimer now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently waiting for her—thinking in every ſound which echoed among the deſolate ruins of St. Catherine's, he heard her footſteps, his ſoul melting with tenderneſs at
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:038416_0228_1011D29DB317C1F8"/>
the idea of a perfect reconciliation, which an unſatisfied doubt only retarded. What would he infer from her not keeping an appointment ſo ardently deſired, ſo ſolemnly promiſed, but that ſhe was unable to remove that doubt to his ſatisfaction: perhaps he would not credit the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe could aſſign for breaking her engagement: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, piqued at her doing ſo, he would not afford her an opportunity of accounting for it, or the apparent myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her late conduct; to retain his doubts would be to loſe his tenderneſs, and at laſt perhaps expel her from his heart. She thought of ſending Ellen to acquaint him with the occaſion of her detention at home; but this idea exiſted but for a moment; an appointment ſhe concealed from her father, ſhe could not bear to divulge to any other perſon; it would be a breach of duty and delicacy ſhe thought: "No," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "I will not, from the thoughtleſsneſs and impetuoſity which lead ſo many of my ſex aſtray, overſtep the bounds of propriety, and to reinſtate myſelf in the eſteem of one perſon, loſe that of others, and above all that of my own heart. If Lord Mortimer refuſes to hear my juſtification, he will act neither agreeable to candour or juſtice, and pride muſt aid in repelling my regret."</p>
                     <p>"You look ſtrangely indeed, my dear," ſaid Lad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Greyſtock, who was attentively watching her whilſt thoſe ideas were riſing in her mind. Amanda recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the remarks which might be made on her behaviour, and apologizing for the manner in which ſhe had acted, took her ſeat with ſome degree of compoſure. Fitzalan ſoon after entered the room, and tea was made; when over, Lady Greyſtock declared they were a ſnug party for three handed whiſt. Amanda would gladly have excuſed herſelf from being of the party, but politeneſs made her conceal her reluctance; her extreme dejection was noticed both by Fitzalan and her Ladyſhip; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imputed it to regret at not being permitted by her father to accept an invitation ſhe had received for a ball the enſuing evening.</p>
                     <p>"Don't fret about it, my dear creature," ſaid ſhe, laying down her cards, to adminiſter the conſolation ſhe
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:038416_0229_1011D2A098898650"/>
required; "'tis not by frequenting balls and public pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a girl always ſtands the beſt chance of being provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for; I, for my part, have been married three times, yet never made a conqueſt of any one of my huſbands in a public place: no, it was the privacy of my life partly obtained for me ſo many proofs of good fortune." Fitzalan and Amanda laughed. "I ſhall never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with ſtaying at home," ſaid the latter, "though without either expecting or deſiring to have my retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment recompenſed as your Ladyſhip's was."</p>
                     <p>"One prize will ſatisfy you then," ſaid Fitzalan, "Ah!" cried Lady Greyſtock, "it is Lady Euphraſia Sutherland who will obtain the capital one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I don't know where ſuch another young man as Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is to be found."—"Then your Ladyſhip ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes," ſaid Fitzalan, "there is ſome truth in the reports circulated, relative to him and Lady Euphraſia."—"I aſſure you there is," ſaid ſhe, "and I think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion will be a very eligible one; their births, their fortunes are equal." But ah! thought Amanda, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like their diſpoſitions. "I dare ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y," proceeded her ladyſhip, "Lady Euphraſia will have changed her ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before this time next year."</p>
                     <p>Fitzalan glanced at Amanda; her face was deadly pale, and ſhe put him and Lady Greyſtock out in the game by the errors ſhe committed. At laſt the carriage from Grangeville arrived, and broke up a party Amanda could not much longer have ſupported. Her father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the painful efforts ſhe made to conceal her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs: he pitied her from his ſoul, and pretending to think ſhe was only indiſpoſed, entreated her to retire to her chamber. Amanda gladly complied with this entreaty, and began to meditate on what Greyſtock had ſaid: Was there not a probability of its being true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Might not the indifference Lord Mortimer had manifeſted on his firſt arrival in the neighbourhood, have really originated from a change of affections? Might not the tenderneſs he diſplayed in the morning, have been concerted with the hope of its inducing her to gratify his curioſity, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the reaſon of her journey from Wales, or pleaſe
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:038416_0230_1011D2A4131EE1D8"/>
his vanity by tempting her to give ſome proof of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But ſhe ſoon receded from this idea. Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock was not infallible in her judgment: reports of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nuptials Amanda knew had often been raiſed without any foundation for them: the preſent report, relative to Lord Mortimer and Lady Euphraſia, might be one of that nature; ſhe could not believe him ſo egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly vain, or ſo deliberately baſe, as to counterfeit tenderneſs, merely for the purpoſe of having his curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity or vanity gratified: ſhe felt, however, truly unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and could derive no conſolation but from the hope that her ſuſpence, at leaſt, would ſoon be terminated.</p>
                     <p>She paſſed a reſtleſs night, nor was her morning more compoſed; ſhe could not ſettle to any of her uſual avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; every ſtep ſhe heard, ſhe ſtarted, in expectation of inſtantly ſeeing Lord Mortimer, but he did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. After dinner ſhe walked out alone, and took the road to St. Catherine's. When ſhe reached the ruins ſhe felt fatigued, and ſat down upon a flag in the chapel to reſt herſelf. "Here," ſaid ſhe, penſively leaning her head upon her hand, "Mortimer waited for me; perhaps with tender impatience:—here too, he perhaps accuſed me of neglect or deceit." She heard a ruſtling behind her, and turning perceived ſiſter Mary.</p>
                     <p>"You are welcome, my dear ſoul," cried the good natured nun, running forward, and ſitting down by her, "but why did you not come in to ſee us," continued ſhe, affectionately kiſſing her. Amanda ſaid "ſuch was her intention, but feeling a little indiſpoſed, ſhe had remained in the air, in hopes of growing better."</p>
                     <p>"Oh Jeſu," cried the ſiſter, "you do indeed look ill, I muſt go and get you a cordial from our Prioreſs, who is quite a doctreſs I aſſure you."</p>
                     <p>Amanda caught her gown as ſhe was running away, and aſſured her ſhe was better.</p>
                     <p>"Well then," ſaid ſhe, reſuming her ſeat' "I muſt tell you an odd thing which happened here laſt night; I came out to walk about the ruins between the lights, that is, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

As the air was cold, I wrapt my veil about me, and had juſt turned the cloiſters, when I heard a quick foot pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing after me: well, I ſuppoſing it to be one of the ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, walked ſlowly, that ſhe might eaſily overtake me; but you may gueſs my ſurpriſe, when I was overtaken, not by one of them indeed, but by one of the fineſt and moſt beautiful young men I ever beheld. Lord how he did ſtart when he ſaw me, juſt for all the world as if I were a ghoſt: he looked quite wild, and flew off mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſomething to himſelf. Well, I thought all this ſtrange, and was making all the haſte I could to the convent, when he appeared again, coming from under that broken arch, and he bowed and ſmiled ſo ſweetly and held his hat in his hand ſo reſpectfully, whilſt he begged my pardon for the alarm he had given me; and then he bluſhed and ſtrove to hide his confuſion with his handkerchief, while he aſked me if I had ſeen e're a young lady about the ruins that evening, as a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar friend had informed him ſhe would be there, and deſired him to eſcort her home."</p>
                     <p>"Why, my dear Sir," ſays I, "I have been about this place the whole evening, and here has neither been man, woman or child, but you and myſelf; ſo the young lady changed her mind and took another ramble." "So I ſuppoſe," ſaid he; and he looked ſo pale, and ſo melancholy, I could not help thinking it was a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart he had been ſeeking; ſo by way of giving him a bit of comfort, "Sir," ſays I, "if you will leave any marks of the young lady you were ſeeking, with me, I will watch here myſelf a little longer for her, and if ſhe comes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will tell her how uneaſy you were at not finding her, and be ſure to diſpatch her after you." "No, he thanked me," he ſaid, "but it was of very little conſequence his not meeting her, or indeed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ever met her again," and walked away.</p>
                     <p>"Did he!" ſaid Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me!" exclaimed the nun, "you are worſe inſtead of better."</p>
                     <p>Amanda acknowledged ſhe was, and riſing, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe would excuſe her not paying her compliments that evening at the nunnery.</p>

Siſter Mary preſt her to drink tea with the Prioreſs, or at leaſt take ſome of her excellent cordial; but Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da refuſed both requeſts, and the affectionate nun ſaw her depart with reluctance.</p>
                     <p>Scarcely had ſhe regained the road, 'ere a coach and ſix, preceded and followed by a number of attendants, approached with ſuch quickneſs, that ſhe was obliged to ſtep aſide to avoid it: looking in at the window as it paſſed, ſhe ſaw Lord Mortimer and Lady Euphraſia ſeated in it, oppoſite to each other; ſhe ſaw they both perceived her, and that lady Euphraſia laughed, and put her head forward to ſtare impertinently at her. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda was mortified that they had ſeen her; there was ſomething at that moment humiliating in the contraſt between their ſituation and her's; ſhe dejected and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, they, adorned and attended with all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of fortune. But in the eſtimation of a liberal mind, cried ſhe, the want of ſuch advantages can never leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen me—ſuch a mind as I flatter myſelf Lord Mortimer poſſeſſes. Ah, if he thinks as I do, he would prefer a lonely ramble in the deſolate ſpot I have juſt quitted, to all the parade and magnificence he is about witneſſing. The night paſt heavily away; the idea of Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer's devoting all his attention to Lady Euphraſia, could not be driven from her mind.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, the firſt object ſhe ſaw, on going to the window, was a large frigate laying at anchor near the caſtle. Ellen entered her chamber, ſighing heavily, as ſhe always did, indeed, at the ſight of a ſhip, ſaid, ſhe wiſhed it contained her wandering ſailor. Amanda indulged a hope that Lord Mortimer would appear in the courſe of the day, but ſhe was diſappointed. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired after tea in the evening to her dreſſing room, and ſeated in the window, enjoyed a calm and beautiful ſcene; not a cloud concealed the bright azure of the firmament; the moon ſpread a line of ſilvery radiance over the waves, that ſtole with a melancholy murmur upon the ſhore; and the ſilence which reigned around, was only interrupted by the faint noiſe of the mariners

on board the frigate, and their evening drum. At laſt Amanda heard the paddling of oars, and perceived a large boat coming from the ſhip, rowed by ſailors in white ſhirts and trow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The ſupper bell ſoon after ſummoned her from the window; but ſcarcely had ſhe retired to her chamber for the night, 'ere Ellen, ſmiling, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and apparently overcome with joy, appeared.</p>

"Yes, matam, and I aſſure you Chip is not altered for the worſe py a ſea-fairing life; his voice, inteed, is a little of the rougheſt, but he told me that was owing to his learning the poatswain's whiſtle; poor fellow, he ſails to-morrow night; the ſhip is on the Iriſh ſtation, and they are to coaſt it to Dublin."</p>

Whilſt Fitzalan converſed with them, Amanda ſeated herſelf on a low rock, to obſerve their motions; in the murmur of the waves there was a gentle melancholy, in uniſon with her preſent feelings; from a penſive meditation, which had gradually rendered her inattentive to the ſcene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, ſhe was ſuddenly rouſed by voices behind her. She ſtarted from her ſeat, for in one of them ſhe imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe diſtinguiſhed the accent of Lord Mortimer; nor was ſhe miſtaken, he was deſcending a winding path near her, accompanied by a naval officer. To paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing her was impoſſible; and as he approached her he ſtopt, apparently heſitating whether or not he ſhould addreſs her.

Ellen haſtily, demanded if Chip's intelligence was true?</p>

                     <p>Ellen's efforts at conſolation were not ſucceſsful, and Amanda diſmiſſed her, that unnoticed and unreſtrained ſhe might indulge the tears which flowed at the idea of a long, a laſting ſeparation, perhaps, from Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer; offended, juſtly offended, as ſhe ſuppoſed, with her; the probability was, ſhe would be baniſhed from his thoughts, or if remembered, at leaſt without eſteem or tenderneſs; thus might his heart ſoon be qualified for making another choice. She walked to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſaw the ſhip already under weigh; ſhe ſaw the white ſails fluttering in the breeze, and heard the ſhouts of the mariners. "Oh Mortimer!" cried ſhe, "is it thus we part? is it thus the expectations you raiſed in my heart, are diſappointed? you go hence, and deem A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda unworthy a farewell; you gaze perhaps, at this moment on Caſtle Carberry without breathing one ſigh for its inhabitants: ah, had you loved ſincerely never would the impulſe of reſentment have conquered the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tenderneſs:—no, Mortimer, you deceived me, and perhaps yourſelf, in ſaying I was dear to you:—had I been ſo, never could you have acted in this manner.

                     <p>LORD Mortimer had, in reality, departed with ſentiments very unfavourable to Amanda: he had waited impatiently at St. Catherine's, in fond expectation of having all his doubts removed, by a candid explanation of the motives which cauſed her precipitate journey from Wales; his ſoul ſighed for reconciliation; his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was redoubled by being ſo long reſtrained; the idea of folding his beloved Amanda to his boſom, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe deſerved all the tenderneſs and ſenſibility which glowed in that boſom for her, gave him the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pleaſure; but when the appointed hour paſſed and no Amanda appeared, language cannot expreſs his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment: almoſt diſtracted by it, he ventured to enquire concerning her, from ſiſter Mary; and long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the friendly nun had retired, to the convent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to wander about the ruins, till the ſhadows of night had enveloped every object from his view.</p>
                     <p>"She fears to come then," exclaimed he quitting the deſolate ſpot, oppreſſed with the keeneſt anguſh, "ſhe fears to come, becauſe ſhe cannot ſatisfy my doubts; I witneſſed her agitation, her embarraſſment this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when I hinted at them; the myſtery which ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us will not be explained, and it is vain to think we ſhall ever meet, as I once flattered myſelf we ſhould."</p>
                     <p>This thought ſeemed to ſtrike at all his hopes; the diſtreſs and diſorder of his mind was depictured on his
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:038416_0238_1011E2FCAFEF0EA0"/>
countenance, and eſcaped not the obſervation and raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia; but their raillery was vain, and unanſwered by him; he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed in a train of penſive reflections, which they had neither power to remove or diſturb.</p>
                     <p>Moſt unwillingly he accompanied them the enſuing day to a ſplendid entertainment given purpoſely for them in the neighbourhood. The unexpected ſight of Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, as ſhe ſtood on a little elevated bank, to avoid the carriage, cauſed a ſudden emotion of ſurpriſe and delight in his boſom; the utmoſt powers of eloquence could not have pleaded her cauſe ſo ſucceſsfully as her own appearance at that minute did: the langour of her face; its mild and ſeraphic expreſſion; her penſive atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and the timid modeſty with which ſhe ſeemed ſhrinking from obſervation, all touched the ſenſibility of Lord Mortimer, awakened his ſofteſt feelings, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his hopes, and made him reſolve to ſeek another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of demanding an explanation from her. The ſudden colour which fluſhed in his cheeks, and the ſparkling of his eyes, as he looked from the carriage, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the notice of his companions: they ſmiled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly at each other, and Lady Euphraſia declared, "ſhe ſuppoſed the girl was ſtationed there to try and attract admiration, which, perhaps, her ſilly old father had told her ſhe merited: or elſe to meet with adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures." Lord Mortimer drew in his head, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt between her Ladyſhip and the fair being he had been looking at, never ſtruck him ſo forcibly as at that moment and leſſened one as much as it elevated the other, in his eſtimation.</p>
                     <p>He wandered near the caſtle the next evening, in hopes of meeting Amanda; his diſappointment was diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeeing Ellen, who he was confident would be faithful to the meſſage entruſted to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence he haſtened to the rocks, every moment expecting the appearance of Amanda. Her image, as it appeared to him the preceding day, dwelt upon his imagination, and he forcibly felt how eſſential to his peace was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:038416_0239_1011E2FE40EB1F68"/>
with her. An hour elapſed, and his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs again began to give way to reſentment: it was not Ellen, but Amanda he doubted. He traverſed the beach in an agony of impatience and anxiety; a feveriſh heat pervaded his frame, and he trembled with agitation. At length he heard the diſtant ſound of the ſupper bell at Ulſter Lodge, which never rang till a late hour. All hopes of ſeeing Amanda were now given up, and every intention of meeting her at a future period, relinquiſhed. She avoided him deſignedly it was evident; he would have curſt himſelf for betraying ſuch anxiety about her, and his wounded pride revolted from the idea of ſeeking another interview." "No Amanda," he exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he paſſed the caſtle, "you can no longer have any claim upon me; myſterious appearances in the moſt candid mind will raiſe ſuſpicions; in giving you an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for accounting for ſuch appearances, I did all that candour, tenderneſs, ſenſibility, and honour could dictate: and inſtead of again making efforts to converſe with you, I muſt now make others, which I truſt will be more ſucceſsful, entirely to forget you."</p>
                     <p>The next morning he accompanied the Marquis in his barge to the frigate, where he was agreeably ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to find in the commander an old friend of his, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Somerville, returned to Ulſter Lodge with his viſitors, and there, in a half jeſting, half ſerious manner, aſked Lord Mortimer to accompany him in his intended cruize. This his Lordſhip inſtantly promiſed he would, with pleaſure: he was completely tired of the Roſline family, and was beſides glad of an opportunity of convincing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda he was not quite ſo faſcinated to her (as ſhe perhaps believed) by his quitting the the neighbourhood ere their departure. As he deſcended to the boat, the ſight of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, ſhook his reſolution; ſhe ſeemed deſtined to croſs his reſolution; ſhe ſeemed deſtined to croſs his path, merely to give him diſquietude; an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wiſh ſprung in his heart to addreſs her, but it was inſtantly ſuppreſſed, by reflecting how premeditatedly ſhe had avoided him; pride therefore prompted him to paſs her in ſilence yet as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The family at Ulſter Lodge were both mortified and diſappointed by his departure; though he perceiving their diſpleaſure, had endeavoured to leſſen it, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to wait their arrival in Dublin, and return with them to England. His departure ſeemed a tacit intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he was not as much attached to Lady Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia as they wiſhed him to be; a ſuſpicion of this nature had, indeed for ſome time pervaded their minds, and alſo that his affections were elſewhere diſpoſed of: they had reaſon to believe that the perſon who poſſeſſed them dwelt in the vicinity of the Lodge, from the great alteration which took place in his manner, immediately after his arrival at it. In hopes of diſcovering who this was, they watched him critically at all the parties he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented with them, but ſoon found it was not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but the abſent objects had the power of exciting emotions in him. At the name of Amanda Fitzalan, or her father, they obſerved him colour, and frequently ſaw him contemplate Caſtle Carberry, as if it contained a being infinitely dear to him; to Amanda, therefore, they feared he was attached, and ſuppoſed the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commenced at Kilcorban's ball, where they had noticed his impaſſioned glances at this hated, though becauſe too lovely, relation. The moſt unbounded rage took poſſeſſion of their ſouls; they regretted having ever come to Ireland, where they ſuppoſed Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had firſt ſeen Amanda, as Lord Cherbury had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the children of Fitzalan being ſtrangers to him, or his family. They knew the paſſions of Lord Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury were impetuous, and that ambition was the leading principle of his ſoul; anxious for an alliance between his family and theirs, they knew he would ill brook any obſtacle which ſhould be thrown in the way of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, and therefore reſolved, if Lord Mortimer, at their next meeting, appeared averſe to the wiſhes of his

of the ſoul to them, ſoon became an immenſe favourite. After an injunction of ſecrecy, the Marchioneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated her fears relative to Lord Mortimer and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, which ſhe pretended regard for one, and pity for the other, had excited; as an attachment either of an honourable or diſhonourable nature, ſhe knew Lord Cherbury would never pardon. To know, therefore, how far matters had proceeded between them, would be ſome ſatisfaction, and might, perhaps, be the means of preventing the ill conſequences ſhe dreaded. Lady Greyſtock was not to be impoſed on; ſhe perceived it was not pity for Amanda, but envy and jealouſy which had excited the fears of the Marchioneſs. If Lord Mortimer was attached to Amanda, from his ſentiments and manner, ſhe was convinced it was an attachment of the pureſt nature. She carefully concealed her thoughts however, affected to enter into all the alarms of the Marchioneſs, and as ſhe ſaw ſhe was expected to do, promiſed all in her power ſhould be done for diſcovering what attachment ſubſiſted between his Lordſhip and Miſs Fitzalan. For this purpoſe ſhe began to grow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in her viſits at Caſtle Carberry, often ſpending whole days in the moſt familiar manner with Amanda, and endeavouring, by various methods, to beguile her of the ſecrets of her heart. Sometimes ſhe ralied her on her melancholy; ſometimes expreſſed pity for it, in ſtrains of the moſt ſoothing tenderneſs: would frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate little fictitious and embelliſhed anecdotes of her own youth, in which ſhe ſaid ſhe had ſuffered the moſt exquiſite miſery, from an unfortunate entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: would then advert to Lord Mortimer; expreſs her wonder at his precipitate departure, and her admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his virtues, declaring, if ever Lady Euphraſia gained his heart, which ſhe much doubted, ſhe muſt be conſidered as one of the moſt fortunate of women.</p>
                     <p>Delicacy ſealed the lips of Amanda, and guarded her ſecret. She believed her paſſion to be hopeleſs, and felt that to be offered conſolation on ſuch a ſubject, would to her feelings, be truly humiliating. But though ſhe
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:038416_0243_1011E30851580C58"/>
could command her words, ſhe could not her feelings, and they were viſibly expreſſed in her countenance: ſhe bluſhed whenever Lord Mortimer was mentioned: look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhocked if an union between him and Lady Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia was hinted at; and ſmiled if a probability was ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted of its never taking place. Lady Greyſtock, at laſt relinquiſhed her attempts at betraying Amanda into a confeſſion of her ſentiments: indeed, ſhe thought ſuch a confeſſion not very requiſite, as her countenance pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty clearly developed what they were; and ſhe deemed herſelf authorized to inform the Marchioneſs, that ſhe was ſure ſomething had paſſed between Lord Mortimer and Amanda, though what ſhe could not diſcover, from the circumſpection of the latter. The Marchioneſs was enraged, and more determined than ever on involving Amanda in deſtruction, if Lord Mortimer heſitated a moment in obeying the wiſhes of his father, by uniting himſelf to Lady Euphraſia.</p>

                     <p>A MONTH after the departure of Lord Mortimer, the Roſline family left Ulſter Lodge. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda ſighed as ſhe ſaw them paſs, at the idea of the approaching meeting, which might, perhaps, ſoon be followed by an event, that would render her fond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Lord Mortimer improper. Many of the families about the caſtle were already gone to town for the winter. Thoſe who remained in the country till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtinas, among whom were the Kilcorbans, had
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:038416_0244_1011E30A2FB03C98"/>
ſo entirely neglected Amanda, from the time the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs arrived in the neighbourhood, that they could not think of renewing their viſits, confident as they were, from the proper dignity of her and Fitzalan's manner, that they would be unwelcome.</p>
                     <p>The weather was now often too ſevere to permit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda to take her uſual rambles: and the ſolitude of the caſtle was heightened by her own melancholy ideas, as well as by the drearineſs of the ſeaſon. No more the magic hand of hope ſketched ſcenes of flattering bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to diſſipate the gloomineſs of the preſent ones. The proſpects of Amanda's heart were as dreary, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, as thoſe ſhe viewed from the windows of the caſtle. Her uſual avocations no longer yielded delight; every idea, every occupation, was embittered by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of being leſſened in the eſtimation of Lord Mortimer. Her health declined with her peace, and again Fitzalan had the anguiſh of ſeeing ſorrow nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his lovely bloſſom; the roſe forſook her cheek, and her form aſſumed a fragile delicacy, which threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the demolition of his earthly happineſs. He was not ignorant of the cauſe of her dejection, but he would not ſhock her feelings by hinting it. Every effort which tenderneſs could ſuggeſt, he aſſayed to cheer her, but without any durable effect; for though ſhe ſmiled when he expreſſed a wiſh to ſee her cheerful, it was a ſmile, tranſient as the gleamings of a wintry ſun, and which only rendered the ſucceeding gloom more conſpicuous.</p>
                     <p>At this period of diſtreſs, Lady Greyſtock, who, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her viſits at the caſtle, made a propoſal which Fitzalan eagerly embraced; this was to take Amanda with her to London, whither ſhe was obliged to go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, about a law-ſuit carrying on between her and the nephew of her late huſband.</p>
                     <p>Change of ſcene, Fitzalan truſted, would remove from Amanda's mind the dejection which oppreſſed it, and conſequently aid the reſtoration of her health. Of Lord Mortimer's renewing his addreſſes, he had not the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt apprehenſion, as he neglected the opportunities he might have had in the country for ſuch a purpoſe. Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:038416_0245_1011E30DDE7AB818"/>
it may be remembered, knew not that his lordſhip had ever deviated from his indifference, and he believed it occaſioned by a transfer of his affections to Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia; he was alſo ignorant of the great intimacy between the Roſline family and Lady Greyſtock, and conſequently of the probability there was from ſuch an intimacy, of Amanda's being often in the way of Lord Mortimer. If ſhe met him, he was confident it would be as the huſband, or favoured lover of Lady Euphraſia: and in either of theſe characters, he was certain, from the rectitude and purity of her principles, ſhe would be more than ever impreſſed with the neceſſity of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her attachment; whilſt the pain attending ſuch a conviction would be leſſened, and probably ſoon removed, by ſurrounding objects, and the gay ſcenes ſhe muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in, from being the companion of Lady Greyſtock, who had a numerous and elegant acquaintance in London.</p>
                     <p>Her Ladyſhip appeared to him, as ſhe did to many others, a pleaſing, rational woman; one to whoſe care his heart's beſt treaſure might ſafely be conſigned. He was induced to accept her protection for his Amanda, not only on account of her preſent, but future welfare. His own health was extremely delicate; he deemed his life very precarious, and flattered himſelf Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, by having his beloved girl under her care, would grow ſo attached to her, as to prove a friend if he ſhould be ſnatched away, ere his newly obtained independence, enabled him to make a proviſion for her: in indulging, this hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his heart could not reproach him for any thing mean or ſelfiſh. Her ladyſhip had frequently aſſured him all her relations were very diſtant ones, and in afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent circumſtances, ſo that if his Amanda received any proof of kindneſs from her, ſhe could neither injure or encroach on the rights of others.</p>
                     <p>This, however, was not the caſe, though carefully concealed from him, as well as many others, by her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip. Her education had either given birth to, or ſtrengthened the artful propenſities of her diſpoſition. She had been one of the numerous offspring of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the ſouthern part of Ireland, whoſe wife, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete

houſewife, knowing his inability of giving his daughters fortunes, determined to bring them up ſo as to ſave one for their future huſbands.</p>
                     <p>At the age of nineteen Miſs Bridget, by her reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for domeſtic cleverneſs, attracted the notice of a man of eaſy independance, in the neighbourhood, who being a perfect Nimrod, wanted ſomebody to manage thoſe concerns at home, which he neglected for the field and kennel; and in obtaining Miſs Bridget, he procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this valuable acquiſition. His love of ſport, with his life, was fatally terminated the ſecond year of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, by his attempting no leap a five-bar gate. A good jointure devolved to his widow, and the office of conſoling her to the rector of the pariſh, a little fat elderly man, who might have ſat very well for the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Boniface. So ſucceſsful were his arguments, that he not only expelled ſorrow from her heart, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truduced himſelf into it, and had the felicity of receiving her ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the houſe where ſhe lodged was an ancient Baron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, who had never been married; his fortune was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, but his manner ſo ſtrange and whimſical, that he appeared incapable of enjoying the advantages it would have afforded to others. Notwithſtanding his oddities, he was compaſſionate; and as the fair relict was unaccompanied by a friend, he waited on her for the purpoſe of offering conſolation, and any ſervice in his power. This attention inſtantly inſpired her with an idea of trying to make him feel tenderer ſentiments than thoſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The preſumptive heir to the Baronet's large poſſeſſions, was the ſon and only child of a deceaſed ſiſter. At the period this unexpected alliance took place, he was about twenty, pleaſing in his perſon, and engaging in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and tenderly beloved by his uncle. This love Lady Greyſtock ſaw, if it continued, would fruſtrate her wiſh of poſſeſſing the Baro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>et's whole property. Various ſchemes fluctuated in her mind, relative to the manner in which ſhe ſhould lay the foundation for Ruſhbrook's ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; ere ſhe could determine on one, chance diſcovered a ſecret, which completely aided her intentions.</p>
                     <p>In the neighbourhood of the Baronet's country reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Ruſhbrook had formed an attachment for the daughter of a man, againſt whom his uncle entertained the moſt inveterate enmity. An union with this girl, ſhe was well convinced, would ruin him. She therefore gave him to underſtand ſhe knew of his attachment, and ſincerely pitied his ſituation; encouraging his love by the moſt flattering eulogiums on his adored Emily; declared her regret that hearts, ſo congenial ſhould be ſeparated; and at laſt intimated, that if they wiſhed to unite, ſhe was convinced ſhe would ſoon be able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sir Geoffry's forgiveneſs for ſuch a ſtep. Her art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſinuations hurried the unſuſpicious pair into the ſnare ſhe had ſpread for them; the conſequence of this was what ſhe expected.</p>
                     <p>Sir Geoffry's rage was unappeaſable, and he ſolemnly vowed never more to behold his nephew. Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock wiſhed to preſerve, if poſſible, appearances to the world, and prevailed on him to give her five hundred pounds for Ruſhbrook, to which ſhe added five of her own, and preſented the notes to him, with an aſſurance of pleading his cauſe whenever ſhe found a favourable opportunity for doing ſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:038416_0248_1011E3156BED25D0"/>
He purchaſed an enſigncy in a regiment, on the point of embarking for America, where he felt he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encounter diſtreſs, than among thoſe who had known him in affluence.</p>
                     <p>Her ladyſhip now redoubled her attention to Sir Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry, and at laſt prepoſſeſſed him ſo ſtrongly with the idea of her affection for him, that he made a will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathing her his whole fortune, which ſhe flattered herſelf with ſoon enjoying. But the conſtitution of Sir Geoffry was ſtronger than ſhe imagined, and policy obliged her to adhere to a conduct which had gained his favour; as ſhe knew the leaſt alteration in it would to his capricious temper, be ſufficient to make him cruſh all her hopes.</p>
                     <p>Fifteen years paſſed in this manner, when a friend of Ruſhbrook's adviſed him no longer to be deluded by the promiſes Lady Greyſtock ſtill continued to make, of interceding in his favour, but to write himſelf to his uncle for forgiveneſs, which the duty he owed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the diſtreſs of his ſituation, ſhould prompt him to immediately. Ruſhbrook accordingly wrote a moſt pathetic letter, and his friend, as he had promiſed, delivered it himſelf to the baronet. The contents of the letter, and the remonſtrance of his viſitor, produced a great change in the ſentiments of the Baronet. Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for a nephew, he had adopted as his heir from his infancy, began to revive, and he ſeriouſly reflected that by leaving his fortune to Lady Greyſtock, he ſhould enrich a family unconnected with him, whilſt the laſt branch of his own was left to obſcurity and wretchedneſs. Pride recoiled from ſuch an idea, and he told the gentleman he would conſider about a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with his nephew.</p>
                     <p>The converſation between them, which Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock had contrived to overhear, filled her with diſmay; but this was increaſed almoſt to diſtraction, when an attorney being ſent for, ſhe repaired again to her hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place, and heard a new will dictated, entirely in Ruſhbrook's favour.</p>
                     <p>Sir Geoffry was ſoon prevailed on to ſee his nephew,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:038416_0249_1011E31806D2D768"/>
but Mrs. Ruſhbrook and the children were not ſuffered to appear before him: they were, however, ſupplied with every thing requiſite for making a genteel appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and accompanying the regiment (again ordered abroad) with comfort.</p>
                     <p>Soon after their departure, Sir Geoffry ſunk into a ſtate of inſenſibility, from which no hopes of his ever recovering could be entertained. The ſituation was propitious, to the deſigns of Lady Greyſtock: none but creatures of her own were admitted to his chamber. An attorney was ſent for, who had often tranſacted bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs for her, relative to her affairs in Ireland; and a good bribe eaſily prevailed on him to draw up a will ſhe dictated, ſimilar to that before made in her favour. The Baronet was raiſed in her arms, whilſt the attorney guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his almoſt lifeleſs hand in ſigning it; and two clerks ſet their names as witneſſes. Sir Geoffry expired al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt immediately after this ſcheme was executed.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook's friend, who had been appointed to act for him, if this event took place whilſt he was abroad, now appeared. A will found in Sir Geoffry's cabinet was read, by which it appeared Mr. Ruſhbrook was his ſole heir. The exultation of the peruſer, however, was of ſhort continuance; her ladyſhip's attorney appeared, and declared the will was rendered null, by one of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter date, which he had drawn up in Sir Geoffry's laſt moments, by his expreſs deſire. Conſternation and ſurpriſe pervaded the mind of Ruſhbrook's friend; he ſaw the will was too well atteſted for him to diſpute it; yet he ſuſpected foul play, and loſt no time in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating his ſuſpicion to Ruſhbrook.</p>
                     <p>Her Ladyſhip ſettled her affairs moſt expeditiouſly, and returned with delight to her native country, after a very long abſence from it. Moſt of her near relations were dead, but ſhe had many diſtant ones, who, prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the knowledge of her large fortune, eagerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded her of their affinity, and vied with each other in paying her attention. This was extremely pleaſing to her Ladyſhip, who was fond of pleaſure at other people's expence. For herſelf ſhe had laid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="unknown:038416_0250_1011E31B9AC2C0F8"/>
of the moſt rigid oeconomy, which ſhe ſtrictly adhered to. From the many invitations ſhe received, ſhe was ſeldom a reſident in her own houſe; ſhe judged of others by herſelf, and aſcribed the attentions ſhe received, to their real ſource, ſelf-intereſt, which ſhe laughed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to think ſhe ſhould diſappoint.</p>
                     <p>She was remarkable (as Miſs Kilcorban informed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda) for aſking young people to do little matters for her, ſuch as making her millenery, working ruffles, aprons and handkerchiefs.</p>
                     <p>The tranquility ſhe enjoyed for two years after Sir Geoffry's death, was a little interrupted by his nephew's arrival from America, and commencing a ſuit directly againſt her, by the advice of his friends, and ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent lawyers, on the ſuppoſition that the will, by which ſhe inherited, had been made when his uncle was in a ſtate of imbecility.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock, however, received but a trifling ſhock from this; ſhe knew he had no money to carry on ſuch an affair, and that his advocates would loſe their zeal in his cauſe, when convinced of the ſtate of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. On being obliged to go to London to attend the ſuit, it immediately occurred that Amanda would be a moſt pleaſing companion to take along with her, as ſhe would not only enliven the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Amanda, on the firſt propoſal of accompanying her, warmly oppoſed it; ſhe felt unutterable reluctance to leave her father, and aſſured him ſhe would, by exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf, prove that a change of ſcene was not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for reſtoring her cheerfulneſs. Fitzalan knew her ſincerity in making this promiſe, but he alſo knew her inability of performing it: his happineſs he declared depended on her complying with his requeſt: he even ſaid his own health would probably be eſtabliſhed by it, as during her abſence he would partake of the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the country, which he had hitherto declined
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:038416_0251_1011E31D2A430FB0"/>
on her account. This aſſertion prevailed on her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and immediate preparations were made for her journey, as the invitation had not been given till within a few days of her Ladyſhip's intended departure. As ſhe went by Holyhead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fitzalan determined on ſending Ellen to her parents, till Amanda returned from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, which determination pleaſed Ellen exceedingly, as ſhe longed to ſee her family, and tell them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Chip. As the hour approached for quitting her father, the regret and reluctance of Amanda increaſed; nor were his feelings leſs oppreſſive, though better concealed; but when the moment of parting came, they could no longer be ſuppreſt; he held her with a trembling graſp to his breaſt, as if life would forſake it. On her departure, the gloom on his mind ſeemed like a preſentiment of evil; he repented forcing her from him, and ſcarcely could he refrain from ſaying, they muſt not part.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock, who in every ſcene, and every ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, preſerved her compoſure hinted to him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury he was doing his daughter, by ſuch emotions, and mentioned how ſhort their ſeparation would be, and what benefits would accrue to Amanda from it.</p>
                     <p>This laſt conſideration recalled to his mind, inſtantly compoſed him, and he handed them to her Ladyſhip's chariot, which was followed by a hired chaiſe, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her woman and Ellen; he then ſighed her a laſt adieu, returned to his ſolitary habitation to pray, and in ſpite of all his efforts, weep for his darling child.</p>
                     <p>Amanda's tears ſtreamed down her pale cheek, and never did ſhe experience a pang of ſuch ſorrow as that ſhe felt, when the chaiſe deſcending a hill, ſhe caught the laſt glimpſe of Caſtle Carb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She perceived, however, that her Ladyſhip had no reliſh for a gloomy companion, and therefore endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to recover her ſpirits and enter into converſation.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock had a number of friends in that part of Ireland, and therefore never ſtopt at an inn.</p>

                     <p>THE dejection of Amanda gradually declined, as the idea of ſeeing Lord Mortimer again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived. It revived not, however, without hopes, fears, and agitations. Sometimes ſhe imagined ſhe ſhould find him devoted to Lady Euphraſia; then again believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his honour and ſincerity would not allow him to give her up to ſuddenly, and that this apparent indifference proceeded from reſentment, which would vaniſh, if an opportunity once offered (and ſhe truſted there would) for explaining her conduct. She endeavoured to calm the emotions theſe ideas gave riſe to, by reflecting that a ſhort time now would moſt probably terminate her ſuſpenſe.</p>
                     <p>They ſtopped for the night, about five o'clock, at an inn about a mile from Tudor Hall. After dinner Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da informed Lady Greyſtock, ſhe wiſhed to accompany Ellen to her parents. To this her Ladyſhip made no objection, on finding ſhe did not want the carriage.

                        </gap>e a walk, in which ſhe promiſed herſelf a melancholy indulgence, from reviewing the well known ſcenes, endeared by tender recollections.</p>
                     <p>A mournful, yet not undelightful ſenſation, attends the contemplation of ſcenes, where we once enjoyed feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city:—departed joys are ever remembered with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm of tenderneſs, which ſoothes the ſorrow we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience for their loſs.</p>
                     <p>Such were the preſent feelings of Amanda; while El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len undiſturbed by regrets for the paſt, pointed out, with pleaſure, the dwellings of her intimates and friends. Yet when ſhe came to Chip's deſerted cottage, ſhe ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and a tear ſtole from her eye, accompanied at the ſame time by a ſmile, which ſeemed to ſay, though thou art now lonely and cheerleſs, the period is approaching when comfort and gaiety ſhall reſume their ſtations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, when the blaze of thy fire and thy taper, ſhall not only diffuſe cheerfulneſs within, but without, and give a ray to the deſolate or benighted traveller, to guide him to thy hoſpitable ſhelter.</p>
                     <p>Amanda, leaning on Ellen's arm, proceeded ſlowly in her walk; the evening was delightful; the blue vault of heaven was ſpangled with ſtars, and the air, without being ſeverely cold, was clear and refreſhing. Their road, on one ſide, was ſkirted with the high woods of Tudor Hall. Amanda gazed on them with emotion; but when ſhe came to the gate which Lord Mortimer had opened for her departure at the firſt interview, the ſoftneſs of her heart could no longer be reſiſted: ſhe ſtopped, leaned penſively upon it, and wept. The ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greens, with which the woods abounded, prevented their wearing a deſolate appearance: ſhe wiſhed to have pierced into their moſt ſequeſtered gloom, but ſhe had no time to indulge this wiſh; nor did ſhe, indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her companion, who was tinctured with ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fears, would have accompanied her. "When the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:038416_0254_1011E3249A6FAF58"/>
glow of vegetation again revives," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "when the bloſſom and the flowers again ſpread their ſpangled foliage to the ſun, and every ſhade reſounds with harmony, where, alas! will Amanda be?—Far diſtant, in all probability, from theſe delightful ſcenes, perhaps neglected and forgotten by their maſter."</p>
                     <p>The awful murmurs of the wind ruſtling through the trees, joined to the ſolemn ſound of a neighbouring wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfall, began to excite fears in Ellen's breaſt. She laid her trembling hand on Amanda, and beſought her, for the love of Cot, to haſten to the cottage. The road ſtill wound round the wood, and lights from a ſmall vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, which lay on its borders, caſt various ſhadows upon the trees, whilſt the hum of diſtant voices floated upon the gale, and fancy pictured joyous groups of ruſtics aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling round their fires, to enjoy refreſhment after the labours of the day.</p>
                     <p>"Peaceful people," ſaid Amanda, "when the wants of nature are ſatisfied, no care or trouble obtrudes upon your minds: tired, but not exhauſted with the toils of the day, with preparing the boſom of the earth for the etherial mildneſs of the ſpring, you ſeek and enjoy a calm repoſe."</p>
                     <p>In the lane which led to her nurſe's cottage, Amanda pauſed for a moment: down this lane Lord Mortimer had once purſued her: ſhe looked towards the manſion of Tudor Hall; ſhe endeavoured to diſcern the library, but all was dark and diſmal, except the wing, which El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len informed her was occupied by the domeſtics. Thro' the window of Edwin's cottage, they ſaw all the family ſitting round a blazing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, chatting and laughing. The tranſport of Ellen's heart overcame every idea of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſhe haſtily unlatched the door, and flung herſelf into her parents' arms: their ſurpriſe and joy was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, and Amanda was received and welcomed with as much tenderneſs as their child, without ever aſking the reaſon of her ſudden appearance. The firſt queſtion was, "Would ſhe not ſtay with them?" and her anſwer filled them with regret and diſappointment. Perceiving
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:038416_0255_1011E326FA278ED8"/>
them about procuring her refreſhments, "ſhe declared ſhe had not a minute to ſtay: the time alotted for her walk was already exceeded, and ſhe feared Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock would be offended at being left ſo long at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er, ſuddenly flung herſelf into her arms, and clinging round her neck, as if to prevent a ſeparation; which, till the moment of its arrival, ſhe thought ſhe could have ſupported, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, my tear young lady, we are going to part, and my heart ſinks within me at the idea: even Chip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he was here, could not conſole me. I know you are not happy, and that increaſes my ſorrow: your ſweet cheek is pale, and I have often ſeen you cry, when you thought no poty was minding you; if you who are ſo goot are not happy, how can a peing like me hope to be ſo. Oh, may I ſoon pe bleſt with ſeeing you return the miſtreſs of Tudor Hall, married to the ſweeteſt, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt of noblemen—who I know, in my ſoul, loves you, as well inteed he may, for where would he ſee the fellow of my young laty. Then Chip and I will be ſo happy, for I am ſure you and my lort will ſhelter our humble cottage."</p>
                     <p>Amanda preſt the affectionate girl to her breaſt, and mingled tears with her's, while ſhe ſoftly whiſpered to her not to hint at ſuch an event; "but be aſſured, my deareſt Ellen," continued ſhe, "that I ſhall ever rejoice at your felicity, which, to the utmoſt of my power, I would promote, and hope ſoon to hear of your union with Chip."</p>
                     <p>"Alack a tay," ſaid her nurſe," are you going away, when I thought you come to ſtay among us; and then, perhaps my lort would have come, and then there would have peen ſuch a happy meeting; why, I verily thought he would have gone diſtracted when he found you, as one may ſay, run away; and to pe ſure I did pity him, and ſhould have made no ſcruple to tell him where you
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:038416_0256_1011E328AF3DEAF8"/>
were, had I known it myſelf, which he ſuſpected, for he offered me a ſight of money if I would diſcover. Then there is parſon Howell, why he has peen like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing put a ghoſt ſince you went away; and he does ſo ſigh—and he comes almoſt every tay to aſk me apout you, and whether I think or know Lort Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is with you; he will be in ſuch grief to think you were here without his ſeeing you."</p>
                     <p>"Well", ſaid Amanda, endeavouring to appear cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, "we may all yet have a happy meeting."</p>
                     <p>She then repeated her farewell, and leaning on the arm of old Edwin, returned to the inn, where ſhe again bid him adieu; and haſtening to her Ladyſhip, ſound her juſt awkening from a comfortable ſlumber. They drank tea, and after playing for about an hour at piquet, retired to reſt. Amanda, who enjoyed but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, roſe early in the morning, and finding her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip not quite ready, went down to the court to walk about till ſhe was, where, to her great ſurpriſe, the firſt object ſhe perceived was Howell, leaning penſively againſt a gate oppoſite the houſe. He flew over, and catching her hand, exclaimed,</p>
                     <p>"You are ſurpriſed, but I truſt not diſpleaſed: I could not reſiſt ſuch an opportunity of ſeeing you once more, after all I have ſuffered from your precipitate journey, and the probability of never beholding you. I have been watching here, in expectation of this happineſs, ſince the firſt dawn of day."</p>
                     <p>"I am ſorry," ſaid Amanda, gravely, "your time was ſo ill employed."</p>
                     <p>"How coldly you ſpeak," cried he, "ah! could you read my heart, you would ſee ſo little preſumption in it, that you would, I am confident, pity, though you could not relieve, its feelings. Every ſpot you loved to frequent, I have haunted ſince your departure: your mother's grave has often been the ſcene of penſive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; nor has it wanted its vernal offering; the lovelieſt flowers of my garden I have wove into wreaths, and hung them o'er it, in fond remembrance of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel daughter."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="unknown:038416_0257_1011E32B43968C70"/>
The plaintive ſound of Howell's voice; the dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his countenance, excited the ſofteſt feelings of ſenſibility in Amanda's boſom; but ſhe grew confuſed by the tenderneſs of his expreſſion, and ſaying ſhe was happy to ſee him, tried to diſengage her hand, that ſhe might retire.</p>
                     <p>"Surely," ſaid he, ſtill detaining it, "a few moments you might grant me without reluctance: you who are going to enjoy every happineſs and pleaſure, going to meet the favoured—"</p>
                     <p>Amanda anticipated the name he was about uttering, and her confuſion redoubled. She attempted again, yet in vain, to withdraw her hand, and turned to ſee whether any one was obſerving them; how great was her morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, on perceiving Lady Greyſtock leaning from a window, exactly over their heads. She ſmiled ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly at Amanda, on being ſeen; and the carriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready, ſaid, "ſhe would attend her below ſtairs." Howell now relinquiſhed Amanda's hand; he ſaw ſhe looked diſpleaſed; and expreſſed ſuch ſorrow, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſuch ſubmiſſive apologies for offending her that ſhe could not avoid according him her pardon. He handed both her and Lady Greyſtock into the carriage, and looked a melancholy adieu as it drove off.</p>
                     <p>"Upon my word, a pretty ſmart young fellow," ſaid Lady Greyſtock:—"though impatient this long time to ſet out, I could not think of interrupting the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting tete-a-tete I ſaw between you and him. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have been a reſident in this part of the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Amanda wiſhed to avoid acknowledging this—if known, ſhe feared it would lead to a diſcovery, or at leaſt excite a ſuſpicion of her intimacy with Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, which ſhe was deſirous of concealing, while in this uncertainty concerning him.</p>
                     <p>"Your Ladyſhip has heard, I believe," replied ſhe, "that Ellen's mother nurſed me."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my dear," anſwered her ladyſhip, with ſome ſmartneſs; but if your acquaintance even commenced
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:038416_0258_1011E32F4CA09AE0"/>
with this youth in infancy, I fancy it has been renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince that period."</p>
                     <p>Amanda bluſhed deeply, and to hide her confuſion, pretended to be looking at the proſpect from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Lady Greyſtock's eyes purſued her's. Tudor Hall was conſpicuous from the road, and Amanda invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untarily ſighed as ſhe viewed it.</p>
                     <p>"That is a fine domain," ſaid lady Greyſtock," I preſume you have viſited it, and know its owner?"</p>
                     <p>Amanda could not aſſert a falſehood; neither could ſhe evade the enquiries of Lady Greyſtock, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only confeſſed its being the eſtate of Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer but her own reſidence near it, the preceding ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Her ladyſhip immediately conjectured it was then the attachment between her and Lord Mortimer had commenced; and the bluſhes, the heſitation, and the unwillingneſs of Amanda, in owning her viſit to Wales all confirmed this conjecture. She tried, however, to inſinuate herſelf into her full confidence, by warm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of eſteem, and by hinting, that from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Lord Mortimer, ſhe could not believe he ever did, or ever would think ſeriouſly of lady Euphraſia; this ſhe hoped would either induce or betray Amanda to open her whole heart, but ſhe was diſappointed. She flattered herſelf, however, with thinking ſhe had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered enough to ſatisfy the Marchioneſs, if ſhe, (as Lady Greyſtock feared ſhe would) expreſſed any diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at ſeeing Amanda her companion; ſhe intended ſaying, that Fitzalan had abſolutely forced her under her protection.</p>
                     <p>They arrived late in the evening of the third day at Pall-Mall, where her Ladyſhip's agent had previouſly taken lodgings for them.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock, though immerſed in buſineſs againſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The next morning, as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, ſhe received a viſit from them. Amanda was ſitting in the window when the carriage drove up to the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:038416_0259_1011E330DA1CCC98"/>
door; ſhe inſtantly aroſe, and left the room, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither to expoſe herſelf to their impertinence, or appear ſolicitous for their notice, by ſtaying in their company uninvited. Lady Greyſtock ſoon informed them of Amanda's having accompanied her to London; and they, as ſhe expected, expreſs both ſurprize and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at it. As ſhe had ſettled in her own mind, ſhe therefore told them, "that Fitzalan had urged her to take his daughter under her care, with entreaties ſhe could not reſiſt: entreaties," ſhe added with a ſignificant lock, "ſhe believed he had good reaſon for making." She then related all ſhe ſuſpected, or rather had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, relative to the attachment between Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Amanda having commenced the preceding ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in Wales.</p>
                     <p>The Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded ſhe was ſent to London for the purpoſe of having it completed by a marriage. This, however, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to prevent. The Marchioneſs felt the moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate hatred againſt her, and alſo that to prevent her being advantageouſly ſettled, even if that ſettlement threatened not to interfere with the one ſhe had project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her daughter, ſhe could undertake almoſt any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Though ſhe abhorred the idea of noticing her, yet ſhe was tempted now to do ſo, from the idea that it would better enable her to watch her actions. This idea ſhe communicated in a haſty whiſper to Lady Euphraſia, who approving it, ſhe told Lady Greyſtock, "as Miſs Fitzalan was her gueſt, ſhe would, on that account, permit her to be introduced to them." Amanda was accordingly ſent for. On entering the room, Lady Greyſtock took her hand, and preſented her to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs and Lady Euphraſia. The former, half riſing, with a coldneſs ſhe could not conquer, ſaid, "Whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Lady Greyſtock honoured her with a viſit, ſhe ſhould be happy to ſee Miſs Fitzalan along with her." The latter only noticed her by a ſlight bow; and when Amanda drew a chair near the ſofa on which ſhe ſat, or rather reclined, ſhe continued ſtaring in her face, and alternately humming an Italian air, and careſſing
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:038416_0260_1011E3336EBD8F98"/>
a little dog ſhe had brought with her. The unembar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed elegance of Amanda's air and manner, ſurpriſed and mortified them; as they expected to have ſeen her covered with confuſion, at an introduction ſo unexpected. To their haughty ſouls nothing was more delightful than the awe and deference which vulgar and illiberal minds are ſo apt to pay to rank and fortune. They were provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee in Amanda, conſcious dignity, inſtead of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling diffidence. As ſhe ſat by Lady Euphraſia, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs could not help ſecretly confeſſing ſhe was a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rival to her daughter: for never did her lovely features, and ingenuous countenance, appear to ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as when contraſted to Lady Euphraſia's. The Marchioneſs withdrew ſoon after her entrance, unable longer to reſtrain the malignant paſſions which envy had excited.</p>
                     <p>Both ſhe and Lady Euphraſia were convinced that to communicate their ſuſpicions at preſent to Lord Cherbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, about her and his ſon, would not anſwer the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: for it could be of little conſequence, they reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to withdraw the eſteem of the father, if that of the ſon's continued: who independent in his notions, and certain of the fortunes of his anceſtors, might not heſitate to gratify himſelf. The point therefore was, by ſome deep laid ſcheme, to ruin Amanda in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Lord Mortimer: and if in the power of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals to contrive and execute ſuch a ſcheme, they gave themſelves credit for being able to effect it.</p>
                     <p>The blow at her fond hopes, they reſolved ſhould be followed by one againſt the peace of Fitzalan, on whom they knew, whenever they pleaſed, they could draw the reſentment of Lord Cherbury; thus ſhould they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely triumph over the lovely Amanda: plunge two beings they deteſted into poverty and wretchedneſs: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy expectations which interfered with their own, and ſecure an alliance with a man, they had long wiſhed united to their family.</p>
                     <p>From the unaltered indifference of Lord Mortimer to Lady Euphraſia, they were convinced of his predilection for another. Flattering themſelves that nothing but a
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:038416_0261_1011E335EF88BF38"/>
prior attachment could have rendered him inſenſible to the attractions of her ladyſhip; to render the object of this attachment contemptible in his ſight, they believed would produce the tranſfer of affections they ſo long deſired. The haughty ſoul of lady Euphraſia would never have permitted her to think of accepting Lord Mortimer (after his neglect of her), but by the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſhe ſhould have by ſuch an acceptance of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over Amanda; from this idea, ſhe entered warmly into all her mother's plans.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury had never yet ſpoken explicitly to his ſon concerning the union he had projected for him; he often, indeed, dropt hints about it, which he always either neglected, or purpoſely miſunderſtood; and from theſe circumſtances was pretty ſenſible of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclination Lord Mortimer felt to his wiſhes; he knew he entertained high notions of the independence which a rational mind has a right to maintain, and that in an affair of ſuch conſequence; as Mortimer frequently ſaid, he conſidered matrimonial connection to be, he would neither be controuled by the opinion of others or mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allured by the advantages of fortune.</p>
                     <p>To avoid a diſagreeable argument with a ſon he not only loved, but reſpected, he ſought rather, by indirect means, to involve him in an eſtabliſhment with the Roſline family, than come to an open explanation with him. For this purpoſe he contrived parties as often as poſſible with them into public; where, by Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's being ſeen with Lady Euphraſia, reports might be raiſed of an intended alliance between them; reports which he himſelf propagated among ſome particular friends, with a deſire of having them circulated; but an injunction of ſecrecy as to their author; theſe reports would he truſted, on reaching Lord Mortimer, lead to a diſcuſſion of the affair: and then he meant to ſay, as Lord Mortimer had partly contributed to raiſe them himſelf, by his attendance on Lady Euphraſia, he could not poſſibly, with honour, recede from, realizing them: yet often did his Lordſhip fear his ſcheme would prove abortive; for well he knew the cool judgment and keen
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:038416_0262_1011E33858C6F0F8"/>
penetration of his ſon: this fear always inſpired him with horror, for he had a motive for deſiring the union which he durſt not avow.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer quickly indeed diſcerned what his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's views were, in promoting his attendance on Lady Euphraſia; he therefore avoided her ſociety, whenever it was poſſible to do ſo, without abſolute rudeneſs; and contradicted the reports he almoſt continually heard, of an intended alliance between them, in the moſt ſolemn manner: he had always diſliked her, but latterly that diſlike was converted into hatred, from the malevolence of her conduct towards Amanda; and he felt, that even was his heart free, he never could devote it to her, or give his hand where it muſt be unaccompanied with eſteem; he wiſhed to avoid a diſagreeable converſation with Lord Cherbury, and flattered himſelf, his unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indifference to her Ladyſhip, would at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his Lordſhip of the impoſſibility of accompliſhing his projected ſcheme, and that conſequently it would be dropt 'ere openly avowed, and he ſaved the painful neceſſity of abſolutely rejecting a propoſal of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's.</p>
                     <p>In the evening Lady Greyſtock and Amanda received cards for dinner the next day at the Marquiſs of Roſline's. Amanda made no objection to this invitation; her father had often declared, if the Marchioneſs made an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for an intimacy with his children, he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, as he always deemed family quarrels highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to both parties, with regard to the opinion of the world: beſides, had ſhe objected to it, ſhe ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been a reſtraint on Lady Greyſtock, or left to total ſolitude; and the idea alſo ſtole upon her mind, that ſhe ſhould loſe a chance of ſeeing Lord Mortimer, who, ſhe ſuppoſed, a frequent gueſt of the Marquis's. Her heart flattered at the idea of ſoon beholding him; and the bright glow of animation which overſpread her countenance, in conſequence of this idea, attracted the obſervation of Lady Greyſtock, who congratulated her on the alteration that was already viſible in her looks;
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:038416_0263_1011E33AE4949FC0"/>
and inferred from thence, that ſhe was ſo well recovered of her fatigue, as to be able to contrive a little trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming for her againſt the next day. This Amanda cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully undertook, and having a quick execution, as well as an elegant taſte, ſhe ſoon made a progreſs in it, which delighted her Ladyſhip; who, to divert her whilſt ſhe worked, related ſome of the many entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anecdotes with which her memory was ſtored.</p>
                     <p>Though Amanda ſubmitted her beautiful hair to the hands of a freizure, ſhe departed not from the elegant ſimplicity always conſpicuous in her dreſs; her little or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments were all arranged with taſte, and an anxious wiſh of appearing to advantage; ſo lovely indeed did ſhe appear to Lady Greyſtock, that her Ladyſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſeriouſly to fear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he ſhould not be forgiven by the Marchioneſs, or Lady Euphraſia, for having introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch an object to their parties.</p>
                     <p>About ſix they reached Portman Square, and found a large party aſſembled in the drawing room. After the firſt compliments were over and Amanda introduced to the Marquis—not indeed as a near relation, but an utter ſtranger, a gentleman ſtepped up to the Marchioneſs, and addreſſing her in a low voice, was immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by her to Amanda, as the Earl of Cherbury.</p>
                     <p>"My dear young lady," ſaid he, "allow me to expreſs the pleaſure I feel, at ſeeing the daughter of my worthy friend, Mr. Fitzalan: allow me alſo to increaſe that pleaſure," continued he, taking her hand, and leading her to a very lovely girl, who ſat at ſome diſtance, "by preſenting Miſs Fitzalan to Lady Araminta Dormer, and deſiring their friendſhip for each other."</p>
                     <p>Surpriſed, confuſed, yet delighted by notice ſo little expected, the heart of Amanda heaved with emotion: her cheeks mantled with bluſhes, and the tear of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility trembled in her eye: ſhe was not, however, ſo embarraſſed, as to be incapable of expreſſing her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to his Lordſhip for his attention, and alſo to aſſure him, ſhe had early been taught, and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly felt the claims he had upon her gratitude and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. He bowed as if to prevent a further mention of
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:038416_0264_1011E33DB05BF970"/>
obligations, and left her ſeated by his daughter, who had expreſſed her pleaſure at being introduced to her, not in the ſupercilious ſtile of Lady Euphraſia, but in the ſweet accents of affability and tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>The conduct of Lord Cherbury had drawn all eyes upon Amanda: the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia regarded her with peculiar malignancy; the idea, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that they could, whenever they pleaſed, deprive her of his notice, a little leſſened the jealouſy and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification it had excited.</p>
                     <p>"Pray, who is this little creature?" exclaimed Miſs Malcolm (who wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Some kind of a far-off relation of my mother's," replied Lady Euphraſia, "who that old dowager, Lady Greyſtock, pick'd up in the wilds of Ireland, and has abſolutely forced her upon our notice; though I aſſure you, from compaſſion, we ſhould have taken the poor creature long ago under our protection, but for the ſhocking conduct of her family to the Marchioneſs, and the ſymptoms ſhe has already betrayed of following their example: it is really ridiculous ſending her to London—I dare ſay her ſilly old father has exhauſted all his ways and means in trying to render her decent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting himſelf, no doubt, with the hope of her entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſome young fool of quality, who may ſupply his wants as well as her's."</p>

"I declare," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, ſurveying Amanda through an opera glaſs which dangled from his button hole, "if her father has nothing to ſupport him, but the hope of her making a conqueſt of importance, he will be in a ſad way, for 'pon my ſoul, I can ſee nothing the girl has to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her, except novelty, and that, you know, is a charm which will leſſen every day: all ſhe can poſſibly expect is an eſtabliſhment for a few months with ſome taſteleſs being, who may like the ſimplicity of her country look—"</p>
                     <p>"And more than ſhe merits," exclaimed Miſs Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm; "I have no patience with ſuch creatures forcing themſelves into ſociety quite above them."</p>
                     <p>"I aſſure you," ſaid Lady Euphraſia, you would be aſtoniſhed at her vanity and conceit, if you knew her: ſhe conſiders herſelf a firſt rate beauty, though poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively any one may ſee ſhe is quite the reverſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the greateſt gentleneſs and ſimplicity; then ſhe has made ſome ſtrange kind of people, to be ſure they muſt be, believe ſhe is accompliſhed; though I dare ſay, if ſhe can read tolerably, and ſcrawl out a decent letter, 'tis all ſhe can do."</p>
                     <p>"We will quiz her after dinner, about her accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments," ſaid Freelove, "and have a little ſun with her."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, do," cried Miſs Malcolm, "we will aſk her to play, and ſing," ſaid her ladyſhip; for I aſſure you ſhe pretends to excel in both; though from her father's poverty, I am certain ſhe can know little of either: I ſhall enjoy her confuſion of all things, when her igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Whilſt this converſation was paſſing, Amanda, in converſing with Lady Araminta, experienced the pureſt
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:038416_0266_1011E3426E0616D8"/>
pleaſure. Her Ladyſhip was the "ſoftened image" of Lord Mortimer; her voice was modulated to the ſame harmony as his, and Amanda gazed and liſtened with rapture. On her confuſion abating, her eye had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered round the room, in queſt of his Lordſhip, but he was not in. At every ſtir near the door, her heart flutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the idea of ſeeing him; nor was this idea relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, till ſummoned to dinner. She fortunately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a ſeat next Lady Araminta, which prevented her thinking the time ſpent at dinner tedious. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rooms were crouded with company, but Lord Mortimer appeared not among the brilliant aſſembly; yet the pang of diſappointment, was ſoftened to Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da by his abſence, intimating that he was not anxious for the ſociety of Lady Euphraſia:—true, buſineſs, or a prior engagement, might have prevented his coming, but ſhe, as is natural, fixed on the idea moſt flattering to herſelf.</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia, in purſuance of the plan laid againſt Amanda, led the way to the muſic-room, attended by a large party; as Freelove had intimated to ſome of the beaux and belles, her Ladyſhip and he were going to quiz an ignorant Iriſh country girl. Lady Euphraſia ſat down to the harpſichord, that ſhe might have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pretext for aſking Amanda to play. Freelove ſeated himſelf by the latter, and began a converſation, which he thought would effectually embarraſs her; but it had quite a contrary effect, rendering him ſo extremely ridiculous, as to excite an univerſal laugh at his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſoon perceived his intention in addreſſing her, and alſo, that Lady Euphraſia and Miſs Malcolm were privy to it, having caught the ſignificant looks which paſſed among them. Though tremblingly alive to every feeling of modeſty, ſhe had too much ſenſe, and real nobleneſs of ſoul, to allow the illiberal ſallies of impertinence to diveſt her of compoſure.</p>
                     <p>"Have you ſeen any of the curioſities of London, my dear," exclaimed Freelove, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>olling back in his chair
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:038416_0267_1011E344F98B52C0"/>
and contemplating the luſtre of his buckles, unconſcious of the ridicule he excited.</p>
                     <p>"I think I have," ſaid Amanda, ſomewhat archly, and glancing at him, "quite an original in its kind." Her looks, as well as the emphaſis on her words, excited another laugh at his expence, which threw him into a momentary confuſion.</p>
                     <p>"I think," ſaid he, as he recovered from it, "the Monument and the Tower would be prodigious fine ſights to you, and I make it a particular requeſt that I may be included in your party whenever you viſit them; particularly the laſt place."</p>
                     <p>"And why," replied Amanda, "ſhould I take the trouble of viſiting wild beaſts, when every day I may ſee animals equally ſtrange, and not half ſo miſchievous!"</p>
                     <p>Freelove, inſenſible as he was, could not miſtake the meaning of Amanda's words, and he left her with a mortified air, being, to uſe his own phraſe, "complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done up."</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia now riſing from the harpſichord, requeſted Amanda to take her place at it; ſaying, with an ironical air, "her performance (which indeed was ſhocking) would make her's appear to amazing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage."</p>
                     <p>Diffident of her own abilities, Amanda begged to be excuſed; but when Miſs Malcolm, with an earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs even oppreſſive, joined her entreaties to Lady Euphraſia's, ſhe could no longer refuſe.</p>
                     <p>"I ſuppoſe," ſaid her Ladyſhip, following her to the inſtrument, "th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Amanda made no reply, but turned over the leaves of the book to a leſſon much more difficult than that Lady Euphraſia had played. Her touch at firſt was tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and weak, but ſhe was too ſuſceptible of the powers of harmony, not ſoon to be inſpired by it; and gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her ſtile became ſo maſterly and elegant, as to excite univerſal admiration, except in the boſoms of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſcheme, inſtead of depreſſing, had only ſerved to render excellence conſpicuous, and that mortification they deſtined for another, fell upon themſelves. When the leſſon was concluded, ſome gentlemen who either were, or pretended to be, muſical connoiſſeurs, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to ſing. She choſe a plaintive Italian air, and the exquiſite taſte and ſweetneſs with which ſhe ſung, equally aſtoniſhed and delighted: nor was admiration confined to the accompliſhments ſhe diſplayed; the ſoft expreſſion of her countenance, which ſeemed according to the harmonious ſounds that iſſued from her lips, was vied with pleaſure, and praiſed with energy; and ſhe roſe from the harpſichord covered with bluſhes, from the applauſe which ſtole around her. The gentlemen gathered round Lady Euphraſia, to inquire who the beautiful ſtranger was, and ſhe gave them pretty much the ſame account ſhe had already done to Miſs Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm.</p>
                     <p>The rage and diſappointment of that young lady, and her Ladyſhip, could ſcarcely be concealed.</p>
                     <p>"I declare I never knew any thing ſo monſtrouſly abſurd," exclaimed Lady Euphraſia," as to let a girl in her ſituation learn ſuch things, except indeed, it was to qualify her for a governeſs, or an opera ſinger."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, I ſuppoſe, ſaid Miſs Malcolm, "we ſhall ſoon hear her quivering away at one of the theatres, for no perſon of faſhion would really entruſt their children to ſo confident a creature."</p>
                     <p>The fair object of their diſquietude gladly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Lady Araminta into another room: ſeveral gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men followed, and crouded about her chair, offering that adulation which they were accuſtomed to find acceptable at the ſhrine of beauty: to Amanda, however, it was irkſome, not only from its abſurd extravagance, but as it interrupted her converſation with Lady Araminta. The Marchioneſs, however, who critically watched her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſoon relieved her from the trouble ſome aſſiduities of the beaux, by placing them at card tables; not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, from any good-natured motive, but ſhe could not bear that Amanda ſhould have ſo much attention paid

her, and flattered herſelf ſhe would be vexed by loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of converſation, Lady Araminta menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Ireland. "She had a faint remembrance of caſtle Carberry," ſhe ſaid, "and had been half tempted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Marquis and his family, in their late excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: her brother," ſhe added, "had almoſt made her promiſe to viſit the caſtle with him the enſuing ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.—You have ſeen Lord Mortimer to be ſure," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her ladyſhip.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, madam," faultered Amanda, while her face was overſpread with crimſon hue. Her ladyſhip was too penetrating, not to perceive her confuſion, and it gave riſe to a conjecture of ſomething more than a ſlight acquaintance being between his lordſhip and Amanda. The melancholy he had betrayed on his return from Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, had excited the raillery of her ladyſhip, till convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the diſcompoſure he ſhewed, whenever ſhe attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inquire into the occaſion of it, that it proceeded from a ſource truly intereſting to his feelings. She knew of the alliance her father had projected for him with the Roſline family, a project ſhe never approved of, for lady Euphraſia was truly diſagreeable to her; and a ſoul like Mortimer's, tender liberal and ſincere, ſhe knew could never experience the ſmalleſt degree of happineſs with a being ſo uncongenial in every reſpect as was lady Euphraſia to him. She loved her brother with the trueſt tenderneſs, and ſecretly believed he was attached in Ireland. She wiſhed to gain his confidence, yet would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

With the lovelineſs of Amanda's perſon, with the elegance of her manner, ſhe was immediately charmed, as ſhe converſed with her, eſteem was added to admiration, and ſhe believed that Mortimer would not have omitted mentioning to her the beautiful daughter of his father's agent, had he not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="77" facs="unknown:038416_0270_1011E34D71013E08"/>
She appeared to Lady Araminta juſt the kind of woman he would adore, juſt the being that would anſwer all the ideas of perfection (romantic ideas ſhe had called them) which he had declared neceſſary to captivate his heart. Lady Araminta already felt for her unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tenderneſs; in the ſoftneſs of her looks, in the ſweetneſs of her voice there were reſiſtleſs charms; and ſhe felt, that if oppreſſed by ſorrow, Amanda Fitzalan, above all other beings, was the one ſhe would ſelect to give her conſolation. The confuſion ſhe betrayed at the mention of Mortimer, made her Ladyſhip ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſhe was the cauſe of his dejection. She involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily faſtened her eyes upon her face, as if to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the receſſes of her heart, yet with a tenderneſs which ſeemed to ſay, ſhe would pity the ſecret ſhe might there diſcover.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury, at this moment of embarraſſment to Amanda, approached, he ſaid "He had juſt been making a requeſt, and an apology to Lady Greyſtock, and was now come to repeat them to her; the former was, to meet the Marquis's family at his houſe the next day at dinner, and the latter was, to excuſe ſo uncere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious an invitation, which he had been induced to make on Lady Araminta's account, who was obliged to leave town the day after the next, and had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no time for the uſual etiquette of viſiting."</p>
                     <p>Amanda bowed. This invitation was more pleaſing than one of more form would have been; it ſeemed to indicate friendſhip, and a deſire to have the intimacy between her and his daughter cultivated; it gave her alſo a hope of ſeeing Lord Mortimer. All theſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions inſpired her with uncommon animation, and ſhe entered into a lively converſation with Lord Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, who had infinite vivacity in his look and manner. Lady Araminta obſerved the attention he paid her with pleaſure; a prepoſſeſſion in her favour, ſhe truſted, might produce pleaſing conſequences.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock, at length, roſe to depart—Amanda received an affectionate adieu from Lady Araminta; and Lord Cherbury attended the ladies to their carriage.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:038416_0271_1011E34F03A48690"/>
On driving off, Lady Greyſtock obſerved, what a charming polite man his lordſhip was; and, in ſhort, threw out ſuch hints, and entered into ſuch a warm eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logium on his merits, that Amanda began to think he would not find it very difficult <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Amanda retired to her chamber in a ſtate of greater happineſs, than for a long perio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> before ſhe had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced; but it was a happineſs which rather agitated, than ſoothed the feelings particularly her's, which were ſo ſuſceptible of every impreſſion, chat

                     </p>
                     <p>Her preſent happineſs was the offspring of hope and therefore peculiarly liable to diſappointment; a hope derived from the attentions of Lord Cherbury, and the tenderneſs of Lady Araminta, that the fond wiſhes of her heart might yet be realized: wiſhes, again believed, from hearing of Lord Mortimer's dejection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which his ſiſter had touched upon) from his abſenting himſelf from the Marquis's, were not uncongenial to thoſe he himſelf entertained. She ſat down to acquaint her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the particulars of the day ſhe had paſſed, for her chief conſolation in her abſence from him, was, in the idea of writing and hearing conſtantly; her writing finiſhed, ſhe ſat by the fire, meditating on the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view ſhe expected would take place on the enſuing day, till the hoarſe voice of the watchmen, proclaiming paſt three o'clock' rouſed her from the reverie; ſhe ſmiled at the abſtraction of her thoughts, and retired to bed to dream of felicity.</p>
                     <p>So calm were her ſlumbers—ſo delightful her dreams, that So! had long ſhot his timorous ray into her chamber ere ſhe awoke. Her ſpirits ſtill continued ſerene and animated. On deſcending to the drawing-room, ſhe found Lady Greyſtock juſt entering it. After breakfaſt, they went out in her ladyſhip's carriage to different parts of the town. All was new to Amanda, who, during her former reſidence in it, had been entirely confined to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038416_0272_1011E350D0EDCD20"/>
lodgings in a retired ſtreet. She wondered at, and was amuſed by the crowds continually paſſing and repaſſing. About four they returned to dreſs. Amanda began the labours of the toilet with a beating heart; nor were its quick pulſations decreaſed on entering lady Greyſtock's carriage, which in a few minutes conveyed her to lord Cherbury's houſe in St. James's Square. She followed her ladyſhip with tottering ſteps; and the firſt object ſhe ſaw on entering the drawing-room, was Mortimer ſtanding near the door.</p>

                     <p>IN the drawing-room were already aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the Marquis, Marchioneſs, Lady Euphraſia, Miſs Malcolm, and Freelove. Lady Araminta perceived, in the heſitating voice of Amanda, the emotions which agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated her, and which were not diminiſhed, when Lord Cherbury taking her trembling hand, ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"Mortimer, I preſume you have already ſeen Miſs Fitzalan in Ireland."</p>
                     <p>"I have my Lord," cried Mortimer, bowing, and at the ſame time approaching to pay his compliments.</p>
                     <p>Every eye in the room, except Lord Cherbury's and Freelove's, was now turned upon his Lordſhip and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, and though, in the expreſſive countenances of both, enough could be read to confirm their ſuſpicions of a mutual attachment ſubſiſting between them.</p>
                     <p>Amanda, when ſeated, endeavoured to recover from her confuſion. Miſs Malcolm, to prevent Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer's taking a ſeat by her, which ſhe thought ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him inclined to do, beckoned him to her, and contrived to engage him in trifling chat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till they were
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:038416_0273_1011E353423C6B10"/>
ſummoned to dinner. On receiving his hand, which he could not avoid offering, to lead her to the parlour, ſhe caſt a look of exultation at Amanda. Lady Araminta perceiving all the gentlemen engaged, good humouredly put her arm within Amanda's, and ſaid, ſhe would be her chaperon on the preſent occaſion. Lord Mortimer quitted Miſs Malcolm the moment he had procured her a ſeat, though ſhe deſired him to take one between her and Lady Euphraſia, and paſſing to the other ſide, placed himſelf by Amanda. This action pleaſed her as much as it mortified them; it embarraſſed her, however, a little; but perceiving the ſcrutinizing earneſtneſs with which the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia regarded her, ſhe exerted her ſpirits, and was ſoon able to join in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral converſation, which Lord Mortimer promoted.</p>
                     <p>The unexpected arrival of Amanda in London, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and notwithſtanding his reſentment delighted him. His ſiſter, when they were alone in the morning, had mentioned her with all the fervency of praiſe; her plaudits gave him a ſenſation of ſatisfied pride, which convinced him he was not leſs than ever intereſted about Amanda. Since his return from Ireland, he had been diſtracted by incertitude and anxiety about her; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, the purity, the tenderneſs ſhe had diſplayed, were perpetually recurring to his memory; it was impoſſible, he thought, they could be feigned, and he began to think the apparent myſtery of her conduct ſhe could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily have explained: that deſignedly ſhe had not avoided him; and that but for the impetuoſity of his own paſſions, which had induced his precipitate depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he might ere this, have had all his doubts remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Tortured with inceſſant regret for this departure, he would have returned immediately to Ireland, but at this period found it impoſſible to do ſo, without exciting inquiries from lord Cherbury, which at preſent he did not chuſe to anſwer. He had planned an excurſion thither the enſuing ſummer, with lady <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

opportunity of having his anxiety relieved, and the chief obſtacle, perhaps to his, and he flattered himſelf, alſo to her happineſs, removed: for if aſſured her preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate journey from Wales was occaſioned by no motive ſhe need bluſh to avow, he felt he ſhould be better ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to combat the difficulties he was convinced his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would throw in the way of their union. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding lady Araminta's endeavours to gain his implicit confidence, he reſolved to withhold it from her, leſt ſhe ſhould incur even the temporary diſpleaſure of lord Cherbury, by the warm intereſt he knew ſhe would take in his affairs, if once informed of them.</p>
                     <p>Amanda looked thinner and paler than when he had ſeen her in Ireland, yet, if poſſible, more intereſting from theſe circumſtances; and, from the ſoft glance ſhe had involuntarily directed toward him at her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, he was tempted to think he had in ſome degree, contributed to rob her lovely cheek of its bloom; and this idea rendered her dearer than ever to him. Scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could he reſtrain the rapture he felt on ſeeing her within the neceſſary bounds: ſcarcely could he believe the ſcene, which had given riſe to his happineſs, real; his heart, at the moment, melting with tenderneſs, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the period of explanation, which, he truſted, which he hoped, would alſo be the period of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen joined the ladies about tea time, and as no additional company was expected, Lady Euphraſia propoſed a party to the Pantheon; this was immediately agreed to. Amanda was delighted at the propoſal, as it not only promiſed to gratify her curioſity, but to give Lord Mortimer an opportunity of addreſſing her, as ſhe ſaw he wiſhed: but vainly attempted at home. The Marquis and Lord Cherbury declined going. Lady Greyſtock, who had not ordered her carriage till a much later hour, accepted a place in the Marchioneſs'</p>
                     <p>Neither Lady Euphraſia, nor Miſs Malcolm, could bear the idea of Lord Mortimer and Amanda going in the ſame carriage, as the preſence of Lady Araminta,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:038416_0275_1011E358E98856E8"/>
they were convinced, would not prevent their uſing an opportunity, ſo propitious for converſing, as they wiſhed. Lady Euphraſia, therefore, with ſudden eagerneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, ſhe and Miſs Malcolm would reſign their ſeats in the marchioneſs' carriage, to Miſs Fitzalan and Freelove, for the pleaſure of accompanying Lady Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minta in her's. The Marchioneſs, who conjectured her daughter's motive for this new arrangement, ſeconded it to the ſecret regret of Amanda, and the viſible chagrin of Lord Mortimer. Amanda, however, conſoled herſelf for this diſappointment, by reflecting on the pleaſure ſhe ſhould enjoy in a few minutes, when freed from the diſagreeable obſervation of the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia; her reflections were not in the leaſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by any converſation being addreſſed to her. The Marchioneſs and Lady Greyſtock chatted together, and Freelove amuſed himſelf humming a ſong, as if for the purpoſe of mortifying Amanda by his inattention. When the carriage ſtopt, he aſſiſted the former ladies out; but as if forgetting ſuch a being exiſted as Amanda, he went with them. She was deſcending the ſteps, when Lord Mortimer preſt forward, and ſnatching her hand, ſoftly exclaimed, "We have met again, and neither envy nor malice ſhall again ſeparate us." A beautiful glow overſpread the countenance of Amanda; her hand trembled in his, and ſhe felt in that moment, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed for her former diſappointment, and elevated above the little inſolence of Freelove. Lord Mortimer handed her to his ſiſter, who was waiting to receive her, and they proceeded to the room. Lady Euphraſia en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it with a temper unfitted for enjoyment: ſhe was convinced the whole ſoul of Mortimer was devoted to Amanda, and ſhe trembled, from the violent and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant feelings that conviction excited. From the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he entered the carriage, till he quitted it, he had remained ſilent, notwithſtanding all her efforts, and Miſs Malcolm's, to force him into converſation. He left them as ſoon as they reached the Pantheon, to watch the Marchioneſs' carriage, which followed their's, and on rejoining Amanda, he attached himſelf entirely to
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:038416_0276_1011E35BC8752558"/>
her, without any longer appearing anxious to conceal his predilection for her. He had, indeed, forgotten the neceſſity there was for concealing it; all his feelings, all his ideas were engroſſed by ecſtacy and tenderneſs. The novelty, the brilliancy of the ſcene, excited ſurpriſe and pleaſure in Amanda, and he was delighted with the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated deſcription ſhe gave of the effect it produced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her mind. In her he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But alas! poor Amanda was deemed to diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this evening. Lady Greyſtock, according to a hint ſhe had received, after a few rounds, ſtept up to her, and declared ſhe muſt accompany her to a ſeat, as ſhe was convinced her health was yet too weak to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> whoſe arm Amanda leaned, pleaded for her friend, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring her Ladyſhip, "ſhe would take care Miſs Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan ſhould not injure herſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, you young people," ſaid Lady Greyſtock, "are ſo carried away with ſpirits, you never reflection conſequences; but I declare, as ſhe is entruſted to my care, I could not anſwer it to my conſcience to let her run into any kind of danger."</p>
                     <p>Lady Araminta remonſtrated with her Ladyſhip, and Amanda would have joined, but that ſhe feared her real motive for ſo doing would have been diſcovered. She perceived the party were detained from proceeding on her account, and immediately offered her arm to Lady Greyſtock, and accompanied her and the Marchioneſs to a ſeat. Lady Euphraſia, catching hold of Lady A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raminta's arm, hurried her, at the ſame inſtant, into the crowd; Miſs Malcolm, as if by chance, laid her hand on Lord Mortimer, and thus compelled him to attend her party. She ſaw him, however, in the courſe
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:038416_0277_1011E35F112B2C10"/>
of the round, prepared to fly off; but when they had completed it, to her inexpreſſible joy, the ſituation of Amanda made him relinquiſh his intention, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with her was utterly impoſſible, for the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had placed her between Lady Greyſtock and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and under the pretence of frequently addreſſing her Ladyſhip, was continually leaning acroſs Amanda, ſo as to exclude her almoſt from obſervation, thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering her ſituation, excluſive of regret at being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Lord Mortimer and Lady Araminta, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſagreeable. The Marchioneſs enjoyed a malicious joy in the uneaſineſs ſhe ſaw ſhe gave Amanda; ſhe deemed it but a ſlight retaliation for the uneaſineſs ſhe had given Lady Euphraſia; a trifling puniſhment for the admiration ſhe had excited.</p>
                     <p>Amanda, indeed, whilſt ſurveying the ſcene around her with wonder and delight, had herſelf been an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of critical attention and enquiry; ſhe was followed, univerſally admired, and allowed to be the fineſt girl that had appeared for a long ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>Relieved by her preſence, Lady Euphraſia's ſpirits began to revive, and her good humour to return. She laughed maliciouſly with Miſs Malcolm, at the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Lord Mortimer and Amanda. After a few rounds, Sir Charles Bingley, in company with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gentleman, paſt them: he was, to uſe Miſs Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm's own phraſe, "an immenſe favourite with her," and ſhe had long meditated, and attempted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of his heart. The attention which politeneſs obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to ſhew, and the compliments ſhe ſometimes compelled him to pay, ſhe flattered herſelf, were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the ſuceeſs of her ſcheme. Lady Euphraſia, notwithſtanding her intentions relative to Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and her profeſt friendſhip for Miſs Malcolm, felt an ardent deſire to have Sir Charles emolled in the liſt of her admirers; and both ladies determined he ſhould not again paſs, without noticing them. They accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing watched his approach, and when they again met, addreſt him in a manner, that to a man at all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted about either, would have been truly flattering.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:038416_0278_1011E360C6791AC0"/>
As this, however, was not the young Baronet's caſe, after paying his compliments in a general way, to the whole party, he was making his parting bow, when his companion, pulling him by the ſleeve, bid him obſerve a beautiful girl ſitting oppoſite to them. They had ſtopt near the Marchioneſs's ſeat, and it was to Amanda Sir Charles's eyes were directed.</p>
                     <p>"Gracious heaven," cried he, ſtarting; while his cheek was ſuffuſed with a glow of pleaſure, "Can this be poſſible? Can this, in reality," advancing to her ſeat, "be Miſs Fitzalan? this ſurely," continued he, "is a meeting as fortunate as unexpected; but for it, I ſhould have been poſting back to Ireland in a day or two."</p>
                     <p>Amanda bluſhed deeply, at his thus publicly declaring her power of regulating his actions. Her confuſion reſtored that recollection his joyful ſurpriſe had deprived him of, and he addreſt the Marchioneſs and lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock. The former haughtily bowed, without ſpeaking; and the latter laughing ſignificantly, ſaid, "ſhe really imagined ecſtacy on Miſs Fitzalan's account, had made him forget any one elſe was preſent." The ſituation of Amanda was tantalizing in an extreme degree to Sir Charles: it precluded all converſation, and frequently hid her from his view, as the Marchioneſs and lady Greyſtock ſtill continued their pretended whiſpers. Sir Charles had ſome knowledge of the Marchioneſs's diſpoſition, and quickly perceived the motive of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conduct.</p>
                     <p>"Your ladyſhip is kind," ſaid he, "in trying to hide Miſs Fitzalan, as no doubt you are conſcious 'tis not a ſlight heart-ache ſhe would give to ſome of the bells preſent this evening: but why," continued he, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Amanda "do you prefer ſitting to walking?"</p>
                     <p>Amanda made no anſwer; but a glance from her expreſſive eyes to the ladies, informed him of the reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia and Miſs Malcolm, provoked at the abrupt departure of Sir Charles, had hurried on; but ſcarcely had they proceeded a few yards, 'ere envy and
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:038416_0279_1011E3632DEB2850"/>
curioſity induced them to turn back. Lady Araminta perceived their chagrin, and ſecretly enjoyed it. Sir Charles, who had been looking impatiently for their approach, the moment he perceived them, entreated Amanda to join them.</p>
                     <p>"Let me" cried he, preſenting his hand, "be your knight on the preſent occaſion, and deliver you from what may be called abſolute captivity."</p>
                     <p>She heſitated not to accept his offer; the continual buz in the room, with the paſſing and repaſſing of the company had made her head giddy; ſhe deemed no apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy requiſite to her companions, and quitting her ſeat, haſtened forward to Lady Araminta, who had ſtopt for her. A crowd at that moment intervening between them retarded her progreſs. Sir Charles preſſing her hand with fervour availed himſelf of this opportunity to expreſs his pleaſure at their unexpected meeting.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! how little," cried he, "did I imagine there was ſuch happineſs in ſtore for me this evening."</p>
                     <p>"Sir Charles," ſaid Amanda, endeavouring, though in vain, to withdraw her hand, "you have learned the art of flattering ſince your return to England."</p>
                     <p>"I wiſh," cried he, "I had learned the art of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing as I wiſh the ſentiments I feel."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer, who had made way through the crowd for the ladies, at this inſtant appeared; he ſeemed to recoil at the ſituation of Amanda, whoſe hand was yet detained in Sir Charles's, while the ſoft glow and confuſion of her face gave at leaſt a ſuſpicion of the language ſhe was liſtening to.</p>
                     <p>On rejoining the party, ſhe hoped again to have been joined by Lord Mortimer; but even if inclined to this, Sir Charles totally prevented him. His Lordſhip deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, yet almoſt continually contrived to intercept the party, and his eyes were always turned on Amanda and Sir Charles; he was really diſpleaſed with her; he thought ſhe might as well have left her ſeat before, as after Sir Charles's appearance, and he reſolved to watch her cloſely. She was aſked to dance by Sir Charles, and ſeveral other gentlemen, but refuſed, and Lady Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minta,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:038416_0280_1011E364C5C2EA20"/>
on her account, followed her example. Lady Euphraſia, and Miſs Malcolm either were too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed, or not aſked by gentlemen they liked, to join the feſtive group.</p>
                     <p>Amanda, from being diſappointed, ſoon grew languid, and endeavoured to check, with more than uſual ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ardent expreſſions of Sir Charles, who repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly declared, "he had hurried over the affairs which brought him to England, entirely on her account, as he thought every day an age till they again met."</p>
                     <p>She was rejoiced when Lady Araminta propoſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home. Lady Euphraſia and Miſs Malcolm had no longer a deſire to accompany her Ladyſhip, as they believed Lord Mortimer already gone, and ſhe and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, therefore returned alone. Sir Charles was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to ſupper, an invitation he joyfully accepted, and promiſed to follow her Ladyſhip as ſoon as he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed the party he came with of his intention.</p>
                     <p>Lady Araminta and Amanda arrived ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt of the party; her Ladyſhip ſaid, "that her leaving town was to attend the nuptials of a particular friend," and was expreſſing her hopes, that on her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, ſhe ſhould often be favoured with the company of Amanda, when the door ſuddenly opened and Lord Mortimer entered. He looked pleaſed and ſurpriſed, and taking a ſeat on the ſopha between them, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as he regarded them with unutterable tenderneſs, "Surely, one moment like this is worth whole hours, ſuch as we have lately ſpent. May I," looking at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, "ſay, that chance is now as propitious to me, as it was ſome time ago to Sir Charles Bingley? Tell me," continued he, "were you not agreeably ſurpriſed to-night?"</p>
                     <p>"By the Pantheon? undoubtedly, my Lord."</p>
                     <p>"And by Sir Charles Bingley?"</p>
                     <p>"No: he is too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>light an acquaintance, either to give pleaſure by his preſence, or pain by his abſence."</p>
                     <p>This was juſt what Lord Mortimer wanted to hear. The looks of Amanda, and above all, the manner in which ſhe had received the attentions of Sir Charles,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:038416_0281_1011E3676AEA09C8"/>
evinced her ſincerity. The ſhadow of jealouſy remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Lord Mortimer recovered all his animation. Never does the mind feel ſo light, ſo truly happy, as when a painful doubt is baniſhed from it.</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Fitzalan," ſaid Lady Araminta, recurring to what Amanda had juſt ſaid, "can ſee few beings like herſelf, capable of exciting immediate eſteem; for my part, I cannot perſuade myſelf that ſhe is an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of but two days, I feel ſuch an intereſt in her wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, ſuch a ſiſterly regard."—She pauſed, and looked expreſſively on her brother and Amanda. His fine eyes beamed the livelieſt pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>"Oh my ſiſter," cried he, "encourage that ſiſterly affection: Who ſo worthy of poſſeſſing it as Miſs Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan? and who but Amanda," continued he, paſſing his arm round her waiſt, and ſoftly whiſpering to her, "ſhall have a right to claim it?"</p>
                     <p>The ſtopping of the carriages now announced the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the party, and terminated a ſcene which, if much longer protracted, might, by increaſing their agitation, have produced a full diſcovery of their feelings. The ladies were attended by Sir Charles and Freelove. The Marquis and Lord Cherbury had been out, but returned about this time, and ſoon after ſupper the company departed, Lady Araminta tenderly bidding Amanda farewell.</p>
                     <p>The cares which had ſo long preſt upon the heart of Amanda, and diſturbed its peace, were now vaniſhed; the whiſper of Lord Mortimer had aſſured her, that ſhe was not only the object of his tendereſt affection, but moſt ſerious attention; the regard of Lady Araminta flattered her pride, as it implied a tacit approbation of her brother's choice.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, immediately after breakfaſt, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Greyſtock went cut to her lawyer, and Amanda was ſitting at work in the dreſſing-room, when Sir Charles Bingley was announced. He now expreſſed, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more pleaſure, at ſeeing her, than he had done the preceding night; congratulated himſelf at finding her alone, and repeatedly declared, from their firſt interview
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:038416_0282_1011E36BA6735E58"/>
her image had never been abſent from his mind.—The particularity and ardour of his expreſſions, Amanda wiſhed, and endeavoured to repreſs: ſhe had not the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and unfeeling vanity to be delighted with an attachment ſhe could not return; beſides, his attentions were unpleaſing, as ſhe believed they gave uneaſineſs to Lord Mortimer; ſhe therefore anſwered him with cold and ſtudied caution, which, to his impetuous feelings, was inſupportable. Half reſenting, half rallying it, he ſnatched her hand, in ſpite of her efforts to prevent him, and was declaring he could not bear it, when the door opened, and Lord Mortimer appeared. Had A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda been encouraging the regard of Sir Charles, ſhe could not have betrayed more confuſion. Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer retreated a few ſteps, in evident embarraſſment: then bowing coolly, again advanced and took a ſeat. Sir Charles ſtarted up, with a look which ſeemed to ſay he had been moſt unpleaſantly interrupted, and walked about the room. Amanda was the firſt who broke ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; ſhe aſked, in a heſitating voice, "Whether La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Araminta was yet gone?"</p>
                     <p>"No," his Lordſhip gravely replied, "but in a few minutes ſhe propoſed ſetting out, and he meant to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her part of the way."</p>
                     <p>"So, till her Ladyſhip was ready," cried Sir Charles, with quickneſs, "that no time might be loſt, you came to Miſs Fitzalan?"</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer made no reply; he frowned, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing directly, ſlightly ſaluted Amanda and retired.</p>
                     <p>Convinced, as ſhe was, that Lord Mortimer had made the viſit for the purpoſe of ſpeaking more explicitly than he had yet done, ſhe could not entirely conceal her chagrin, or regard Sir Charles without ſome diſpleaſure. It had not, however, the effect of making him ſhorten his viſit; he continued with her till Lady Greyſtock's return, to whom he propoſed a party that evening for the opera, and obtained permiſſion to wait upon her Ladyſhip at tea, with tickets, notwithſtanding Amanda declared her diſinclination to going:—ſhe wiſhed to avoid the public as well as private attentions of Sir
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:038416_0283_1011E36D33F58768"/>
Charles; but both ſhe found impoſſible to do. The impreſſion which the charms of her mind and form had made on him, was of too ardent too permanent a nature, to be eraſed by her coldneſs: generous and exalted in his notions; affluent and independent in his fortune, he neither required any addition of wealth, nor was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nder any controul, which could prevent his following his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations:—his heart was bent on an union with Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da: though hurt by her indifference, he would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low himſelf to be diſcouraged by it; time and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he truſted and believed, would conquer it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to diſappointment, he could not, in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair which ſo materially concerned his happineſs, bear the idea of proving unſucceſsful.

                     <p>Lady Greyſtock had a numerous and brilliant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in London, amongſt whom ſhe was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engaged. Sir Charles was well known to them, and therefore almoſt conſtantly attended Amanda where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe went. His unremitted and particular attention excited univerſal obſervation, and he was publicly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the profeſt admirer of Lady Greyſtock's beautiful companion. The appellation was generally beſtowed on her by the gentlemen; as many of Lady Greyſtock's female intimates declared, from the appearance of the girl, as well as her diſtreſt ſituation, they wondered Sir Charles Bingley could ever think about her: for her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip had repreſented her as a perſon in the moſt indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent circumſtances, on which account ſhe had taken her under her protection. All that envy, hatred and malice could ſuggeſt againſt her, Miſs Malcolm ſaid. The Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia, judging of her by themſelves, ſuppoſed, that as ſhe was not ſure of Lord Mortimer, ſhe would accept of Sir Charles; and though this meaſure would remove all apprehenſions relative to
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:038416_0284_1011E36EF75B3FD8"/>
Lord Mortimer, yet the idea of the wealth and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſhe would derive from it, almoſt diſtracted them; thus does envy ſting the boſoms which labour it.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer again reſumed his reſerve: he was frequently in company with Amanda, but never even at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to pay her any attention; yet his eyes, which ſhe often caught rivited on her, though the moment ſhe perceived them they were withdrawn, ſeemed to ſay, that the alteration in his manner was not produced by any diminution of tenderneſs: he was indeed determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to regulate his conduct by her's to Sir Charles: though pained and irritated by his aſſiduities, he had too much pride to declare a prior claim to her regard; a woman who could waver between two objects, be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unworthy of either. He therefore reſolved to leave Amanda free to act, and put her conſtancy to a kind of teſt: yet notwithſtanding all his pride, we believe, if not pretty well convinced that this teſt would have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſource of triumph to himſelf, he never would have ſubmitted to it. The period for Lady Araminta's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn was now arrived, and Amanda was anxiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting her, when ſhe heard from Lady Euphraſia, that her Ladyſhip had been ill in the country, and would not therefore leave it for ſome time. This was a ſevere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment to Amanda, who had hoped, by her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's means, to have ſeen leſs of Sir Charles, and more of Lord Mortimer.</p>

                     <p>AMANDA was ſitting alone in the drawing room one morning, when a gentleman was ſhewn into it, to wait for Lady Greyſtock. The ſtranger was about the middle period of life; his dreſs announced him a military man, and his threadbare coat ſeemed to declare that whatever laurels he had gathered, they were barren ones. His form and face were intereſting; infirmity appeared to preſs upon one, and ſorrow had deeply marked the other; yet without deſpoiling it of a certain expreſſion which indicated the hilarity nature had once ſtampt upon it: his temples were ſunk, and his cheek faded to a ſickly hue. Amanda felt immediate reſpect and ſenſibility for the intereſting figure before her: the feelings of her ſoul, the early leſſons of her youth, had taught her to reverence diſtreſs; and never, perhaps, did ſhe think it ſo peculiarly affecting, as when in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary garb.</p>
                     <p>The day was uncommonly ſevere, and the ſtranger ſhivered with the cold.</p>
                     <p>"I declare, young lady," cried he, as he took the chair which Amanda had placed for him by the fire, "I think I ſhould not tremble more before an enemy, than I do before this day: I don't know but what it is as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential for a ſubaltern officer to ſtand cold as well as fire."</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſmiled, and reſumed her work:—ſhe was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily employed making a trimming of artificial flowers for Lady Greyſtock, to preſent to a young lady, from whoſe family ſhe had received ſome obligations. This was a cheap mode of returning them, as Amanda's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials were uſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:038416_0286_1011E37585B49DF8"/>
"Your employment is an entertaining one," ſaid the ſtranger, "and your roſes literally without thorns; ſuch, no doubt, as you expect to gather in your path through life."</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Amanda, "I have no ſuch expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation."</p>
                     <p>"And yet," ſaid he, "how few at your time of life, particularly if poſſeſſed of your advantages, could make ſuch a declaration."</p>
                     <p>"Whoever had reflection undoubtedly would," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"That I allow," cried he, "but how few do we find with reflection?—from the young it is baniſhed as the rigid tyrant that would forbid the enjoyment of the pleaſures they pant after:—and from the old it is too often expelled as an enemy to that forgetfulneſs which can alone enſure their tranquility.</p>
                     <p>"But in both, I truſt," ſaid Amanda, "you will allow there are exceptions."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps there are, yet often, when conſcience has no reaſon to dread, ſenſibility has cauſe to fear reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which not only revives the recollection of happy hours, but inſpire ſuch a regret for their loſs, as almoſt unfits the ſoul for any exertions; 'tis indeed beautifully deſcribed in theſe lines—
<q>
                           <l>Still importunate and vain,</l>
                           <l>To former joys recurring ever,</l>
                           <l>And turning all the paſt to pain."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amanda attentively watched him, and thought what he ſaid appeared particularly applicable to himſelf, as his countenance aſſumed a more dejected expreſſion. He revived, however, in a few moments.</p>
                     <p>"I have, my dear young lady," continued he ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, "beguiled you moſt ſoberly," as lady Grace ſays, into converſation; I have, however, given you an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of amuſing your fancy by drawing a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between an old veteran and a young ſoldier: but though you may allow him more animation, I truſt you
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:038416_0287_1011E3771413CD10"/>
will not do me ſo much injuſtice, as to allow him more taſte, while he merely extolled the luſtre of your eyes, I ſhould admire the mildneſs which tempered that luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre: while he praiſed the glow of your cheek. I ſhould adore that ſenſibility which had power, in a moment to augment or diminiſh."</p>
                     <p>At this inſtant Lady Greyſtock entered the room:—ſhe entered it with the ſwell of importance, and a haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty expreſſion of contempt in her features:</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger roſe from his chair, and his paleneſs encreaſed.</p>
                     <p>"So, Mr. Ruſhbrook," at laſt drawled out her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip—"So, Sir, but pray be ſeated," waving her hand at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>Amanda now retired: ſhe had lingered a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the room, under the pretence of putting her work out of her Ladyſhip's way, to diſcover who the ſtranger was.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook had been repreſented to her as artful, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, and contemptible. His appearance was almoſt a ſufficient refutation of thoſe charges, and ſhe began to think they never would have been laid againſt him by any other being than Lady Greyſtock, from a deſire of depreciating her adverſary. In her Ladyſhip ſhe had ſeen much to diſlike ſince ſhe reſided with her; ſhe ſaw that the temper, like the perſon, is often allowed to be in diſhable at home.</p>
                     <p>She felt even warmly intereſted about Ruſhbrook; ſhe had heard of his large family; and from his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſhe conjectured, they muſt be in diſtreſs. There was a kind of humorous ſadneſs in his manner, which affected her even more than a ſettled melancholy perhaps would have done, as it implied the efforts of a noble heart to repel ſorrow; and if there cannot be a more noble, neither ſurely can there be a more affecting ſight, than that of a good and brave man ſtruggling with adverſity.</p>

Ruſhbrook croſs the ſtreet; his walk was the ſlow and lingering walk of dejection and diſappointment: he raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand to his eyes; Amanda ſuppoſed to wipe away his tears, and her own fell at the ſuppoſition. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the day had increaſed, a heavy ſhower of ſnow was falling, againſt which poor Ruſhbrook had no ſhelter but his thread-bare coat. Amanda was unutterably affected; and when he diſappeared from her ſight, ſhe fell into a ſentimental ſoliloquy, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſtile of Yorick.</p>
                     <p>"Was I miſtreſs," exclaimed ſhe, as ſhe beheld the ſplendid carriages paſſing and repaſſing.—"Was I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of one of theſe carriages, an old ſoldier, like Ruſhbrook, ſhould not be expoſed to the inclemency of a wintry ſky; neither ſhould his coat be thread-bare; or his heart oppreſt with anguiſh: if I ſaw a tear upon his cheek, I would ſay it had no buſineſs there, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort was about reviſiting him."—As ſhe ſpoke, the idea of Lord Mortimer occurred: her tears was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended and her cheek began to glow.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, poor Ruſhbrook," ſhe exclaimed, "perhaps the period is not far diſtant, when a bounteous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, through the hands of Amanda, may relieve thy wants; when Mortimer himſelf may be her aſſiſtant in the office of benevolence."</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock's woman now appeared, to deſire ſhe would come down to her lady. She immediately obeyed the ſummons, with a ſecret hope of hearing ſomething of the conference. Her Ladyſhip received her with an exulting laugh.</p>
                     <p>"I have good news to tell you, my dear," exclaimed ſhe," that poor w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>tch, Ruſhbrook, has loſt the friend who was to have ſupported him in the law-ſuit; and the lawyers finding the ſheet anchor gone, have ſteered off, and left him to ſhift for himſelf; the miſerable creature and his family muſt certainly ſtarve: only think of his aſſurance: he came to ſay, indeed, he would now be ſatisfied with a compromiſe."</p>
                     <p>"Well, madam," ſaid Amanda.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:038416_0289_1011E37D16A27EA0"/>
"Well, madam," repeated her Ladyſhip, mimicking her manner, "I told him I muſt be a fool indeed, if I ever conſented to ſuch a thing, after his effrontery in attempting to litigate the will of his much abuſed uncle, my dear good Sir Geoffry. No, no, I bid him proceed in the ſuit, and all my lawyers were prepared; and after ſo much trouble on both ſides, it would be a pity the thing came to nothing."</p>
                     <p>"As your Ladyſhip, however, knows his extreme diſtreſs, no doubt you will relieve it."</p>
                     <p>"Why pray," ſaid her Ladyſhip, ſmartly, "do you think he has any claim upon me?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Amanda, "if not upon your juſtice, at leaſt upon your humanity."</p>
                     <p>"So you would adviſe me to fling away my money upon him?</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Amanda ſmiling, "I would: and as your Ladyſhip likes the expreſſion, have you fling it away profuſely."</p>
                     <p>"Well, well," anſwered ſhe, "when you arrive at my age, you will know the real value of wealth."</p>
                     <p>"I truſt, madam," ſaid Amanda with ſpirit, "know its real value already: we only eſtimate it differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently."</p>
                     <p>"And pray," aſked her Ladyſhip, with a ſneer, "how may you eſtimate it?"</p>
                     <p>"As the means, madam, of diſpenſing happineſs around us;—of giving ſhelter to the "houſeleſs child of want," and joy to the afflicted heart; as a ſacred depoſit entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by an Almighty Power for thoſe purpoſes: which, if ſo applied, will nouriſh placid and delightful reflections, that like ſoothing friends, will croud around us in the bed of ſickneſs or death, alleviating the pains of one, and the terrors of the other."</p>
                     <p>"Upon my word," exclaimed Lady Greyſtock," a fine flowery ſpeech, and well calculated for a ſentimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal novel, or a moral treatiſe for the improvement of youth; but I adviſe you, my dear, in future, to keep your queer and romantic notions to yourſelf, or elſe it will be ſuſpected you have made romances your ſtudy,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:038416_0290_1011E37F64007228"/>
for you have juſt ſpoken as one of their heroines would have done."</p>
                     <p>Amanda made no reply; yet as ſhe beheld her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſeated in an eaſy chair, by a blazing fire, with a large bowl of rich ſoup before her, which ſhe took eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning, ſhe could not forbear ſecretly exclaiming,—Hard hearted woman, engroſſed by your own gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, no ray of compaſſion can ſoften your nature for the misfortunes of others: ſheltered yourſelf from the tempeſt, you ſee it falling, without pity, on the head of wretchedneſs; and while you feaſt on luxuries, think, without emotion, on thoſe who want even common ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries.</p>
                     <p>In the evening they went to a large party at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs's, but though the ſcene was gay and brilliant, it could not remove the penſiveneſs of Amanda's ſpirits: the emaciated form of Ruſhbrook, returning to his deſolate family, dwelt upon her mind. A little, ſhe thought, as ſhe ſurveyed the magnificence of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the ſplendour of the company which crouded them: a little from this parade of vanity and wealth, would give relief to many a child of indigence: never had the truth of the following lines ſo forcibly ſtruck her imagination.</p>

                        <l>How many feel this very moment, death,</l>

                     <p>From ſuch reflections as theſe, ſhe was diſturbed by the entrance of Sir Charles Bingley. As uſual he took
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:038416_0291_1011E380F1BD2F50"/>
his ſtation by her, and in a few minutes after him Lord Mortimer appeared. A party for vingt'un was formed, in which Amanda joined, from a wiſh of avoiding the aſſiduities of Sir Charles; but he took care to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a ſeat next her's, and Lord Mortimer ſat oppoſite to them.</p>
                     <p>"Bingley," ſaid a gentleman, after they had been ſome time at the table, "you are certainly the moſt changeable fellow in the world. About three weeks ago you were hurrying every thing for a journey to Ireland, as if life and death depended on your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and here I ſtill find you, loitering about the town."</p>
                     <p>"I deny the imputation of changeableneſs," replied the Baronet, "all my actions are regulated, "and he glanced at Amanda, "by one ſource, one object."</p>
                     <p>Amanda bluſhed, and caught, at that moment, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating look from Lord Mortimer.</p>
                     <p>Her ſituation was extremely diſagreeable: ſhe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his attentions would be imputed to encouragement from her: ſhe had often tried to ſuppreſs them, and ſhe reſolved her next efforts ſhould be more reſolute.</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles reached Pall Mall the next morning, juſt as Lady Greyſtock was ſtepping into her chariot, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her lawyer of Ruſhbrook's viſit. She informed him that Miſs Fitzalan was in the drawing room, and he flew up to her.</p>
                     <p>"You find," ſaid he, "by what you heard laſt night, that my conduct has excited ſome ſurpriſe; I aſſure you my friends think I muſt abſolutely be deranged, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh ſo ſuddenly a journey I appeared ſo anxious to take: ſuffer me," continued he, taking her hand, "to aſſign the true reaſon for this apparent change."</p>
                     <p>"Sir Charles," replied Amanda, "'tis time to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate this trifling."</p>
                     <p>"Oh let it then be terminated," ſaid he, with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs," by your conſenting to my happineſs; by your accepting a hand, tendered to you with the moſt ardent affections of my heart."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="unknown:038416_0292_1011E38284650000"/>
With equal delicacy and tenderneſs, he then urged her acceptance of propoſals, which were as diſintereſted as the moſt romantic generoſity could deſire them to be.</p>
                     <p>Amanda felt really concerned that he had made them; the grateful ſenſiblity of her nature, was hurt at the idea of giving him pain.</p>
                     <p>"Believe me, Sir Charles," ſaid ſhe, "I am truly ſenſible of the honour of your addreſſes; but I ſhould deem myſelf unworthy of the favourable opinion which excited them, if I delayed a moment aſſuring you, that friendſhip was the only return in my power to make for them."</p>
                     <p>The impetuous paſſions of Sir Charles were now all in commotion; he ſtarted from his chair, and traverſed the apartment in breathleſs agitation.</p>
                     <p>"I will not, Miſs Fitzalan," ſaid he, reſuming his ſeat again, "believe you inflexible: I will not believe that you can think I ſhall ſo eaſily reſign an idea, which I have ſo long cheriſhed with rapture."</p>
                     <p>"Surely, Sir Charles," ſomewhat alarmed, "you cannot accuſe me of having encouraged that idea?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh no," ſighed he, paſſionately, "to me you were always uniformly cold."</p>
                     <p>"And from whence then proceeded ſuch an idea?"</p>
                     <p>"From the natural propenſity we all have to deceive ourſelves and to believe, that whatever we wiſh will be accompliſhed. Ah! Miſs Fitzalan, deprive me not of ſo ſweet a belief: I will not at preſent urge you to any material ſtep to which you are averſe; I will only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for permiſſion to hope, that time, perſeverance, unremitted attention, may make ſome impreſſion on you, and at laſt produce a change in my favour."</p>
                     <p>"Never, Sir Charles, will I give riſe to a hope, which I think cannot be realized; a little reflection will convince you, you ſhould not be diſpleaſed at my being ſo explicit. We are, at this moment, both, perhaps, too much diſcompoſed to render a longer conference deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: pardon me, therefore, if I now terminate it, and be aſſured. I ſhall never loſe a grateful remembrance of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:038416_0293_1011E3B4E97236D8"/>
the honour you intended me: or forget the friendſhip I profeſt for Sir Charles Bingley."</p>
                     <p>She then withdrew, without any obſtruction from him: regret and diſappointment ſeemed to have ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his faculties; but it was a momentary ſuſpenſion, and on recovering them, he quitted the houſe.</p>
                     <p>His pride, as firſt, urged him to give up Amanda for ever; but his tenderneſs ſoon ſuppreſſed this reſolution. He had, as he himſelf acknowledged, a propenſity to believe, that whatever he wiſhed was eaſy to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh: this propenſity proceeded from the eaſineſs with which his inclinations had hitherto been gratified: flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering himſelf, that the coldneſs of Amanda proceeded more from natural reſerve, than particular indifference to him: he ſtill hoped ſhe might be induced to favour him. She was ſo ſuperior, in his opinion, to every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he had ſeen; ſo truly calculated to render him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that as the violence of offended pride abated, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, without another effort, not to give her up. Without knowing it, he had rambled to St. James<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s ſquare, and having heard of the friendſhip ſubſiſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Lord Cherbury and Fitzalan, he deemed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a proper perſon to apply to on the preſent occaſion; thinking, that if he intereſted himſelf in his favour, he might yet be ſucceſsful. He accordingly repaired to his houſe, and was ſhewn into an apartment where the Earl, and Lord Mortimer were ſitting together. After pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſual compliments, "I am come, my Lord," ſaid he, ſomewhat abruptly, "to entreat your intereſt in an affair, which materially concerns my happineſs, and truſt your Lordſhip will excuſe my entreaty, when I inform you, it relates to Miſs Fitzalan."</p>
                     <p>The Earl, with much politeneſs, aſſured him, "he ſhould feel happy in an opportunity of ſerving him," and ſaid, "he did him but juſtice in ſuppoſing him particularly intereſted about Miſs Fitzalan, not only as the daughter of his old friend, but from her own great merit."</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles then acquainted him of the propoſals he had juſt made her: and her abſolute rejection of them;
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:038416_0294_1011E38700A05EB0"/>
expreſt his hope that Lord Cherbury would try to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence her in his fovour.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis very extraordinary indeed," cried his Lordſhip, "that Miſs Fitzalan ſhould decline ſuch an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſuch an advantageous propoſal: are you ſure Sir Charles, there is no prior attachment in the caſe?"</p>
                     <p>"I never heard of one, my Lord, and I believe none exiſts." Lord Mortimer's countenance loured at this, but happily its gloom was unperceived.</p>
                     <p>"I will write to day," ſaid the Earl, "to Mr. Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan, and mention your propoſal to him in the terms it deſerves; except authorized by him, you muſt, Sir Charles, excuſe my perſonal interference in the affair: I have no doubt, indeed, but he will approve of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, and you may then depend on my ſeconding them with all my intereſt."</p>
                     <p>This promiſe ſatisfied Sir Charles, and he ſoon after withdrew. Lord Mortimer was now pretty well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the ſtate of Amanda's heart: under this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, he delayed not many minutes after Sir Charles's departure, going to Pall Mall; and having particularly inquired whether Lady Greyſtock was out, and being anſwered in the affirmative, he aſcended to the drawing room, to which Amanda had again returned.</p>

                     <p>IN an emotion of ſurpriſe at ſo unexpected a viſit, the book ſhe was reading dropt from Amanda, and ſhe aroſe in viſible agitation.</p>
                     <p>"I fear," ſaid his Lordſhip," I have intruded ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abruptly upon you; but my apology for doing ſo, muſt be my ardent wiſh of uſing an opportunity ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious for a mutual ecclairciſſement; an opportunity I might, perhaps, vainly ſeek again."</p>
                     <p>He took her trembling hand, and leading her to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa, placed himſelf by her. As a means of leading her to the deſired ecclairciſſement, he declared the agonies he had ſuffered at returning to Tudor Hall, and finding her gone—gone in a manner ſo inexplicable; that the more he reflected on it, the more wretched he grew. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the hope and fears which alternately fluctuated in his mind during his continuance in Ireland, and which often drove him into a ſtate, nearly bordering on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, he mentioned the reſolution (though painful in the extreme) which he had adopted on the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Sir Charles Bingley's particularity; and finally concluded, by aſſuring her, notwithſtanding all his incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and anxiety, his tenderneſs had never known di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution.</p>
                     <p>Encouraged by this aſſurance, Amanda, with reſtored compoſure, informed him of the reaſon of her precipitate journey from Wales, and the incidents which prevented her meeting him in Ireland, as he had expected; tho' de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy

                     <p>Reſtored to the confidence of Mortimer, Amanda ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared dearer to his ſoul than ever; pleaſure beamed from his eyes as he preſſed her to his boſom, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "I may again call you my own Amanda: again ſketch ſcenes of felicity, and call upon you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize them." Yet in the midſt of this tranſport, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den gloom clouded his countenance; and after gazing on her ſome minutes with penſive tenderneſs, he fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently exclaimed, "would to heaven, in this hour of perfect reconciliation I could ſay, that all obſtacles to our future happineſs were removed."</p>
                     <p>Amanda involuntarily ſhuddered, and continued ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                     <p>"That my father will throw difficulties in the way of our union, I cannot deny my apprehenſion of," ſaid Lord Mortimer; "though truly noble and generous in his nature, he is ſometimes like the reſt of mankind, influenced by intereſted motives: he had long, from ſuch motives, ſet his heart on a connection with the Marquis of Roſline's family: though fully determined in my intentions, I have hitherto forborne an explicit declaration of them to him, truſting that ſome propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous chance would yet ſecond my wiſhes, and ſave me the painful neceſſity of diſturbing the harmony which has ever ſubſiſted between us."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my Lord," ſaid Amanda, turning pale, and ſhrinking from him, "let me not be the unfortunate cauſe of diſturbing that harmony; comply with the wiſhes of Lord Cherbury, marry Lady Euphraſia, and let me be forgotten."</p>
                     <p>"Amada," cried his Lordſhip, "accuſe not yourſelf of being the cauſe of any diſagreement between us; had I never ſeen you, with reſpect to Lady Euphraſia, I

ſhould have felt the ſame inability to comply with his wiſhes; to me, her perſon is not more unpleaſing than her mind; I have long been convinced, that wealth alone was inſufficient to beſtow felicity, and have ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the man, who could ſacrifice his feelings at the ſhrine of intereſt or ambition, degraded below the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of humanity; that to marry merely from ſelfiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, was one of the moſt culpable, moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible actions which could be committed, to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch an union, I want the propenſities which can alone ever occaſion it, namely, a violent paſſion for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only attainable through the medium of wealth. Left at an early age, uncontrouled maſter of my own actions, I drank freely of the cup of pleaſure, but found it ſoon pall upon my taſte; it was, indeed, unmixed with any of thoſe refined ingredients which can only pleaſe the intellectual appetite, and might properly be termed the cup of falſe, inſtead of real pleaſure. Thinking, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I do, that an union, without love, is abhorrent to probity and ſenſibility, and that the diſſipated plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of life are not only prejudicial, but tireſome, I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally wiſh to ſecure to myſelf domeſtic happineſs, but never could it be experienced, except united to a woman whom my reaſon thoroughly approved, who ſhould at once poſſeſs my unbounded confidence and tendereſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, who ſhould be, not only the promoter of my joys, but the aſſuager of my cares; in you I have found ſuch a woman, ſuch a being, as I candidly confeſs ſome time ago I thought it impoſſible to meet with; to you I am bound by a ſentiment even ſtronger than love, by honour, and with real gratitude acknowledge my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, in being permitted to atone, in ſome degree, for my errors relative to you. But I will not allow my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda to ſuppoſe theſe errors proceeded from any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled depravity of ſoul: allowed to be, as I have before ſaid, my own maſter, at an early period, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

manners, inſtead of checking, gave a latitude to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: women, too, who from their ſituations in life, had every advantage that could be requiſite for improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refining their minds; from converſing with them, I gradually imbibed a prejudice againſt the whole ſex, and under that prejudice firſt beheld you, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either to doubt or to believe the reality of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence you appeared to poſſeſs.</p>
                     <p>"Convinced, at length, moſt fully, moſt happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of its reality, my prejudices no longer remained, they vaniſhed like miſts before the ſun, or rather like the illuſions of falſhood before the influence of truth. Were thoſe, my dear Amanda, of your ſex, who like you had the reſiſtleſs power of pleaſing, to uſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties aſſigned them by a bounteous Providence in the cauſe of virtue, they would ſoon check the diſſipation of the times.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis impoſſible to expreſs the power a beautiful form has over a mind; that power might be exerted for nobler purpoſes; purity ſpeaking from love inſpiring lips, would, like the voice of Adam's heavenly gueſt, ſo ſweetly breathe upon the ear, as inſenſibly to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the heart; the libertine it corrected, would, if not utterly hardened, reform; no longer ſhould he glory in his vices, but touched and abaſhed, inſtead of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, worſhip female virtue.</p>
                     <p>"But I wander from the purpoſe of my ſoul; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced as I am of the diſſimilarity between my father's inclinations and mine, I think it better to give no inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of my preſent intentions, which if permitted by you. I am unalterably determined on fulfilling, as I ſhould conſider it as highly inſulting to him, to incur his prohibition, and then act in defiance of it though my heart would glory in avowing its choice. The peculiar circumſtances I have juſt mentioned, will, I truſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my Amanda to excuſe a temporary concealment of it, till beyond the power of mortals to ſeparate us:—A private and immediate union, the exigence of ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and the ſecurity of felicity demands; I ſhall feel
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:038416_0299_1011E393AFEC2488"/>
a trembling apprehenſion till I call you mine: life is too ſhort to permit the waſte of time in idle ſcruples and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning ceremonies; the eye of ſuſpicion has long reſted on us, and would, I am convinced, effect a premature diſcovery, if we took not ſome meaſure to prevent it.</p>
                     <p>"Deem me not too precipitate, my Amanda," paſſing his arm gently round her waiſt, "if I aſk you to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row night, for the laſt ſweet proof of confidence you can give me, by putting yourſelf under my protection: a journey to Scotland is unavoidable; in the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I ſhall make for it, all that is due to delicacy I ſhall conſider.</p>
                     <p>"Mention it no more, my Lord," ſaid Amanda, in a faultering accent; "no longer delude your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or mine, with the hopes of being united."</p>
                     <p>Hitherto ſhe had believed the approbation of Lord Cherbury to the wiſhes of his ſon would be obtained, the moment he was convinced how eſſential their grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was to his felicity; ſhe judged of him by her father, who, ſhe was convinced, if ſituations were rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, would beſtow her on Mortimer without heſitation. Theſe ideas ſo nouriſhed her attachment, that like the vital parts of exiſtence, it at length became painfully, almoſt fatally ſuſceptible of every ſhock. Her dream of happineſs was over, the moment ſhe heard Lord Cherbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's conſent was not to be aſked, from a fear of its being refuſed:—'T was miſery to be ſeparated from Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, but it was guilt and miſery to marry him clandeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinely, after the ſolemn injunction her father had given her againſt ſuch a ſtep. The ſhock of diſappointment could not be borne with compoſure; it preſt like a cold dead weight upon her heart; ſhe trembled, and unable to ſupport herſelf, ſunk againſt the ſhoulder of Lord Mortimer, while a ſhower of tears proclaimed her ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Alarmed by her emotion, Lord Mortimer haſtily demanded its ſource, and the reaſon of the words which had juſt eſcaped her.</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe, my, Lord," replied ſhe, "I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a clendeſtine meaſure, nor bear you ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the diſpleaſure of Lord Cherbury on my account.

Though lady Euphraſia Sutherland is not agreeable, there are many women, who, with equal rank and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, poſſeſs the perfections ſuited to your taſte: ſeek for one of theſe; chooſe from among them a happy daughter of proſperity, and let Amanda, untitled, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, and unpleaſing to your father, return to an obſcurity, which owes its comforts to his foſtering boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty." "Does this advice," aſked Lord Mortimer, "pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Amanda's heart." "No," replied ſhe, heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatingly, and ſmiling through her tears, "not from her heart, but from a better counſellor, her reaſon."</p>
                     <p>"And ſhall I not obey the dictates of reaſon," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, "in uniting my deſtiny to yours: reaſon directs us to ſeek happineſs through virtuous means; and what means are ſo adapted for that purpoſe, as an union with a beloved and amiable woman?—No, Amanda, no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled daughter of proſperity, to uſe your own words, ſhall ever attract my affections from you, "Imagination cannot form a ſhape beſides your own to like of," a ſhape which even, if deſpoiled of its graces, would enſhrine a mind ſo tranſcendantly lovely, as to ſecure my admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In chooſing you as a partner of my future days, I do not infringe the moral obligation which exiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween father and ſon; for as, on one hand, it does not require weak indulgence; ſo, on the other, it does not demand implicit obedience, if reaſon, and happineſs muſt be ſacrificed by it. Nothing ſhould have tempted me to propoſe a private union, but the hope of eſcaping many diſagreeable circumſtances by it: if you perſiſt, however, in rejecting it, I ſhall openly avow my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for a longer continuance of anxiety and ſuſpenſe I cannot ſupport.</p>
                     <p>"Do you think, then," ſaid Amanda, "I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your family amidſt confuſion and altercation? No, my Lord, raſhly or clandeſtinely I never will conſent to enter it."</p>
                     <p>"Is this the happineſs I promiſed myſelf would crown our reconciliation?" exclaimed Lord Mortimer, riſing haſtily, and traverſing the apartment: "Is an obſtinate adherence to rigid punctilio, the only proof of regard I
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:038416_0301_1011E396DEB92878"/>
ſhall receieve from Amanda? Will ſhe make no trifling ſacrifice to the man who adores her, and whom ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to eſteem?"</p>
                     <p>"Any ſacrifice, my Lord, compatible with virtue and filial duty, moſt willingly would I make; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond theſe limits, I muſt not, cannot, will not ſtep.—Cold, joyleſs, and unworthy of your acceptance, would be the hand you would receive, if given againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of what was right. Oh, never may the hour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, in which I ſhould bluſh to ſee my father; in which I ſhould be accuſed of injuring the honour entruſted to my charge, and feel oppreſt with the conſciouſneſs of having planted thorns in the breaſt that depended on me for happineſs."</p>
                     <p>"Do not be too inflexible, my Amanda," cried Lord Mortimer, reſuming his ſeat, "nor ſuffer too great a degree of refinement to involve you in wretchedneſs: felicity is ſeldom attained without ſome pain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Araminta adores you; with rapture would ſhe receive her dear and lovely ſiſter to her boſom; your father, happy in your happineſs, would be convinced his notions heretofore were too ſcrupulous, and that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with my wiſhes, you had neither violated your own delicacy, or tarniſhed his hohour."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, my Lord, your arguments have not the effect you deſire: I cannot be deluded by them, to view things in the light you wiſh: to unite myſelf clandeſtinely to you, would be to fly in the face of parental authority: to be propoſed to Lord Cherbury, when almoſt certain of a refuſal, would not only ſubject me to inſult, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the friendſhip which has hitherto ſubſiſted between his Lordſhip and my father. Situated as we are, our only expedient is to ſeparate; 'tis abſurd to think longer of a connection, againſt which there are ſuch obſtacles: the taſk of trying to forget, will be eaſier to you, my Lord, than you now perhaps imagine; the ſcenes you
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:038416_0302_1011E39B1A4A9740"/>
muſt be engaged in, are well calculated to expunge painful remembrances: in the retirement my deſtiny has doomed me to, my efforts will not be wanting to render me equally ſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p>The tears trickled down Amanda's pale cheeks as ſhe ſpoke; ſhe believed that they muſt part, and the belief was attended with a pang of unutterable anguiſh: pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pained by her ſenſibility, Lord Mortimer bent forward, and looked in her face.</p>
                     <p>"Are theſe tears," ſaid he, "to enforce me to the only expedient you ſay remains? Ah, my Amanda," claſping her to his breaſt, "the taſk of forgetting you could never be accompliſhed—could never be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: life would be taſteleſs, if not ſpent with you; never will I relinquiſh the delightful hope of an union yet taking place. A ſudden thought," reſumed he, after pauſing a few minutes, "has juſt occurred; I have an aunt, the only remaining ſiſter of Lord Cherbury, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, tender, exalted woman; I have ever been her particular favourite; my Amanda, I know, is the very kind of being ſhe would ſelect, if the choice devolved on her, for my wife; ſhe is now in the country, I will write immediately, inform her of our ſituation, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Her fortune is large, from the bequeſt of a rich relation; and from the generoſity of her diſpoſition, I have no doubt ſhe would render the loſs of Lady Euphraſia's fortune very immaterial to her brother. This is the only ſcheme I can poſſibly deviſe for the completion of our happineſs, according, to your notions, and I hope it meets your approbation."</p>
                     <p>It appeared, indeed, a feaſible one to Amanda; and as it could not poſſibly excite any ideas unfavourable to her father's integrity, ſhe gave her conſent to its being tried.</p>
                     <p>Her heart felt relieved of an oppreſſive load, as the hope revived that it might be accompliſhed. Lord Mortimer wiped away her tears and the cloud which hung over them both being diſperſed, they talked with pleaſure of future days.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="unknown:038416_0303_1011E39DB4A1E850"/>
Lord Mortimer deſcribed the various ſchemes he had planned for their mode of life. Amanda ſmiled at the eaſineſs with which he contrived them, and ſecretly wiſhed he might find it as eaſy to realize as to project.</p>
                     <p>"Though the retired path of life," ſaid he, "might be more agreeable to us, than the frequented and public one, we muſt make ſome little ſacrifice of inclination to the community to which we belong. On an elevated ſtation and affluent fortune, there are claims from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ranks, which cannot be avoided without injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; neither ſhould I wiſh to hide the beautiful gem I ſhall poſſeſs in obſcurity; but after a winter of what I call moderate diſſipation, we will haſten to the ſequeſtered ſhades of Tudor Hall. He dwelt with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on the calm and rational joys they ſhould experience there; nor could forbear hinting at the period when new tenderneſſes, new ſympathies would be awakened in their ſouls: when little prattling beings ſhould frolick before them, and literally ſtrew roſes in their paths. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his wiſh of having Fitzalan a conſtant reſident with them; and was proceeding to mention ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations he intended at Tudor Hall, when the return of Lady Greyſtock's carriage effectually diſturbed him.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer, however, had time to aſſure Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, ere ſhe entered the room, that he had no doubt but every thing would be ſoon ſettled according to their wiſhes, and that he would take every opportunity her Ladyſhip's abſence gave him of viſiting her.</p>
                     <p>"So, ſo," ſaid Lady Greyſtock, coming into the room, "this has been Miſs Fitzalan's levee day; why I declare, my dear, now that I know of the agreeable tete-a-tetes you can enjoy, I ſhall feel no uneaſineſs at leaving you to yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>Amanda bluſhed deeply, and Lord Mortimer thought in this ſpeech he perceived a degree of irony, which ſeemed to ſay all was not right in the ſpeaker's heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Amanda; and on this account he felt more anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than ever to have her under his own protection; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the idea that this would ſoon be the caſe, he told her Ladyſhip, ſmiling, "She ſhould be obliged to
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:038416_0304_1011E39F49ED6990"/>
him, or any other perſon, who could relieve her mind from uneaſineſs," and departed.</p>
                     <p>This had been a buſy, an intereſting day to Amanda, and the variety of emotions it had given riſe to, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a languor in her mind and frame ſhe could not ſhake off.</p>
                     <p>Her expectations were not as ſanguine as Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer's: once ſeverely diſappointed, ſhe dreaded again to give too great a latitude to hope: happineſs was in view, but ſhe doubted much whether it would ever be within her reach; yet the pain of ſuſpenſe ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to alleviate, by reflecting, that every event was under the direction of a ſuperior being, who knew beſt what would conſtitute the felicity of his creatures.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock learned from her maid the length of Lord Martimer's viſit, and ſhe was convinced, from that circumſtance, as well as from the looks and abſent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Amanda, that ſomething material had happened in the courſe of it. In the evening they were engaged to a party, and ere they ſeparated after dinner, to dreſs for it, a plain looking woman was ſhewn into the room, who Amanda inſtantly recollected to be the perſon, at whoſe houſe ſhe and her father had lodged on quitting Devonſhire, to ſecrete themſelves from Colonel Belgrave. This woman had been bribed to ſerve him, and had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſeveral letters upon Amanda, who, therefore, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally abhorred the ſight of a perſon that had joined in ſo infamous a plot againſt her; and to her exclamation of ſurpriſe and pleaſure, only returned a cool bow, and directly left the room. She was vexed at ſeeing this woman. The conduct of Colonel Belgrave had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been concealed, from motives of pride and delicacy; and to Lady Greyſtock, of all other beings, ſhe wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not revealed; her only hope of its not being ſo, was, that this woman, on her own account, would not mention it, as ſhe muſt be conſcious, that her efforts to ſerve him were not undiſcovered.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Jennings had been houſekeeper to Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock during her reſidence in England, and ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ingratiated herſelf into her favour, that though
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:038416_0305_1011E3A20AD099B8"/>
diſmiſſed from her ſervice, ſhe yet retained it. Lady Greyſtock was ſurpriſed to ſee ſhe and Amanda knew each other, and inquired minutely how the acquaintance had commenced. The manner in which ſhe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Amanda, convinced Mrs. Jennings ſhe was not high in her eſtimation, and from this conviction, ſhe thought ſhe might ſafely aſſert any falſehood ſhe pleaſed againſt her. As ſhe knew enough of her Lady's diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to be aſſured ſhe never would contradict an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the prejudice of a perſon ſhe diſliked, by what ſhe deſigned ſaying, ſhe truſted any thing Amanda might ſay againſt her, would appear malicious, and that ſhe ſhould alſo be revenged for the diſdainful air with which ſhe had regarded her.</p>
                     <p>She told her Ladyſhip, "that near a year back, Miſs Fitzalan had been a lodger of her's, as alſo an old offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, ſhe called her father; but had ſhe known what kind of people they were, ſhe never would have admitted them into her houſe. Miſs was followed by ſuch a ſet of gallants, ſhe really thought the reputation of her houſe would have been ruined. Among them was a Colonel Belgrave, a ſad rake, who ſhe believed was the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite. She was determined on making them decamp, when ſuddenly Miſs went off, nobody knew where, but it might eaſily be gueſt ſhe did not travel alone, for the Colonel diſappeared at the ſame time."</p>
                     <p>The character of Fitzalan, and the uniform propriety of Amanda's conduct, forbid Lady Greyſtock's giving implicit credit to what Mrs. Jennings ſaid; ſhe perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it the exaggerations of malice and falſhood, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, ſhe ſuppoſed, by diſappointed avarice, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended pride. She reſolved, however, to relate all ſhe heard to the Marchioneſs, without betraying the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt doubt of its veracity.</p>
                     <p>It may appear ſtrange that Lady Greyſtock, after taking Amanda, unſolicited, under her protection, ſhould without any cauſe for enmity, ſeek to injure her: but Lady Greyſtock was a woman devoid of principle: from ſelfiſh motives ſhe had taken Amanda, and from ſelfiſh motives ſhe was ready to ſacrifice her. Her Ladyſhip
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:038416_0306_1011E3A4067BA718"/>
had enjoyed ſo much happineſs in her matrimonial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, that ſhe had no objection again to enter the liſts of Hymen, and Lord Cherbury was the object at which her preſent wiſhes pointed. The Marchioneſs had hinted, in pretty plain terms, that if ſhe counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted Lord Mortimer's intentions reſpecting Amanda, ſhe would forward her's relative to Lord Cherbury.</p>
                     <p>She thought what Mrs. Jennings had alledged would effectually forward their plans; as ſhe knew, if called upon, ſhe would ſupport it. The next morning ſhe went to Portman Square, to communicate her impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant intelligence to the Marchioneſs and Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia.</p>
                     <p>Joy and exultation ſat upon their features, at receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this intereſting communication, which opened ſo charming a proſpect of ſeparating Lord Mortimer from Amanda, by giving them the power of injuring her character. This joy and exultation they deemed requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for ſome time to conceal: they conſidered their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures would be more ſucceſsful for being gradually brought about, and therefore reſolved rather to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, than directly ſtrike at the peace of Amanda.</p>
                     <p>Like Lady Greyſtock, they diſbelieved Mrs. Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning's tale; but like her Ladyſhip, confined this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief to their own boſoms. In the manner, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Amanda, there was an innocence, a mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that denoted ſomething holy dwelt within her breaſt, and forbid the entrance of any impure or wayward paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: beſides, from a gentleman who had preſided in Devonſhire, they learned the diſtreſs Fitzalan was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to, by Belgrave's revenge for the virtue of his daughter. This gentleman was now, however, on the continent, and they had no fear of their allegations againſt Amanda being contradicted, or their ſchemes againſt her being overthrown.</p>
                     <p>After ſome conſultation, it was agreed, as a means of expediting their plot, that lady Greyſtock and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda ſhould immediately remove to the Marchioneſs's houſe; by this change of abode too, Lord Mortimer would be prevented taking any material ſtep relative to
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:038416_0307_1011E3A79FB66498"/>
Amanda, till the period arrived, when his own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would, moſt probably, render any further trouble on that account unneceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock, on her return to Pall-Mall, after a warm eulogium on the friendſhip of the Marchioneſs, mentioned the invitation ſhe had given them to her houſe, which ſhe declared ſhe could not refuſe, as it was made from an ardent deſire of enjoying more of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety than ſhe had hitherto done, during their ſhort ſtay in London. She alſo told Amanda, that both the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia had expreſt a tender regard for her, and a wiſh of proving to the world, that any coolneſs which exiſted between their families, was removed by her becoming their gueſt.</p>
                     <p>This projected removal was extremely diſagreeable to Amanda, as it not only terminated the morning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviews which were to take place between her and Lord Mortimer, during the abſence of lady Greyſtock with her lawyers, but threatened to impoſe a reſtraint on her looks, as well as actions, being confident, from the views and ſuſpicions of Lady Euphraſia, ſhe ſhould continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be watched with the cloſeſt circumſpection. Her part, however, was acquieſcence; the lodgings were diſcharged, and the next morning they took up their reſidence under the Marquis of Roſline's roof, to the infinite ſurpriſe and mortification of Lord Mortimer, who, like Amanda, anticipated the diſagreeable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which would reſult from it.</p>
                     <p>The altered manner of the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia, ſurpriſed Amanda; they received her not merely with politeneſs, but affection: recapitulated all Lady Greyſtock had already ſaid, concerning their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: bid her conſider herſelf entirely at home in their houſe and appointed a maid ſolely to attend her.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding their former cool, even contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous conduct, Amanda, the child of innocence and ſimplicity, could not believe the alteration in their manners feigned, ſhe rather believed that her own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and humility had at length conciliated their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the idea pleaſed her, and like every other, which

ſhe ſuppoſed could give her father ſatisfaction, it was inſtantly communicated to him.</p>
                     <p>She found herſelf moſt agreeably miſtaken, relative to the reſtraint ſhe had feared: ſhe was perfect miſtreſs of her own time and actions; and when ſhe ſaw Lord Mortimer, no louring looks, no ſtudied interference, as heretofore, from the Marchioneſs or Lady Euphraſia, prevented their frequently converſing together. The Marchioneſs made her ſeveral elegant preſents, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Euphraſia frequently dropt the formal appellation of Miſs Fitzalan, for the more familiar one of Amanda.</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles Bingley, agreeable to his reſolution of not relinquiſhing Amanda, without another effort for her favour, ſtill perſiſted in his attentions, and viſited conſtantly at the Marquis's.</p>
                     <p>Amanda had been about a fortnight in Portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Square, when ſhe went one night with the Marchioneſs, Lady Euphraſia, Miſs Malcolm, and Lady Greyſtock, to the Pantheon. Lord Mortimer had told her, that if he could poſſibly leave a particular party he was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to, he would be there. She therefore, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, wiſhed to keep herſelf diſengaged; but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, on her entrance, ſhe was joined by Sir Charles Bingley, and ſhe found ſhe muſt either dance with him as he requeſted, or conſent to liſten to his uſual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and ſhe choſe the firſt, as being leaſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The dancing over, Sir Charles was conducting her to get ſome refreſhment, when a gentleman haſtily ſtepping forward, ſaluted him by his name. Amanda ſtarted at the ſound of the voice, ſhe raiſed her eyes, and with equal horror and ſurpriſe, beheld Colonel Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave.</p>
                     <p>She turned pale, trembled, and involuntarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "Gracious heaven!" her ſoul recoiled at the ſight, as if an evil genius had ſuddenly darted into her path, to blaſt her hopes of happineſs: ſickening with emotion, her head grew giddy, and ſhe caught Sir Charles's arm, to prevent her falling.</p>
                     <p>Alarmed by her paleneſs and agitation, he haſtily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the cauſe of her diſorder: willing to believe,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:038416_0309_1011E3AD069F6B58"/>
notwithſtanding what he had ſeen, that it did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſight of Colonel Belgrave. "Oh take me, take me from this room," was all in faultering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, Amanda could pronounce, ſtill leaning on him for ſupport. Colonel Belgrave enquired tenderly what they could do to ſerve her, and at the ſame time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to take her hand. She ſhrunk from his touch, with a look of expreſſive horror, and again beſought Sir Charles to take her from the room, and procure her a conveyance home. Her agitation now became conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; it was viſible to Sir Charles that it proceeded from ſeeing Colonel Belgrave, and he trembled as he ſupported her.</p>
                     <p>Belgrave offered his ſervices in aſſiſting to ſupport her from the room, but ſhe motioned with her hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe him.</p>
                     <p>At the door they met Lord Mortimer entering. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the ſituation of Amanda, all caution, all reſerve forſook him, and his rapid and impaſſioned enquiries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the tender intereſt ſhe had in his heart. Unable to anſwer them herſelf, Sir Charles replied for her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "ſhe had been taken extremely ill after dancing," and added, "he would reſign her to his Lordſhip's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection while he went to procure her a chair."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer received the lovely trembler in his arms; he ſoftly called her his Amanda, the beloved of his ſoul, and ſhe began to revive: his preſence was at once a relief and comfort to her, and his language ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the perturbations of her mind; but as ſhe raiſed her head from his ſhoulder, ſhe beheld Colonel Belgrave ſtanding near them. His invidious eyes faſtened on her; ſhe averted her head, and ſaying the air would do her good, Lord Mortimer led her forward, and took this opportunity of expreſſing his wiſhes for the period, when he ſhould be at liberty to watch over her with guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian care, ſooth every weakneſs, and ſoften every care.</p>
                     <p>In a few minutes Sir Charles returned, and told her he had procured a chair. She thanked him with grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſweetneſs for his attention, and requeſted Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer to acquaint the ladies with the reaſon of her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:038416_0310_1011E3B0A27F8718"/>
departure. His Lordſhip wiſhed himſelf to have attended her to Portman Square, but ſhe thought it would appear too particular, and would not ſuffer him. She retired to her room, immediately on her return, and endeavoured though unſucceſsfully, to compoſe her ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>The diſtreſs ſhe ſuffered from Belgrave's conduct, had left an impreſſion on her mind, which could not be eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the terror his preſence inſpired, was too powerful for reaſon to conquer, and raiſed the moſt gloomy preſages, in her mind; ſhe believed him capable of any villainy: his looks had declared a continuance of illicit love; ſhe trembled at the idea of his ſtratagems being renewed; her apprehenſions were doubly painful, from the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of concealment, leſt thoſe dearer to her than exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhould be involved in danger on her account. To heaven ſhe looked up for protection, and the terrors of her heart were ſomewhat leſſened, conſcious that heaven could render the aims of Belgrave againſt her peace, as abortive as thoſe againſt her innocence had been.</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles Bingley parted from Lord Mortimer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Amanda's departure, and returned arm in arm with Belgrave to the room. "Belgrave" ſaid he abruptly, after muſing ſome minutes, "you know Miſs Fitzalan?</p>
                     <p>Belgrave anſwered not haſtily: he appeared as if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating on the reply he ſhould give; at laſt, "I do know Miſs Fitzalan," cried he, "her father was my tenant in Devonſhire; ſhe is one of the lovelieſt girls I ever knew."</p>
                     <p>"Lovely indeed," ſaid Sir Charles with a deep and involuntary ſigh, "but it is ſomewhat extraordinary to me, that inſtead of noticing you as a friend of acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſhe ſhould look alarmed and agitated, as if ſhe had ſeen an enemy."</p>
                     <p>"My dear Bingley," exclaimed Belgrave, "ſurely at this time of day, you cannot be a ſtranger to the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable caprices of the female mind."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="unknown:038416_0311_1011E3B22E5E0A78"/>
" 'Tis very extraordinary to me, I own" reſumed Sir Charles, "that Miſs Fitzalan ſhould behave as ſhe did to you: Were you and her family ever very intimate?"</p>
                     <p>An invidious ſmile lurked on Belgrave's countenance at this queſtion.</p>
                     <p>"Belgrave," exclaimed Sir Charles, paſſionately, your manner appears ſo myſterious, that it diſtracts me; if friendſhip will not induce you to account for it, my intentions, relative to Miſs Fitzalan, will compel me to inſiſt on your doing ſo."</p>
                     <p>"Come, come, Bingley," replied the colonel, "this is not a country for extorting confeſſion; however ſerious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you might depend on my honour, excluſive of my friendſhip, to conceal nothing from you, in which you were materially intereſted." So ſaying, he ſnatched away his arm, ruſhed into the crowd, and inſtantly diſappeared.</p>
                     <p>This aſſurance, however, could not calm the diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude of Sir Charles; his ſoul was tortured with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and anxiety for an explanation of the myſtery, which the agitation of Amanda, and the evaſive anſwers of Belgrave had betrayed. He ſought the latter through the room, till convinced of his departure, and reſolved the next morning to intreat him to deal candidly with him.</p>
                     <p>Agreeable to this reſolution, he was preparing, after breakfaſt, for his viſit, when the letter was brought him, which contained the following lines:</p>
                     <p>"If Sir Charles Bingley has the leaſt regard for his honour or tranquillity, he will immediately relinquiſh his intentions relative to Miſs Fitzalan; this caution comes from a ſincere friend, from a perſon whom delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not want of veracity, urges to this ſecret mode of giving it."</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles peruſed and re-peruſed the letter, as if doubting the evidence of his eyes: he at laſt flung it from him, and claſping his hands together, exclaimed, "This is indeed a horrible explanation:" he took up the deteſted paper; again he examined the characters,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:038416_0312_1011D035303E24B8"/>
and recognized the writing of Colonel Belgrave. He haſtily ſnatched up his hat, and with the paper in his hand, flew directly to his houſe: the Colonel was alone.</p>
                     <p>"Belgrave," ſaid Sir Charles, in almoſt breathleſs agitation, "are you the author of this letter?" pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it to him.</p>
                     <p>Belgrave took it, read it, but continued ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Belgrave," exclaimed Sir Charles, in a voice trembling with agony, "pity and relieve my ſuſpenſe.</p>
                     <p>"I am the author of it," replied Belgrave, with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, "Miſs Fitzalan and I were once tenderly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached; I truſt I am no deliberate libertine; but when a lovely, ſeducing girl was thrown purpoſely in my way—"</p>
                     <p>"Oh ſtop," ſaid Sir Charles, "to me any extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your conduct is unneceſſary; 'tis ſufficient to know, that Miſs Fitzalan and I are for ever ſeparated." His emotion overpowered him—he leaned on a table, and covered his face with a handkerchief.</p>
                     <p>"The ſhock I have received," ſaid he, "almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans me: Amanda was—alas, I muſt ſay, is dear, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſibly dear to my ſoul; I thought her the moſt lovely, the moſt eſtimable of women, and the anguiſh I now feel, is more on her account than my own; I cannot bear the idea of the contempt which may fall upon her: Oh Belgrave, 'tis melancholy to behold a human being, ſo endowed by nature as ſhe is, inſenſible or unworthy of her bleſſings. Amanda," he continued, after a pauſe, "never encouraged me, I therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accuſe her of intending deceit."</p>
                     <p>"She never encouraged you," replied Belgrave, "becauſe ſhe was ambitious of a higher title; Amanda, beneath a ſpecious appearance of innocence, conceals a light diſpoſition, and a deſigning heart; ſhe aſpires to Mortimer's hand, and may probably ſucceed, for his language and attentions to her laſt night, were thoſe of a tender lover."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall return immediately to Ireland," ſaid Sir Charles, "and endeavour to forget I have ever ſeen her; ſhe has made me indeed experience all the fervency of
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:038416_0313_1011E3B6E6B48DD8"/>
love, and bitterneſs of diſappointment; what I felt for her, I think I ſhall never again feel for any woman.</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>I'll lock up all the gates of love,</l>
                        <l>And on my eye-lids ſhall conjecture hang,</l>
                        <l>To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,</l>
                        <l>And never more ſhall it be gracious.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>Sir Charles Bingley, and Colonel Belgrave, in early life, had contracted a friendſhip for each other, which time had ſtrengthened in one, but reduced to a mere ſhadow in the other. On meeting the Colonel unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly in town, Sir Charles had informed him of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions relative to Amanda. His heart throbbed at the mention of her name; he had long endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her; pride, love, and revenge, were all concerned in the accompliſhment of his deſigns, which diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had only ſtimulated. He was one of thoſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined characters, which never relinquiſh a purpoſe, "though heaven and earth that purpoſe croſt." The confidence Sir Charles repoſed in him, joined to his warm and unſuſpicious temper, convinced him he would be credulous enough to believe any imputation he ſhould caſt on Amanda; he therefore loſt no time in contriving his execrable ſcheme, without the ſmalleſt compunction for deſtroying the reputation of an innocent girl, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring the happineſs of an amiable man.</p>
                     <p>Removed from the protection of her father, he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his deſtined victim could not eſcape the ſnare he ſhould ſpread for her; and as means of expediting his ſucceſs, under the appearance of feeling, urged Sir Charles's return to Ireland.</p>
                     <p>The eaſy credit which Sir Charles gave to the vile allegations of Belgrave, cannot be wondered at, when his long intimacy, and total ignorance of his real charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is conſidered. He knew Belgrave to be a gay man, but he never imagined him to be a hardened libertine; beſides <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e never could have ſuppoſed any man would have been ſo audacious, or ſufficiently baſe, as to make ſuch an aſſertion as Belgrave had done againſt Amanda, without truth for its ſupport.</p>

The errors of his friend, though the ſource of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable anguiſh to him, were more pitied than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as he rather believed they proceeded from the impetuoſity of paſſion, than the deliberation of deſign, and that they were long ſince ſincerely repented of.</p>
                     <p>Amanda could not be forgotten, the hold ſhe had on his heart, could not eaſily be ſhaken off, and like the recording angel, he was often tempted to drop a tear over her faults, and obliterate them forever from his memory; this, however, was conſidered the mere ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of weakneſs, and he ordered immediate prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made for his return to Ireland.</p>

                     <p>LORD Mortimer, diſtreſt by the indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Amanda, haſtened, at an earlier hour than uſual (for his morning viſits) to Portman Square, and was uſhered into Lady Euphraſia's dreſſing room, where ſhe and Miſs Malcolm, who had continued with her the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding night, were ſitting tete-a-tete at breakfaſt. His Lordſhip was a welcome viſitor, but it was ſoon obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous on whoſe account he had made his appearance, for ſcarcely were the uſual compliments over, 'ere he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired about Miſs Fitzalan.</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia ſaid, "ſhe was ſtill unwell, and had not yet left her apartment."</p>
                     <p>"She has not recovered the ſurpriſe of laſt night," exclaimed Miſs Malcolm, with a malicious ſmile.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="122" facs="unknown:038416_0315_1011E3BD0E59C848"/>
"What ſurpriſe?" aſked his Lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>"Dear me" replied Miſs Malcolm, "was not your Lordſhip preſent at the time ſhe met Colonel Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave?"</p>
                     <p>"No," ſaid Lord Mortimer, changing colour, "I was not preſent: But what has Colonel Belgrave to ſay to Miſs Fitzalan?" aſked he, in an agitated voice.</p>
                     <p>"That is a queſtion your Lordſhip muſt put to the young lady herſelf," anſwered Miſs Malcolm.</p>
                     <p>"Now I declare," cried Lady Euphraſia, addreſſing her friend, " 'tis very probable her illneſs did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſeeing Colonel Belgrave; you know ſhe never mentioned being acquainted with him, though her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was his tenant in Devonſhire."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer grew more diſturbed, and roſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly.</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia mentioned their intention of going that evening to the play, and invited him to be of the party; he accepted her invitation, and retired.</p>
                     <p>His viſible diſtreſs was a ſource of infinite mirth to the young ladies, which they indulged the moment he quitted the room. The circumſtance relative to Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, the Marchioneſs had informed them of; as ſhe and Lady Greyſtock were near Amanda when ſhe met <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>im.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was unhappy; the mind which has once harboured ſuſpicion, will, from the moſt trivial circumſtance, be tempted again to give admiſſion to the unpleaſing gueſt; nor was it a trivial circumſtance which diſcompoſed the too ſuſceptible heart of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The ſudden illneſs of Amanda, her extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agitation, her eagerneſs to quit the room, the cloſe, though ſilent attendance of Belgrave; all theſe, I ſay, when recalled to recollection, gave an air of probability to Miſs Malcolm's inſinuation, that her diſorder was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſeeing him. From reſiding more conſtantly in England than Sir Charles Bingley had done, he had had more opportunities of learning Belgrave's real cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which he knew to be that of a profeſt libertine. It was ſtrange, he thought, that when Amanda inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:038416_0316_1011E3BFB04F0508"/>
him ſhe once reſided in Devonſhire, ſhe ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her father's being the Colonel's tenant: he began to think her reluctance to a clandeſtine and immediate marriage, might have proceeded from ſome ſecret at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, and not from the ſtrict adherence of filial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which had exalted her ſo much in his opinion.</p>
                     <p>Yet the idea was ſcarcely formed ere he endeavoured to ſuppreſs it; he ſtarted as if from an uneaſy dream, and wondered how he could have conceived this, or any other idea, injurious to Amanda; he felt a degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe at having allowed her, for a moment to be leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his opinion: her tenderneſs, her purity, he ſaid to himſelf, could not be feigned: no, ſhe was a treaſure greater than he deſerved to poſſeſs; nor would he, like a wayward ſon of error, fling away the happineſs he had ſo long deſired to obtain.</p>
                     <p>The calm this reſolution produced, was but tranſient; doubts had been raiſed, and doubts could not be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; he was inclined to think them unjuſt, yet had not power to diſpel them. Vainly he applied to the ideas which had heretofore been ſuch conſolatory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of comfort to him, namely, that his father would conſent to his union with Amanda, through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of his aunt; and the felicity he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in that union, an unuſual heavineſs clung to his heart, which like a gloomy ſky, caſt a ſhade of ſadneſs over every proſpect. Thoughtful and penſive he reached home, juſt as Sir Charles Bingley was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door who informed him he had juſt received a note from Lord Cherbury, deſiring his immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer attended him to the Earl, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him that he had received a letter from Mr. Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan, in which he expreſſed a warm ſenſe of the honour Sir Charles did his family, by addreſſing Miſs Fitzalan; and that to have her united to a character ſo truly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable would give him the trueſt happineſs, from the conviction that her's would be ſecured by ſuch an union. "He has written to his daughter, expreſſing his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents," continued Lord Cherbury; " I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

no doubt, Sir Charles, but what every thing will ſucceed to your wiſh.</p>
                     <p>"I am ſorry, my Lord," cried Sir Charles, with an agitated voice, and a cheek fluſhed with emotion, "that I ever troubled your Lordſhip in this affair, as I have now, and forever, relinquiſhed all ideas of an union with Miſs Fitzalan."</p>
                     <p>"The reſolution is really ſomewhat extraordinary and ſudden," replied the Earl, "after the converſation which ſo lately paſſed between us."</p>
                     <p>"Adopted, however, my Lord, from a thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that happineſs could never be attained in an union with that young lady."—Sir Charles's tenderneſs for Amanda was ſtill undiminiſhed: he wiſhed to preſerve her from cenſure, and thus proceeded:</p>
                     <p>"Your Lordſhip muſt allow I could have little chance of happineſs in allying myſelf to a woman who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and uniformly treated me with indifference: paſſion blinded my reaſon, when I addreſſed your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip relative to Miſs Fitzalan, but its miſts are now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and ſober reflection obliges me to relinquiſh a ſcheme, whoſe accompliſhment could not poſſibly give me ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>"You are certainly the beſt judge, of your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Sir Charles," replied the Earl; "my acting in the affair proceeded from a wiſh to ſerve you, as well as from my friendſhip to Captain Fitzalan; I muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your conduct will never diſparage your own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or caſt a ſlight upon Miſs Fitzalan."</p>
                     <p>"That, my Lord, you may be aſſured of," ſaid Sir Charles, with ſome warmth, "my actions and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have hitherto and will ever, I truſt, bear the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inveſtigation. I cannot retire without thanking your Lordſhip for the intereſt you took in my favour: had things ſucceeded as I then hoped and expected, I cannot deny but I ſhould have been much happier than I am at preſent. He then bowed and retired.</p>
                     <p>Lor Mortimer had liſtened with aſtoniſhment to Sir Charles's relinquiſhment of Amanda: like his father, he thought it a ſudden and extraordinary reſolution:—he
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:038416_0318_1011E3C600D827F0"/>
was before jealous of Amanda's love—he was now jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her honour. The agitation of Sir Charles ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to imply even a cauſe more powerful than her cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for reſigning her: he recollected that the Baronet and the Colonel were intimate friends: diſtracted by apprehenſions, he ruſhed out of the houſe, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took Sir Charles ere he had quitted the ſquare.</p>
                     <p>"Why Bingley," cried he, with affected gaiety, "I thought you too valient a knight to be eaſily overcome by deſpair; and that without firſt trying every effort to win her fovour, you never would give up a fair lady you had ſet your heart on."</p>
                     <p>"I leave ſuch efforts for your Lordſhip," replied Sir Charles, "or thoſe who have equal patience."</p>
                     <p>"But ſeriouſly, Bingley, I think this ſudden reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miſs Fitzalan ſomewhat ſtrange: why, laſt night I could have ſworn you were as much attached to her as ever. From Lord Cherbury's friendſhip for Captain Fitzalan, I think her, in ſome degree, under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and mine; and as the particularity of your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions attracted obſervation, I think your abruptly withdrawing them requires explanation."</p>
                     <p>"As Lord Cherbury was the perſon I applied to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to Miſs Fitzalan," exclaimed Sir Charles, "and as he was ſatisfied with the motive I aſſigned for my conduct, be aſſured, my Lord, I ſhall never give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to you."</p>
                     <p>"Your words," retorted Lord Mortimer with warmth, "imply that there was another motive for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, than the one you avowed: what horrid infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may not be drawn from ſuch an inſinuation? Oh, Sir Charles, reputation is a fragile flower, which the ſlighteſt breath may injure."</p>
                     <p>"My Lord, if Miſs Fitzalan's reputation is never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured but by my means, it will ever continue unſullied."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot, indeed, reſumed Lord Mortimer, "ſtile myſelf her guardian, but I conſider myſelf her friend; and from the feelings of friendſhip, ſhall ever evince my intereſt in her welfare, and reſent any conduct which can poſſibly render her an object of cenſure to any being."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="unknown:038416_0319_1011E3C7989810F8"/>
"Allow me to aſk your Lordſhip one queſtion," cried Sir Charles, "and promiſe, on your honour, to anſwer it."</p>
                     <p>"I do promiſe," ſaid Lord Mortimer.</p>
                     <p>"Then, my Lord, Did you ever really wiſh I ſhould ſucceed with Miſs Fitzalan?"</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer coloured, "You expect, Sir Charles, I ſhall anſwer you on my honour? Then really I never did."</p>
                     <p>"Your paſſions and mine," continued Sir Charles, "are impetuous; we had better check them in time, leaſt they lead us to lengths we may hereafter repent of. Of Miſs Fitzalan's fame, be aſſured, no man could be more tenacious than I ſhould:—I love her with the trueſt ardour:—her acceptance of my propoſals would have given me felicity:—my ſuddenly withdrawing them, can never injure her, when I declare my motive for ſo doing, was her indifference. Lord Cherbury is ſatisfied with the reaſon I have aſſigned for reſigning her; he is conſcious that no man of ſenſibility could experience happineſs with a woman, in whoſe heart he knew he had no intereſt: this, I ſuppoſe, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will alſo allow."</p>
                     <p>"Certainly," replied Lord Mortimer.</p>
                     <p>"Then it ſtrikes me, my Lord, that it is your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, not mine, which has a tendency to injure Miſs Fitzalan: that it is your words, not mine, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey an inſinuation againſt her: you really appear if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious ſome other cauſe exiſted, which would have made me relinquiſh her, without the one I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy aſſigned for doing ſo."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was inſtantly convinced of the juſtice of what Sir Charles ſaid; he began to fear his warmth would really prove prejudicial to Amanda; betray the doubts which had obtruded on his mind, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to thoſe who might not be equally influenced by tenderneſs and delicacy to conceal them.</p>
                     <p>"You are right, Sir Charles," ſaid he, "in what you have ſaid, paſſion, like a bad advocate, hurts the cauſe in which it is engaged. From my knowledge of your
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:038416_0320_1011E3CA36E3E140"/>
character, I ſhould have been convinced your honour would have prevented any improper conduct. You are going to Ireland; permit me, Sir Charles, to offer you my beſt wiſhes for your future happineſs."</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles took Lord Mortimer's extended hand:—he reſpected and eſteemed his Lordſhip, and a mutual interchange of good wiſhes took place between them, as this was the laſt interview they expected for a long time.</p>
                     <p>The indiſpoſition of Amanda was more of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal than the bodily kind, and on the firſt intimation of a party to the play, ſhe agreed to join it, in hopes the amuſement would remove her dejection. Her father's letter, relative to Sir Charles Bingley, had given her ſome uneaſineſs, but as he left her free to act, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented herſelf with uſing the negative he allowed her, by a ſolemn reſolution of never acting contrary to his inclinations, and anſwered his letter to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer and Freelove attended the ladies in the evening to the play. His Lordſhip found an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of tenderly inquiring after Amanda's health.—When they were ſeated in the houſe, he perceived a lady in another box, to whom he wiſhed to ſpeak, and accordingly left his party. This lady offered him a ſeat by herſelf, which he accepted. She was a ſtranger to Amanda, young, and extremely beautiful. Amanda, however, had none of that fooliſh weekneſs which could make her dread a rival in every new face, or feel uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at Lord Mortimer's attention to any woman but her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; aſſured that his affections for her were founded on the baſis of eſteem, and that ſha would retain them while worthy of eſteem; ſhe could, without being diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the agreeable converſation he appeared enjoying, fix her attention on the ſtage; ſo entirely, indeed, that ſhe obſerved not, from time to time the glances Lord Mortimer directed towards her:—not ſo his fair compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; ſhe noticed the wanderings of his eyes, and her own involuntarily purſued their courſe. She was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the moment, but ſuddenly ſtopt, and Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:038416_0321_1011E3CBF33227C8"/>
ſaw her change colour. He turned pale himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in a faultering voice, aſked her, "if ſhe knew the lady ſhe had been looking at?"</p>
                     <p>"Know her," replied ſhe, "oh heavens! but too well."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer trembled univerſally, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to have recourſe to his handkerchief, to hide his emotion.</p>
                     <p>It was by Adela, the lovely and neglected wife of Belgrave, he was ſitting. She had been a ſhort time in London, and her acquaintance with Lord Mortimer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced at a ball, where ſhe had danced with him. He was not one of thoſe kind of men who when in love have neither eyes or ears, but for the object of that love; he could ſee perfections in other women, beſides his Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and was particularly pleaſed with Mrs. Belgrave. He inſtantly perceived ſhe knew Amanda; alſo, that that knowledge was attended with pain. The well known profligacy of her huſband intruded on his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and he ſhuddered at the dreadful thoughts which roſe in his mind.</p>
                     <p>Curioſity had directed the eyes of Adela to Amanda, but admiration, and an idea of having ſomewhere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen her face, rivetted them upon her; at laſt, the picture Oſcar Fitzalan had ſhewn, occurred to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, and ſhe was immediately convinced it was no other than the original of that picture ſhe now ſaw. Shocked at the ſight of a perſon, who, as ſhe thought had ſtept (though innocently) between her and felicity; and diſtreſt by the emotions which paſt ſcenes thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called gave riſe to, ſhe entreated Lord Mortimer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her from the box, that ſhe might return home.</p>
                     <p>He complied with her requeſt, but ſtopt in the lobby, and entreated her to tell him "where ſhe had known the lady ſhe had ſo attentively regarded." Adela, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would, if poſſible, have evaded the queſtion; but the earneſtneſs of his Lordſhip's manner, compelled her to anſwer it. She ſaid "ſhe had no perſonal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the lady, but recollected her face, from having ſeen her picture with a gentleman."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="unknown:038416_0322_1011E3CD872F4390"/>
"And who was the gentleman," aſked Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, with a forced ſmile, and a faltering voice.</p>
                     <p>"That," replied Adela, with involuntary quickneſs "I will not tell."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhould apologize, indeed," cried Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, recollecting himſelf, "for a curioſity which may appear impertinent." He led her to a chair, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated whether he ſhould not follow her example in quitting the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Malcolm had firſt made him uneaſy; uneaſineſs introduced doubts which Sir Charles Bingley had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and Mrs. Belgrave almoſt confirmed. He dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a horrid confirmation of his fears; the picture, like Othello's handkerchief, was a ſource of unſpeakable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. The agitation that Mrs. Belgrave had betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on mentioning it, joined to her concealment of the gentleman ſhe had ſeen it with, tempted him to believe, he was no other than her huſband.</p>
                     <p>Yet that he might not be accuſed of yielding raſhly to jealouſy, he reſolved to confine his ſuſpicions, like his pangs, to his own boſom, except aſſured they were well ſounded; a little time, he ſuppoſed, would determine the opinion he ſhould form of Amanda. If he found ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged Belgrave, he reſolved to leave her without an explanation: if, on the contrary, he ſaw that ſhe avoided him, he meant to mention the circumſtance of the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to her, yet ſo as not to hurt her feelings, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by her anſwer, relative to his future conduct. He returned at laſt to the box, and procured a ſeat behind her. He had not occupied it long, 'ere Colonel Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave (who from a retired part of the houſe, where he ſat with ſome female friends, had obſerved Amanda) entered the next box, and made his way to the pillar againſt which ſhe leaned. He endeavoured to catch her eyes but the noiſe he made on entering, put her on her guard, and ſhe inſtantly averted her face. Her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment was viſible to her party, and they all, Lord Mortimer excepted, enjoyed it; ſcarcely could he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from chaſtiſing the audacity of Belgrave's locks,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:038416_0323_1011E3D31A2ADA40"/>
who ſtill continued to gaze on Amanda, though he could not ſee her face; nothing but the diſcovery which ſuch a ſtep would produce, could have prevented his Lordſhip, in his preſent irritable ſtate of mind, from chaſtiſing what he deemed the height of inſolence.</p>
                     <p>At laſt the hour came for relieving Amanda from a ſituation extremely painful to her. As Lord Mortimer ſat next the Marchioneſs, he was compelled to offer her his hand. Freelove led Lady Euphraſia; Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock and Miſs Malco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m followed her, and Amanda was the laſt who quitted the box. A crowd in the lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by impeded their progreſs. Amanda was cloſe behind the Marchioneſs, when Belgrave forced his way to her, and attempted to take her hand at the very moment Lord Mortimer turned to look at her, who heard him ſay. "Dear, though unkind Amanda, why this cruel change in your conduct?"</p>
                     <p>The eyes of Mortimer flaſhed fire: "Miſs Fitzalan," ſaid he, in a voice trembling through paſſion, "if you accept my arm, I will make way for you, or at leaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you from impertinence." Amanda, though trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and confounded by his looks, heſitated not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his offer. Belgrave knew his words alluded to him; at preſent, however, he reſolved not to reſent them, convinced, that if he did, his views on Amanda would be defeated. From that moment her beauty was not more powerful in ſtimulating his deſigns, than his deſire of revenge on Lord Mortimer. He ſaw he was fondly attached to Amanda, and he believed his proud heart would feel no event ſo afflictive as that which ſhould deprive him of her.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer handed Amanda to the carriage; he was preſt to return to ſupper, but refuſed. The ladies found the Marquis and Lord Cherbury together. Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da retired to her chamber immediately after ſupper; the preſence of Belgrave had increaſed the dejection which ſhe hoped the amuſements of the theatre would have diſſipated; ſhe now indeed longed for the period, when ſhe ſhould be entitled to the protection of Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: when ſhe ſhould no longer dread the and city <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſtratagems of Belgrave. Lord Cherbury, on her retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſt his regret at her coldneſs to Sir Charles Bingley, by which ſhe had loſt a moſt honourable and advantageous attachment.</p>
                     <p>This was an opportunity not to be neglected by the Marchioneſs, for commencing her operations againſt Fitzalan. A glance to Lady Greyſtock was the ſignal to begin.</p>
                     <p>"To thoſe," ſaid Lady Greyſtock, "who are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Miſs Fitzalan's real motives for refuſing Sir Charles, it muſt appear, no doubt, extraordinary; but ambitious people are not eaſily ſatisfied; indeed I cannot blame her ſo much, for entertaining aſpiring notions, as thoſe who inſtilled them into her mind."</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury ſtared, and requeſted an explanation of her words.</p>
                     <p>"Why I declare, my Lord," cried ſhe, "I do not know but that it will be more friendly to explain than conceal my meaning; when once informed of the young lady's views, your lordſhip may be able to convince her of their fallacy, and prevail on her not to loſe another good opportunity of ſettling herſelf in conſequence of them; in ſhort, my Lord, Miſs Fitzalan, prompted by her father, has caſt her eyes on Lord Mortimer; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming on your friendſhip, he thought an union between them might eaſily be accompliſhed. I do not believe Lord Mortimer, at firſt, gave any encouragement to their deſigns: but when the girl was continually thrown in his way, it was impoſſible not to notice her at laſt. I really expreſt a thorough diſapprobation to her con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing to London, knowing their motives for deſiring the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion, but her father never ceaſed perſecuting me, till I conſented to take her under my protection."</p>
                     <p>"Upon my word," cried the Marquis, who was not of the ladies privy council, though if he had, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he would not have objected to their ſchemes, "Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fitzalan muſt have had ſome ſuch motive, as this Lady Greyſtock has mentioned, for ſending his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to London, or elſe he would not have been ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:038416_0325_1011E3D78AAE7B58"/>
as to put himſelf to the expence of ſitting her out, for company ſhe has no right to enter."</p>
                     <p>"I never thought," exclaimed Lord Cherbury, whoſe mind was irritated to the moſt violent degree of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt his injured friend, "that Captain Fitzalan could have acted with ſuch duplicity. He knew the views I entertained for my ſon, and there is a mean treachery in his attempting to counteract them.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, my Lord," ſaid Lady Greyſtock, "you are a father yourſelf, and muſt make allowances for the anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of a parent to eſtabliſh a child."</p>
                     <p>"No madam," he replied, " I can make no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for a deviation from integrity, or for a ſacrifice of honour and gratitude at the ſhrine of intereſt: the ſubject has diſcompoſed me, and I muſt beg to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for abruptly retiring: nothing, indeed, I believe, can wound one ſo ſeverely as deceit, where one repoſed implicit confidence."</p>
                     <p>The ladies were enraptured at the ſucceſs of their ſcheme. The paſſion of Lord Cherbury could ſcarcely be ſmothered in their preſence. On the head of Fitza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan they knew it would burſt with full violence. They did not mention Belgrave; relative to him they reſolved to affect profound ignorance.</p>
                     <p>The paſſions of Lord Cherbury were impetuous. He had, as I have already hinted, ſecret motives for deſiring a connexion between his family and the Marquis's; and the idea of that deſire being defeated, drove him almoſt to diſtraction. He knew his ſon's paſſions, though not ſo eaſily irritated as his own, were, when once irritated, equally violent. To remonſtrate with him concerning Miſs Fitzalan, he believed would be unavailing; he therefore reſolved, if poſſible, to have her removed out of his way, ere he appriſed him of the diſcovery he had made of his attachment. He entertained not a doubt of Lady Greyſtock's veracity; from his general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of mankind, he believed ſelf the predominant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in every breaſt. His feelings were too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent not to ſeek an immediate vent, and ere he went to bed, he wrote a bitter and reproachful letter to Fitzalan,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:038416_0326_1011E3D918B220D8"/>
which concluded with an intreaty, or rather a command, to ſend, without delay, for his daughter. A dreadful ſtroke this for poor Fitzalan.
<q>
                           <l>After all his wanderings round this world of care,</l>
                           <l>And all his griefs—</l>
                        </q>
He hoped he had at laſt found a ſpot, where his latter days might cloſe in tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>The innocent Amanda was received the next morning with ſmiles, by thoſe who were preparing a plot for her deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt at breakfaſt, a ſervant informed Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock a young woman wanted to ſpeak to her.</p>
                     <p>"Who is ſhe?" aſked her Ladyſhip, "Did ſhe not ſend up her name?"</p>
                     <p>"No, my Lady, but ſhe ſaid ſhe had particular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with your Ladyſhip."</p>
                     <p>The Marchioneſs directed ſhe might be ſhewed up, and a girl about ſeventeen was accordingly uſhered into the room. Her figure was delicate, and her face inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting, not only from its innocence, but the ſtrong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of melancholy diffuſed over it. She appeared trembling with confuſion and timidity, and the poverty of her apparel implied the ſource of her dejection.</p>
                     <p>"So, child," ſaid Lady Greyſtock, after ſurveying her from head to foot, "I am told you have buſineſs with me,"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Madam," replied ſhe, in an accent ſo low as ſcarcely to be heard, "my father, Captain Ruſhbrook, deſired me to deliver a letter to your ladyſhip."</p>
                     <p>She preſented it, and endeavoured to ſcreen herſelf from the ſcrutinizing and contemptuous glances of lady Euphraſia by pulling her hat more over her face.</p>
                     <p>"I wonder, child," ſaid Lady Greyſtock, as ſhe open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the letter, "what your father can write to me about? I dont ſuppoſe it can be about the affair he mentioned the other day?—Why really," continued ſhe, after ſhe had peruſed it, " I believe he takes me for a fool; I am aſtoniſhed, after his inſolent conduct, how he can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:038416_0327_1011E3DBF36A1C00"/>
have the aſſurance to make application to me for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: no, no, child, he neglected the opportunity he had of ſecuring me his friend; it would really be a ſin to give him the power of bringing up his family in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; no, no, child, he muſt learn you, and the other little dainty miſſes he has, to do ſomething for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves."</p>
                     <p>The poor girl bluſhed: a tear trembled in her eye; ſhe tried to ſuppreſs it, but it forced its way, and dropt into her boſom. Amanda, inexpreſſibly ſhocked, could ſupport the ſcene no longer; ſhe retired precipitately, and deſcended to the parlour; ſympathy as well as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion made her feel for this daughter of affliction, for ſhe herſelf knew what it was to feel the inſolence of proſperity, " the proud man's ſcorn, and all thoſe ills which patient merit of the unworthy takes."</p>
                     <p>In a few minutes Miſs Ruſhbrook quitted the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing room, and ſtopt in the hall to wipe away her tears. Amanda had been watching for her, and now appeared: ſhe ſtarted, and was hurrying away, when Amanda caught her hand, and leading her ſoftly to the parlour, endeavoured, with angelic ſweetneſs, to calm her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Surpriſed at this unexpected attention, and over come by her feelings, the poor girl ſunk on her chair, and dropping her head on Amanda's boſon, wet it with a ſhower of tears, as ſhe exclaimed, " Alas! my unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate parents, how can I return to behold your miſery? the grave is the only refuge for you and your wretched children."</p>
                     <p>"You muſt not encourage ſuch deſponding thoughts," ſaid Amanda, "Providence, all bounteous and all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, is able, in a ſhort time, to change the gloomieſt ſcene into one of brightneſs. Tell me," ſhe continued, after a pauſe, "where do you reſide?"</p>
                     <p>"At Kenſington."</p>
                     <p>"Kenſington," repeated Amanda, "ſurely, in your preſent ſituation, you are unable to take ſuch a walk."</p>
                     <p>"I muſt attempt it, however," replied Miſs Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brock.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="unknown:038416_0328_1011E3DF0F0DD220"/>
Amanda walked from her to the window, revolving a ſcheme which had juſt darted into her mind; "If you knew any houſe, "ſaid ſhe, "where you could ſtay for a ſhort time, I would call on you in a carriage and leave you at home."</p>
                     <p>This offer was truly pleaſing to the poor weak trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling girl, but ſhe modeſtly declined it, from the fear of giving trouble. Amanda beſought her not to waſte time in ſuch unneceſſary ſcruples, but to give her the deſired information.</p>
                     <p>She accordingly informed her there was a Haberdaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's in Bond ſtreet, mentioning the name, where ſhe could ſtay till called for.</p>
                     <p>This point ſettled, Amanda, fearful of being ſurpriſed, conducted her ſoftly to the hall-door, and immediately returned to the drawing-room, where ſhe found La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Euphraſia juſt beginning to read Ruſhbrook's letter, for her mother's amuſement.</p>
                     <p>Its ſtile evidently denoted the painful conflicts there were between pride and diſtreſs, ere the former could be ſufficiently ſubdued, to allow an application for relief to the perſon who had occaſioned the latter; the ſight of a tender and beloved wife languiſhing in the arms of ſickneſs, ſurrounded by a family, under the preſſure of the ſevereſt want, had forced him to a ſtep, which, on his own account, no neceſſity could have compelled him to take. He and his family, he ſaid, had drank the cup of miſery to the very dregs: he waved the claims of juſtice, he only aſſerted thoſe of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in his preſent application to her Ladyſhip; and theſe, he flattered himſelf, ſhe would allow: he had ſent a young petitioner in his behalf, whoſe tearful eye, whoſe faded cheek, were ſad evidences of the miſery he deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>The Marchioneſs declared ſhe was aſtoniſhed at his inſolence in making ſuch an application, and Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia proteſted it was the moſt ridiculous ſtuff ſhe had ever read.</p>
                     <p>Amanda, in this, as well as many other inſtances, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from her L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Out of the allowance her father made her for cloathes and other expences, about ten guineas remained, which ſhe had intended laying out in the purchaſe of ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments for her appearance at a ball, to be given in the courſe of the enſuing week, by the Dutcheſs of B—, and for which, at the time of invitation, Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had engaged her for his partner, to give up going to this ball, to conſecrate to charity the money devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vanity, was her project; and moſt fortunate did ſhe deem the application of Ruſhbrook, ere her purchaſe was made, and ſhe conſequently prevented from giving her mite. Her ſoul revolted from the inhumanity of the Marchioneſs, her daughter and Lady Greyſtock. Exempt from the calamities of want themſelves, they forgot the pity due to thoſe calamities in others; if this coldneſs, this obduracy, ſhe cried within herſelf, is the effect of proſperity: if thus it cloſes the avenues of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and compaſſion, oh! never may the dangerous viſitor approach me, for ill ſhould I think the glow of compaſſion and ſenſibility exchanged for all its gaudy pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>The ladies had mentioned their intention of going to an auction, where, to uſe Lady Euphraſia's phraſe, "they expected to ſee all the world." Amanda excuſed herſelf from being of the party, ſaying, ſhe wanted to make ſome purchaſes in the city. Her excuſe was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily admitted, and when they retired to their reſpective toilets, ſhe ſent for a carriage, and being prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it came, immediately ſtept into it, and was driven to Bond ſtreet, where ſhe found Miſs Ruſhbrook with trembling anxiety waiting her arrival.</p>
                     <p>In their way to Kenſington, the tenderneſs of Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da at once conciliated the affection, and gained the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire confidence of her young companion. She related the little hiſtory of her parents' ſorrows. Her father, on returning from America, with his wife and ſix chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, had been adviſed by Mr. Heathfield, the friend who had effected a reconciliation between him and his
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:038416_0330_1011E3E3E3217438"/>
uncle, to commence a ſuit againſt Lady Greyſtock, on the preſumption that the will, by which ſhe enjoyed Sir Geoffry's fortune, was illegally executed. He offered him his purſe to carry on the ſuit, and his houſe for an habitation. Ruſhbrook gratefully and gladly accepted both offers, and having diſpoſed of his commiſſion, to diſcharge ſome preſent demands againſt him, he and his family took up their reſidence under Mr. Heathfield's hoſpitable roof. In the midſt of the felicity enjoyed beneath it; in the midſt of the hopes their own ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine tempers, and the flattering ſuggeſtions of the lawyers had excited, a violent fever carried off their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benevolent friend, 'ere a will was executed, in which he had promiſed largely to conſider Ruſhbrook. His heir, narrow and illiberal, had long feared that his intereſt would be hurt by the affection he entertained for Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook: and as if in revenge for the pain this fear had given, the moment he had the power he ſhewed his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant diſpoſition, ſold all the furniture of the houſe at Kenſington, and, as a great favour, told Ruſhbrook he might continue in it till the expiration of the half year, when it was to be given up to the landlord. The law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers underſtanding the ſtate of his finances, ſoon inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him he could no longer expect their aſſiſtance.—Thus, almoſt in one moment, did all his pleaſing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects vaniſh, and,
<q>Like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion, left not a wreck behind.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As a duty he owed his family, he tried whether Lady Greyſtock would make a compromiſe between juſtice and avarice, and afford him ſome means of ſupport. Her inſolence and inhumanity ſhocked him to the ſoul; and as he left her preſence, he reſolved never to enter it again, or apply to her: this laſt reſolution, however, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued till the diſtreſſes of his family grew ſo great as to threaten their exiſtence, perticularly that of his wife's who, overpowered by grief, had ſunk into a languiſhing illneſs, which every day increaſed for want of proper aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="unknown:038416_0331_1011E3E6A3C8E380"/>
In hopes of procuring her ſome, he was tempted again to apply to Lady Greyſtock. The youth and innocence of his daughter, would, he thought, if any thing could do it, ſoften her flinty heart: beſides, he believed that pleaſure, at finding his pretentions to the fortune entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrawn, would influence her to adminiſter from it to his wants.</p>
                     <p>"We have," ſaid Miſs Ruſhbrook, as ſhe concluded her ſimple narration, "tried, and been diſappointed in our laſt reſource: what will become of us I know not; we have long been ſtrangers to the comforts, but even the neceſſaries of life we cannot now procure."</p>
                     <p>"Comfort," cried Amanda, "often arrives when leaſt expected: to deſpair, into doubt the goodneſs of a Being, who has promiſed to protect all his creatures."</p>
                     <p>The carriage had now reached Kenſington, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few yards of Ruſhbrook's habitation. Amanda ſtopt it; ſhe took Miſs Ruſhbrook's hand, and as ſhe ſlipt a ten pound note into it, exclaimed, " I truſt the period is not far diſtant, when the friendſhip we have conceived for each other, may be cultivated under more fortunate auſpices."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Ruſhbrook opened the folded paper: ſhe ſtarted, and " the hectic of a moment fluſhed her cheek."—"Oh! Madam," ſhe cried, "your goodneſs—" tears impeded her further utterance.</p>
                     <p>"Do not diſtreſs me," ſaid Amanda, again taking her hand, "by mentioning ſuch a trifle; was my abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty equal to my inclination I ſhould bluſh to offer it to your acceptance: as it is, conſider it but as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte of the bounty which heaven has, I doubt not, in ſtore for you."</p>
                     <p>She then deſired the door to be opened, and told her companion ſhe would no longer detain her. Miſs Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook affectionately kiſſed her hand, and exclaimed, "You look like an angel, and your goodneſs is correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to your looks. I will not, madam refuſe your bounty, I accept it with gratitude, for thoſe dearer to me than myſelf: but ah! may I not indulge a hope of
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:038416_0332_1011E3E9457C7310"/>
ſeeing you again: you are ſo kind, ſo gentle, madam, that every care is lulled into forgetfulneſs whilſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with you."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall certainly ſee you again as ſoon as poſſible," replied Amanda.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Ruſhbrook then quitted the carriage, which Amanda ordered back to town, and bid the coachman drive as faſt as poſſible. They had not proceeded far, when the traces ſuddenly gave way; and the man was obliged to diſmount, and procure aſſiſtance from a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic houſe on the road, in repairing them. This occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a delay, which greatly diſtreſſed Amanda. ſhe wiſhed greatly to get home before the ladies, leſt, if this was not the caſe, her long abſence ſhould make lady Greyſtock, who was remarkably inquiſitive, inquire the reaſon of it; and to tell her ſhe had a ſtrong objection, convinced as ſhe was, that her Ladyſhip's knowing ſhe relieved objects ſo extremely diſagreeable to her, would occaſion a quarrel between them, which would either render a longer reſidence together impoſſible, or highly diſagreeable; and to leave London at the preſent cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, when every thing relative to Lord Mortimer was drawing to a concluſion, was not to be thought of without the greateſt pain.</p>
                     <p>At length the coachman remounted his box, and the velocity with which he drove, flattered her with the hope of reaching home as ſoon as ſhe wiſhed. Tranquilized by this hope, ſhe again indulged her imagination with ideas of the comfort her little bounty had probably giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Ruſhbrook and his dejected family; ſo ſweet to her ſoul was the ſecret approbation which crowned her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſo preferable to any pleaſure ſhe could have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced at a ball, that even the diſappointment ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Lord Mortimer would feel from her declining it, was overlooked in the ſatisfaction ſhe felt from the action ſhe performed. She was convinced he would inquire her reaſon for not going, which ſhe determined at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to conceal; it would appear like oſtentation, ſhe thought, to ſay, that the money requiſite for her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ball, was expended in charity, and perhaps
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:038416_0333_1011E3EBD8F54070"/>
excite his generoſity, in a manner which delicacy at preſent forbid her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>owing.</p>
                     <p>She aſked the footman who handed her from the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whether the ladies were returned; and on being anſwered in the affirmative, inquired the hour, and learned it was juſt dinner time. Flurried by this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſhe haſtened to her chamber, followed by the maid appointed to attend her, who ſaid Lady Greyſtock had enquired for her as ſoon as ſhe came home. Amanda dreſſed herſelf with unuſual expedition, and repaired to the drawing room, where, in addition to the family party, ſhe found Lord Mortimer, Freelove, Miſs Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm, and ſome other ladies and gentlemen, aſſembled.</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me, child," ſaid Lady Greyſtock, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe entered the room, " where have you been the whole day?"</p>
                     <p>"I declar, Miſs Fitzalan," exclaimed Lady Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, "I believe you ſtole a march ſomewhere upon us this morning."</p>
                     <p>"Well," cried Miſs Malcolm, laughing, "your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip muſt know that people generally have ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reaſon for ſtolen marches, which they do not chuſe to divulge."</p>
                     <p>Amanda treated this malicious inſinuation with the ſilent contempt it merited; and on Lady Greyſtock's again aſking her where ſhe had been, ſaid, in a low heſitating voice, "In the city."</p>
                     <p>"In the city?" repeated Lord Mortimer.</p>
                     <p>This ſudden exclamation ſtartled her: ſhe looked at him, and perceived him regarding her with the moſt ſcrutinizing earneſtneſs. She bluſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed deeply, as if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in a falſhood, and immediately bent her eyes to the ground.</p>
                     <p>The converſation now changed, but it was ſome time ere Amanda's confuſion ſubſided.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer, indeed, had a reaſon for his excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſhe little thought of. He had met the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs and her companions, by appointment, at the auction, but ſoon grew weary of his ſituation, which the preſence of Amanda could alone have rendered tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:038416_0334_1011E3EE74133CE0"/>
He pleaded buſineſs as an excuſe for withdrawing, and hurrying home, ordered his phaeton, and proceeded towards Kenſington. As he paſt the carriage in which Amanda ſat, at the time the traces were mending, he careleſsly looked into it, and directly recognized her. Lady Euphraſia had informed him ſhe excuſed herſelf from their party on account of ſome buſineſs in the city. He never heard of her having any acquaintance in or about Kenſington, and was at once alarmed and ſurpriſed by diſcovering her. He drove to ſome diſtance from the carriage and as ſoon as it began to move, purſued it with equal velocity, till it reached town, and then giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his phaeton in charge to the ſervant, followed it on foot, till he ſaw Amanda alight from it at the Marquis of Roſline's. Amanda had eſcaped ſeeing his Lordſhip, by a profound meditation in which ſhe was engaged at the moment, as ſhe penſively leaned againſt the ſide of the carriage. Lord Mortimer walked back with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed diſorder to meet his phaeton. As he approached it, he ſaw Colonel Belgrave by it, on horſeback, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the horſes, which were remarkably fine, and aſking to whom they belonged. His acquaintance with the Colonel had hitherto never exceeded more than a paſſing bow; now prompted by an irreſiſtible impulſe, he ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him familiarly; inquired, "Whether he had had a pleaſant ride that morning, and how far he had been."</p>
                     <p>"No farther than Kenſington," replied the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</p>
                     <p>This anſwer was confirmation ſtrong to all the fears of Lord Mortimer; he turned pale, dropt the reins which he had taken, with an intention of remounting, and without even noticing the Colonel, ſlew from the place, and arrived at home in almoſt a ſtate of diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was engaged to dine at the Marquis's, but in the firſt violence of his feelings, reſolved on ſending an apology. Ere the ſervant, however, ſummoned for that purpoſe, had entered his apartment, he changed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. "I will go," ſaid he, "though appearances are againſt her, ſhe may perhaps (and he tried to derive
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:038416_0335_1011E3F12773E250"/>
ſome comfort from the idea) be able ſatisfactorily to account for her being at Kenſington."</p>
                     <p>Tortured by conflicting paſſions, alternately hoping and doubting, he arrived in Portman Square.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock and Lady Euphraſia dwelt with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the length of Amanda's morning excurſion. When ſhe entered the room, he thought ſhe appeared embarraſſed; and that on Lady Greyſtock's addreſſing her, this embarraſſment increaſed: but when ſhe ſaid ſhe had been in the city, her duplicity, as he termed it, appeared ſo monſtrous to him, that he could not forbear an involuntary repetition of her words; ſo great indeed, was the indignation it excited in his breaſt, that he could ſcarcely forbear reproaching her, as the deſtroyer of his, and her own felicity. Her bluſh appeared to him, not the ingenuous colouring of innocence, but the glow of ſhame and guilt. It was evident to him that ſhe had ſeen Belgrave that morning; that he was the occaſion of all the myſtery which appeared in her conduct, and that it was the knowledge of the improper influence he had over her heart, which made Sir Charles Bingley ſo ſuddenly reſign her.</p>
                     <p>Gracious heaven! ſaid he to himſelf, who, that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Amanda, could ever ſuppoſe duplicity harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her breaſt; yet that too ſurely it is, I have every reaſon to ſuppoſe; yet a little longer I will bear this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ſuſpence, nor reveal my doubts, till thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced they are well founded.</p>
                     <p>He ſat oppoſite to her at dinner, and his eyes were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards her with that tender ſadneſs which we feel on viewing a beloved object we know ourſelves on the point of loſing forever.</p>
                     <p>His melancholy was quickly perceived by the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia; they ſaw with delight that the poiſon of ſuſpicion infuſed into his mind, was already beginning to operate; they anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſucceſs of all their ſchemes; their ſpirits grew uncommonly elevated, and Lady Euphraſia determined, whenever ſhe had the power, to revenge on the ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible nature of Mortimer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="143" facs="unknown:038416_0336_1011E3F37A8EEBC8"/>
her ſuffer, and to add, as far as malice could add to it, to the miſery about to be the lot of Amanda.</p>
                     <p>The dejection of Lord Mortimer was alſo obſerved by Amanda; it excited her fears and affected her ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſhe dreaded that his aunt had refuſed complying with his requeſt relative to her interference with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or that the Earl had been urging him to an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate union with Lady Euphraſia: perhaps her now wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered between love and duty; the thought ſtruck a cold damp upon her heart—yet no, cried ſhe, it cannot be; if inclined to change, Lord Mortimer would at once have informed me.</p>
                     <p>In the evening there was a large addition to the party, but Lord Mortimer ſat penſively apart from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Amanda by chance procured a ſeat next his. His paleneſs alarmed her, and ſhe could not forbear hinting her fears that he was ill.</p>
                     <p>"I am ill indeed," ſighed he heavily:—he looked at her as he ſpoke, and beheld her regarding him with the moſt exquiſite tenderneſs: but the period was paſt for receiving delight from ſuch an appearance of affection; an affection he had reaſon to believe was never more than feigned for him; and alſo from his emotions when with her, that he ſhould never ceaſe regretting the deception: his paſſions, exhauſted by their own violence, had ſunk into a calm, and ſadneſs was the predominant feeling of his ſoul. Though he ſo bitterly lamented, he could not at the moment have reproached her perfidy: he gazed on her with mournful tenderneſs, and to the involuntary expreſſion of regret which dropt from her, on hearing he was ill, only replied, by ſaying, "Ah! Amanda, the man that really excites your tenderneſs, muſt be happy."</p>
                     <p>Amanda, unconſcious that any ſiniſter meaning lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beneath theſe words, conſidered them as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the happineſs he himſelf experienced, from being convinced of her regard; and her heart ſwelled with pleaſure at the idea.</p>
                     <p>Any farther converſation between them was interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Miſs Malcolm, who, in a laughing manner, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>"I hope your Ladyſhip," ſaid Amanda, who had not yet declared her intention of ſtaying at home, "will be able to give me a good deſcription of it."</p>
                     <p>"Why, I ſuppoſe," cried Lady Euphraſia, "you do not intend going without being able to ſee and hear yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Certainly," replied Amanda, "I ſhould not, but I do not intend going."</p>
                     <p>"Not go to the ball to night?" exclaimed Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia.</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me, child," ſaid Lady Greyſtock, "what whim has entered your head to prevent your going?"</p>
                     <p>"Dear Lady Greyſtock," ſaid Lady Euphraſia, in a tone of unuſual good humour, internally delighted at Amanda's reſolution, "don't teize Miſs Fitzalan with queſtions."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="145" facs="unknown:038416_0338_1011E3F9F185B048"/>
"And you really do not go?" exclaimed Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, in an accent expreſſive of ſurpriſe and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
                     <p>"I really do not, my Lord."</p>
                     <p>"I declare," ſaid the Marchioneſs, even more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted than her daughter at Amanda's reſolution, as it favoured a ſcheme ſhe had long been projecting, "I wiſh Euphraſia was as indifferent about amuſement as Miſs Fitzalan: here ſhe has been complaining of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the whole morning, yet I cannot prevail on her to give up the ball."</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphaſia, who never felt in better health and ſpirits, would have contradicted the Marchioneſs, had not an expreſſive glance aſſured her there was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant motive for this aſſertion.</p>
                     <p>"May we not hope, Miſs Fitzalan, ſaid Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, "that a reſolution ſo ſuddenly adopted as yours, may be as ſuddenly changed?"</p>
                     <p>"No, indeed, my Lord, nor is it ſo ſuddenly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as you ſeem to ſuppoſe."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer ſhuddered, as he endeavoured to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it in his own mind; his agony became almoſt inſupportable: he aroſe and walked to the window where ſhe ſat.</p>
                     <p>"Amanda," ſaid he, in a low voice, "I fear you forgot your engagement to me."</p>
                     <p>Amanda, ſuppoſing this alluded to her engagement for the ball, replied, "ſhe had not forgotten it."</p>
                     <p>"For your inability, or diſinclination to fulfil it, then," ſaid he, " will you not account?"</p>
                     <p>"Moſt willingly, my Lord."</p>
                     <p>"When?" aſked Lord Mortimer, impatiently, for unable longer to ſupport his torturing ſuſpence, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, contrary to his firſt intention, to come to an immediate explanation relative to Belgrave.</p>
                     <p>"To morrow, my Lord," replied Amanda, "ſince you deſire it, I will account for not keeping my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and I truſt," a modeſt bluſh mantling her
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:038416_0339_1011E3FC77CA12F0"/>
cheeks as ſhe ſpoke, "that your Lordſhip will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve of my reaſons for declining it."</p>
                     <p>The peculiar earneſtneſs of his words, Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer imagined, had conveyed their real meaning to Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Till to-morrow, then," ſighed he heavily, "I muſt bear my diſquietude."</p>
                     <p>His regret, Amanda ſuppoſed, proceeded from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment at not having her company at the ball; ſhe was flattered by it, and pleaſed at the idea of telling him her real motive for not going; certain it would meet his approbation, and open another ſource of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to poor Ruſhbrook.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, at Lady Euphraſia's particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſhe attended at her toilet, and aſſiſted in orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting her Ladyſhip. At ten ſhe ſaw the party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, without the ſmalleſt regret for not accompanying them: happy in ſelf approbation, a delightful calm was diffuſed over her mind: a treacherous calm, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which lulling her ſenſes into ſecurity, made the approaching ſtorm burſt with redoubled violence on her head; it was ſuch a calm as Shakeſpeare beautiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribes:
<q>
                           <l>We often ſee againſt ſome ſtorm</l>
                           <l>A ſilence in the heavens; the wreck ſtands ſtill,</l>
                           <l>The bold winds ſpeechleſs, and the orb below</l>
                           <l>As huſh as death.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>She continued in Lady Euphraſia's dreſſing room, and took up the beautiful and affecting ſtory of Paul and Mary, to amuſe herſelf. Her whole attention was ſoon engroſſed by it, and with the unfortunate Paul ſhe was ſhedding a deluge of tears over the fate of his love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mary, when a ſudden noiſe made her haſtily turn her head, and with equal horror and ſurpriſe, ſhe beheld Colonel Belgrave coming forward. She ſtarted up and was ſpringing to the door, when ruſhing between her and it he caught her in his arms, and forcing her back to the ſofa, rudely ſtopt her mouth.</p>
                     <p>"Neither cries nor ſtruggles, Amanda," ſaid he,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:038416_0340_1011E3FE09C7E800"/>
"will be availing; without the aſſiſtance of a friend, you may be convinced, I could not have entered this houſe; and the ſame friend will, you may depend on it, take care that our tete-a-tete is not interrupted."</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſhuddered at the idea of treachery, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced, from what he ſaid ſhe could not expect aſſiſtance, endeavoured to recover her fainting ſpirits and exert all her reſolution.</p>
                     <p>"Your ſcheme, Colonel Belgrave," ſaid ſhe, "is equally vile and futile; though treachery may have brought you hither, you muſt be convinced, that under the Marquis of Roſline's roof, who by relationſhip as well as hoſpitality, is bound to protect me, you dare not, with impunity, offer me any inſult. The Marquis will be at home immediately, if therefore you wiſh to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſemblance of honour, retire without further delay."</p>
                     <p>"Not to retire ſo eaſily," exclaimed Belgrave, "did I take ſuch pains, or watch ſo anxiouſly for this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. Fear not any inſult; but till I have revealed the purpoſe of my ſoul, I will not be forced from you; my love, or rather adoration, has known no abatement by your long concealment; and now that chance has ſo happily thrown you in my way, I will not neglect uſing any opportunity it may offer."</p>
                     <p>"Gracious heavens!" ſaid Amanda, while her eyes flaſhed with indignation, "how can you have the effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to avow your inſolent intentions; intentions which long ſince you muſt have known would ever prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive?"</p>
                     <p>"And why, my Amanda," ſaid he, again attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtrain her to his breaſt, while ſhe ſhrunk from his graſp, "why ſhould they prove abortive? why ſhould you be obſtinate in refuſing wealth, happineſs, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, the ardent affection of a man, who in promoting your felicity, would conſtitute his own? My life, my fortune would be at your command; my eternal grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would be your's for any trifling ſacrifice the world might think you made me; heſitate no longer about raiſing yourſelf to affluence, which, to a benevolent ſpirit
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:038416_0341_1011E400A53BA1A8"/>
like your's, muſt be ſo peculiarly pleaſing:—Heſitate not to ſecure independence to your father, promotion to your brother; and be aſſured if the connection I formed in an ill fated hour, deceived by a ſpecious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of perfection, ſhould ever be diſſolved, my hand, like my heart, ſhall be your's."</p>
                     <p>"Monſter!" exclaimed Amanda, beholding him with horror, "your hand, was it at your diſpoſal, like your other offers, I ſhould ſpurn with contempt; ceaſe to torment me," ſhe continued, "leaſt, in my own defence, I call upon thoſe who have power, as well as inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to chaſtiſe your inſolence. Let this conſideration, joined to the certainty that your purſuit muſt ever prove unavailing, influence your future actions; for be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that you are in every reſpect an object of abhorrence to my ſoul."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſpoke, exerting all her ſtrength, ſhe burſt from him, and attempted to gain the door. He flung himſelf between her and it, his face inflamed with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and darting the moſt malignant glances at her.</p>
                     <p>Terrified by his looks, Amanda, tried to avoid him; and when he caught her again in his arms ſhe ſcreamed aloud:—no one appeared:—her terror increaſed.</p>
                     <p>"Oh Belgrave!" "cried ſhe, trembling, "if you have one principle of honour, one feeling of humanity remaining, retire; I will pardon and conceal what is paſt, if you comply with my requeſt."</p>
                     <p>"I diſtreſs you, Amanda," ſaid he, aſſuming a ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened accent, "and it wounds me to the ſoul to do ſo, though you, cruel and inexorable, care not what pain you accaſion me, hear me calmly, and be aſſured, I ſhall attempt no action which can offend you."</p>
                     <p>He led her again to the ſofa, and thus continued.</p>
                     <p>"Miſled by falſe views, you ſhun and deteſt the only man who has had ſufficient ſincerity to declare openly his intentions; inexperience and credulity have already made you a dupe to artifice. You imagined Sir Charles Bingley was a fervent admirer of your's, when be aſſured, in following you, he only obeyed the dictates of an egregious vanity, which flattered him with the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038416_0342_1011E4041C5670B8"/>
hope of gaining your regard, and being diſtinguiſhed by it: nothing was farther from his thoughts, as he himſelf confeſt to me, than ſeriouſly paying his addreſſes to you, and had you appeared willing, at laſt, to accept them, be aſſured he would ſoon have contrived ſome ſcheme to diſengage himſelf from you. The attentions of Lord Mortimer are prompted by a motive much more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than that which inſtigated Sir Charles; he really admires you, and would have you believe his views are honourable; but beware of his duplicity, he ſeeks to take advantage of the too great confidence you repoſe in him: his purpoſe once accompliſhed, he would ſacrifice you to Lady Euphraſia; and I know enough of her malevolent diſpoſition, to be convinced ſhe would enjoy her tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over ſo lovely a victim. Ah! my dear Amanda, even beauty and elegance like yours, would not, on the generality of mankind, have power to make them fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the advantages annexed to wealth; on Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer particularly, they would fail of that effect; his ambition and avarice are equal to his father's; and though his heart and ſoul, I am confident, revolt from the perſon and mind of Lady Euphraſia, he will unite himſelf to her, for the ſake of poſſeſſing her fortune, and thus increaſing his own power of procuring the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications he delights in. As my ſituation is known, I cannot be accuſed of deception, and whatever I promiſe will be ſtrictly fulfilled: deliberate therefore no longer, my Amanda, on the courſe you ſhall purſue."</p>
                     <p>"No," cried ſhe, "I ſhall indeed no longer deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate about it."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſpoke, ſhe ſtarted from her ſeat.—Belgrave again ſeized her hand. At this moment a knocking was heard at the hall door, which echoed through the houſe. Amanda trembled, and Belgrave pauſed in a ſpeech he had begun. She ſuppoſed the Marquis had returned: it was improbable he would come to that room: and even if he did, from his diſtruſtful and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant temper, ſhe knew not whether ſhe would have reaſon to rejoice or regret his preſence. But how great was her confuſion, when inſtead of his voice, ſhe heard
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:038416_0343_1011E406EB870548"/>
thoſe of the Marchioneſs and her party. In a moment the dreadful conſequences which might enſue from her preſent ſituation, ruſhed upon her mind. By the forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attentions of the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia, ſhe was not long deceived, and had reaſon to believe, from the inveterate diſlike they bore her, that they would rejoice at an opportunity like the preſent, for traducing her fame; and with horror ſhe ſaw, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, even in the eyes of candour, would be againſt her. She had poſitively, and unexpectedly refuſed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ball; ſhe had expreſt delight at the idea of ſtaying at home. Alas! would not all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be dwelt upon? What ideas might they now excite in Lord Mortimer, who already ſhewed a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to jealouſy?</p>
                     <p>Half wild at the idea, ſhe claſped her hands together, and exclaimed, in a voice trembling with anguiſh, "Merciful heaven, I am ruined for ever!"</p>
                     <p>"No, no," cried Belgrave, flinging himſelf at her feet, "pardon me, Amanda, and I never more will mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt you; I ſee your principles are invincible; I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, I revere your purity, and never more will I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to injure it; I was on the point of declaring ſo, when the curſed knock came to the door; compoſe yourſelf, and conſider what can be done in the preſent emergency; you will be ruined if I am ſeen with you; the malicious devils you live with, would never believe our united aſſeverations of your innocence: conceal me, therefore, if poſſible, till the family are ſettled, the perſon who let me in, will then ſecure my retreat, and I ſwear ſolemnly never more to trouble you."</p>
                     <p>Amanda heſitated between the confidence her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence inſpired, and the dread of the unpleaſant conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion malice might put on her ſituation. She heard the party aſcending the ſtairs: fear conquered her reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to concealment, and ſhe motioned to Belgrave to retire to a cloſet adjoining the dreſſing room. He obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the motion, and cloſed the door ſoftly after him.</p>
                     <p>Amanda, ſnatching up her book, endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe herſelf; but the effort was ineffectual; ſhe tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:038416_0344_1011E40881D56FC8"/>
univerſally; nor was her agitation diminiſhed, when from the outſide of the door, Lady Euphraſia called to her to open it. She tottered at it, and almoſt fainted on finding it locked; with difficulty ſhe opened it, and the whole party, followed by the Marquis, entered.</p>
                     <p>"Upon my word, Miſs Fitzalan," ſaid the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs, "you were determined no one ſhould diſturb your meditations; I fear we have ſurpriſed you; but poor Euphraſia was taken ill at the ball, and we were obliged to return with her."</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Fitzalan has not been much better, I believe," ſaid Lady Euphraſia, regarding her attentively.</p>
                     <p>"Good Lord! child," cried Lady Greyſtock, "what is the matter with you? why you look as pale as if you had ſeen a ghoſt."</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Fitzalan is fond of ſolitude," exclaimed the Marquis, preventing her reply to Lady Greyſtock. "When I returned home about an hour ago I ſent to requeſt her company in the parlour, which honour, I aſſure your, I was refuſed."</p>
                     <p>The meſſage indeed had been ſent, but never deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Amanda."</p>
                     <p>"I aſſure you, my lord," ſaid ſhe, "I heard of no ſuch requeſt."</p>
                     <p>"And pray, child, how have you been employed all this time?" aſked Lady Greyſtock.</p>
                     <p>"In reading, Madam," faltered out Amanda, while her death like paleneſs was ſucceeded by a deep bluſh.</p>
                     <p>"You are certainly ill," ſaid Lord Mortimer, who ſat beſide her, in a voice expreſſive of regret at the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: "you have been indulging melancholy ideas. I fear," continued he ſoftly, and taking her hand, "for ſurely—ſurely to night you are uncommonly affected."</p>
                     <p>Amanda attempted to ſpeak: the contending emotions of her mind prevented her utterance, and the tears trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſilently down her cheeks. Lord Mortimer ſaw ſhe wiſhed to avoid notice, vet ſcarcely could he forbear requeſting ſome aſſiſtance for her.</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia now complained of a violent head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach: the Marchioneſs wanted to ring for her remedies:
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:038416_0345_1011E40A4EDDF438"/>
this Lady Euphraſia oppoſed; at laſt if as ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting it, ſhe ſaid, "in the cloſet there was a bottle of Eau de luce, which ſhe was certain would be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to her."</p>
                     <p>At the mention of the cloſet, the blood ran cold through the veins of Amanda; but when ſhe ſaw lady Euphraſia riſe to enter it, had death, in his moſt fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful form ſtared her in the face, ſhe could not have Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more horror. She looked towards it with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as expreſſive of wild affright, as Macbeth's when viewing the chair, on which the ſpectre of the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Banquo ſat. Lord Mortimer obſerving the diſorder of her looks, began to tremble; he graſped her hand with a convulſive motion, and exclaimed,
"Amanda, what means this agitation?"</p>
                     <p>A loud ſcream from Lady Euphraſia broke upon their ears, and ſhe ruſhed from the cloſet, followed by Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave.</p>
                     <p>"Gracious heavens!" exclaimed Lord Mortimer, dropping Amanda's hand, and riſing precipitately.</p>
                     <p>Amanda looked around—ſhe beheld every eye faſtened on her with amazement and contempt: the ſhock was too much for her to ſupport: a confuſed idea darted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her mind, that a deep laid plot had been concerted to ruin her: ſhe faintly exclaimed, " I am betrayed," and ſunk back upon the ſofa.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer ſtarted at her exclamation. "Oh heavens!" cried he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> as he looked towards her, unable to ſupport the ſcene that would enſue in conſequence of this diſcovery, he ſtruck his forehead in an agony, and ruſhed out of the room.</p>
                     <p>In the hall he was ſtopt by Mrs. Jane, the maid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Marchioneſs to attend Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Alack-a-day my Lord," ſaid ſhe in a whimpering voice, "ſomething dreadful, I am afraid, has happened above ſtairs: Oh dear, what people ſuffer ſometimes by their good nature; I am ſure, if I thought any harm would come of granting Miſs Fitzalan's requeſt, he might have begged and prayed long enough, before I would have obliged her.</p>

"Did ſhe deſire you to bring Colonel Belgrave to this houſe?" aſked Lord Mortimer.</p>
                     <p>"Oh to be ſure ſhe did, my Lord, or how ſhould I ever have thought of ſuch a thing: ſhe has been beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and praying long enough, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o me to contrive ſome way of bringing him here; and ſhe told me a piteous ſtory, which would have ſoftened a ſtone, of his being a ſweetheart of her's before he was married."</p>
                     <p>"Merciful powers!" cried Lord Mortimer, claſping his hands together, "how have I been deceived?"</p>
                     <p>He was hurrying away, when Mrs. Jane caught his coat.</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall loſe my place," ſaid ſhe ſobbing, "that I ſhall, moſt certainly, for my Lord and Lady never will forgive my bringing any one, in ſuch a way, into the houſe; I am ſure I thought no great harm in it, and did it quite from good nature; for indeed how could one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the poor dear young lady; ſhe cried and ſaid, ſhe only wanted to bid farewell to her dear Belgrave."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer could hear no more, he ſhook her from him, and hurried from the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Amanda's faculties ſuffered but a momentary ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; as ſhe opened her eyes, her compoſure and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude returned.</p>
                     <p>"I am convinced," ſaid ſhe, riſing, and advancing to the Marquis, "it will ſhock your Lordſhip to hear, that it is the treachery of ſome perſon under your roof, has involved me in my preſent embarraſſing ſituation. For my own juſtification, 'tis neceſſary to acknowledge that I have long been the object of a purſuit from Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Belgrave, as degrading to his character as inſulting to mine. When he broke ſo unexpectedly upon me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, he declared, even with effrontery declared, he had a friend in this houſe, who gave him acceſs to it. As your gueſt, my Lord, I may expect your Lordſhip's protection: alſo that an immediate inquiry be made for the abettor in this ſcheme againſt me, and a full diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of it extorted, that ſhould the affair be mentioned, in may be explained, and my fame cleared of every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation."</p>

"That, Madam," ſaid the Marquis, with a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſneer, "would not be quite ſo eaſy a matter as you may perhaps ſuppoſe; neither the world nor I am ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous as you imagine; your ſtory, Madam, by no means hangs well together; there is no perſon in my houſe would have dared to commit the act you accuſe them of, as they muſt know the conſequence of it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate diſmiſſion from my ſervice. Had not Colonel Belgrave been voluntarily admitted, he never would have been concealed: no, Madam, you would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced at the opportunity our preſence gave you, of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing his temerity." Innocence is bold, 'tis guilt alone is timerous."</p>
                     <p>The truth of part of his ſpeech ſtruck forcibly upon Amanda; but how could ſhe explain her conduct? how declare it was her dread of the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia's malice, which had made her conſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal him.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! I ſee," ſaid ſhe, in the agony of her ſoul, "I ſee I am the dupe of complicated artifice."</p>
                     <p>"I never, in my life," cried the Marchioneſs, "met with ſuch aſſurance:—to deſire the Marquis to be her champion."</p>
                     <p>"As ſhe was entruſted to my care, however," exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lady Greyſtock, "I think it neceſſary to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the affair. Pray, Sir turning to the Colonel, "by what means did you come here?</p>
                     <p>The Colonel, with undiminiſhed aſſurance, had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtood near the fatal cloſet leaning on a chair.</p>
                     <p>"That Madam," replied he, "I muſt be excuſed revealing: let me, however, aſſure your Ladyſhip, 'tis not on my own account I affect concealment." Here he glanced at amanda. "Thoſe parts of my conduct, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which I chuſe to conceal, I ſhall always be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to defend."</p>
                     <p>"Sir," cried the Marquis, haughtily, "no explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or defence of your conduct, is here required, I have neither right nor inclination to interfere in Miſs Fitzalan's concerns."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="unknown:038416_0348_1011E413118949D0"/>
The Colonel bowed to the circle, and was retiring, when Amanda flew to him, and caught his arm, "Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſurely," ſaid ſhe, almoſt gaſping for breath, " you cannot be ſo inhuman, as to retire without explaining this whole affair. Oh! Belgrave, leave me not a prey to ſlander; by all your hopes of mercy and forgiveneſs hereafter, I conjure you to clear my fame."</p>
                     <p>"My dear creature," ſaid he, in a low voice, yet loud enough to be heard by the whole party, "any thing I could ſay would be unavailing; you find they are determined not to ſee things in the light we wiſh them viewed: compoſe yourſelf, I beſeech you, and be aſſured, while I exiſt, you never ſhall want comfort or affluence."</p>
                     <p>He gently diſengaged himſelf as he ſpoke, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the room, leaving her, rivited to the floor in amazement, at his inſolence and perfidy.</p>
                     <p>"I am ſure," ſaid Lady Greyſtock, "I ſhall regret all my life the hour in which I took her under my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: though, indeed, from what I heard ſoon after my arrival in London, I ſhould have diſpatched her back to her father; but I felt a fooliſh pity for her; I was in hopes, indeed, the ſociety I had introduced her to, would have produced a reformation, and that I might be the means of ſaving a young creature from entire deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>"From what I have already ſuffered by her family, nothing ſhould have tempted me to take her under my roof," exclaimed the Marchioneſs.</p>
                     <p>"Was ſhe my relation," cried the Marquis, "I ſhould long ſince have come to a determination about her; as your's Madam," turning to the Marchioneſs, "I ſhall not attempt forming one; I deem it, however, abſolutely neceſſary to remove Lady Euphraſia Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land from the houſe, till the young lady chuſes to quit it; I ſhall therefore order the carriage to be ready at an early hour for the villa."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall certainly accompany your Lordſhip," cried the Marchioneſs, " for I cannot endure her ſight: and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:038416_0349_1011E4160EA21BE8"/>
though ſhe deſerves it, it ſhall not be ſaid that we turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her from the houſe."</p>
                     <p>"The only meaſure ſhe ſhould purſue," exclaimed Lady Greyſtock, "is to ſet off as ſoon as poſſible for Ireland; when ſhe returns to obſcurity, the affair may die away."</p>
                     <p>"It may, however," ſaid Amanda, "be yet revived, to cover with confuſion its contrivers: to heaven I leave the vindication of my innocence: its juſtice is ſure, though ſometimes ſlow, and the hour of retribution of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten arrives, when leaſt expected: much as I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered—much as I may ſtill ſuffer I think my own ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preferable to theirs, who have ſet their ſnares around me: the injurer muſt ever feel greater pangs than the injured—the pangs of guilt and remorſe. I ſhall return to my obſcurity, happy in the conſciouſneſs, that it is not a ſhelter for ſhame, but a refuge from cruelty I ſeek: but can I be ſurpriſed at meeting cruelty from thoſe, who have long ſince waved the ties of kindred:—from thoſe," and ſhe glanced at Lady Greyſtock, "who have ſet aſide the claims of juſtice and humanity."</p>
                     <p>The Marchioneſs trembled with rage at this ſpeech, and as Amanda retired from the room, exclaimed, "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable aſſurance."</p>
                     <p>Amanda repaired immediately to her chamber: ſhe tottered as ſhe walked, and the houſekeeper and Mrs. Jane, who, with ſome other ſervants, had aſſembled out of curioſity near the door, followed her thither.</p>
                     <p>The emotions ſhe had ſo painfully ſuppreſt, now burſt forth with violence; ſhe fell into an agony of tears and ſobs, which impeded her breathing. The houſekeeper and Jane looſened her clothes, and ſupported her to the bed. In a ſhort time ſhe was ſufficiently recovered, to be able to ſpeak, and requeſted they would engage a carriage for her againſt the next day, at an early hour, that ſhe might commence her journey to Ireland; this they promiſed, and at her deſire retired.</p>
                     <p>Succeſs, but not happineſs, had crowned the Marchion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs's ſcheme; ſhe triumphed in the diſgrace ſhe had drawn upon Amanda; but feared that diſgrace was only
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:038416_0350_1011E419417CC0A8"/>
temporary; ſhe had entangled her in a ſnare, but dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not having ſecured her in it; ſhe diſtruſted thoſe who had aſſiſted her deſigns, for the guilty will ever ſuſpect each other; they might betray her, or Colonel Belgrave might repent; but ſuch evils, if they did ever arrive, were probably far diſtant; in the interim, all ſhe deſired to accompliſh, might be effected. Long had ſhe been meditating on ſome plan, which ſhould ruin Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da forever, not only in the opinion of Lord Mortimer, but in the eſtimation of the world. With the profliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Colonel Belgrave ſhe was well acquainted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined from it to believe, that he would readily join in any ſcheme which could give him a chance of poſſeſſing Amanda. On diſcovering her reſidence, he had ordered his valet, who was a truſty agent in all his villainies, to endeavour to gain acceſs to the houſe, that he might diſcover whether there was a chance of introducing him there. The valet obeyed his orders, and ſoon attached himſelf to Mrs. Jane, whom the Marchioneſs had placed about Amanda, from knowing ſhe was capable of any deceitful part. She was introduced to Belgrave, and a handſome preſent ſecured her in his intereſt.</p>
                     <p>She communicated to the Marchioneſs particulars of their interview: from that period they had been ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring about ſuch a ſcene as was at laſt acted; for the conduct of Amanda had hitherto defeated their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Her ſtaying from the ball at laſt gave the wiſhed for opportunity.</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia was apprized of the whole plot, and the hint of her indiſpoſition was given in the morning, that no ſuſpicion might be entertained in the evening, when mentioned as a plea for returning home earlier than was intended.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Belgrave was introduced into the cloſet by Mrs. Jane, through a door that opened from the lobby; and whilſt Amanda ſat penſively reading, he ſtole out, and ſecured the other door, as already mentioned.</p>
                     <p>When Lady Euphraſia declared ſhe was too ill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at the ball, Lord Mortimer offered to attend her
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:038416_0351_1011E41BDD22E878"/>
home; had he not done ſo, the Marchioneſs intended to have aſked him.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis was perſuaded that Amanda was an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dangerous rival to his daughter, and he hated her from that conſideration. The laws of hoſpitality obliged him to treat her with politeneſs, but he gladly ſeized the firſt opportunity that offered for expreſſing his diſlike.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock ſaw through the plot, but ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt her belief of Amanda's guilt, which was all the Marchioneſs required.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis left the ladies together, while he went to give orders about his early journey.</p>
                     <p>Soon after his departure, a loud knocking was heard, which announced a viſitor; and from the lateneſs of the hour, they conjectured, and were right in doing ſo, that it muſt be Lord Mortimer.</p>
                     <p>After traverſing ſeveral ſtreets, in an agony no tongue could deſcribe, he returned to Portman Square. His fancy preſented Amanda to his view, overwhelmed with ſhame, and ſinking beneath the keen reproaches levelled at her. In the idea of her ſufferings, all reſentment for her ſuppoſed perfidy was forgotten. Human nature was liable to err, and the nobleſt efforts that nature could make, was to pardon ſuch errors. To ſpeak comfort to this fallen angel, he felt would relieve the weight which preſt upon his own breaſt. Pale and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, he entered the room, and found the ladies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently much affected.</p>
                     <p>"My dear Lord," ſaid the Marchioneſs, "I am glad you are come back; as a friend of the family, you may perhaps honour us with your advice on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed," exclaimed Lady Greyſtock, "I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Lordſhip is at as great a loſs to know what can be done as we are. Was the Colonel in a ſituation to make any reparation! but a married man, only think how horrible."</p>
                     <p>"Execrable monſter!" cried Lord Mortimer, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his ſeat, and traverſing the room; "it were a
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:038416_0352_1011E41D6DB63D70"/>
deed of kindneſs to mankind, to extirpate him from the earth:—but ſay," continued he, and his voice faultered as he ſpoke, "where is the unfortunate—," he could not pronounce the name of Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"In her own room," replied the Marchioneſs; "I aſſure you, ſhe behaved with not a little inſolence, on Lady Greyſtock's adviſing her to return home. For my part, I ſhall let her act as ſhe pleaſes."</p>
                     <p>She then proceeded to mention the Marquis's reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of leaving the houſe till ſhe had quitted it, and that he inſiſted on their accompanying him.</p>
                     <p>"To return to her father, is certainly the only eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible plan ſhe can purſue," ſaid Lord Mortimer, "but allow me," continued he, "to requeſt, that your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip will not impute to inſolence, any expreſſion which dropt from her: pity her wounded feelings, and ſoften her ſorrows."</p>
                     <p>"I declare," cried Lady Euphraſia, "I thought I ſhould have fainted from the pity I felt for her."</p>
                     <p>"You pitied her then," ſaid Lord Mortimer ſitting down by her Ladyſhip, "you pitied and ſoothed her afflictions?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, indeed," replied ſhe.</p>
                     <p>If ever Lady Euphraſia appeared pleaſing it the eyes of Lord Mortimer, it was at this moment, when he was credulous enough to believe ſhe had ſhed the tear of pity o'er his loſt Amanda.</p>
                     <p>He took her hand, "Ah! my dear Lady Euphraſia," ſaid he, in an accent of melting ſoftneſs, "perhaps even now ſhe needs conſolation: a gentle female friend would be a comfort to her wounded heart."</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia immediately took the hint, and ſaid ſhe would go to her.</p>
                     <p>He led her to the door. "You are going," cried he, "to perform the office of an angel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to conſole the afflicted: ah! well does it become the young and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of your ſex, to pity ſuch misfortunes."</p>
                     <p>Her Ladyſhip retired, but not indeed to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the forlorn Amanda; in her own ſhe vented the rage of her ſoul, in ſomething little ſhort of execrations
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:038416_0353_1011E4204D5AF9D0"/>
againſt Lord Mortimer, for the affection ſhe ſaw he ſtill retained for Amanda.</p>
                     <p>On her Ladyſhip's retiring, Lady Greyſtock menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned every particular ſhe had heard from Mrs. Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and bitterly lamented her ever having taken Amanda under her protection.</p>
                     <p>The ſubject was too painful to be long endured by Lord Mortimer. He had heard of the early hour fixed for the journey, and ſaying he would no longer keep the ladies from repoſe, precipitately retired. He gave his man directions to watch their motions, and inform him when they left town.</p>
                     <p>Exhauſted by the violence of her emotions, a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary forgetfulneſs ſtole over the ſenſes of Amanda, on her being left to ſolitude. In this ſtate ſhe continued, till rouſed by a buſtle in the houſe:—ſhe ſtarted, liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and heard the ſound of a carriage; ſuppoſing it to be the one ſhe had ordered for her departure, ſhe ſprang from the bed, and going to the window, ſaw, inſtead of one for her, the Marquis's, into which he was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ladies. As ſoon as it drove from the door, ſhe rang the bell, and the houſe-keeper immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, as Mrs. Jane had attended the Marchioneſs to the villa. Amanda enquired "whether a carriage, as ſhe directed, had been engaged for her."</p>
                     <p>The houſe-keeper replied, "the hour in which ſhe ſpoke was too late for ſuch a purpoſe, but ſhe had now ſent for one."</p>
                     <p>Amanda endeavoured to exert herſelf, and was pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up her clothes, when a maid entered the chamber, and ſaid, "Lord Mortimer was below, and wiſhed to ſpeak to her."</p>
                     <p>Tumultuous joy pervaded the mind of Amanda; ſhe had believed it probable ſhe ſhould not ſee him again before her departure for Ireland, from whence ſhe had determined writing to him the particulars of the affair. His viſit ſeemed to announce he thought not unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of her: ſhe ſuppoſed he came to aſſure her, that his opinion of her integrity was unſhaken, "and I ſhall yet
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:038416_0354_1011E4249FAD2568"/>
triumph," cried ſhe, in the tranſport of the idea, "over malice and treachery."</p>
                     <p>She ſprung paſt the maid; her feet ſcarce touched the ground, and in a moment ſhe found herſelf in the arms of Lord Mortimer, which involuntarily opened to receive her, for trembling, weak and diſordered, ſhe would elſe, on ſeeing him, have ſunk to the floor.</p>
                     <p>He ſupported her to a ſofa; in a little time ſhe raiſed her head from his ſhoulder, and exclaimed,</p>
                     <p>"Oh! you are come! I know you are come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me."</p>
                     <p>"Would to heaven," he anſwered, "I were capable of either giving or receiving comfort; the period, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I truſt, may yet arrive, when we ſhall both, at leaſt be more compoſed:—to mitigate your ſorrows, would leſſen my own; for never, oh never can my heart forget the love and eſteem it once bore Amanda."</p>
                     <p>"Once bore her!" repeated Amanda, "once bore her, Lord Mortimer, do you ſay?—then you wiſh to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, they no longer exiſt."</p>
                     <p>The tone of anguiſh in which ſhe ſpoke, pierced the heart of Mortimer; unable to ſpeak, he aroſe, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the window to hide his emotion.</p>
                     <p>His words, his ſilence, all conveyed a fatal truth to Amanda; ſhe ſaw a dreadful and eternal ſeparation ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected between her and Lord Mortimer:—She beheld herſelf deprived of reputation, loaded with calumny, and no longer an object of love, but of deteſtation and contempt.</p>
                     <p>Her anguiſh was almoſt too great to bear, yet the pride of injured innocence made her wiſh to conceal it; and as Lord Mortimer ſtood at the window ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to try and leave the room without his knowledge; but ere ſhe gained the door, her head grew giddy, her ſtrength failed, ſhe ſtaggered, faintly ſcreamed on find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf falling, and ſunk upon the floor.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer wildly called for aſſiſtance; he raiſed and carried her back to the ſofa; he ſtrained her to his boſom; kiſſed her pale lips and wept over her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="unknown:038416_0355_1011E426307CA0D0"/>
"I have wounded your gentle ſoul, my Amanda," he cried, "but I have tortured my own by doing ſo; ah! ſtill deareſt of women, did the world compaſſionate your errors, as I compaſſionate them, neither contempt nor calumny would ever be your portion. How pale ſhe looks" ſaid he, raiſing his head to gaze upon her face; "how like a lovely flower untimely faded: yet were it happineſs for her never to revive: a ſoul like her's, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally noble, muſt be wretched under the preſſure of ſcorn. Execrable Belgrave! the faireſt work of heaven is deſtroyed by you. Oh! my Amanda, my diſtreſs is ſurely ſevere, though anguiſh rives my heart for your loſs, I muſt conceal it; the ſad luxury of grief will be denied me; for the world would ſmile if I could ſay I now lamented you."</p>
                     <p>Such were the effuſions of ſorrow which broke from Lord Mortimer, o'er the inſenſible Amanda. The houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, who had been liſtening all this time, now appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if in obedience to his call, and offered her aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in recovering Amanda. Heavy ſighs, at length, gave hopes of her reſtoration. Lord Mortimer, unable to ſupport her pathetic lamentations, determined to depart ere ſhe was perfectly ſenſible.</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Fitzalan," ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to the houſe-keeper, "will wiſh, I am convinced, to quit this houſe immediately; I ſhall take upon myſelf to procure her a carriage, alſo a proper attendant for her journey, which, I flatter myſelf, ſhe will be able to commence in a few hours: be kind, be gentle to her, my good woman, and depend on my eternal gratitude. When ſhe is recovered, deliver her this letter."</p>
                     <p>The houſe-keeper promiſed to obſerve his injunctions, and he departed.</p>
                     <p>To Ireland, with Amanda, he intended ſending an old female ſervant, who had formerly been an attendant of his mother's, and his own man. He was ſhocked at the conduct of the Marchioneſs and Lady Greyſtock, and thought them guilty of the higheſt inhumanity, in thus deſerting Amanda. The letter he had put into the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper's hands excited her curioſity ſo ſtrongly, that ſhe
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:038416_0356_1011E428D557B308"/>
was tempted to gratify it. Amanda was not in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perceive what ſhe did: the letter could eaſily be ſcaled again; and, in ſhort, without longer heſitation, ſhe opened it. How great was her amazement, on finding it contained a bank note for five-hundred pounds; the words were as follows:</p>

                     <p>"What a ſum," cried the houſekeeper, as ſhe exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the note, "what a nice little independency would this, in addition to what I have already ſaved, be for an honeſt woman? What a pity it is ſuch a creature as it is deſigned for ſhould poſſeſs it?" The houſekeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, like her lady, was fertile in invention:—to be ſure there was ſome danger in her preſent ſcheme, but for ſuch a prize it was worth her while to run ſome riſk. Could ſhe but get Amanda off, ere the carriage from Lord Mortimer arrived, ſhe believed all would ſucceed as ſhe could wiſh. Amanda, ignorant as ſhe was of Lord Mortimer's intentions, would not, conſequently be influenced by them, to oppoſe any thing ſhe could do. Full of this idea, ſhe ran out, and calling a footman, high in her favour, deſired him immediately to procure a travelling chaiſe for Miſs Fitzalan. She then returned to Amanda, who was juſt beginning to move.</p>
                     <p>"Come, come," cried ſhe, going to her, and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaking her ſhoulder, "have done with thoſe trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy airs, and prepare yourſelf againſt the carriage you ordered comes: it will be at the door in a few minutes."</p>
                     <p>Amanda looked round the room, "Is Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer gone then?" ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"Lord, to be ſure he is," cried the houſekeeper, "he left you on the floor, and as he went out, he ſaid,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:038416_0357_1011E42A718AA9B8"/>
you ſhould never have another opportunity of deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him."</p>
                     <p>A ſudden frenzy ſeemed to ſeize Amanda: ſhe wrung her hands, called upon Lord Mortimer in the impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned language of deſpair, and flung herſelf on the ground, exclaiming, "this laſt ſtroke is more than I can bear."</p>
                     <p>The houſekeeper grew alarmed, leſt her agitation ſhould retard her departure; ſhe raiſed her forcibly from the ground, and ſaid, "ſhe muſt compoſe herſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin her journey, which was unavoidable, as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs had given abſolute orders to have her ſent from the houſe early in the morning."</p>
                     <p>"Accurſed houſe!" ſaid Amanda, whoſe reaſon was reſtored by the ſtrenuous remonſtrances of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, "Oh! that I had never entered it." She then told her companion, "if ſhe would aſſiſt her, as ſhe was almoſt too weak to do any thing herſelf, ſhe would be ready againſt the carriage came." The houſe-keeper and maid accordingly attended her to her chamber: the former brought her drops, and the latter aſſiſted in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on her habit, and packing up her clothes. Amanda having ſecured her trunks, deſired they might be ſent, by the firſt opportunity, to Caſtle Carberry; ſhe had left a great many clothes there, ſo took nothing at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with her, but a ſmall quantity of linen. She had but a few guineas in her purſe: her watch, however, was valuable; and if ſhe had money enough to carry her to Dublin, ſhe knew there ſhe might procure a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſum on it to carry her home.</p>
                     <p>At laſt the carriage came; with a trembling frame, and half broken heart, Amanda entered it. She ſaw Nicholas, the footman, who had procured it, ready mounted to attend her. She told him it was unneceſſary to do ſo, but he declared he could not think of letting ſo young a lady travel unprotected. She was pleaſed at his attention: ſhe had ſhuddered at the idea of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn ſituation, and now dropt a tear of ſweet ſenſibility, at finding ſhe was not utterly deſerted by every human being. The carriage took the road to Park-Gate, as
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:038416_0358_1011E42FE59FB2D8"/>
Amanda choſe to embark from thence, the journey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much nearer to it than to Holyhead. It was now about eight o'clock; after travelling about four hours, the chaiſe ſtopt at a ſmall houſe on the road ſide, which appeared to be a common ale-houſe. Amanda was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to enter it, but the horſes were here to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and ſhe was ſhewn into a dirty parlour, where, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſinking with weakneſs, ſhe ordered tea to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately brought in. She was much aſtoniſhed, as ſhe ſat at the tea-table, to ſee Nicholas enter the room, with a familiar air, and ſeat himſelf by her. She ſtared at firſt, ſuppoſing him intoxicated; but perceiving no ſigns of this in his countenance, began to fear that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults ſhe had received at the Marquis's, made him think himſelf authorized to treat her with this inſolence. She roſe abruptly, and ſummoning all her reſolution to her aid, deſired him to retire, adding, "if his attendance was requiſite, ſhe would ring for him."</p>
                     <p>Nicholas alſo quitted his ſeat, and following her, caught her in his arms, exclaiming, "bleſs us how hoity toity you are grown."</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſhrieked, and ſtamped on the floor, in an agony of terror and indignation.</p>
                     <p>"Why now really," ſaid he, "after what happened at home. I think you need not be ſo coy with me."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! ſave me, heaven, from this wretch," was all the affrighted Amanda could articulate.</p>
                     <p>The door opened, a waiter appeared, and told Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las he was wanted without. Nicholas releaſed Amanda, and ran directly from the room. Amanda ſunk upon a chair, and her head turned giddy at the idea of the dangers with which ſhe was ſurrounded. She ſaw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the power of a wretch, perhaps wretches, for the houſe ſeemed a proper place for ſcenes of villainy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means of delivering herſelf. She walked to the window; a confuſed idea of getting through it, and running from the houſe, darted into her mind, but ſhe turned from it in agony, at ſeeing a number of country
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:038416_0359_1011E431769A9F58"/>
men drinking before it. She now could only raiſe her feeble hands to heaven to ſupplicate its protection.</p>
                     <p>She paſt ſome minutes in this manner, when the lock turned, and made her ſhudder; but it was the landlady alone who entered; ſhe came, ſhe ſaid, with Nicholas's reſpectful duty, and he was ſorry he was obliged to go back to town, without ſeeing her ſafe to her journey's end.</p>
                     <p>"Is he really gone?" aſked Amanda, with all the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs of joy.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," the woman ſaid, "a perſon had followed him from London on purpoſe to bring him back."</p>
                     <p>"Is the carriage ready?" cried Amanda.</p>
                     <p>She was informed it was.</p>
                     <p>"Let me fly, then," ſaid ſhe, running to the door, "let me fly, or the wretch may return."</p>
                     <p>The landlady impeded her progreſs, to tell her the bill was not yet ſettled. Amanda pulled out her purſe, and beſought her not to detain her. This the woman had no deſire to do: things were therefore ſettled without delay between them, and Amanda was driven, with as much expedition as ſhe could deſire, from the terrifying manſion. The chaiſe had proceeded about two miles, when, in the middle of a ſolitary road, or rather lane, by the ſide of a wood, it ſuddenly ſtopt. Amanda, alarmed at every incident, haſtily looked out, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what was the matter; but how impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe her terror, when ſhe beheld Colonel Belgrave, and Nicholas ſtanding by him. She ſhrunk back, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the poſtilion to drive on; but he heeded not her entreaty. Nicholas opened the door, and Belgrave ſprang into the carriage. Amanda attempted to burſt open the door at the oppoſite ſide, but he caught her to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and the horſes ſet off at full ſpeed. Colonel Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave's valet had been ſecreted by Mrs. Jane the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding night in the houſe, that he might be able to give his maſter intelligence of all that paſt within it, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his being diſcovered in the cloſet. On hearing the family were gone to the Marquis's villa, Belgrave believed he could eaſily prevail on the domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:038416_0360_1011E4341D3E6B70"/>
to deliver up Amanda to him. Elated with this hope, he reached the houſe, attended by his valet, juſt after ſhe had quitted it. The houſe-keeper heſitated to inform him of the road ſhe had taken, till ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured what ſhe knew would be the conſequence of her heſitation, a large bribe. Horſes were then immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procured, and Belgrave and his ſervant ſet off in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of Amanda. The ſight of a travelling chaiſe at the little inn already mentioned, prompted their inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and on finding the chaiſe waited for Amanda, the Colonel retired to a private room, ſent for Nicholas, and ſecured him in his intereſt. It was ſettled they ſhould repair to the wood, by which the poſtilion was bribed to paſs, and from thence proceed to a country houſe of the Colonel's. Their ſcheme accompliſhed, Nicholas, happy in the ſervice he had done, or rather the reward he had obtained for that ſervice, again turned his face towards London.</p>
                     <p>The carriage and attendants Lord Mortimer procured for Amanda arrived even earlier than the houſe-keeper had expected, and ſhe bleſt her lucky ſtars for the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitancy with which ſhe had hurried off Amanda.</p>
                     <p>They were followed by his Lordſhip himſelf, whoſe wretched heart could not ſupport the idea of letting A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda depart without once more beholding her. Great was his diſmay, his aſtoniſhment, when the houſe keeper informed him ſhe was gone.</p>
                     <p>"Gone!" he repeated, changing colour.</p>
                     <p>The houſe-keeper ſaid, that without her knowledge Miſs Fitzalan had a chaiſe hired, and the moment it came to the door, ſtept into it, notwithſtanding ſhe was told his Lordſhip meant to provide every thing proper for her journey himſelf; "but ſhe ſaid, my Lord" cried the houſe-keeper, "ſhe wanted none of your care, and that ſhe could never get faſt enough from a houſe, or from people, where, and by whom, ſhe had been ſo ill treated."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer aſked if ſhe had any attendant, and whether ſhe took the letter.</p>
                     <p>The houſe-keeper anſwered both theſe queſtions in the affirmative; " Truly, my Lord," ſhe continued, "I
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:038416_0361_1011E435D6284D60"/>
believe your Lordſhip ſaid ſomething in that letter which pleaſed her, for ſhe ſmiled on opening it, and ſaid, "Well, well, this is ſomething like comfort."</p>
                     <p>"And was ſhe really ſo mean," he was on the point of aſking, but he timely checked a queſtion which was ſpringing from a heart that ſickened at finding the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of its tendereſt affections unworthy in every reſpect of poſſeſſing them. Every idea of this kind ſoon gave way to anxiety on her account; his heart miſgave him at her undertaking ſo long a journey under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a common ſervant; and unable to endure his apprehenſions, he determined inſtantly to purſue, and ſee her ſafe himſelf to the deſtined port.</p>
                     <p>The woman who had hitherto ſat in the chaiſe, was ordered home; he entered it with eagerneſs, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberally to reward the poſtilions, if they uſed expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They had changed horſes but once, when Lord Mortimer ſaw Nicholas approaching, whom, at the firſt glance, he knew. He ſtopt the carriage, and called out, "Where have you left Miſs Fitzalan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>"</p>
                     <p>"Faith, my Lord," cried Nicholas, inſtantly ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and taking off his hat, "in very good company; I left her with Colonel Belgrave, who was waiting, by appointment, on the road for her."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! horrible infatuation!" ſaid Lord Mortimer, "that nothing can ſnatch her from the arms of infamy."</p>
                     <p>The poſtillion deſired to know whether he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to London.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer heſitated, and at laſt deſired him to go on, according to his firſt directions. He reſolved to proceed to Parkgate, and diſcover whether Amanda had returned to Ireland. They had not proceeded far, when they overtook a travelling chaiſe. As Lord Mortimer paſt he looked into it, and beheld Amanda reclined on the boſom of Belgrave. He trembled univerſally, cloſed his eyes, and ſighed out the name of the perfidious Amanda. When they had got ſome way before the other chaiſe, he deſired the poſtillion to ſtrike off into another road, which, by a circuit of a few miles, would bring them back to London. Amanda, it was evident, had put her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:038416_0362_1011E43AA51F3450"/>
under the protection of Belgrave, and to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe went to Ireland, was now of little conſequence to him, as he ſuppoſed her unreclaimable; but how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to deſcribe his diſtreſs and confuſion, when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the firſt object he beheld on alighting in St. James's Square, was his aunt, Lady Martha Dormer, who, in compliance with his urgent requeſt, had haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to London. Had a ſpectre croſſed his ſight, he could not have been more ſhocked.</p>
                     <p>"Well, my dear Frederick," ſaid her Ladyſhip, you ſee I loſt no time in obeying your wiſhes: I have flown hither, I may indeed ſay, on the wings of love: but where is this little divinity of thine? I long to have a peep at her goddeſs-ſhip."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer, inexpreſſibly ſhocked, turned to the window.</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall ſee, to be ſure," cried her Ladyſhip, "quite a little paragon: poſitively, Frederick, I will be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this very evening."</p>
                     <p>"My dear aunt, my dear Lady Martha," ſaid Lord Mortimer, impatiently, "for heaven's ſake ſpare me."</p>
                     <p>"But tell me," ſhe continued, "when I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence this attack upon your father's heart?"</p>
                     <p>"Never, never," ſighed Mortimer half diſtracted.</p>
                     <p>"What. you ſuppoſe he will prove inflexible? but I do not deſpair of convincing you to the contrary: tell me Frederick, when the little charmer can be ſeen!"</p>
                     <p>"Oh God!" cried Mortimer, ſtriking his forehead, "ſhe is loſt," ſaid he, "ſhe is loſt forever."</p>
                     <p>Lady Martha was alarmed: ſhe now, for the firſt time, noticed the wild and palid looks of her nephew.</p>
                     <p>"Gracious heaven!" ſhe exclaimed, "What is the matter?"</p>
                     <p>The dreadful explanation Lord Mortimer now found himſelf under the neceſſity of giving: the ſhame of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging he was ſo deceived: the agony he ſuffered from that deception, joined to the exceſſive agitation and fatigue he had ſuffered the preceding night, and the preſent day, ſo powerfully aſſailed him at this moment,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:038416_0363_1011E43C321BD1E0"/>
that his ſenſes ſuddenly gave way, and he actually faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the floor.</p>
                     <p>What a ſight for the tender Lady Martha: ſhe ſaw ſomething dreadful had happened, and what this was, Lord Mortimer, as ſoon as recovered, informed her.</p>
                     <p>He then retired to his chamber; he could neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, nor bear to be converſed with: his fondeſt hopes were blaſted: nor could he forego the ſad indulgence of mourning over them in ſolitude; he felt almoſt convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the hold Amanda had on his affections, could not be withdrawn: he had conſidered her as ſcarcely leſs than his wife, and had ſhe been really ſuch, her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conduct could not have given him more anguiſh. Had ſhe been ſnatched from him by the hand of death; had ſhe been wedded to a worthy character, he could have ſummoned fortitude to his aid, but to find her the prey of a villain, was a ſtroke too horrible to bear, at leaſt for a long period, with patience.</p>

                     <p>AMANDA had fainted ſoon after Colonel Belgrave entered the carriage, and ſhe was reclining on his boſom in a ſtate of inſenſibility, when Lord Mortimer paſt. In this ſituation ſhe continued, till they had gained a ſolitary road, when the carriage ſtopt, and water procured from an adjacent cottage, being ſprinkled on her face, ſhe recovered: but either by arguments, or actions, ſhe was now unable to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Belgrave; ſhe felt a weakneſs through her whole frame, which ſhe believed the forerunner of death; and a languor on her mind that almoſt deprived it of the perception of miſery.</p>
                     <p>The refreſhments ordered to her, ſhe could only refuſe by a motion of her hand; and in this manner they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded till about nine o'clock at night, when they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an extenſive wood, in the very centre of which ſtood Colonel Belgrave's manſion. He carried Amanda him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into it, and laid her upon a ſofa in a large parlour.—Some female domeſtics appeared with drops and cordials, to try to recover her from the almoſt lifeleſs ſtate in which ſhe lay. One of them preſented a letter to Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Belgrave, which excited no little perturbation in his mind; it came expreſs to inform him that his uncle, whoſe eſtate and title he was heir to, lay at the point of death, and that his preſence immediately was required.</p>
                     <p>The Colonel was not ſo abſolutely engroſſed by love, as to be incapable of attending to his intereſt. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his fortune was extremely agreeable, as his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:038416_0365_1011E440809C8268"/>
were ſomewhat deranged; and as Amanda was not in a ſituation at preſent to comply with any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he ſhould make, his reſolution was immediately formed to ſet off without delay, and againſt his return, he truſted Amanda would not only be recovered, but willing to accede to his wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>He diſmiſt the woman who had brought her a little to herſelf, and taking her hand, informed her of the painful neceſſity he was under of departing for a ſhort time: he alſo mentioned his hopes, that on his return he ſhould have no obſtacle thrown in the way of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by her. "You muſt be ſenſible my dear Amanda," ſaid he with coolneſs, "that your reputation is as much gone, as if you had complied with my wiſhes; ſince it is ſacrificed, why not enjoy the advantages that may, that will certainly attend, the reality of that ſacrifice."</p>
                     <p>"Monſter!" cried Amanda, "your arts may have deſtroyed my fame, but my innocence bids defiance to your power."</p>
                     <p>"Conquer your obſtinacy, Amanda," replied he, "againſt I return, or I ſhall not promiſe but what I may at laſt be irritated. As you will have no occaſion for money here, you muſt excuſe me, my dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if I take your purſe into my own keeping; my domeſtics may be faithful, when they have no induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the contrary; but no bribery, no corruption, you know."</p>
                     <p>He then deliberately took Amanda's purſe and watch from her pocket, and depoſited them in his own. He had already given directions to his ſervants concerning the treatment of Amanda, and now ordered them to carry her to a chamber, and make her ſome refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>"Reflect, Amanda," ſaid he, ere ſhe retired, "on your preſent ſituation, and timely eſtimate the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages I offer to your acceptance; wealth, pleaſure, the attentions of a man who adores you, are not to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Upon my ſoul it grieves me to leave you, but the joys of meeting, will, I truſt, pay the pangs of abſence."</p>
                     <p>As he ſpoke, he attempted to embrace her, but ſhe faintly ſhrieked, and ſunk from his graſp. He looked
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:038416_0366_1011E4440F2FC588"/>
provoked, but as he had no time to loſe, he reſerved a declaration of his anger for another opportunity, and directly ſet off for his uncle's.</p>
                     <p>Amanda was ſupported to a chamber, and lay down in her clothes on a bed. They offered her bread and wine, but ſhe was too ſick to touch any. To remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate with the inſolent looking creatures who ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, ſhe knew would be unavailing, and ſhe turned her face on the pillow to ſtifle her ſobs, as ſhe believed they would exult in her diſtreſs. Death ſhe thought approaching, and the idea of being ſeparated from the dear objects who would have ſoothed its laſt pangs, was dreadful; her father in agony, and Oſcar, her beloved brother, bewailing her with tears of ſorrow, were the images fancy preſented to her view.</p>
                     <p>"Dear objects of my love," ſhe ſoftly exclaimed, "Amanda ſhall no more behold you, but her laſt ſigh will be breathed for you. Ah! why, why," ſhe cried, "did I ſuffer myſelf to be ſeparated from my father?"</p>
                     <p>A young woman leaned over Amanda, and ſurveyed her with the moſt malignant ſcrutiny: ſhe was daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Belgrave's ſteward, and neither ſhe nor her father poſſeſſed ſufficient virtue to make them reject the offers Belgrave made them on her account. His attachment to her was violent, but tranſient, and in the height of it he made her miſtreſs of the manſion ſhe now occupied, which character ſhe maintained with tyrannic ſway over the reſt of the domeſtics. Belgrave was really ignorant of the violence of her temper, and had no idea ſhe would dare diſpute his inclinations, or to diſobey his orders: he believed ſhe would be ſubſervient to both, and from this belief gave Amanda particularly into her charge.</p>
                     <p>But ſcarcely had he departed, ere ſhe ſwore, "that let the coſequence be what it would, the vile wretch he had brought into the houſe to inſult her, ſhould never remain in it: ſhe ſhall tramp," cried ſhe, "though I follow her myſelf, when he returns, for ſuch a little huſſey ſhall never triumph over me."</p>
                     <p>The ſervants, ignorant and timorous, did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to oppoſe her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:038416_0367_1011E4469FF64BF8"/>
"Come, madam," ſaid ſhe, ſuddenly ſeizing Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's arm, and pulling her from the pillow, "have done with theſe languiſhing airs, and march."</p>
                     <p>"What do you mean?" cried Amanda, trembling at her inflamed countenance</p>
                     <p>"Why I mean you ſhall quit this houſe directly, and I wonder Colonel Belgrave could have the aſſurance to bring ſuch a creature as you into it."</p>
                     <p>"You miſtake, indeed," ſaid Amanda, "treachery, not inclination, brought me into it, and I am not what you ſuppoſe: if, as you ſay, you allow me to depart, I ſhall ever regard you as a friend, and in every pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er I offer up to heaven for myſelf, you ſhall be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered."</p>
                     <p>"Oh dear, but you ſhall not impoſe upon me ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily: come,'" continued ſhe, turning to a maid, "and help me to conduct this fine lady to the hall door."</p>
                     <p>"Gracious heaven," ſaid Amanda, who by this time was taken, or rather dragged, from the bed, "What are you about doing with me? Though I rejoice to quit the houſe, yet ſurely, ſurely," ſhe cried, and her ſoul recoiled at the idea, "without a guide at this hour of the night, you will not turn me from it."</p>
                     <p>She then mentioned Colonel Belgrave's having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her of her purſe and watch, and beſought the woman, in the moſt pathetic terms, to ſupply her with a ſmall ſum, which ſhe ſolemnly aſſured her ſhould be returned, as ſoon as ſhe reached her friends; and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſaying, ſhe ſhould depart with gratitude and joy, if ſhe complied with her requeſt, and allowed ſome one to guide her to a place where ſhe might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a carriage.</p>
                     <p>"Such madams as you," replied the imperious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "are never at a loſs for means of procuring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or a place to go to: I ſee through your art well enough; you want me to pity you, that I may let you ſtay till your Colonel returns; but who would be fool then, I wonder? the tables, I warrant, would ſoon be turned upon me: No, no, out you go this moment."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="175" facs="unknown:038416_0368_1011E4495B326318"/>
So ſaying, ſhe rudely ſeized Amanda, and aſſiſted by another woman, hurried her down ſtairs, and out of the houſe directly they carried her to an intricate part of the wood, and then ran back, leaving the helpleſs mourner leaning againſt a tree.</p>
                     <p>Amanda looked around her; dark and awful were the ſhades of the wood: no light appeared but what came from a few wandering ſtars, which only ſerved to render darkneſs viſible. Have mercy upon me, heaven, groaned Amanda, as ſhe felt herſelf ſinking to the earth. The cold acted as a kind of reſtorative, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt immediately revived her. She reſted her head againſt a little bank, and as ſhe thus reclined, a tender ſadneſs pervaded her ſoul, at the idea of her father's ſorrow when he heard of her fate. "When he hears," cried ſhe, "that I was driven from the houſe, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of pity or protection from any being; that his Amanda, whom he cheriſhed in his boſom as the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his age, was denied the pity he would have ſhewn the greateſt wretch that crawls upon the earth; and that ſhe periſhed without ſhelter, it will break his heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely. Poor Oſcar, too, alas! I ſhall be a ſource of wretchedneſs to both. Will Lord Mortimer lament when he hears of my fate? Alas! I cannot believe that he will: he that could leave me in the arms of inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and ſo readily believe ill of me, muſt have a heart ſteeled againſt compaſſion for my ſufferings. But my unhappy father and brother will never doubt my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and by them I ſhall be tenderly and truly mourned."</p>
                     <p>The idea of their ſufferings, at laſt recalled her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thoughts, and pity for thoſe ſufferings, made her endeavour to ſupport her own, that ſhe might be able to make ſome efforts for preſerving a life ſo precious to them: beſides, as ſhe reflected, ſhe could not but attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but her expulſion from the houſe of infamy, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate interpoſition of Providence in her favour; and whilſt her heart ſwelled with gratitude at the idea, her fortitude gradually returned. She aroſe, but the vigour of her nerves was not equal to the ardour of her intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:038416_0369_1011E44CF43A8F48"/>
ſhe walked on, and as ſhe proceeded, the gloom grew more profound; the paths were intricate, and her progreſs was often impeded by the roots of trees, and the branches that grew about them. After wandering about a conſiderable time, ſhe at laſt began to think, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of gaining the ſkirts, ſhe had penetrated into the very centre of the wood, and that to quit it, till morning, would be impoſſible. Yielding to this idea, or rather to her exceſſive wearineſs, ſhe was ſeeking for a place to ſit down on, when a faint light glimmered before her: ſhe inſtantly darted through the path from whence it gleam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and found herſelf at the extremity of the wood, and that the light proceeded from a ſmall hamlet contiguous to it. Thither ſhe walked, as faſt as her trembling limbs would carry her. A profound ſtillneſs reigned around, only interrupted by the hoarſe and hollow barking of ſome diſtant dogs, which, in ſuch an hour, had ſomething particularly ſolemn in it. The ſtillneſs, and ſudden diſappearance of lights from various windows, convinced Amanda that every cottage was cloſed for the night; "and were they open," ſaid ſhe, "I perhaps ſhould be denied acceſs to any, deprived as I am, of the means of rewarding kindneſs." She ſhuddered at the idea of paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a night unſheltered. "It is now, indeed," ſaid ſhe, "I really know what it is to feel for the houſeleſs chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of want." She moved ſoftly along; the echo of her own ſteps alarmed her; ſhe had nearly reached the end of the hamlet, when before a neat cottage, divided from the others by a clump of old trees, ſhe ſaw a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, who might well have paſſed for an ancient hermit; his grey locks thinly ſhaded his forehead; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of deep and penſive thought was viſible in his countenance; his arms were folded on his breaſt, and his eyes were raiſed with a tender melancholy to heaven, as if that heaven he contemplated, was now the abode of ſome kindred and lamented ſpirit. Surely ſuch a being, thought ſhe, will pity me. She approached him—ſtood cloſe to him, yet was unnoticed. Thrice ſhe attempted to ſpeak, and thrice her heart failed her; at laſt ſhe ſummoned all her courage to her aid, and faintly articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:038416_0370_1011E4503AC6CC78"/>
"pity—" ſhe could add no more, but fainted at his feet. The ſtranger's mind was fraught with all the benevolence his countenance depictured; the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent glance he had caught of Amanda, intereſted every tender feeling; he called to his ſervant, an elderly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, his only companion in the cottage, to aſſiſt him in conveying her in. The woman's heart was as tender as her maſter's, and the youth, the beauty, and forlorn ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Amanda, equally excited their wonder and pity. It was many minutes ere ſhe opened her eyes, and when ſhe did, her ſenſes were quite bewildered; "and my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? alas! my father, I ſhall never more behold him," was all ſhe could articulate.</p>
                     <p>She was ſupported to a ſmall chamber, the old woman undreſt her, put her to bed, and ſat up with her the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the night. Amanda often ſtarted: ſhe raved continually of Belgrave, the author of her woes, and betrayed the ſtrongeſt horror. "The wound he had inflicted on her heart," ſhe ſaid, "the hand of death could only heal." She mentioned the cruelty of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs; called upon her father to ſave her from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and reproached Mortimer for aiding to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm her in diſgrace. She continued in this ſituation three days, during which the old man and his faithful ſervant watched her with unremitted attention. A neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring apothecary was ſummoned to her aid, and a girl from one of the cottages procured to ſit up with her at night. The old man frequently knelt by the bed-ſide, watching, with anxiety, for a favourable ſymptom. Her incoherent expreſſions pierced him to the heart; he felt, from mournful ſympathy, for the father ſhe ſo patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally mentioned, and invoked heaven to reſtore her to him.</p>
                     <p>The afternoon of the third day, Amanda, after a long ſlumber, awoke, perfectly reſtored to her ſenſes; it was many minutes, however, after her awaking, ere ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected all the circumſtances that had cauſed her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="unknown:038416_0371_1011E451CF8A0ED0"/>
She at laſt opened the curtain, and perceived the old woman, whom we ſhall hereafter call Eleanor, ſeated by the bed ſide.</p>
                     <p>"I ſear," ſaid ſhe, with a languid ſmile, "I have been the occaſion of a great deal of trouble."</p>
                     <p>"No, no," replied the kind Eleanor, delighted to hear her ſpeak ſo calmly, and drawing back a little of the curtain at the ſame time, to obſerve her looks.</p>
                     <p>Amanda inquired how long ſhe had been ill. Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor informed her, and added, "heaven, my dear child, was kind to you, in throwing you in my maſter's way, who delights in befriending the helpleſs."</p>
                     <p>"Heaven will reward him," exclaimed Amanda."</p>
                     <p>The chamber was gloomy; ſhe requeſted one of the ſhutters might be opened. Eleanor complied with her deſire, and a ray of the declining ſun darting through the caſement, cheered her penſive heart.</p>
                     <p>She perfectly remembered the venerable figure ſhe had beheld on the threſhold of the cottage, and was impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to expreſs her gratitude to him. The next day ſhe truſted, would give her an opportunity of doing ſo, as ſhe then reſolved, if poſſible to riſe. The wiſh of her ſoul was to be with her father. Ere he could receive any intimation of what had happened, ſhe reſolved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to her benevolent hoſt, the incident which had placed her in ſuch a ſituation; and ſhe flattered herſelf, on hearing them, he would accommodate her with the means of returning to Ireland: if unable (unwilling ſhe could not think ſhe ſhould find him) to do this, ſhe then intended writing to her father. This meaſure, however, ſhe fervently truſted, ſhe ſhould have no occaſion to take, as ſhe well knew the ſhock ſuch a letter would give him.</p>
                     <p>Contrary to the inclinations of Eleanor, ſhe roſe the next day, and as ſoon as ſhe was dreſt, ſent to requeſt Mr. Howell's company. Eleanor had informed her of her maſter's name.</p>
                     <p>The chamber was on a ground floor: before the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were a row of neat white cottages; and behind them roſe a range of lofty hills, covered to the very ſummit with trees, now juſt burſting into verdure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:038416_0372_1011E4548CE8BFA0"/>
the cottages ran a clear murmuring rivulet, at which ſome young girls were waſhing clothes, whilſt others ſpread them upon hedges, and all beguiled their labour with ſinging, chatting, and laughing together.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! happy creatures," cried Amanda, "ſcreened by your native hills, you know nothing of the vices or miſeries of the great world: no ſnares lurk beneath the flowery paths you tread, to wring your hearts with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and nip the early bloſſoms of your youth."</p>
                     <p>The old man appeared and interrupted her meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When he beheld the pale face of Amanda, beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with angelic ſweetneſs: when he ſaw her emaciated hand extended towards him, while her ſoft voice uttered her grateful acknowledgments, his emotions could not be ſuppreſt: he preſt her hand between his: tears rolled down the furrows of his face, and he exclaimed,
"I thank the Almighty for reviving this ſweet flower."</p>
                     <p>A deep ſob from Amanda, proved how much he had affected her feelings.</p>
                     <p>He was alarmed, and haſtily endeavoured to compoſe his own, out of regard to her's.</p>
                     <p>When a little compoſed, with grateful ſweetneſs ſhe continued to thank him for his kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>"Pity," ſaid ſhe, "is a ſweet emotion to excite; yet from you, without eſteem, it would be humiliating; and eſteem I cannot flatter myſelf with obtaining, till I have accounted for being a wretched wanderer."</p>
                     <p>She then gave a brief account of her father, and the events of her life.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! my dear, cried the old man, as ſhe finiſhed her narrative, "you have reaſon, indeed, to regret your knowledge of Belgrave, but the ſorrow he has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, I believe and truſt, will be but tranſient: that which he has given me, will be laſting as my life: you look aſtoniſhed:—alas! but for him, I might now have been bleſt with a daughter as lovely and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MANY years are now elapſed ſince I took up my reſidence in this ſequeſtered hamlet. I retired to it in diſtaſte with a world, whoſe vices had robbed me of the deareſt treaſure of my heart. Two children cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſolitude, and in training them up to virtue, I loſt the remembrance of half my cares. My ſon, when qualified, was ſent to Oxford, as a friend had promiſed to provide for him in the church: but my daughter was deſtined to retirement, not only from the narrowneſs of my income, but from a thorough conviction it was beſt calculated to enſure her felicity. Juliana was the child of innocence and content, ſhe knew of no greater hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs than that of promoting mine; of no pleaſures but what the hamlet could afford, and was one of the gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as well as the lovelieſt of its daughters. One fatal evening I ſuffered her to go, with ſome of her young companions, to a ruſtic ball, given by the parents of Belgrave, to their tenants, on coming down to Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, from which they had been long abſent. The graces of my child immediately attracted the notice of their ſon: though young in years, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a profeſt libertine: the conduct of his father had ſet him an example of diſſipation, which the volatility of his own diſpoſition too ready inclined him to follow. His heart immediately conceived the baſeſt ſchemes
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:038416_0374_1011E45B70B2B0A8"/>
againſt Juliana, which the obſcurity of her ſituation prompted him to think might readily be accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>From this period he took every opportunity of thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in her way; my ſuſpicions, or rather my fears, were ſoon excited, for I knew not then the real depravity of Belgrave; but I knew that an attachment between him and my daughter would prove a ſource of uneaſineſs to both, from the diſparity fortune had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced between them. My taſk in convincing Juliana of the impropriety of encouraging ſuch an attachment, was not a difficult one; but alas! I ſaw the conviction was attended with a pang of anguiſh, which pierced me to the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Belgrave, from the aſſumed ſoftneſs and delicacy of his manners, had made an impreſſion on her heart, which was not to be eraſed; every effort, however, which pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could ſuggeſt, ſhe reſolved to make, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with my wiſhes avoided Belgrave. This conduct ſoon convinced him that it would be a difficult matter to lull my caution or betray her innocence; and finding all his attempts to ſee, or convey a letter to her, ineffectual, he departed with his parents from Woodhouſe.</p>
                     <p>Juliana heard of his departure with a forced ſmile, but a ſtarting tear, and a colourleſs cheek, too clearly denoted to me the ſtate of her mind. I ſhall not attempt to deſcribe my ſufferings, on witneſſing her's; with my pity was mixed a degree of veneration for that virtue, which in ſo young a mind could make ſuch exertions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a paſſion diſapproved of by a parent. The evening of his departure, no longer under any reſtraint, ſhe walked out alone, and inſtinctively, perhaps, took the road to Woodhouſe. She wandered to its deepeſt glooms, and there gave way to emotions, which, from her efforts to ſuppreſs them, were become almoſt too painful to ſupport The gloom of the wood was heightened by the ſhades of evening, and a ſolemn ſtillneſs reigned around, well calculated to inſpire penſive tenderneſs. She ſighed the name of Belgrave in tremulous accents, and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ever having in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the trees ſtartled her, and the next moment ſhe beheld him at her feet, exclaiming, "We have met, my Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, never more to part."</p>
                     <p>Surpriſe and confuſion ſo overpowered her ſenſes, as to render her, for ſome time, unable to attend to his raptures. When ſhe grew compoſed, he told her he was returned to make her honourable his; but to effect this intention, a journey from the hamlet was requiſite.</p>
                     <p>She turned pale at theſe words, and declared ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would conſent to a clandeſtine meaſure.</p>
                     <p>This declaration did not diſcourage Belgrave: he knew the intereſt he had in her heart, and this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge gave an energy to his arguments, which gradually undermined the reſolution of Juliana. Already, he ſaid, ſhe had made a ſufficient ſacrifice to filial duty; ſurely ſomething was now due to love like his, which, on her account, would cheerfully ſubmit to innumerable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. As he was under age, a journey to Scotland was unavoidable, he ſaid, and he would have made me his confidant on the occaſion, but that he feared my ſcrupulous delicacy would have oppoſed his intentions, as contrary to parental authority. He promiſed Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana to bring her back to the hamlet immediately after the ceremony; in ſhort, the plauſibility of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, the tenderneſs of his perſuaſions, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret impulſes of her heart, at laſt produced the effect he wiſhed, and he received a promiſe from her, to put herſelf under his protection that very night.</p>
                     <p>But oh! how impoſſible to deſcribe my agonies the enſuing morning, when, inſtead of my child, I found a letter in her room, informing me of her elopement; they were ſuch as a parent, trembling for the ſame and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his child, may conceive; my ſenſes muſt have ſunk beneath them, had they long continued; but Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, according to his promiſe, haſtened back my child, and as I ſat ſolitary and penſive in the apartment ſhe ſo often had enlivened, I ſuddenly beheld her at my feet, ſupported by Belgrave, as his wife. So great a tranſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from deſpair to comfort, was almoſt too powerful for me to ſupport. I aſked my heart, was its preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:038416_0376_1011E45FE07B1810"/>
real: I knelt, I received my child in my arms: in thoſe feeble arms I ſeemed to raiſe her with my heart to heaven in pious gratitude, for her returning unſulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yet when my firſt tranſports were abated, I could not help regretting her ever having conſented to a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine union. I entreated Belgrave to write in the moſt ſubmiſſive manner to his father. He promiſed to comply with my entreaty, yet hinted his fears, that his compliance would be unattended with the ſucceſs I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. He requeſted, if this ſhould be the caſe, I would allow his wife to reſide in the cottage till he was of age. Oh! how pleaſing a requeſt to my heart: a month paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away in happineſs, only allayed by not hearing from his father. At the expiration of that time, he declared he muſt depart, having received orders to join his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but promiſed to return as ſoon as poſſible: he alſo promiſed to write, but a fortnight elapſed, and no letter arrived.</p>
                     <p>Juliana and I grew alarmed, but it was an alarm that only proceeded from fears of his being ill. We were ſitting one morning at breakfaſt, when the ſtopping of a carriage drew us from the table.</p>
                     <p>"He is come!" ſaid Juliana, "he is come!" and ſhe flew to open the door, when, inſtead of her expected Belgrave, ſhe beheld his father, whoſe dark and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty viſage proclaimed, that he came on no charitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Alas! the occaſion of his viſit was too ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; he came to have the ties, which bound his ſon to Juliana, broken. My child, on hearing this, with firmneſs declared, that ſhe was convinced any ſcheme his cruelty might deviſe to ſeparate them, the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, as well as tenderneſs of his ſon, would render abortive.</p>
                     <p>"Be not too confident of that, young lady," cried he, ſmiling maliciouſly. He then proceeded to inform her, that that Belgrave, ſo beloved, and in whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity ſhe ſo confided, had himſelf authorized his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being determined to avail himſelf of non-age, to have the marriage broke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="unknown:038416_0377_1011E4616D310010"/>
Juliana could bear no more; ſhe ſunk fainting on the boſom of her wretched father. Oh! what a ſituation was mine, when, as I claſped her wildly to my heart, and called upon her to revive, that heart whiſpered me, it was cruelty to wiſh ſhe ſhould! Alas! too ſoon ſhe did, to a keen perception of miſery. The marriage was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and health and happineſs fled from her together: yet, from compaſſion to me, I ſaw ſhe ſtruggled to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the burthen of exiſtence. Every remedy which had a chance of prolonging it, I adminiſtered: but alas! ſorrow was rooted in her heart, and it was only its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, which was impoſſible, that could have effected her recovery. Oh! how often have I ſtolen from my bed to the door of her apartment, trembling, leſt I ſhould hear the laſt groan eſcape her lips! how often have I then heard her deep convulſive ſobs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached myſelf for ſelfiſhneſs at the moment, for wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the continuance of her being, which was only wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the continuance of her miſery? Yes, I have then ſaid, I reſign her, my Creator, unto thee; I reſign her, from a certainty, that only with thee ſhe can enjoy feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. But alas! in a moment frail nature has triumphed over ſuch a reſignation, and proſtrate on the ground I have implored heaven, either to ſpare the child, or take the father along with her.</p>
                     <p>She ſaw me unuſually depreſt one day, and propoſed a walk, with the hope that any exertion from her might recruit my ſpirits; but when I ſaw my child in the very bloom of life, unable to ſuſtain her feeble frame: when I felt her leaning on my almoſt nerveleſs arm for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, Oh! how intolerable was the anguiſh that rived my heart! In vain by ſoft endearments, ſhe ſtrove to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it. She motioned to go towards Woodhouſe; we had got within ſight of the wood, when ſhe complained of fatigue, and ſat down. She had not been many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes in this ſituation, when ſhe beheld, coming from the wood, Belgrave and a young girl ſhe knew to be the ſteward's daughter. The familiar manner in which they appeared converſing, left little room to doubt of the footing on which they were. The hectic glow of Juliana's
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:038416_0378_1011E4649CC8AAE8"/>
complexion, gave place to a deadly paleneſs; ſhe aroſe and returned with me in ſilence to the cottage, from whence, in leſs than a week, ſhe was borne to her grave.</p>
                     <p>Eight years, continued he, after a pauſe of ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, have elapſed ſince her death, yet is her worth, her beauty, and her ſufferings ſtill freſh in the remembrance of the inhabitants of the hamlet. In mine, oh! Miſs Fitzalan, how painfully, how pleaſingly, do they ſtill exiſt: no noiſome weed is allowed to intermingle in the high graſs which has o'ergrown her grave, at the head of which ſome kind hand has planted a roſe tree, whoſe roſes bloſſom, bloom, and die upon the ſacred ſpot. My child is gone before me to that earthly bed, to which I hoped ſhe would have ſmoothed my paſſage. Every ſpot in and about the cottage, continually recall her to my view: the ornaments of this little room, were all the work of that hand, long ſince mouldered into duſt: in that bed—he ſtopt, he groaned, and tears burſt from him—in that bed, reſumed he (in a few minutes, though with a broken voice) ſhe breathed her laſt ſigh; in that ſpot I knelt and received the laſt preſſure of her clay cold lips. Of a calm night, when all is huſhed to repoſe, I love to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template that heaven, to which I have given an angel; an angel to whom, I hope, ſhortly to be re-united; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a hope, ſurely, of all men breathing, I ſhould be the moſt wretched; oh! how cruel is it then in thoſe, who, by raiſing doubts of an hereafter, attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſuch a hope. Ye ſons of error, hide the impious doubts within your hearts, nor with wanton barbarity endeavour to deprive the miſerable of their laſt comfort; when this world preſents nothing but a dreary proſpect, how chearing to the afflicted to reflect on that future one, where all will be bright and happy. When we mourn over the loſt friends of our tendereſt affections, on! how conſolatory to think we ſhall be re-united to them again; how often has this thought ſuſpended my tears and ſlopt my ſighs; inſpired by it with ſudden joy, often have I riſen from the cold bed where Juliana lies, and exclaimed, "O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory?" both loſt in the certainty of again beholding my child.</p>
                     <p>

Amanda ſhed tears of ſoft compaſſion for the fate of Juliana, and the ſorrows of her father, and felt if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, her gratitude to heaven increaſed, for preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from the ſnares of ſuch a monſter of deceit and barbarity as Belgrave.</p>
                     <p>Howell relieved the anxiety ſhe laboured under about the means of returning home, by aſſuring her he would not only ſupply her with a ſum ſufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but ſee her to Parkgate himſelf.</p>
                     <p>His name ſtruck Amanda: it recalled to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance her Welch friend. She inquired, and heard, that the young and tender curate was indeed the ſon of her benefactor. "The ſoftneſs of Henry's diſpoſition," ſaid his father, "particularly qualifies him for the ſacred function, which prevents his having occaſion to mingle in the concerns of the great world. He writes me word, that he is the ſimple ſhepherd of a ſimple flock."</p>
                     <p>One day was all Amanda would devote to the purpoſe of recruiting her ſtrength; nothing could prevail on her longer to defer her journey. A chaiſe was accordingly procured, into which, at the firſt dawn of day, ſhe and Howell ſtept, followed by the bleſſings of the affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Eleanor, who, from her own wardrobe, had ſupplied Amanda with a few neceſſaries, to take along with her. The church yard lay about a quarter of a mile from the hamlet: it was only divided from the road by a low and broken wall. Old trees, ſhaded the graſs grown graves, and gave a kind of ſolemn gloomineſs to the place.</p>
                     <p>"See," ſaid Howell, ſuddenly taking Amanda's hand and letting down the glaſs, "ſee the bed where Juliana repoſes."</p>
                     <p>The grave was diſtinguiſhed by the roſe tree at its head: the morning breeze gently agitated the high and luxuriant graſs which covered it. Amanda gazed on it with inexpreſſible ſadneſs, but the emotions it excited in her breaſt, ſhe endeavoured to check, in pity to the wretched father, who exclaimed, while tears trickled down his pale and furrowed cheeks, "there lies my treaſure."</p>
                     <p>She tried to divert him from his ſorrows, by talking of his ſon. She deſcribed his little reſidence, which he
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:038416_0380_1011E46AEE32FB08"/>
had never ſeen: thus, by recalling to his recollection the bleſſings he yet poſſeſſed, checking his anguiſh for thoſe he had loſt.</p>
                     <p>The weakneſs of Amanda would not allow them to travel expeditiouſly. They ſlept one night on the road, and the next day, to her great joy, arrived at Parkgate, as ſhe had all along dreaded a purſuit from Belgrave. A packet was to ſail about four o'clock in the afternoon; ſhe partook of a ſlight repaſt with her benevolent friend, who attended her to the boat, and with ſtarting tears, gave and received an adieu. She promiſed to write as ſoon as ſhe reached home, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him his kindneſs would never be obliterated from her heart. He watched her till ſhe entered the ſhip, then returned to the inn, and immediately ſet off for the hamlet, with a mind ſomewhat cheered by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of having ſerved a fellow creature.</p>

                     <p>THE weakneſs which Amanda felt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of her late illneſs, and the exceſſive ſickneſs ſhe always ſuffered at ſea, made her retire to bed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on entering the packet, where ſhe continued till evening of the ſecond day, when about five o'clock, ſhe was landed at the marine hotel. She directly requeſted the waiter to procure her a meſſenger to go into town, which being done ſhe ſent to engage a place in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern mail coach, that went within a few miles of Caſtle Carberry. If a place could not be procured, ſhe order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a chaiſe might be hired, that would immediately ſet out with her, as the nights were moon light; but to her great joy the man ſpeedily returned, and informed her he had ſecured a ſeat in the coach, which ſhe thought a much ſafer mode of travelling for her, than in a hired carriage, without any attendant. She took ſome ſlight refreſhment, and then proceeded to the mail hotel, from whence, at eleven o'clock, ſhe ſet out, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with one old gentleman, who very compoſedly put on a large woollen night cap, buttoned up his great coat, and fell into a profound ſleep; he was, perhaps, juſt ſuch a kind of companion as Amanda deſired, as he neither teazed her with inſipid converſation, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent queſtions, but left her undiſturbed, to indulge her meditations during the journey. The ſecond even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about eight o'clock, ſhe arrived at the neareſt town to Caſtle Carberry, for which ſhe directly procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a chaiſe, and ſet off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="189" facs="unknown:038416_0382_1011E4718B0E4E98"/>
Her ſpirits were painfully agitated: ſhe dreaded the ſhock her father would receive from hearing of her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which it would be impoſſible to conceal from him: ſhe trembled at what they would both feel on the approaching interview; ſometimes ſhe feared he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard of her diſtreſs, and a gloomy preſage roſe in her mind, of the anguiſh ſhe ſhould find him in on her account: yet again, when ſhe reflected on the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude he had hitherto diſplayed in his trials, under the preſent, ſhe truſted, he would not loſe it; and that he would not only ſupport himſelf, but her, and bind up thoſe wounds in her heart, which perfidy, cruelty, and ingratitude had made. And oh! thought ſhe to herſelf, when I find myſelf again in his arms, no temptation ſhall allure me from them; allure me into a world, where my peace and fame have already ſuffered ſuch a wreck. Thus alternately fluctuating between hope and fear, Amanda purſued the road to Caſtle Carberry; but the latter ſenſation was predominat in her mind.</p>
                     <p>The uncommon gloomineſs of the evening added to her dejection; the dark and lowering clouds threatened a violent ſtorm; already a ſhower of ſleet and rain was falling, and every thing looked cold and cheerleſs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda thought the cabins infinitely more wretched than when ſhe had firſt ſeen them; many of their miſerable inhabitants were now gathering their little ſtock toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and driving them under ſhelter from the coming ſtorm. The labourers were ſeen haſtening to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective homes, whilſt the plough boy, with a low and melancholy whiſtle, drove his ſlow and wearied team along. The ſea looked rough and black, and as Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da drew nearer to it, ſhe heard it breaking with fury againſt the rocks.</p>
                     <p>She felt herſelf extremely ill: ſhe had left the hamlet ere her fever was ſubdued, and fatigue, joined to want of reſt, now brought it back with all its former violence. She longed for reſt and quiet, and truſted and believed theſe would conquer her malady.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="190" facs="unknown:038416_0383_1011E4742C4DA4F0"/>
The chaiſe ſtopped at the entrance of the lawn, as ſhe wiſhed to have her father prepared for her arrival, by one of the ſervants. On alighting from it, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to town, and ſhe ſtruck into a grove, and by a winding path reached the caſtle. Her limbs trembled, and ſhe knocked with an unſteady hand at the door. The ſound was awfully reverberated through the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſome minutes elapſed, and no being appeared; neither could ſhe perceive a ray of light from any of the windows; the wind blew the rain directly in her face, and her weakneſs increaſed ſo ſhe could ſcarcely ſtand. She recollected a ſmall door at the back of the caſtle, which led to the apartments appropriated to the domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; ſhe walked feebly to this, to try and gain admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and found it open. She proceeded through a long dark paſſage, on each ſide of which were ſmall rooms, till ſhe came to the kitchen; here ſhe found the old woman ſitting, (to whom the care of the caſtle was uſually conſigned) before a large turf fire. On hearing a footſtep ſhe looked behind, and when ſhe ſaw Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, ſtarted, ſcreamed, and betrayed ſymptoms of the utmoſt terror.</p>
                     <p>"Are you frightened at ſeeing me, my good Kate?" cried Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Oh Holy Virgin," replied Kate, croſſing her breaſt, "one could not help being frightened, to have a body ſteal unawares upon them."</p>
                     <p>"My father is well, I hope?" ſaid Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Alack a-day," cried Kate, "the poor dear Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain has gone through a ſea of troubles ſince you went away."</p>
                     <p>"Is he ill?" exclaimed Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Ill, ay, and the Lord knows he has reaſon enough to be ill. But, my dear jewel, do you know nothing at all of what has happened at the Caſtle ſince you went away?"</p>
                     <p>"No, nothing in the world."</p>
                     <p>"Heaven help you then," ſaid Kate; "but my dear ſoul, ſit down upon this little ſtool, and warm yourſelf before the fire, for you look pale and cold, and I will tell you all about it. You muſt know, about three weeks

ago my Johnaten brought the Captain a letter from the Poſt-office; he knew by the mark it was a letter from England; and ſo when he comes into the kitchen to me, Kate, ſays he, the Captain has got ſomething now to cheer his ſpirits, for he has heard from Miſs, I am ſure. So to be ſure, I ſaid, I was glad of it, for you muſt know, my dear, he was low in ſpirits, and peaking, as one may ſay, for a few days before. Well, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways my cuſtom, when he got a letter from England, to go to him as ſoon as I thought he had read it, and aſk about you; ſo I put on a clean apron, and up I goes to the parlour, and opened the door and walked in. "Well, ſir," ſays I, "I hope there is good news from Miſs?"</p>
                     <p>"The Captain was ſitting with the letter open before him on a table; he had a handkerchief to his eyes, but when I ſpoke he took it down, and I ſaw his face, which generally looked ſo pale, now quite ſtuſhed."</p>
                     <p>"This letter, my good Kate," ſays he, "is not from my daughter, but I am glad you are come, for I wanted to ſpeak to you. I am going to leave the Caſtle, and I want you to look over all the things, and ſee they are in the ſame ſtate as when I came to it; I ſhall then ſettle with the ſervants I hired, and diſcharge them."</p>
                     <p>I was ſtruck all of a heap; "The Lord forbid you ſhould be going to leave us, ſir," ſays I.</p>
                     <p>"The Captain got up: he walked to the window: he ſighed heavily, and I ſaw a tear upon his cheek. He ſpoke to me again, and begged I would do as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me; ſo with a heavy heart I went and told Johna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ſad tidings, who was as ſorry as myſelf, for he loved the Captain dearly, not only from his being ſo mild a gentleman, but becauſe he was a ſoldier, as he himſelf had been in his youth, and a ſoldier has always a love for one of his cloth; and Johnaten had often ſaid he knew the captain in America, and that he was a brave officer, and a real gentleman.</p>
                     <p>"Well, the captain came out to us, and ſaid he was to be Lord Cherbury's agent no longer; and being a good penman, he ſettled all his own accounts, and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, in the courſe of the day, and diſcharged them,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:038416_0385_1011E478C80924E8"/>
giving them both characters, which I warrant will ſoon get them good places again. Well, he ſaid he muſt ſet off for England the next day, ſo every thing was got ready; but in the middle of the night he was ſeized with ſpaſms in his ſtomach; he thought himſelf dying, and at laſt rung the bell, and as good luck would have it, my Johnaten heard it, and went up to him directly: had he been without relief much longer, I think he would have died. Johnaten called me up; I had a choice bottle of old brandy lying by me, ſo I ſoon blew up a fire, and heating a cup of it, gave it to him directly. He grew a little eaſier, but was too bad in the morning to think of going on his journey, which grieved him ſadly. He got up, however, and wrote a large pacquet, which he ſent by Johnaten to the Poſt-office; packed up ſome things in a trunk, and put his ſeal upon his deſk: he ſaid he would not ſtay in the Caſtle upon any account, ſo he went out as ſoon as Johnaten came back from the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Office, leaning upon his arm, and got a little lodging at Thady Bryne's cabin."</p>
                     <p>"Merciful Heaven!" exclaimed the agonized and almoſt fainting Amanda, "ſupport and ſtrengthen me in this trying hour! enable me to comfort my unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate father; preſerve me from ſinking, that I may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to aſſiſt him:" Tears accompanied this fervent ejaculation, and her voice was loſt in ſobs.</p>
                     <p>"Alack-a-day, ſaid the good-natured Kate, "now don't take it ſo ſadly to heart, my jewel, all is not loſt that is in danger, and there is as good fiſh in the ſea as ever were caught; and what though this is a ſtormy night, to-morrow may be a fine day. Why, the very firſt ſight of you will do the Captain good. Come, cheer up. I will give you ſome nice hot potatoes for your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for you ſee the pot is juſt boiling, and ſome freſh churned butter-milk, and by the time you have eaten it, Johnaten, perhaps, may come back; he is gone to town to get ſome beef for our Sunday dinner, and then I will go with you to Thady's myſelf."</p>
                     <p>"No, no," cried Amanda, "every minute I now ſtay from my father ſeems an age:—too long has he been
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:038416_0386_1011E47C9F566E30"/>
neglected:—too long without a friend to ſooth or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him. Oh grant, gracious heaven grant," raiſing her claſped hands, "that I may not have returned too late to be of uſe to him."</p>
                     <p>Kate preſt her to ſtay for Johnaten's return; but the agony of ſuſpence ſhe endured till ſhe ſaw her father, made her regardleſs of walking alone, though the hour was late, dark and tempeſtuous. Kate finding her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties vain, attended her to the door, aſſured her if Johnaten returned ſoon, ſhe would go over herſelf to the cabin, and ſee if ſhe could do any thing for her. Amanda preſt her hand, but was unable to ſpeak. Ill, weak and diſpirited, ſhe had flattered herſelf, on return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her father, ſhe ſhould receive relief, ſupport, and conſolation; inſtead of which, heart-broken as ſhe was, ſhe now found ſhe muſt give, or at leaſt attempt giving them, herſelf. She had before experienced diſtreſs, but the actual preſſure of poverty ſhe had never yet felt. Heretofore ſhe had always a comfortable aſylum to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to, but now ſhe not only found herſelf deprived of that, but of all means of procuring one, or even the neceſſaries of life.</p>
                     <p>But if ſhe mourned for herſelf, how much more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely did ſhe mourn for her adored father. Could ſhe have procured him comfort: could ſhe, in any degree, have alleviated his ſituation, the horrors of her own would have been leſſened; but of this ſhe had not the ſlighteſt means or proſpect. Her father, ſhe knew, poſſeſſed the agency too ſhort a time, to be enabled to ſave any mony, particularly as he was indebted to Lord Cherbury ere he obtained it: ſhe knew of no being to whom ſhe could apply in his behalf. Lord Cherbury was the only perſon on whom he depended in his form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er misfortunes for relief; his friendſhip, it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by depriving her father of the agency, was total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt; and to the diſconſolate Amanda, no way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of eſcaping "want, worldly want, that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, meagre fiend," who was already cloſe at their heels, and followed them in view.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="194" facs="unknown:038416_0387_1011E47E2CE16CF8"/>
The violence of the ſtorm had increaſed, but it was ſlight in compariſon of that which agitated the boſom of Amanda. The waves daſhed with a dreadful noiſe againſt the rocks, and the angry ſpirit of the waters roared; the rain fell heavily, and ſoon ſoaked through the thin cloathing of Amanda. She had about half a mile to walk through a rugged road, bounded on one ſide by rocks, and on the other by wild and dreary fields. She knew the people with whom her father lodged, they were of the loweſt order, and on her firſt arriving at Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Carberry, in extreme diſtreſs, from which ſhe had relieved them. She recollected their cabin was more decent than many others ſhe had ſeen, yet ſtill a moſt miſerable dwelling. Wretched as it was, ſhe was glad when ſhe reached it, for the violence of the ſtorm, and the lonelineſs of the road, had terrified her. The cabin was but a few yards from the beach; there were two windows in front: on one ſide a pile of turf, and on the other a ſhed for the pigs, in which they now lay grunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the ſhutters were faſtened on the windows, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their being ſhaken by the wind; but through the crevices Amanda ſaw light, which convinced her the inhabitants were not yet retired to repoſe. She feared her ſuddenly appearing before her father, in his preſent weak ſtate, might have a dangerous effect upon him, and ſhe ſtood before the cabin, conſidering how ſhe ſhould have her arrival broke to him. She at laſt tapped gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the door, and then retreated a few ſteps from it, ſhivering with the wet and cold: in the beautiful lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Solomon ſhe might have ſaid, "Her head was filled with dew, and her locks with the drops of the night." As ſhe expected, the door was almoſt inſtantly opened; a boy appeared, whom ſhe knew to be ſon to the poor people. She held up her handkerchief, and beckoned him to her; he heſitated, as if afraid to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, till ſhe called him ſoftly by his name; this aſſured him; he approached and expreſſed aſtoniſhment at find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe was the perſon who called him. She inquired for her father, and heard he was ill, and then aſleep. She deſired the boy to enter the cabin before her, and caution
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:038416_0388_1011E480C7BED960"/>
his parents againſt making any noiſe that might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb him; he obeyed her and ſhe followed him.</p>
                     <p>She found the father of the family blowing a turf fire, to haſten the boiling of a large pot of potatoes. Three ragged children were ſitting before it, watching impatiently for their ſupper. Their mother was ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and their old grandmother making bread. The place was ſmall and crowded; half the family ſlept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the other half upon a loft, to which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended by a ladder, and upon which a number of fowls were now familiarly rooſting, cackling at every noiſe made below. Fitzalan's room was divided from the reſt of the cabin by a thin partition of wood, plaiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pictures of ſaints and croſſes.</p>
                     <p>"Save you kindly, madam," ſaid the miſtreſs of the manſion to Amanda, on entering it.</p>
                     <p>Bryne got up, and with many ſcrapes, offered her his little ſtool before the fire. She thanked him, and accepted it; his wife, notwithſtanding the obligations ſhe lay under to her, ſeemed to think as much reſpect was not due to her as when miſtreſs of the caſtle, and therefore never left her ſeat, or quitted her ſpinning, on her entrance.</p>
                     <p>"My poor father is very ill," ſaid Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Why, indeed the captain has had a bad time of it," anſwered Mrs. Bryne, jogging her wheel; "to be ſure he has ſuffered ſome little change; but your great folks, as well as your ſimple folks, muſt look to that in this world; and I don't know why they ſhould not, for they are no better than the others, I believe."</p>
                     <p>"Arra, Norah, now," ſaid Bryne, "I wonder you are not ſhy of ſpeaking ſo to the poor young lady."</p>
                     <p>Amanda's heart was ſurcharged with grief; ſhe felt ſuffocating; ſhe aroſe, unlatched the door, and the keen cold air a little revived her. Tears burſt forth, ſhe indulged them freely, and they lightened the load on her heart. She aſked for a glaſs of water; a glaſs was not readily to be procured. Bryne told her ſhe had better take a noggin of butter-milk. This ſhe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and he brought her one of water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="unknown:038416_0389_1011E482C6E6E438"/>
She now conquered the reluctance ſhe felt to ſpeak to the uncouth Mrs. Bryne, and conſulted her on the beſt method of mentioning her arrival to her father. Mrs. Bryne ſaid he had been in bed ſome time, but his ſleep was often interrupted, and ſhe would now ſtep into his chamber, and try if he was awake; ſhe accordingly did ſo, but returned in a moment, and ſaid he ſtill ſlept.</p>
                     <p>Amanda wiſhed to ſee him in his preſent ſituation, to judge how far his illneſs had affected him; ſhe ſtept ſoftly into his room; it was ſmall and low, lighted by a glimmering ruſh-light, and a declining fire. The fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture was poor and ſcanty; in one corner ſtood a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en bedſtead, without curtains, or any ſhade, and on this, under miſerable bed clothes, lay poor Fitzalan.</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſhuddered as ſhe looked round this chamber of wretchedneſs. "Oh, my father," ſhe cried to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "is this the only refuge you could find." She went to the bed, ſhe leaned over it, and beheld his face; it was deadly pale and emaciated: he moaned in his ſleep, as if his mind was dreadfully oppreſt. Suddenly he began to move; he ſighed—"Amanda, my deareſt child, ſhall I never more behold you?"</p>
                     <p>Amanda was obliged to haſten from the room, to give vent to her emotions: ſhe ſobbed, ſhe wrung her hands, and in the bitterneſs of her ſoul exclaimed, "Alas! alas! I have returned too late to ſave him."</p>
                     <p>They ſoon after heard him ſtir. She requeſted Mrs. Bryne to go in, and cautiouſly inform him ſhe was come. She complied, and in a moment Amanda heard him ſay, "Thank heaven, my darling is returned."</p>
                     <p>"You may now go in, Miſs," ſaid Mrs. Bryne, coming from the room.</p>
                     <p>Amanda went in; her father was raiſed in the bed; his arms were extended to receive her; ſhe threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into them; language was denied them both, but tears, even more expreſſive than words, evinced their feelings. Fitzalan firſt recovered his voice, "My pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er," ſaid he, is granted; heaven has reſtored my child,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:038416_0390_1011E4866EE83D60"/>
to ſmooth the pillow of ſickneſs, and ſooth the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of exiſtence."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my father," cried Amanda, "have pity on me, and mention not thoſe moments; exert yourſelf for your child; who in this wide world, has ſhe but thee to comfort, ſupport and befriend her?"</p>
                     <p>"Indeed," ſaid he, "for your ſake I wiſh they may be far diſtant."</p>
                     <p>He held her at a little diſtance from him; he ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her face, her form; her altered complexion, her fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len features, appeared to ſhock him; he claſped her again to his boſom. "The world, my child, I fear," cried he, "has uſed thee moſt unkindly."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! moſt cruelly," ſobbed Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Then, my girl, let the reflection of that world, where innocence and virtue will meet a proper reward, conſole you:—Here they are often permitted to be tried; but as gold is tried and purified by fire, ſo are they by adverſity. "Thoſe whom God loves, he chaſtiſes."—Let this idea give you patience and fortitude, under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trial; never forego your dependence on him, though calamity ſhould purſue you to the very brink of the grave; but be comforted by the aſſurance he has given, that thoſe who meekly bear the croſs he lays upon them, ſhall be rewarded: that he will wipe away all tears from their eyes, and ſwallow up death in victory.</p>
                     <p>"Though a ſoldier from my youth, and accuſtomed to all the licentiouſneſs of camps, I never forgot my Creator, and I now find the benefit of not having done ſo; now when my friends deſert, the world frowns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; when ſickneſs and ſorrow have overwhelmed me, religion ſtands me in good ſtead; conſoles me for what I loſt, and ſoftens the remembrance of the paſt, by preſenting proſpects of future brightneſs."</p>
                     <p>So ſpoke Fitzalan the pious ſentiments of his ſoul and they calmed the agitations of Amanda. He found her clothes were wet, and inſiſted on her changing them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly. In the bundle the good Eleanor gave her, was a change of linen, and a cotton wrapper, which ſhe now put on, in a ſmall cloſet, or rather ſhed, adjoining her
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:038416_0391_1011E48A36A6B900"/>
father's room. A good fire was made up, a better light brought in, and ſome bread and wine from a ſmall cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board in the room, which contained Fitzalan's things, ſet before her, of which he made her immediately par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. He took a glaſs of wine himſelf from her, and tried to cheer her ſpirits. "He had been daily expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her arrival," he ſaid, "and had had a pallet and bed clothes kept airing for her; he hoped ſhe would not be diſſatisfied with ſleeping in the cloſet."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! my father," ſhe cried, "can you aſk your daughter ſuch a queſtion?" She expreſt her fears of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring him, by having diſturbed his repoſe. "No," he ſaid, "it was a delightful interruption; it was a relief from pain and anxiety."</p>
                     <p>"Lord Cherbury," he informed her, had written him a letter, which pierced him to the ſoul. He accuſed me," ſaid he, "of endeavouring to promote a marriage between you and Lord Mortimer: of treacherouſly try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to counteract his views, and take advantage of his unſuſpecting friendſhip. I was ſhocked at theſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but how excrutiating would my anguiſh have been had I really deſerved them. I ſoon determined upon the conduct I ſhould adopt, which was to deny the juſtice of his charges, and reſign his agency; for any farther deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with a man, who could think me capable of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or duplicity, was not to be thought of. My accounts were always in a ſtate to allow me to reſign at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's warning. It was my intention to go to England, put them into Lord Cherbury's hands, and take my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda from a place, where ſhe might meet with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities as little merited by her, as thoſe her father had received, were by him. A ſudden and dreadful diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which I am convinced the agitation of my mind brought on, prevented my executing this intention. I wrote however, to his lordſhip, acquainting him with my reſignation of his agency, and tranſmitting my accounts and arrears. I ſent a letter to you at the ſame time, with a ſmall remittance, for your immediate return, and then retired from the Caſtle, for I felt a longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in it, would degrade me to the character of a mean

dependant, and intimate a hope of being re-inſtated in my former ſtation; which, ſhould Lord Cherbury now offer I ſhould reject, for ignoble muſt be the mind which could accept of favours from thoſe who doubted its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. Againſt ſuch conduct my feelings revolt; poverty, to me, is mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Amanda perceived her father knew nothing of her ſufferings, but ſuppoſed her return occaſioned by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſhe therefore reſolved, if poſſible, not to undeceive him, at leaſt till his health was better.</p>
                     <p>The night was far advanced, and her father who ſaw her ill, and almoſt ſinking with fatigue, requeſted her to retire to reſt; ſhe accordingly did. Her bed was made up in the little cloſet; Mrs. Bryne aſſiſted her to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and brought her a bowl of whey, which ſhe truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a comfortable ſleep, would carry off her feveriſh ſymptoms, and enable her to be her father's nurſe.</p>
                     <p>Her reſt, however, was far from being comfortable; it was broken by horrid dreams, in which ſhe beheld the pale and emaciated figure of her father, ſuffering the moſt exquiſite tortures: and when ſhe ſtarted from theſe dreams, ſhe heard his deep moans, which were like dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers going through her heart. She aroſe once or twice, ſuppoſing him in pain; but when ſhe went to his bed, ſhe found him aſleep, and was convinced, from that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, his pain was more of the mental than the bodily kind. She felt extremely ill; her bones were ſore from the violent motion of the carriage, and ſhe fancied reſt would do her good; but when, towards morning, ſhe was inclined to take ſome, ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely prevented by the noiſe the children made on riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Fearful of neglecting her father, ſhe aroſe ſoon after herſelf, but was ſcarcely able to put on her clothes, from exceſſive weakneſs. She found him in bed, but awake. He welcomed her with a languid ſmile, and extending his hand, which was reduced to mere ſkin and bone, ſaid, "that joy was a greater enemy to repoſe than grief, and had broken his earlier than uſual that morning."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="200" facs="unknown:038416_0393_1011E4BBBAE72D88"/>
He made her ſit down by him: he gazed on her with unutterable tenderneſs: "in divine language," cried he, "I may ſay, let me ſee thy countenance; let me hear thy voice: but ſweet is thy voice, and thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is comely, and my ſoul has pleaſure in gazing on it."</p>
                     <p>The kettle was already boiling; he had procured a few neceſſaries for himſelf, ſuch as tea-things and glaſſes. Amanda placed the tea-table by the bed ſide, and gave him his breakfaſt. Whilſt receiving it from her, his eyes were raiſed to heaven, as if in thankful gratitude for the ineſtimable bleſſing he ſtill poſſeſſed in ſuch a child. After breakfaſt, he ſaid he would riſe, and Amanda retired into the garden till he was dreſt, if that could deſerve the appellation, which was only a ſlip of ground, planted with cabbages and potatoes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with looſe ſtones and blackberry buſhes. The ſpring was already advanced; the day was fine: the light and fleecy clouds were gradually diſperſing, and the ſky, almoſt as far as the eye could reach, was of a clear blue. The duſky green of the blackberry buſhes, was enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the pale purple of their bloſſoms; tufts of prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſes grew beneath their ſhelter; the fields, which roſe with a gentle ſwell above the garden, were covered with a vivid green, ſpangled with daiſies, buttercups, and wild honey-ſuckles; and the birds, as they fluttered from ſpray to ſpray, with notes of gladneſs hailed the genial ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>But neither the ſeaſon, nor its charms, could now, as heretofore, delight Amanda; ſhe felt forlorn and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate; deprived of the comforts of life, and no longer intereſted in the objects about her, ſhe ſat down upon a ſtone at the end of the garden, and ſhe thought the freſh breeze from the ſea cooled the feeveriſh heat of her blood. "Alas!" ſhe ſaid to herſelf, at this ſeaſon laſt year, how different was my ſituation from the preſent; though not in affluence, neither was ſhe then in abſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; and ſhe had beſides the comfortable hope of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her father's difficulties removed; like Burn's moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the ſtorm, becauſe ſhe thought that ſtorm would ſoon be o'erblown; but now ſhe ſaw herſelf on the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finally cruſhed beneath the rude preſſure of poverty."</p>
                     <p>She recollected the words which had eſcaped her when ſhe laſt ſaw Tudor Hall, and ſhe thought they were dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by ſomething like a prophetic ſpirit. She had then ſaid, as ſhe leaned upon a little gate which looked into the domain, "when theſe woods again glow with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation; when every ſhade reſounds with harmony, and the flowers and the bloſſoms ſpread their foliage to the ſun, ah! ah where will Amanda be? far diſtant, in all probability, from theſe delightful ſhades; perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and forgotten by their maſter."</p>
                     <p>She was indeed far diſtant from them; deſerted, and if not forgotten, at leaſt only remembered with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by their maſter; remembered with contempt by Lord Mortimer. It was an idea of intolerable anguiſh; his name was no more repeated as a charm to ſooth her grief; his idea increaſed her miſery.</p>
                     <p>She continued indulging her melancholy meditations, till informed by one of the children, the Captain was ready to receive her. She haſtened in, and found him in an old high-backed chair, and the ravages of care and ſickneſs were now more viſible to her than they had been the night before: he was reduced to a mere ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; "the original brightneſs of his form" was quite gone, and he ſeemed already on the very brink of the grave. The agony of Amanda's feelings was expreſt on her countenance: he perceived and gueſt its ſource. He endeavoured to compoſe and comfort her. She men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a phyſician; he tried to diſſuade her from the idea of bringing one, but ſhe beſought him, in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to her, to conſent, and overcome by her earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he at laſt promiſed the enſuing day ſhe ſhould do as ſhe wiſhed.</p>
                     <p>It was now Sunday, and he deſired the ſervice of the lay to be read. A ſmall bible lay on the table before him, and Amanda complied with his deſire. In the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to me, and I will be their father." The tears guſhed from Fitzalan; he laid his hand, which appeared convulſed with agitation, on the book. "Oh! what words of comfort," cried he, "are theſe; what tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port do they convey to the heart of a parent burthened with anxiety?—yes, merciful power, I will, with grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful joy, commit my children to thy care, for thou art the friend who will never forſake them." He deſired Amanda to proceed; her voice was weak and broken, and the tears, in ſpite of her efforts to reſtrain them, ſtole down her cheeks.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe had concluded, her father drew her towards him, and inquired into all that had paſt during her ſtay in London. She related to him, without reſerve, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious incidents ſhe had met with, previous to her going to the Marchioneſs's; acknowledged the hopes and fears ſhe experienced on Lord Mortimer's account, and the arguments he had made uſe of, to induce her to a cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine union, with her poſitive refuſal to ſuch a ſtep.</p>
                     <p>A beam of pleaſure illumined the pallid face of Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan; "you acted," ſaid he, "as I expected, and I glory in my child, and feel more indignation than ever againſt Lord Cherbury, for his mean ſuſpicions." Amanda was convinced thoſe ſuſpicions had been infuſed into his mind by thoſe who had ſtruck at her peace and fame. This idea, however, as well as their injuries to her, ſhe meant, if poſſible, to conceal. When her father, therefore, deſired her to proceed in her narrative, her voice began to faulter, her mind became diſturbed, and her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance betrayed her agitation. The remembrance of the dreadful ſcenes ſhe had gone through at the Marchion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs's, made her involuntarily ſhudder, and ſhe wiſhed to conceal them for ever from her father, but found it impoſſible to evade his minute and earneſt inquiries.</p>
                     <p>"Gracious heaven," ſaid he, on hearing them, "what complicated cruelty and deceit! inhuman monſters! to have no pity on one ſo young, ſo innocent, ſo helpleſs; the hand of ſorrow has indeed preſt heavy on thee my child; but after the Marchioneſs's former conduct, I cannot be ſurpriſed at any action of her's</p>

He gave her a note to diſcharge her debt to Howell, and begged ſhe would immediately write, and return his grateful acknowledgments for his benevolence. She feared he inconvenienced himſelf by parting with the note, but he aſſured her he could ſpare it extremely well, as he had been an economiſt, and had ſtill ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent money to ſupport them a few months longer in their preſent ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Amanda now enquired when he had heard from her brother; ſhe ſaid he had not anſwered her laſt letter, and that his ſilence had made her very uneaſy.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! poor Oſcar," exclaimed Fitzalan, "he has not been exempt from his portion of diſtreſs."</p>
                     <p>He took a letter, as he ſpoke, from his pocket book, and preſented it to Amanda. She opened it with a trembling hand, and read as follows:</p>

                           <p>Particular circumſtances prevented my anſwering your laſt letter as ſoon as I could have wiſhed; and indeed, the intelligence I have to communicate, makes me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt averſe to write at all. As my ſituation, however, muſt ſooner or later be known to you, I think it better to inform you of it myſelf, as I can, at the ſame time, reconcile you, I truſt, in ſome degree to it, by aſſuring you I bear it patiently, and that it has not been cauſed by any action which can degrade my character, as a man or a ſoldier. I have long, indeed, had a powerful enemy to cope with, and it will not doubt, ſurpriſe you to hear, that that enemy is Colonel Belgrave. An interference in the cauſe of humanity provoked his inſolence and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity; neither his words nor looks were bearable, and I was irritated by them to ſend him a challenge; had I reflected, the probable conſequences of ſuch a ſtep muſt have occurred, and prevented my taking it; but paſſion blinded my reaſon, and in yielding to its dictates, do I hold myſelf alone culpable throughout the whole affair. I gave him the opportunity his malicious heart had long deſired, of working my ruin. I was, by his order, put under an immediate arreſt. A court martial was held,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:038416_0397_1011E4914FBB4860"/>
and I was broke, for diſreſpect to a ſuperior officer; but it was imagined by the whole corps, I ſhould have been reſtored. I however knew too much of Belgrave's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to believe this would be the caſe; but never ſhall he triumph in the diſtreſs he has cauſed, by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing it. I have already ſettled on the courſe I ſhall purſue, and ere this letter reaches you, I ſhall have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my native kingdom. Forgive me, my dear Sir, for not conſulting you relative to my conduct; but I feared, if I did, your tenderneſs would interfere to prevent it, or lead you to diſtreſs yourſelf on my account; and to think that you, and my dear ſiſter, were deprived of the ſmalleſt comfort by my means, would be a ſource of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable anguiſh to me. Bleſt as I am with youth, health and fortitude, I have no doubt but I ſhall make my way through the rugged path of life extremely well. A parting viſit I avoided, from the certainty of its being painful for us both. I ſhall write as ſoon as I reach my place of deſtination. I rejoice to hear Amanda is ſo happily ſituated with Lady Greyſtock; may your ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and her merit be rewarded as they deſerve. Suffer not, I entreat, too tender an anxiety for my intereſt to diſturb your repoſe.

                     <p>Johnaten and Kate called in the courſe of the day, to know if they could be of any ſervice to Fitzalan. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda engaged Johnaten to go to town the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a phyſician, and gave Kate the key of a ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, where ſhe had left ſome things, which ſhe deſired her to pack up, and ſend to the cabin in the evening.—Mrs. Bryne gave them one of her fowls for dinner, and Fitzalan aſſumed an appearance of cheerfulneſs, and the evening wore away ſomewhat better than the preceding part of the day had done.</p>
                     <p>Johnaten was punctual in obeying Amanda's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and brought a phyſician the next morning to the cabin. Fitzalan appeared much worſe, and Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da rejoiced that ſhe had been reſolute in procuring him advice.</p>
                     <p>She withdrew from the room ſoon after the phyſician had entered it, and waited without in trembling anxiety for his appearance.</p>
                     <p>When he came out, ſhe aſked, with a faultering voice, his opinion, and beſought him not to deceive her, from pity to her feelings.</p>
                     <p>He ſhook his head, and aſſured her he would not devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from truth for the world; "The Captain was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in a tickliſh ſituation," he ſaid, "but the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines he had ordered, and ſea bathing, he doubted not would ſet all to rights; it was fortunate," he added, "ſhe delayed no longer ſending for him;" mentioned twenty miraculous cures he had performed: admired the immenſe fine proſpect before the door, and wiſhed her good morning, with what he thought quite a degagee, and irreſiſtible air.</p>
                     <p>She was willing to believe his aſſurances of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's recovery, as the drowning wretch will graſp at every ſtraw: ſhe eage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

wanting to him; and would have ſat up with him at night, had he not poſitively inſiſted on her going to bed.</p>
                     <p>The medicines he was ordered, he received from her hands, but with a look which ſeemed to expreſs his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their inefficacy. All, however, ſhe wiſhed him to do, he did, and often raiſed his eyes to heaven, as to implore it to reward her care, and yet a little longer ſpare him to this beloved child, whoſe happineſs ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the prolongation of his exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Four days paſt heavily away, and the aſſurances of the phyſician, who was punctual in his attendance, loſt their effect upon Amanda.</p>
                     <p>Her father was conſiderably altered for the worſe, and unable to riſe, except for a few minutes in the evening, to have his bed made. He complained of no pain or ſickneſs, but ſeemed ſinking beneath an eaſy and gradual decay. It was only at intervals he could converſe with his daughter. His converſation was then calculated to ſtrengthen her fortitude and reſignation, and prepare her for an approaching melancholy event. Whenever ſhe received a hint of it, her agony was inexpreſſible; but pity for her feelings could not prevent her father from uſing every opportunity that occurred, for laying down rules and precepts, which might be ſerviceable to her when without a guide or protector. Sometimes he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the paſt, but this was only done to make her more cautious of the future.</p>
                     <p>He charged her to avoid any further intimacy with Lord Mortimer, as an eſſential meaſure for the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her peace, and preſervation of her fame, and the removal of Lord Cherbury's unjuſt ſuſpicions, who will find, at laſt, continued he, how much he wronged me, and may, perhaps, feel compunction, when beyond his power to make reparation.</p>
                     <p>To all he deſired, Amanda promiſed a religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance; ſhe thought it unneceſſary in him, indeed, to deſire her to avoid Lord Mortimer, convinced as ſhe was, that he had utterly abandoned her; but the grief this deſertion occaſioned, ſhe believed, ſhe ſhould ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, was her father once reſtored to health, for then
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:038416_0400_1011E4994D352638"/>
ſhe would have no time for uſeleſs regrets or retroſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but be obliged to paſs every hour in active exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for his ſupport and comfort.</p>
                     <p>A week paſt away in this manner at the cabin: a week of wretchedneſs to Amanda, who perceived her father growing weaker and weaker.</p>
                     <p>She aſſiſted him, as uſual, to riſe one evening, for a few minutes; when dreſt, he complained of an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his breathing, and deſired to be ſupported to the air. Amanda, with difficulty, led him to the window, which ſhe opened, and ſeated him by it; then knelt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and putting her arms round his waiſt, faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her eyes with anxious tenderneſs upon his face.</p>
                     <p>The evening was ſerenely fine; the ſun was ſetting in all its glory, and the ſea, illumined by its parting beams, looked like a ſheet of burniſhed ſilver.</p>
                     <p>"What a lovely ſcene," cried Fitzalan, faintly, "with what majeſty does the ſun retire from the world: the calmneſs which attends its departure is ſuch, I think, as muſt attend the exit of a good man."</p>
                     <p>He pauſed for a few minutes, then raiſing his eyes to heaven, exclaimed, "Merciful power! had it pleaſed thee, I could have wiſhed yet a little longer to have been ſpared to this young creature; but thy will, not mine, be done; confiding in thy mercy, I leave her with ſome degree of fortitude.</p>
                     <p>Amanda's tears began to flow as he ſpoke; he raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand on which they fell, and kiſſing them off, exclaimed, "Precious drops: my Amanda, weep not too bitterly for me; like a weary traveller, think that reſt muſt now be acceptable to me."</p>
                     <p>She interrupted him, and conjured him to change the diſcourſe. He ſhook his head mournfully; preſt her hands between his, and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"Yet a little longer, my child, bear with it;" then bid her aſſure her brother, whenever they met, which he truſted and believed would be ſoon, he had his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's bleſſing; "the only legacy," he cried, "I can leave him: but one, I am cofident, he merits, and will value; to you, my girl, I have no doubt he will prove
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:038416_0401_1011E49D0EA47960"/>
a friend and guardian; you may both, perhaps, be amply recompenſed for all your ſorrows. Providence is juſt in all its dealings, and may yet render the lovely offspring of my Malvina truly happy."</p>
                     <p>He appeared exhauſted by ſpeaking, and Amanda aſſiſted him to lie down, entreating him, at the ſame time to take ſome drops. He conſented, and while ſhe was pouring them out at a little table, her back to the bed, ſhe heard a deep groan: the bottle dropt from her hand, ſhe ſprang to the bed, and perceived her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lying ſenſeleſs on the pillow. She imagined he had fainted, and ſcreamed out for aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>The woman of the cabin, her huſband and mother, all ruſhed into the room; he was raiſed up, his temples and hands chafed, and every remedy within the houſe applied, for his recovery—but in vain—his ſpirit had forſaken its tenement of clay forever.</p>
                     <p>Amanda, when convinced of this, wrung her hands together, then ſuddenly opening them, ſhe claſped the lifeleſs body to her breaſt, and ſunk fainting beſide it.</p>

                     <p>SHE remained a conſiderable time in a ſtate of inſenſibility, and, when recovered, ſhe found herſelf in a bed lain upon the floor, in a corner of the outſide room; her ſenſes were at firſt confuſed, ſhe felt as if waking from a diſagreeable dream, but in a few minutes a perfect recollection of what had paſt returned, ſhe ſaw ſome one ſitting by the bed; ſhe raiſed herſelf a little, and perceived ſiſter Mary: "This is indeed a charitable viſit," cried ſhe, extending her hand, and ſpeaking in a low broken voice. The good natured nun jumped from her ſeat on hearing her ſpeak, and embraced her moſt tenderly. Her careſſes affected Amanda inexpreſſibly: ſhe dropped her head upon her breaſt and wept with a vehemence which relieved the oppreſſion of her heart.</p>
                     <p>Siſter Mary ſaid, ſhe had never heard of her return to the country till Mrs. Bryne came to St. Catherine's for a few ſprigs of Roſemary to ſtrew over the poor Captain; ſhe had returned with her then to the cabin to try if ſhe could be of any ſervice, and to invite her, in the name of the prioreſs and the whole ſiſterhood, to the convent.</p>
                     <p>Amanda thanked her for her kind invitation, which, ſhe ſaid, ſhe muſt decline accepting for a few days, till ſhe had performed all her duties, which, in a voice half ſtifled by ſobs, ſhe added, "the grave would ſoon termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; ſhe was ſorry," ſhe ſaid, "that they had undreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038416_0404_1011E4A550DBEEE8"/>
her, and requeſted ſiſter Mary to aſſiſt her in putting on her clothes." The ſiſter tried to diſſuade her from this, but ſoon found ſhe was determined to ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the night in her father's apartment: She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly dreſſed her, for Amanda's trembling hands refuſed their accuſtomed office, and made her take a glaſs of wine and water ere ſhe ſuffered her to move towards the door. Amanda was aſtoniſhed, as ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached it, to hear a violent noiſe, like the mingled ſounds of laughing and ſinging; her ſoul recoiled at the tumult, and ſhe aſked ſiſter Mary, with a countenance of terror, "what it meant?" She replied, "It was only ſome friends and neighbours doing honour to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain." Amanda haſtily opened the door anxious to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the ſuſpence theſe words occaſioned; but how great was her horror when ſhe perceived a ſet of the meaneſt ruſtics aſſembled round the bed, with every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of inebriety, laughing, ſhouting and ſmoking: What a ſavage ſcene for a child, whoſe heart was burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with grief! She ſhrieked with horror, and flinging herſelf into the arms of ſiſter Mary, conjured her to have the room cleared.</p>
                     <p>Siſter Mary, from being accuſtomed to ſuch ſcenes, felt neither horror nor diſguſt; ſhe complied, however, with the requeſt of Amanda, and beſought them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, ſaying, "that Miſs Fitzalan was a ſtranger to their cuſtoms, and beſides, poor thing, quite beſide herſelf with grief." They began to grumble at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of removing, they had made preparations for ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a merry night, and Mrs. Bryne ſaid, "if ſhe had thought things would have turned out in this way, "The captain might have found ſome other place to die in—for the leaſt one could have, after his giving them ſo much trouble, was a little enjoyment with one's friends at the latter end." Johnaten and Kate, who were among the party, joined their entreaties to ſiſter Mary's, and ſhe, to tempt them to compliance, ſaid, "that in all probability they would ſoon have another and a better opportunity for making merry than the preſent." They at length retired, and ſiſter Mary and Amanda were left alone in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038416_0405_1011E4A7B89B8420"/>
the chamber of death. The dim light which remained caſt a glimmering ſhade upon the face of Fitzalan, that added to its ghaſtlileſs; Amanda now indulged in all the luxury of grief, and found in ſiſter Mary a truly ſympathetic friend, for the good nun was famed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the little circle of her acquaintance for weeping with thoſe that wept, and rejoicing with thoſe that rejoiced. She obtained a promiſe from Amanda of accompanying her to St. Catherine's as ſoon as her father was interred; and in return for this ſhe gave an aſſurance of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her till the laſt melancholy offices were over, and alſo, that, with the aſſiſtance of Johnaten, ſhe would ſee every thing proper provided; this was ſome comfort to Amanda, who felt herſelf at preſent une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to any exertion; yet, notwithſtanding her fatigue and illneſs, ſhe perſevered in her reſolution of ſitting up with her father every night, dreading that, if ſhe retired to bed, a ſcene of riot would again enſue, which, in her opinion, was ſacrilege to the dead. She went to bed every morning, and was nurſed with the moſt tender at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention by ſiſter Mary, who alſo inſiſted on being her companion at night. This, however, was but a mere matter of form, for the good ſiſter was totally unable to keep her eyes open, and ſlept as comfortably upon the earthen floor, with her gown made into a pillow for her head, as if laid upon down; then was poor Amanda left to her own reflections, and the melancholy contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of her beloved father's remains. The evening of the fourth day after his deceaſe was fixed upon for his interment; with ſtreaming eyes and a breaking heart, Amanda beheld him put into the coffin, and in that moment felt as if he had again died before her.

ſword upon the coffin. Amanda by the moſt painful efforts, ſupported the preparations for his removal; but when ſhe ſaw the coffin actually raiſed to be taken out, ſhe could no longer reſtrain her feelings; ſhe ſhrieked in the agony of her ſoul, a ſickneſs, almoſt deadly ſeized her, and ſhe fell fainting upon ſiſter Mary's boſom!</p>

                     <p>SISTER MARY, recovered her with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but found it impoſſible to remove her from the cabin till ſhe was more compoſed. In about two hours its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants returned, and the car having arrived, which ſhe had ordered to convey Amanda to St. Catherine's, ſhe was placed upon it in a ſtate ſcarcely animate, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſiſter Mary, was conveyed to that peaceful aſylum.</p>
                     <p>On arriving at it, ſhe was carried immediately into the prioreſs's apartment, who received and welcomed her with the moſt tender affection and ſenſibility—a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which rouſed Amanda from the ſtupefaction into which ſhe appeared ſinking, and made her weep violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. She felt relieved from doing ſo, and, as ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for the kindneſs ſhe received, endeavoured to appear benefited by it; ſhe therefore declined going to bed, but lay down upon a little matted couch in the prioreſs's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>She arrived on the eve of their patron Saint at the convent, which was always celebrated with ſolemnity: after tea, therefore, the prioreſs and ſiſter Mary, were compel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed to repair to the chapel, but ſhe removed the reluctance they felt to leave her alone by complaining of being drowſy. A pillow being laid under her head by ſiſter Mary, ſoon after they quitted her ſhe fell into a profound ſlumber, in which ſhe continued till awoke by diſtant muſic, ſo ſoft, ſo clear, ſo harmonious, that the delightful ſenſations it gave her ſhe could only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to thoſe which ſhe imagined a diſtreſſed and penſive ſoul would feel, when ſpringing from the ſhackles of mortality, it firſt heard the heavenly ſounds that wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed it to the realms of eternal bliſs.</p>
                     <p>The chapel, from which thoſe celeſtial ſounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, was at the extremity of the houſe, ſo that they ſometimes ſwelled upon her ear, ſometimes faintly ſunk upon it. The pauſes in the organ, which was finely played, were filled up by the ſweet, though leſs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtrains of the ſiſterhood, who ſung an hymn in honour of their Saint.

"Gracious Heaven! what can have brought Lord Mortimer hither?"</p>
                     <p>He made no reply, but kneeling before her, took her hands in his and preſſed them to his forehead and lips, and laid his head upon them.</p>
                     <p>"Why," cried Amanda, unutterably affected by the emotions he betrayed, "why my Lord are you come hither!"</p>
                     <p>"To try," he replied, in a voice ſcarcely articulate, "whether Miſs Fitzalan will yet conſider me as her friend?"</p>
                     <p>"That my Lord," ſaid ſhe, "depends upon circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but while your Lordſhip remains in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſition, what they are I cannot explain."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer inſtantly aroſe, and ſeated himſelf by her; "Now tell me," ſaid he, "what thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are."</p>
                     <p>"The firſt, my Lord, is to exculpate my father in the opinion of Lord Cherbury, and by declaring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement and progreſs of our acquaintance, eradicate from his Lordſhip's mind the injurious ſuſpicions he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained againſt him. This, perhaps, you will ſay is uſeleſs, conſidering thoſe ſuſpicions can no longer wound him; but my Lord, I deem it an incumbent duty on me to remove from his memory the obloquy on my account caſt on it."</p>
                     <p>"I promiſe you moſt ſolemnly," ſaid Lord Mortimer, "you ſhall be obeyed. This is a debt of juſtice, which I had reſolved to pay ere I received your injunction for doing ſo; it is but lately I heard of the unjuſt charges made againſt him; nor do I know what fiend gave riſe to them."</p>
                     <p>"The ſame, perhaps," exclaimed Amanda, "who ſpread ſuch complicated ſnares for my deſtruction, and involved me in every horror but that which proceeds from conſcious guilt. Oh! my Lord, the ſecond cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance I allude to is, if you ſhould hear my name treated with ſcorn and contempt by thoſe few, thoſe very few whom I had reaſon to eſteem, and to believe eſteemed me, that you will kindly interpoſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038416_0409_1011E4B2A93F4F98"/>
in my juſtification, and ſay, I merited not the aſperſions caſt upon me. Believe me innocent, and you will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuade others I am ſo. You ſhake your head, as much as to ſay you cannot think me ſo after the proofs you have ſeen to the contrary. Ah! my Lord the proofs were contrived by malice and treachery, to ruin me in the eſtimation of my friends, and by perfidy to force me into a crime, of which I already bear the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and ſtigma. Surely in this ſolemn hour, which has ſeen my beloved father conſigned to his kindred earth, when, with a mind harraſſed by ſorrow, and a body worn out with fatigue, I feel as if ſtanding on the verge of the grave, I ſhould be the moſt abandoned of wretches, if I could aſſert my innocence without the conſciouſneſs of really poſſeſſing it: No, my Lord, by ſuch a falſhood I ſhould not only be wicked, but fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh in depriving myſelf of that happineſs hereafter, which will ſo fully recompence my preſent miſeries."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Amanda," cried Lord Mortimer, who had been walking backwards and forward in an agitated manner while ſhe ſpoke, "you would almoſt convince me againſt the evidence of my own ſenſes."</p>
                     <p>"Almoſt," ſhe repeated; then I ſee my Lord, you are determined to diſbelive me, but why, ſince ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt me, have you come hither, was it merely to be aſſured of my wretchedneſs? to hear me ſay that I ſtand alone in the world, without one being intereſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my welfare, that my preſent aſylum is beſtowed by charity, and that if my life be prolonged it muſt be ſpent in ſtruggling againſt conſtitution, ſorrow, and ill fame to procure a ſubſiſtence."</p>
                     <p>"No, no," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, flinging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her feet, "never ſhall you ſuffer ſuch miſery; were you even the being I was tempted to think you ſome time ago, never would Mortimer ſuffer the woman his heart doated on to feel ſuch calamity. I do not, I cannot believe you would deceive me. There is an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible eloquence in your words, that convinces me you have been the victim of treachery, and I its dupe: I cannot give you a more convincing proof of my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

                     <p>The reſolution which Amanda had forced to ſupport her through the painful ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ence ſhe gueſt would enſue the moment ſhe ſaw Lord Mortimer, now vaniſhed and burſt into a flood of tears.</p>
                     <p>She ſaw his conduct in the moſt generous, the moſt exalted light, notwithſtanding appearances were ſo much againſt her, he was willing to rely ſolely on her own aſſeveration of innocence, and to run every riſk on her account; that by an union he might ſhelter her from the diſtreſſes of her preſent ſituation: But while her ſenſibility was affected by his expreſſions, her pride was alarmed leſt he ſhould impute her ardent deſire of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating herſelf to the expectation of having his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes renewed. In broken accents ſhe endeavoured to remove ſuch an idea if it had ariſen, and to convince him that all further intimacy between them muſt now be terminated. Lord Mortimer aſcribed the latter part of her ſpeech to the reſentment ſhe felt againſt him for ever entertaining doubts of her worth. She deſired him to riſe, but he refuſed till he was forgiven. My forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is your's indeed, my Lord, ſaid ſhe, though your ſuſpicions wounded me to the ſoul; I can ſcarcely won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at your entertaining them, when I reflect on the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſituations in which I was found, which, if your Lordſhip can ſpare a little longer time, or deem it worth devoting to ſuch a purpoſe, as well as I am able I will account for being involved in.—Lord Mortimer declared his ardent deſire to hear thoſe particulars, which nothing but a fear of fatiguing or agitating her could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his before expreſſing. He then ſeated himſelf by her, and taking her cold and emaciated hand in his, li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>She briefly informed him of her father's reſiding in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

them in diſtreſs, when he found they not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted but reſented his villainous deſigns.</p>
                     <p>She related the artful manner in which Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock, had drawn her from her father's protection, and the cold and inſolent reception ſhe met from the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs and her daughter, when introduced by the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned lady; the enmity the Marchioneſs bore her father, the ſudden alteration in her behaviour, the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to her houſe, ſo unexpected and unneceſſary, all tending to inſpire a belief that ſhe was concerned in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving Colonel Belgrave's admittance to the houſe, and had alſo given Lord Cherbury reaſon to ſuſpect the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of her father.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer here interrupted Amanda to mention the converſation which paſſed between him and Mrs. Jane in the hall.</p>
                     <p>She raiſed her hands and eyes to heaven with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at ſuch wickedneſs, and ſaid, "Though ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expected the girl's integrity, from a certain ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant air, ſhe never imagined ſhe could be capable of ſuch baſeneſs.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer again interrupted her, to mention what Lady Greyſtock had told him concerning Mrs. Jennings, as alſo what the houſekeeper had ſaid of the note he gave for Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Good God!" ſaid Amanda, "when I hear of all the enemies I had, I almoſt wonder I eſcaped ſo well." She then reſumed her narrative, accounted for the diſlike Mrs. Jennings had to her, and explained the way in which ſhe was entrapped into Colonel Belgrave's power, ſhe almoſt miraculous manner in which ſhe was freed from his houſe, the friendſhip ſhe received from Howell, and the ſituation in which ſhe arrived at Caſtle Carber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and found her father. The cloſing ſcene ſhe could not deſcribe, for ſighs and ſobs impeded her utterance. Lord Mortimer gently folded her to his breaſt; he called her his dear, his unfortunate, his lovely girl, more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than ever to his heart, and declared he never again would quit her till ſhe had given him a right to eſpouſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

enemies. Her warm tears wet his cheek as ſhe exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "that could never be."</p>
                     <p>"My promiſe is already paſt," cried ſhe; that which was given to the living ſhall not be forfeited to the dead; and this, my Lord, by deſign, is the laſt time we muſt ever meet."</p>
                     <p>"What promiſe! "exclaimed Lord Mortimer, "ſurely no one could be ſo inhuman as to extort a promiſe from you to give me up."</p>
                     <p>"It was not inhumanity extorted it," replied Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da; "but honour, rectitude, and diſcretion, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting thoſe, never can I violate it. There is but one event could make me acquieſce in your wiſhes, that is, having a fortune adequate to yours to bring you, becauſe then Lord Cherbury would aſcribe no ſelfiſh motive to my conduct; but as ſuch an event is utterly improbable, I might almoſt ſay impoſſible, it is certain we never ſhall be united. Any farther intercouſe between us, you muſt therefore be convinced would injure me. Diſturb not, therefore, my Lord, my retirement; but ere you depart, allow me to aſſure you, you have lightened the weight on my heart by crediting what I have ſaid; ſhould I not recover from the illneſs which now preys upon me, it will cheer my departing ſpirit to know you think me innocent; and, if I live, it will ſupport me through many difficulties, and often, perhaps, after the toils of a buſy day, ſhall comfort myſelf by reflecting, that thoſe I eſteem, if they think of me, it is with their wonted regard."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was affected by the manner in which ſhe ſpoke, his eyes began to gliſten, and he was again declaring he would not ſuffer her to ſacrifice happineſs at the ſhrine of a too ſcrupulous and romantic generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when the door opened and the prioreſs and ſiſter Mary (who had been detained in the chapel by a long diſcourſe from the Prieſt) entered, bearing lights.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer ſtarted in much confuſion, retreated to one of the windows, and drew out his handkerchief to conceal the emotions Amanda had excited. She was unable to ſpeak to the prioreſs and ſiſter Mary, who
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038416_0413_1011D03C65EA0248"/>
ſtared round them, and then at each other, not certain whether they ſhould advance or retreat. Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in a few moments recovered his compoſure, and advancing to the prioreſs apologized for his intruſion into her apartment; but ſaid he had the honour of being a friend of Miſs Fitzalan's, and could not reſiſt his wiſh to enquiring in perſon after her health as ſoon as he arrived in the country.</p>
                     <p>The prioreſs, who had once ſeen a good deal of the polite world, received this addreſs with eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance. Siſter Mary went over to Amanda, and found her weak, trembling, and weeping. She expreſſed the utmoſt concern at ſeeing her in ſuch a ſituation, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately procured her a glaſs of wine, which ſhe inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her taking. The lights now gave Lord Mortimer an opportunity of contemplating the depredations which grief and ſickneſs had made upon her. Her pale and ſallow complexion, her heavy and ſunken eyes, ſtruck him with horror. He could not conceal his feelings.—"Gracious heaven," cried he, going to the couch, and taking her hand, "I fear you are very ill."</p>
                     <p>She looked mournfully in his face without ſpeaking; but this look was ſufficient to aſſure him he was not miſtaken. The efforts ſhe had made to converſe with him, and the yet greater efforts ſhe had made to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him for ever from her, quite exhauſted her: after the various miſeries ſhe had gone through, how ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her ſoul would have been the attentions of Lord Mortimer, how pleaſing, how delightful, the aſylum ſhe ſhould have found in his arms! But no temptation, no diſtreſs, ſhe reſolved ſhould ever make her diſobey the injunction of her adored father.</p>
                     <p>"She is very bad, indeed." Said ſiſter Mary, "and we muſt get her to bed as ſoon as poſſible."</p>
                     <p>"She requires reſt and repoſe indeed," ſaid Lord Mortimer; "but tell me, my dear Miſs Fitzalan," taking her hand, "if I have thoſe good ladies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for calling here to-morrow, will you, if able to riſe, ſee me?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="unknown:038416_0414_1011E4C103EAD690"/>
"I cannot indeed," ſaid Amanda "I have already declared this muſt be our laſt interview, and I ſhall not retract from what I have ſaid."</p>
                     <p>"Then," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, regardleſs, or rather forgetful of thoſe who heard him, from the agitation and warmth of his feelings, "I ſhall, in one reſpect at leaſt, accuſe you of diſſimulation, that of feigning a regard for me you never felt."</p>
                     <p>"Such an accuſation is now of little conſequence," replied Amanda; "perhaps you had better think it juſt."</p>
                     <p>"Cruel inexorable girl, to refuſe ſeeing me, to wiſh to have the anxiety which now preys upon my heart prolonged."</p>
                     <p>"Young man," ſaid the prioreſs, in an accent of diſpleaſure, ſeeing the tears ſtreaming down Amanda's cheeks, "reſpect her ſorrows."</p>
                     <p>"Reſpect them, madam," repeated he, "Oh! heaven, I reſpect, I venerate them; but will you, my dear lady, when Miſs Fitzalan is able, prevail on her to communicate the particulars of our acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and will you then become my advocate, and perſuade her to receive my viſits?"</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible Sir," ſaid the prioreſs, "I ſhall never attempt to deſire a larger ſhare of confidence from Miſs Fitzalan than ſhe deſires to beſtow upon me. From my knowledge of her I am convinced her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will always be guided by diſcretion; ſhe has greatly obliged me by chuſing this humble retreat for her reſidence; ſhe has put herſelf under my protection, and I ſhall endeavour to fulfil that ſacred truſt by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing her from any moleſtation."</p>
                     <p>"Well, madam," ſaid Lord Mortimer, "I flatter myſelf Miſs Fitzalan will do me juſtice in declaring my viſits proceeded from wiſhes which though ſhe may diſappoint, ſhe cannot diſapprove. I ſhall no longer intrude upon your time or her's, but will ſtill hope I ſhall find you both leſs inflexible."</p>
                     <p>He took up his hat, he approached the door; but when he glanced at Amanda, he could not depart without
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038416_0415_1011E4C2A73FCE48"/>
ſpeaking to her, and again went to the couch. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to compoſe and exert herſelf; he deſired her forgiveneſs for any warmth he had betrayed, and he whiſpered to her that all his earthly happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on her reſtoration to health, and her becoming his. He inſiſted on her now giving him her hand as a pledge of amity between them. She complied; but when preſuming on this he again aſked her conſent to repeat his viſits, he found her inexorable as ever, and retired, if not with a diſpleaſed, a diſappointed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Siſter Mary attended him from the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—At the door of the convent he requeſted her to walk a few paces from it with him, ſaying he wanted to ſpeak to her. She conſented, and remembering he was the perſon who frightened her one evening amongſt the ruins, determined now, if ſhe had an opportunity, to aſk what had then brought him hither."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer knew the poverty of the convent and feared Amanda might want many things, or its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants be diſtreſſed to procure them for her; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pulled out a purſe, and preſenting it to ſiſter Mary, requeſted ſhe would apply it for Miſs Fitzalan's uſe, without mentioning any thing about it to her."</p>
                     <p>Siſter Mary ſhook the purſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Oh! Jeſu Maria," exclaimed ſhe, "how heavy it is!"</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was retiring, when catching hold of him, ſhe cried, "ſtay, ſtay, I have a word or two to ſay to you: I wonder how much there is in this purſe?"</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer ſmiled.—"If not enough for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent emergencies," ſaid he, "it ſhall ſoon be repleniſhed."</p>
                     <p>Siſter Mary ſat down upon a tomb ſtone, and very deliberately counted the money into her lap, "Oh! mercy," ſaid ſhe, "I never ſaw ſo many guineas to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before in all my life!"</p>
                     <p>Again Lord Mortimer ſmiled, and was retiring, but again ſtopping him, ſhe returned the gold into the purſe, and declared, "ſhe neither would or durſt keep it."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was provoked at this declaration, and without replying to it walked on. She ran nimbly after
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038416_0416_1011E4C5F9D5C170"/>
him, and dropping the purſe at his feet, was out of ſight in a moment.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe returned to the prioreſs's apartment ſhe related the incident, and took much merit to herſelf for acting ſo prudently, the prioreſs commended her very much, and poor Amanda, with a faint voice, ſaid ſhe had acted quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IT will now be neceſſary to account for the ſudden appearance of Lord Mortimer at the convent. Our reader may recollect, that we left him in London, in the deepeſt affliction for the ſuppoſed perfidy of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda—an affliction which knew no diminution from time, neither the tenderneſs of his aunt, Lady Martha Dormer, or the kind conſideration his father ſhewed for him, who for the preſent ceaſed to importune him about Lady Euphraſia, could have any lenient effect upon him; he pined in thought, and felt a diſtaſte to all ſociety; he at laſt began to think, that though Amanda had been unhappily led aſtray, ſhe might ere this have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

without delay, to viſit Captain Fitzalan, and if ſhe was not returned to his protection, adviſe with him about ſome method of reſtoring her to it.</p>
                     <p>He told Lord Cherbury he thought an excurſion into Wales would be of ſervice to him. His Lordſhip agreed in thinking it might, and ſecretly delighted that all danger relative to Amanda was over, gladly concurred in whatever could pleaſe his ſon, flattering himſelf, that on his return to London, he would no longer raiſe any objections to an alliance with the fair Scotch heireſs.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer travelled with as much expedition to Holyhead, as if certain that perfect happineſs, not a ſmall alleviation of miſery, would be the recompence of his journey. He concealed from his aunt the real motives which actuated him to it, bluſhing, even, to himſelf, at the weakneſs which he ſtill felt relative to Amanda.</p>
                     <p>When he croſſed the water he again ſet off poſt, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on horſeback only by his own man; within one mile of Caſtle Carberry he met the little mournful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion approaching, which was attending poor Fitzalan to his laſt home. The carriage ſtopped to let them paſs, and in the laſt of the group he perceived Johnaten, who at the ſame moment recognized him.

                     <p>"Captain Fitzalan dead!" repeated Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, with a face as pale as death, and a faultering voice, while his heart ſunk within him at the idea that his father was in ſome degree acceſſary to the fatal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; for juſt before he left London Lord Cherbury had informed him of the letter he wrote to Fitzalan, and this he believed, joined to his own immediate family misfortunes, had precipitated him from the world.—"Captain Fitzalan dead!" he exclaimed.</p>

                     <p>"She was with him," ſaid Lord Mortimer, in an eager accent.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my Lord, ſhe returned here about ten days ago, but ſo ſadly altered, I think ſhe won't ſtay long behind him: Poor thing, ſhe is going faſt indeed, and the more's the pity, for ſhe is a ſweet creature."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was inexpreſſibly ſhocked; he wiſhed to hide his emotions, and waved his hand to Johnaten to depart; but Johnaten either did not, or would not, underſtand the motion, and he was obliged, in broken accents, to ſay, he would no longer detain him."</p>
                     <p>The return of Amanda was to him a convicton that ſhe had ſeen her error in its true light; he pictured to himſelf the affecting ſcene which muſt have enſued between a dying father and a penitent daughter, ſo loved, ſo valued as was Amanda.—Her ſituation, when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his forgiveneſs and benediction, he repreſented her to himſelf as at once bewailing the loſs of her father, and her offences, endeavouring, by prayers, by tears, by ſighs, to obliterate them in the ſight of heaven, and render herſelf ſit to receive its awful fiat.</p>
                     <p>He heard ſhe was dying; his ſoul recoiled at the idea of ſeeing her ſhrouded in her native clay, and yet he could not help believing this the only peaceful aſylum ſhe could find, to be freed from the ſhafts of contempt and malice of the world. He trembled leſt he ſhould not behold the lovely penitent while ſhe was capable of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving him; to receive a laſt adieu, though dreadful, would yet, he thought, lighten the horrors of an eternal ſeparation, and perhaps too, it would be ſome comfort to her departing ſpirit to know from him he had pardoned her, and conſcious ſurely, he thought to himſelf, ſhe muſt be of needing pardon from him, whom ſhe had ſo long impoſed on by a ſpecious pretext of virtue. He had heard from Lord Cherbury, that Captain Fitzalan had
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038416_0419_1011E4CED301FB68"/>
quitted the Caſtle; he knew not therefore at preſent where to find Amanda, nor did he chuſe to make any enquiries till he again ſaw Johnaten.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the proceſſion was out of ſight he alighted from the carriage, and ordering his man to diſcharge it, on arriving at Caſtle Carberry, he took a path acroſs the fields, which brought him to the ſide of the church-yard where Fitzalan was to be interred.</p>
                     <p>He reached it juſt as the coffin was lowering into the earth, a yew tree growing by the wall againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> he leaned, hid him from obſervation. He heard ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y of the ruſtics mentioning the merits of the deceaſed, in terms of warm, though artleſs, commendation, and he ſaw Johnaten receiving the hat and ſword, which, as military trophies, he had lain upon the coffin, with a flood of tears.</p>
                     <p>When the church-yard was cleared, he ſtepped acroſs the broken wall to the ſilent manſion of Fitzalan; the ſcene was wild and dreary, and a lowering evening ſeemed in uniſon with the ſad objects around. Lord Mortimer was ſunk in the deepeſt deſpondence; he felt awfully convinced of the inſtability of human attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the vanity of human purſuits, not only from the ceremony he had juſt witneſſed, but his own ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the fond hopes of his heart, the gay expectations of his youth, and the hilarity of his ſoul were blaſted—never, he feared, to revive. Virtue, rank and fortune, advantages ſo highly prized by mankind, were unable to give him comfort, to remove the malady of his heart, to adminiſter one oblivious antidote to a mind diſeaſed.</p>
                     <p>"Peace to thy ſhade, thou unfortunate ſoldier," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he, after ſtanding ſome time by the grave with folded arms: "Peace to thy ſhade—peace which ſhall reward thee for a life of toil and trouble; happy ſhould I have deemed myſelf, had it been my lot to have light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened thy grief, or cheared thy cloſing hours; but thoſe who were dearer to thee than exiſtence I may yet ſerve, and thus make the only attonement now in my power for the injuſtice I fear was done thee; thy Amanda, and thy

gallant ſon, ſhall be my care, and his path, I truſt, it will be in my power, to ſmooth through life."</p>
                     <p>A tear fell from Lord Mortimer upon the grave, and he turned mournfully from it towards Caſtle Carberry. Here Johnaten was arrived before him, and had already a large fire lighted in the dreſſing room poor Amanda, on coming to the Caſtle, had choſen for herſelf. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aten fixed on this for Lord Mortimer, as the parlours had been ſhut up ever ſince Capt. Fitzalan's departure, and could not be put in order till the next day; but it was the worſt place Lord Mortimer could have entered, as not only itſelf but every thing in it reminded him of Amanda, and the grief it excited at his firſt entrance was ſo violent as to alarm not only his man (who was ſpreading a table with refreſhments) but Johnaten, who was aſſiſting him. He ſoon checked it, however; but when he again looked round the room and beheld it orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by works done by Amanda, he could ſcarcely prevent another burſt of grief as violent as the firſt.</p>
                     <p>He now learned Amanda's reſidence, and ſo great was his impatience to ſee her, that, apprehenſive the convent would ſoon be cloſed, he ſet off, fatigued as he was, without taking any refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>He intended to aſk for one of the ladies of St. Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, and intreat her, if Amanda was then in a ſituation to be ſeen, to announce his arrival to her; but after rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping repeatedly with a rattan againſt the door, the only perſon who appeared to him was a ſervant girl. From her he learned that the ladies were all in the chapel, and that Miſs Fitzalan was in the prioreſs's apartment. He aſked, "Was ſhe too ill to be ſeen!" The girl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "No;" for having only entered the room to leave the kettle in it, at a time when Amanda was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſhe imagined ſhe was very well.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer then told her his name, and deſired her to go up to Miſs Fitzalan and inquire whether ſhe would ſee him. The girl attempted not to move; ſhe was in reality ſo ſtruck of a heap, by hearing that ſhe had been talking to a Lord, that ſhe know not whether ſhe was ſtanding on her head or her heels. Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

imputing her ſilence to diſinclination to comply with his requeſt, put a guinea, into her hand, and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to be expeditious. This reſtored her to anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but ere ſhe reached the room ſhe forgot his title, and being aſhamed to deliver a blundering meſſage to Miſs Fitzalan, or to appear ſtupid to Lord Mortimer, ſhe returned to him, pretending that ſhe had delivered his meſſage, and that he might go up. She ſhewed him the door, and when he entered he imputed the ſilence of Amanda, and her not moving, to the effects of her grief, he advanced to the couch, and was not a little ſhocked on ſeeing her eyes cloſed; concluding from this that ſhe had fainted, but her eaſy reſpiration ſoon convinced him that this was a miſtake, and he immediately concluded that the girl had deceived him. He leaned over her till ſhe began to ſtir, and then retreated behind her, leaſt his preſence, on her firſt awaking, ſhould alarm her.</p>
                     <p>What took place in the interview between them has already been related, notwithſtanding appearances were ſo much againſt her, and no explanation had enſued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to them; from the moment ſhe aſſerted her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence with ſolemnity, he could no longer doubt it, and yielding at once to his conviction, to his love, to his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for her, he again renewed his overtures for an union. Hearing of the ſtratagems laid for her deſtruction, the dangers ſhe had eſcaped, the diſtreſſes ſhe had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, made him more anxious than ever for completing it; that by his conſtant protection he might ſecure her from ſimilar trials, and by his tenderneſs and care reſtore her to health, peace and happineſs. He longed for the period of her triumphing over the perfidious Marchion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, and the deteſtable Lady Euphraſia, by being raiſed to that ſtation they had ſo long attempted to prevent her attaining, and thus proving to them that virtue, ſooner or later, will counteract the deſigns of vice.—He felt a degree of rapture at the idea of his being no longer obliged to regret the ardent, the unabated affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he felt for her.</p>
                     <p>His tranſports were ſomewhat checked when ſhe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declared an union between them impoſſible, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038416_0422_1011E4D747DBDB28"/>
forbade his ſeeing her again. He was piqued by the ſteadineſs with which ſhe repeated this reſolution, but her preſent weak ſtate prevented his betraying any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and he flattered himſelf he would be able to conquer her obſtinacy; he could not now indeed deſpair of any event after the unexpected reſtoration of Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da to his eſteem, and the revival of thoſe hopes of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which in the certainty of having loſt her had faded away.</p>
                     <p>He returned, as Johnaten ſaid, an altered man to the Caſtle; he no longer experienced horror at entering the dreſſing room, which diſplayed ſo many veſtiges of his Amanda's taſte.</p>
                     <p>He reſolved on an immediate union as the ſureſt proof he could give her of his perfect confidence in her ſincerity, not allowing himſelf to ſuppoſe ſhe would continue firm in the reſolution ſhe had recently avowed to him. He then intended ſetting off for London, and ſparing neither time, trouble, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This was not deſigned for his own ſatisfaction, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no confirmation of what Amanda had aſſerted, as his meaning to marry her immediately demonſtrated, it was to cover with confuſion thoſe who had meditated her deſtruction, and add to the horrors they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience when they found her emerging from obſcurity, not as Miſs Fitzalan, but Lady Mortimer. Such proofs of her innocence would alſo prevent malice from ſaying he was a dupe of art, and he was convinced, for both their ſakes, it was requiſite to procure them; he would then avow his marriage, return for his wife, introduce her to his friends, and, if his father kept up any reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them longer than he expected, he knew, in Lady Martha Dormer's houſe, and at Tudor Hall, he would find not only an eligible but pleaſant reſidence. Thoſe delightful ſchemes kept him awake half the night, and when he fell aſleep it was only to dream of happineſs and Amanda.</p>

In the morning, notwithſtanding the prohibition he had received to the contrary, he went to enquire how ſhe was, and to try and ſee her. The girl who had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his repeated knocks the preceding evening, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and told him Miſs Fitzalan was very bad. He began to think that this muſt be a pretext to avoid ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and to come at the truth, was ſlipping a bribe into her hand, when ſiſter Mary, who had been watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from an adjoining room, appeared and ſtopped this meaſure. She repeated what the girl had juſt ſaid, and in addition to it, declared that, even if Miſs Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan was up, ſhe would not ſee him, and that he muſt come no more to St. Catherine's, as both Miſs Fitzalan and the prioreſs would reſent ſuch conduct exceedingly, and that if he wanted to enquire after the health of the former, he might eaſily ſend a ſervant, and it would be much better done than to come friſking over there every moment.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was ſeriouſly diſpleaſed with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceremonius ſpeech, "So, I ſuppoſe," cried he, "you want to make a real nun of Miſs Fitzalan, and to keep her from all converſation."</p>
                     <p>"And a happy creature ſhe would be were ſhe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one of us," replied ſiſter Mary, "and as too keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from converſation, ſhe might have as much as ſhe pleaſed with any one. Indeed I believe the poor thing likes you well enough, the more's her misfortune for doing ſo."</p>
                     <p>"I thank you, madam," cried Lord Mortimer; "I ſuppoſe it one of your vows to ſpeak truth, if ſo, I muſt acknowledge you keep it religiouſly."</p>
                     <p>"I have juſt heard her," proceeded ſiſter Mary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out minding what he ſaid, "tell the prioreſs a long ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about you and herſelf, by which I find it was her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's deſire ſhe ſhould have nothing more to ſay to you, and I dare ſay the poor gentleman had good reaſons for doing ſo. I beg, my Lord, you will come no more here, and, indeed, I think it was a ſhame for you to give money to the ſimpleton who anſwered you. Why, it was enough

                     <p>Lord Mortimer began now to be ſeriouſly alarmed, leſt Captain Fitzalan had prevailed on his daughter to make a ſolemn renunciation of him; if this was the caſe he knew nothing could prevail on her to break her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

                     <p>THE fatigue, diſtreſs and agitation of Amanda could no longer be ſtruggled with; ſhe ſunk beneath their violence, and for a week was confined to her bed by the fever which ſeized her in England, and had ever ſince lurked in her veins. The whole ſiſterhood, who took it in turn to attend her, vied with each other in kindneſs and care to the poor invalid. Their efforts for her recovery were aided by a ſkilful phyſician from the next town, who called without being ſent for at the convent. He ſaid he had known Captain Fitzalan, and that hearing Miſs Fitzalan was indiſpoſed, he had come in hopes he might be of ſervice to the daughter of a man he ſo much eſteemed.

                     <p>This letter greatly diſtreſſed Amanda. She had hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pain of again rejecting his viſits and requeſts would have been ſpared her.

as honourable as he profeſſed himſelf, thought Amanda on the ſure ſide in declining his viſits.</p>
                     <p>The next morning the Doctor called as uſual. He told Amanda he had brought her an entertaining book, for no ſuch thing could be procured at St. Catherine's, and as ſhe had expreſſed her regret at this, from the time ſhe had been able to read, he had ſupplied her from his library, which was extenſive and well choſen.</p>

Great was her aſtoniſhment when a letter dropped from it into her lap! She ſnatched it up and perceiving the directions in Lord Mortimer's hand, ſhe heſitated whether ſhe ſhould open a letter conveyed in this manner; but to return it unopened was ſurely a ſlight Lord Mortimer merited not, and ſhe broke the ſeal with a trembling hand and a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating heart.</p>

                           <p>To compel me to uſe ſtratagems in writing to you, and deſtroy the delightful hopes which had ſprung in my ſoul at the proſpect of being about to receive a reward for my ſufferings. Am I ever to be involved in doubts and perplexity on your account? Am I ever to ſee diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſuceeded by difficulty, and hope by diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                           <p>You muſt be ſenſible of the anxiety I ſhall feel until your ambiguous expreſſions are fully explained, and yet you refuſe this explanation! But you have no pity for my feelings. Would it not be more generous in you to permit an interview than to keep me in ſuſpenſe? To know the worſt is ſome degree of eaſe; beſides I ſhould then have an opportunity of perhaps convincing you that virtue, unlike vice, has its bounds, and that we may ſometimes carry our notions of honour and generoſity too far, and ſacrifice our real happineſs to chimerical ideas of them. Surely I ſhall not be too preſumptuous in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, if the regard Amanda once flattered me with is
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038416_0428_1011E4E7791B7DD8"/>
undiminiſhed, ſhe will, by rejecting an union with me, leave me not the only ſufferer.</p>
                           <p>Oh! do not, my dear and too ſcrupulous girl, think a moment longer of perſevering in a reſolution ſo prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to your welfare. Your ſituation requires particular protection; young, innocent, and beautiful, already the object of licentious purſuits, your neareſt relations your greateſt enemies, your brother, from his unſettled line of life, unable to be near you. Oh! my Amanda, from ſuch a ſituation what evils may accrue? Avoid them, by taking refuge in his arms, who will be to you a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der friend, and faithful guardian, before ſuch evils, the obligations for keeping a promiſe to reject me fade away, particularly when the motives which led to ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe are conſidered. Captain Fitzalan, hurt by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate letter he received from my father, extended his reſentment to his ſon, and called upon you, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the conſequences of ſuch a meaſure, to give me up. This is the only reaſon I can conceive for his deſiring ſuch a promiſe, and had I but arrived while he could have liſtened to my arguments, I am firmly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, inſtead of appoſing, he would have ſanctioned our union, and given his beloved girl to a man who, in every inſtance, would ſtudy to evince his gratitude for ſuch a gift, and to ſupply his loſs.</p>
                           <p>Happineſs, my dear Amanda, is in long arrears with us. She is now ready to make up for paſt deficiencies, if it is not our own faults; let us not frighten her from performing her good intentions, but hand in hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the lovely and long abſent gueſt to our boſoms.</p>
                           <p>You will not, cannot, muſt not, be inflexible; I ſhall expect, as ſoon as you read this, a ſummons to St. Catherine's, to receive the ratification of my hopes; in every thing reſpecting our union I will be guided by you except delaying it; what we have both ſuffered already from deceit makes me doubly anxious to ſecure you mine, leſt another vile ſcheme ſhould be formed to effect our ſeparation.</p>
                           <p>Oh! Amanda, the fainteſt proſpects of calling you mine gives to my heart a felicity no language can expreſs.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038416_0429_1011E4ECA5DC6DB8"/>
Refuſe not being mine, except you bring me an addition of fortune; already rich in every virtue, I ſhall, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining you obtain a treaſure, which the wealthieſt, the proudeſt, and the vaineſt of the ſons of men may envy me the poſſeſſion of, and which the good, the ſenſible, and the elegant, muſt eſteem the kindeſt gift indulgent heaven could beſtow on me. Baniſh all uneaſy doubts and ſcruples, my Amanda, from your mind, nor think a promiſe, which was demanded without reflecting on the conſequences that muſt attend it can be binding, the ingenuous ſoul of your father would have cancelled it in a moment, had thoſe conſequences been repreſented to him, and now, when our own reaſon convinces us of them I make no doubt, if departed ſouls are permitted to view the tranſactions of this world, his ſpirit would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our union with approbation. Yes, my Amanda, I repeat your father's approving ſpirit will ſmile upon an act which gives to his lovely and beloved orphan a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend, and ſteady protector in her adoring</p>

vain, my Lord, would you, by ſophiſtry cloaked with tenderneſs for that purpoſe, try to influence me. The arguments you have made uſe of, I am convinced, you never would have adopted, had you not been miſtaken in regard to thoſe motives which prompted my father to aſk a promiſe from me of declining any farther connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with you: it was not from reſentment, my Lord, no his death was then faſt approaching, and he in charity for all mankind, forgave thoſe who had wounded him by unjuſt reproach and accuſation; it was a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for his own character, and not reſentment which influenced his conduct, as he was convinced, if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to an alliance with you, Lord Cherbury would be confirmed in all the ſuſpicions he entertained of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entangled you with me, and conſequently load his memory with contempt; tenderneſs alſo for me actuated him; he was acquainted with the proud heart of Lord Cherbury, and knew that if, poor and reduced as I was, I entered his family, I ſhould be conſidered and treated as a mean intruder. So thoroughly am I convinced that he did not err in this idea, that, whenever reaſon is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in my mind, I think, even if a promiſe did not exiſt for ſuch a purpoſe, I ſhould decline your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes; for, though I could ſubmit with cheerfulneſs to many inconveniencies for your ſake, I never could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port indignities.

                           <p>I hope your Lordſhip will not attempt to ſee me again; you muſt be ſenſible that your viſits would be highly injurious to me; even the holy and ſolitary aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum which I have found, would not protect me from the malice which has already been ſo buſy with my peace and fame.

Oh! my Lord, when I think what his ſufferings may now be, my heart ſinks within me: Oh! had I been the only ſufferer, I ſhould not have felt ſo great a degree of ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as I now endure; but I will not deſpair about my dear Oſcar; the Providence which has been ſo kind to his ſiſter, which ſo unexpectedly raiſed her friends, at the moment ſhe deemed herſelf deprived of all earthly comfort, may to him have been equally merciful. I have trespaſſed a long time upon your Lordſhip's attention, but I wiſhed to be explicit, to avoid the neceſſity of any further correſpondence between us: you now know my reſolves; you alſo know my feelings, in pity to them ſpare me any further conflicts.

                     <p>She diſpatched this by an old man, who was employed in the garden at St. Catherine's; but her ſpirits were ſo much affected by writing it, ſhe was obliged to go up and lay on the bed. She conſidered herſelf as having taken a final adieu of Lord Mortimer, and the idea was too painful to be ſupported with fortitude; tender and fervent as his attachment was now to her, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the hurry and buſtle of the world, in which he muſt be engaged, would ſoon eradicate it; a transfer of his affections to one equal to himſelf in rank and fortune was a probable event, and of courſe a total expulſion of her from his memory would follow; a deadly coldneſs ſtole upon her heart at the idea of being forgotten by him, and produced a flood of tears. She then began to accuſe herſelf of inconſiſtency.

                     <p>This laconic letter aſtoniſhed Amanda. By its ſtyle it was evident Lord Mortimer had recovered his cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, recovered it not from a determination of giving her up, but from a hope of their again meeting, as they could both wiſh. A ſudden tranſport ruſhed upon her heart at ſuch an idea, but quickly died away when ſhe reflected it was almoſt beyond the poſſibility of things to bring about a pleaſing interview between them. She knew Lord Mortimer had a ſanguine temper, and though

                     <p>The prioreſs ſympatized in her ſorrow; though not from her own experience, yet, from the experience of others, ſhe knew how dangerous and bewitching a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture man is, and how difficult it is to remove the chains which he twines around the female heart; to remove thoſe which lay ſo heavy upon the delicate and ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart of her young friend, without leaving a corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wound, was her ſincere wiſh, and by ſtrengthening her reſolution, ſhe hoped ſucceſs would crown their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</p>
                     <p>Two hours were elapſed ſince her meſſenger's return from the caſtle, when ſiſter Mary entered the room with a large packet, which ſhe put into Amanda's hands, ſaying, it was given her by Lord Mortimer's ſervant, who rode off the moment he delivered it.</p>
                     <p>Siſter Mary made no ſcruple of ſaying, ſhe ſhould like to know what ſuch a weighty packet contained. The prioreſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>She was ſurprized, on breaking the ſeal, to perceive a very handſome pocket book in a blank cover, and found, unſealed, a letter to this effect:</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <head>TO MISS FITZALAN.</head>
                           <p>I have put it out of your power to return this, by departing long ere you receive it. Surely if you have the laudable pride you profeſs, you will not heſitate to uſe the contents of the pocket book, as the only means of avoiding a weight of obligations from ſtrangers; tho' diſcarded as a lover, ſurely I may be eſteemed as a friend, and with ſuch a title I will be contented till I can lay claim to a tenderer one. You ſtart at this laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and I have no doubt you will call me a roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic viſionary, for entertaining hopes which you have ſo poſitively aſſured me can never be realized; but ere I reſign them I muſt have ſomething more powerful than this aſſurance, my ſweet Amanda, to convince me of their fallacy. I was inexpreſſibly ſhocked this morning to learn by your letter, that your brother had met with misfortune. My blood boils with indignation againſt the monſter who has, to uſe your emphatical expreſſion, been ſuch a ſource of miſery to you both. I ſhall make it my particular care to try and diſcover the place to which Mr. Fitzalan is gone, and in what ſituation, by means of the agents, or ſome of the officers belonging to the regiment, I flatter myſelf with being able to gain ſome intelligence of him; I need not add, that to the utmoſt extent of my power, I will ſerve him. My ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in this affair, as well as in that which concerns a much dearer being, you may be convinced you ſhall ſoon hear. Adieu, my Amanda, I cannot, ſay, like Hamlet, "Go, get you to a nunnery;" but, I can ſay—"Stay there I charge you." Seriouſly, I could wiſh, except you find your preſent ſituation very unpleaſant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, not to change it for a ſhort time. I think, for a temporary above, you could not find a more eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one, and, as I ſhall be all impatience when I return to

You have already refuſed to inform me of your determination relative to this matter, ſurely I may venture to requeſt it may be as I wiſh, when I aſſure you that, except I can ſee you in a manner pleaſing to both, I never will force into your preſence him, who, let things turn out as they may, muſt ever continue,</p>

                     <p>"Gracious Heaven!" ſaid Amanda to herſelf, "what can he mean? What ſcheme can he have in agitation which will remove the obſtacles to our union? He here ſeems to ſpeak of a certainty of ſucceſs. Oh? grant, merciful Power!" ſhe continued, raiſing her meek eyes to Heaven, while a roſy bluſh ſtole upon her cheeks, "grant that indeed he may be ſucceſsful. He talks of returning to Ireland. Still," proceeded ſhe, reading over the letter, "requiring ſomething more powerful than my aſſurance to convince him of the fallacy of his hopes; ſurely Lord Mortimer would not be ſo cruel as to raiſe expectations in my boſom, without thoſe in his own were well founded. No, dear Mortimer, I will not call you a romantic viſionary, but the moſt amiable, the moſt generous of men, who for poor Amanda encounters difficulties, and ſacrifices every ſplendid expectation." She rejoiced at the intention he had declared of ſeeking out Oſcar. She looked forward either to a ſpeedy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, or ſpeedy intelligence of this beloved brother, as ſhe knew Lord Mortimer would ſeek him with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering ſpirit of benevolence, and leave no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried to reſtore him to her.</p>
                     <p>She now examined the contents of the pocket Book; it contained a number of ſmall bills, to the amount of two hundred pounds—a large preſent, but one ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately preſented, that even her ideas of propriety could ſcarcely raiſe a ſcruple againſt her accepting it: They did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, ſuggeſt one, uncertain how matters would

yet terminate between her and Lord Mortimer, ſhe was unwilling to receive any pecuniary obligations from him; but when ſhe reflected on his noble and feeling heart; ſhe knew ſhe ſhould ſeverely wound it by returning his preſent, ſhe therefore reſolved on keeping it, making a kind of compromiſe with her feelings about the matter, by determining that, except entitled to receive them, ſhe would never more accept favours of this nature from his Lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>The preſent one indeed was a moſt ſeaſonable relief, and removed from her heart a load of anxiety which had weighed on it. After paying her father's funeral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, the people with whom he lodged, and the apothecary who had attended him, ſhe found herſelf miſtreſs of but twenty guineas in the whole world, and more than half of this ſhe conſidered as already due to the benevolent ſiſters of St. Catherine's who were ill able to afford any additional expence.</p>
                     <p>She had reſolved to force them to accept what indeed ſhe deemed a poor return for their kindneſs to her, and ſhe then intended to retire to ſome obſcure hovel in the neighbourhood, as better ſuited to the ſtate of her finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and continue there till her health was ſufficiently reſtored, to enable her to make exertion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Lord Mortimer had prevented the neceſſity which had prompted her to think of a removal, and ſhe now reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſide at leaſt for the time he had mentioned in the convent, during which ſhe ſuppoſed her uncertainties relative to him would be over, and that, if it was not her fate to be his, ſhe ſhould, by the perfect re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her health, be enabled to uſe her abilities in the manner her ſituation required. Tears of heart felt gratitude and ſenſibility flowed down her cheeks for him who had lightened her mind of the care which had ſo oppreſſed it.</p>

She at length recollected the prioreſs had retired into the garden from complaiſance to her, and yet continued in it, waiting no doubt to be ſummoned back by her. She haſtily wiped away her tears, and folding up the precious letter which was bedewed with them, repaired to the garden, reſolving not to communicate its contents, as the divulgment of expectations (conſidering how lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all human ones are to be diſappointed) ſhe ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered a piece of folly.</p>
                     <p>She found the prioreſs and ſiſter Mary ſeated under a broken and ivy covered arch. "Jeſu! my dear," ſaid the latter, "I thought you would never come to us. Our good mother has been keeping me here in ſpite of my teeth, though I told her the ſweet cakes I made for tea would be burned by this time, and that, ſuppoſing you were reading a letter from Lord Mortimer, there could be no harm in my ſeeing you." Amanda relieved the impatient Mary, and ſhe took her ſeat. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oreſs caſt her piercing eyes upon her. She perceived ſhe had been weeping, and that joy rather than ſorrow cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her tears. She was too delicate to enquire into its ſource; but ſhe took Amanda's hand, and gave it a preſſure, which ſeemed to ſay, "I ſee, my dear child, you have met with ſomething which pleaſes you, and my heart ſympathizes as much in your happineſs as in your grief."</p>
                     <p>Amanda returned the affectionate preſſure with one equally tender, and a ſtarting tear. They were ſoon called by ſiſter Mary to partake of her hot cakes, which ſhe had made indeed in hopes of tempting Amanda to eat after her bad dinner; the whole community were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at tea, when the Doctor entered the parlour, Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da bluſhed, and looked grave at his firſt entrance; but he ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

She ſaw by his manner he was acquainted with her ſituation relative to Lord Mortimer, and therefore

replied by ſaying, "that, perhaps, if he knew the motives which influenced her conduct, he would not think her wrong in diſregarding what he had juſt mentioned."—She alſo ſaid, "ſhe deteſted all kinds of ſtratagems, and was really diſpleaſed with him for practiſing one upon her."</p>
                     <p>"In a good cauſe," he ſaid, "he ſhould never heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate uſing one. Lord Mortimer was the fineſt young fellow he had ever ſeen, and had won his favour, and the beſt wiſhes of his heart, from the firſt moment that he beheld him. He made me contrive." continued the doctor, "a ſtory to gain admiſſion to your Ladyſhip, and when I found him ſo dreadfully anxious about you, I gave you credit (as I had then no opportunity of judging for myſelf) for all the virtues and graces he aſcribed to you, and which I have ſince perceived you to poſſeſs. You ſmile, and look as if you would call me a flatterer; ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly I aſſure you I am not one: I really think you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Lord Mortimer, and, I aſſure you that is as great a compliment as could be paid any woman. His mind was troubled with grief; he revealed his troubles and perplexities to me, and after hearing them, no good Chriſtian ever prayed more devoutly for another than I prayed for your recovery, that all your ſorrows like a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, might terminate in marriage."</p>
                     <p>"You are obliging in your wiſhes," ſaid Amanda, ſmiling.</p>
                     <p>"Faith, I am ſincere in them," exclaimed he, "and do not know when I have been ſo diſconcerted at things not turning out ſmoothly between you and his Lordſhip; but I will not deſpair: In all my own troubles, and Heaven has given me my ſhare, I ever looked to the bright ſide of things, and ſhall always do ſo for my friends. I yet expect to ſee you ſettled at Caſtle Carberry, and to be appointed myſelf phyſician general to your Ladyſhip's houſehold." The mention of an event, yet ſo uncertain greatly agitated Amanda, ſhe bluſhed and turned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

as ſoon as he ſaw her compoſed, roſe to take his leave.—Amanda detained him for a minute, to try and prevail on him to take a ten guinea note; but he was inflexible, and ſaid, with ſome archneſs, "till the diſorder which prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Lord Mortimer's heart, was in ſome degree alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated, he would receive no recompenſe for his viſits, which he aſſured Amanda, from time to time, he ſhould continue to pay her, adding, a certain perſon had enjoined him now and then to take a peep within the holy walls of St. Catherine's."</p>
                     <p>The next morning Amanda ſet about a temporary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of her affairs. She preſented thirty guineas to the ſiſterhood, which, with much difficulty ſhe forced them to accept, though in reality it was much required by them; but when ſhe came to ſpeak of paying for a continuance, they poſitively declared they would agree to no ſuch thing, as ſhe had already ſo liberally rewarded them for any expence they had incurred on her account. She told them, that if they would not agree to be paid for lodging and board, ſhe would certainly leave them; though ſuch a ſtep was contrary to her inclinations, ſhe aſſured them alſo ſhe was at preſent well able to pay.</p>
                     <p>At laſt it was ſettled ſhe ſhould give them at the rate of forty pounds a year—a ſalary they thought extremely ample, conſidering the plain manner in which they lived. She then had all the things which belonged to her father and herſelf brought to the convent, and had the former, with whatever ſhe did not immediately want, nailed up in a large cheſt, that on a ſhort notice they might be removed. Her harp and guittar ſhe had in her diſtreſs propoſed ſending back to the perſon in Dublin from whom they were purchaſed, to ſell for her; but ſhe now deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to keep thoſe preſents of her beloved father's, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept again urged by neceſſity to part with them. She had a variety of materials for painting and working, and propoſed employing herſelf in executing pieces in each way, not only as a means of amuſing her time, but as a reſource on an evil day. Thus wiſely making uſe of the preſent ſunſhine, leſt another ſtorm ſhould ariſe, which ſhe ſhould not be ſo well able to ſtruggle againſt.</p>

                     <p>THE turbulence of grief, and the agitation of ſuſpence, gradually leſſened in the mind of Amanda, and were ſucceeded by a ſoft and pleaſing melancholy, which ſprang from the conſciouſneſs of having always, to the beſt of her abilities, performed the duties impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her, and ſupported her misfortunes with placid reſignation. She loved to think on her father, for amidſt her ſighs for his loſs were mingled the delightful ideas of having ever been a ſource of comfort to him, and ſhe believed, if departed ſpirits were allowed to review this world, his would look down upon her with delight and approbation at beholding her undeviating in the path he marked out for her to take; the calm derived from ſuch meditations ſhe conſidered as a recompence for many ſorrows, it was ſuch indeed as nothing earthly gives, or can deſtroy, and what the good muſt ever experience, though "amidſt the wreck of matter, and the cruſh of worlds."</p>
                     <p>She tried to prevent her thoughts from wandering to Lord Mortimer, as the ſureſt means of retaining her compoſure, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

not ſufficient fortitude to bear; but the ſpace it covered was ample enough to afford her many different and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive rambles; and of a ſtill evening, when nothing but the lowing of the cattle, or the buzzing of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer flies, was to be heard, ſhe loved to wander through the ſolemn and romantic ruins, ſometimes accompanied by a nun, but much oftener alone.</p>
                     <p>A fortnight had elapſed in this manner ſince Lord Mortimer's departure, when one morning a carriage was heard driving acroſs the Common, and ſtopping at the outer gate of St. Catherine's: Amanda, who was ſitting at work in the parlour with the prioreſs, ſtarted in an univerſal trepidation at the ſound; it may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined the idea of Lord Mortimer was uppermoſt in her thoughts; the door opened in a few minutes, and to her great aſtoniſhment Mrs. Kilcorban and her two daughters made their appearance.</p>
                     <p>Agitation and ſurprize prevented Amanda from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſhe courtiſed, and motioned them to be ſeated. The young ladies ſaluted her with an icy civility, and the mother treated her with a rude familiarity, which ſhe thought herſelf authorized in uſing to one ſo redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in circumſtances as Amanda. "Dear me," cried ſhe, "you can't think, child, how ſhocked we have all been to hear of your misfortunes! We only returned to the country yeſterday, for we have been in town the whole winter, and to be ſure a moſt delightful winter we have had of it, ſuch balls, ſuch routs, ſuch racketings; but as I was going to ſay, as ſoon as we came home I began, according to my old cuſtom, to enquire after all my neighbours, and to be ſure the very firſt thing I heard was of the poor Captain's death. Don't cry, my dear, we muſt all go one time or another, thoſe are things of courſe, as the Doctor ſays in his ſermon; ſo when I heard of your father's death, and your diſtreſs, I began to caſt about in my brain ſome plan for helping you, and at laſt I hit upon one, which, ſays I to the girls, will delight the poor ſoul, as it will give her an opportunity of earning decent bread for herſelf. You muſt know, my dear, the tutoreſs we brought to town
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:038416_0444_1011E512692FF9D0"/>
would not come back with us—a dirty trollop by the bye, and I think her place would be quite the thing for you. You will have the four young girls to learn French, and work to, and I will expect you, as you have a good taſte, to aſſiſt the eldeſt Miſs Kilcorban's in making up their things and dreſſing. I give twenty guineas a year. When we have no company, the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toreſs always ſits at the table, and gets beſides this, the beſt of treatment in every reſpect."</p>
                     <p>A bluſh of indignation had gradually conquered A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda's paleneſs during Mrs. Kilcorban's long and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſpeech—"Your intentions may be friendly, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," cried ſhe, "but I muſt decline your propoſal."</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me, and why muſt you decline it; perhaps you think yourſelf not qualified to inſtruct; indeed this may be the caſe, for people often get credit for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments they do not poſſeſs.—Well, if this is ſo, I am ſtill content to take you, as you were always a decent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved young body. Indeed you cannot expect I ſhould give you twenty guineas a year—No, no, I muſt make ſome abatement in the ſalary, if I am forced to get maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to help you in learning the girls.—"Miſs Fitzalan, Madam," exclaimed the prioreſs, who had hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſilent, "never got credit for accompliſhments which ſhe did not poſſeſs; her modeſty has rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured than blazoned forth her perfections; ſhe does not therefore, Madam, decline your offer from a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of inability to undertake the office of an inſtructor, but from a conviction ſhe never could ſupport imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and folly; ſhould her ſituation ever require her to exert her talents for ſubſiſtence, I truſt ſhe will never experience the mortifications of aſſociating with thoſe who are inſenſible of her worth, or unwilling to pay her the reſpect ſhe merits."</p>
                     <p>"Hoity toity," cried Mrs. Kilcorban, "what aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance! Why, Madam, many a better man's child would be glad to jump at ſuch an offer."</p>
                     <p>"Dear Madam," ſaid Miſs Kilcorban, "perhaps the young lady has a better ſettlement in view.—We for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Lord Mortimer has been lately at Caſtle Carberry,

and we all know his Lordſhip is a friend to Captain Fitzalan's daughter."</p>
                     <p>"Or, perhaps," cried Miſs Alicia, in a gigling tone, "ſhe means to be a nun."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, I ſuppoſe ſhe means to be nothing good," rejoined Miſs Kilcorban; and I ſuppoſe it was by ſome impertinence or other ſhe had a tiff with Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock. Lord! (looking round the room) only ſee her muſic books—her harp—her guittar—as if ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but ſing and thrum away the whole day,—Well Miſs," riſing from her chair, "you may yet be ſorry your friend ſaid ſo much about you. I did not come merely to offer to take you into my houſe, but to offer you alſo a good ſum for you harp and guittar, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing you had no buſineſs with ſuch things now-a-days; but I dare ſay you would have refuſed this offer."</p>
                     <p>"I certainly ſhould, Madam," ſaid Amanda; "it muſt be ſtrong neceſſity which compels me to part with my beloved father's preſents."</p>
                     <p>"Well, well, child, I wiſh this pride of thine may not yet be humbled." So ſaying, ſhe flounced out of the room, followed by her daughters, who, under an affectation of contempt, evidently ſhewed they were chagrined by the reception they had met.</p>
                     <p>The prioreſs indulged herſelf in a long fit of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at the paſſion in which ſhe had thrown Mrs. Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corban; and Amanda, who conſidered the lady and her daughters as the moſt inſignificant of beings, ſoon recovered from the diſcompoſure their viſit had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of the evening a letter was delivered her by the ſervant, who ſaid the meſſenger who brought it waited for an anſwer.

                     <p>The indignation which filled Amanda's breaſt at reading this ſcroll, cannot be expreſſed. Her blood ſeemed to boil in her veins; it was ſometime ere ſhe could ſufficiently compoſe herſelf to acquaint the prior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs with the cauſe of her agitation; it was then agreed that the letter ſhould be returned, with the following lines written on it:</p>
                     <p>"The author of this effuſion of ignorance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence, has already inſpired all the contempt he merits; ſhould he repeat his inſolence, ſomething even more mortifying than contempt, chaſtiſement muſt enſue."</p>
                     <p>That a repetition of this kind would be the caſe ſhe did not believe. From Kilcorban ſhe had no reaſon to ſuſpect either the perſeverance or deſigns of Belgrave;

                     <p>But the calm ſhe had for ſome time experienced was deſtined to be interrupted. The next morning brought father O'Gallaghan, the little fat prieſt (of whom we have made mention before in our pages) to the convent; he was not the officiating prieſt, but notwithſtanding this, paid many viſits to the ſiſterhood, with whom he was a great favourite; he had been much concerned about Amanda's illneſs. She was ſitting alone in the parlour, drawing, when he entered it. He ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by her, and the expreſſion of his countenance ſeemed to declare his heart was brimful of ſomething pleaſant.</p>
                     <p>"You won't be offended now, my dear ſowl," ſaid he, ſmirking up in her face, "with a body for aſking you how you would like to leave this diſmal ſolitude, and have a comfortable home of your own, where you might ſee your own friends, and have every thing warm and coſy about you?"</p>
                     <p>"Why," ſaid Amanda, "though I do not conſider this a diſmal ſolitude, yet to be ſure I ſhould have no objection to a pleaſant ſettled habitation."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, I always thought you a ſenſible young body. Well, and what would you ſay to the perſon then who could point out ſuch an habitation? Aye, you little rogue, who could ſay they had juſt ſuch a one in their eye for you?"</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſtared at him with aſtoniſhment. She had at firſt believed him jeſting, but now found him ſerious.</p>
                     <p>"Aye faith, my dear creature," cried he continuing his diſcourſe, with a look of the moſt perfect ſatisfaction, "I have an offer to make you, which, I believe, would make many girls jump out of their ſkins with joy to hear."</p>
                     <p>"You remember the O'Flannaghans I am ſure, where you took tea laſt ſummer. Well, the eldeſt of the ſons (as honeſt a lad as ever broke bread) caſt a ſheep's eye upon you then; but what with your going from the country, and ſome other matters, he thought there was no uſe then in revealing his flame; but now, when you

are come plump in his way again, faith he plucked up his courage, and told his father all about it. Old Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naghan is a good natured ſowl, and is very willing the match ſhould take place. They have every thing ſnug about them. The old man will give every thing into your ſpouſe's hands; the youngeſt ſon will live in the houſe till he gets married, and goes off to a farm of his own; the eldeſt daughter is married; the ſecond will live with her, and the youngeſt will be a little handy aſſiſtant to you: So you ſee you will not be tormented with a large family. There is one little matter which to be ſure they are a little uneaſy about, and that is your being of different perſuaſions; but ſays I to them when this was ſtarted—faith, ſays I, you need not give your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any trouble about it, for I know the young woman to be a diſcreet ſowl, and I am ſure ſhe will make no heſitation about going to Chapel inſtead of Church, when ſhe knows too, it is for her own intereſt: So, my dear ſowl, I hope ſoon to give you the nuptial bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and to be alſo your ſpiritual director."</p>
                     <p>Amanda had liſtened to his ſpeech in ſilent amaſement. She now roſe and would have quitted the room without ſpeaking to evince her contempt, had not an idea darted into her mind, that ſuch conduct, perhaps, might not be conſtrued by the ignorant prieſt, in the manner ſhe wiſhed; ſhe therefore ſtopped, and turning to him ſaid, "He could not wonder at her being offended at his pretending to anſwer ſo freely for her in matters ſo important as religion; but to prove how preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous he was in every thing he ſaid about her, ſhe muſt aſſure him his embaſſy to her was equally fruitleſs and diſagreeable; and that if Mr. O'Flanaghan conſulted his own happineſs, he would ſeek to unite himſelf with a woman brought up in his own ſphere of life." So ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe quitted the room with a look of dignity which quite confounded the poor prieſt, who ſnatched up his hat in a great hurry, and waddled away to the farm, to communicate the ill ſucceſs of his viſit, which had quite cruſhed his expectations of wedding preſents and pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                     <p>It was ſome time ere Amanda recovered from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure into which the impertinence of the Kil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

From what ſhe ſuffered in conſequence of it, ſhe was forcibly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced how ill qualified ſhe was to ſtruggle with a world where ſhe would be continually liable to ſuch ſhocks; ſhe had yet a hope of eſcaping them—a hope of being guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the tutelary care of Lord Mortimer, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the happieſt of her ſex.</p>

                     <p>BUT a ſhock more ſevere than thoſe ſhe had lately experienced, was yet in ſtore for our hapleſs heroine. About a fortnight after the viſit of the Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corban's and the prieſt, as ſhe was rambling one eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning according to cuſtom amongſt the ſolitary ruins of St. Catherine's, indulging the penſive meditations of her ſoul, the figure of a man ſuddenly darted from under a broken arch, and diſcovered to her view the features of the hated Belgrave. Amanda gave a feint cry, and in unutterable diſmay tottered back a few paces againſt a wall. Cruel Amanda, exclaimed Belgrave, while his look ſeemed to imply he would take advantage of her ſituation; his look, his voice, operated like a charm to rouſe her from the kind of ſtupefaction into which ſhe had fallen at firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of him, and as he attempted to lay hold of her ſhe ſprang paſt him, and, with a ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which mocked his ſpeed, flew through the intricate
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:038416_0450_1011E522E596FC60"/>
windings of the place till ſhe reached the convent. Her pale and diſtracted look, as ſhe ruſhed into the prioreſs's apartment, terrified the good old lady, who haſtily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated her as to the cauſe of her diſorder; but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda was unable to ſpeak. The appearance of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave ſhe thought an omen of every ill to her. Her blood run cold through her veins at his ſight, and terror totally ſubdued her powers. The prioreſs ſummoned ſiſter Mary to her relief, drops and water were adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and the over-loaded heart of the trembling Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da was relieved by tears. The prioreſs again aſked the cauſe of her agitation, but perceiving Amanda did not like to ſpeak before ſiſter Mary, ſhe immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to think it proceeded from fatigue; and Mary, who was ſimplicity itſelf, readily credited the idea. The Prioreſs ſoon ſent her upon ſome pretext from the room, and then in the gentleſt terms, begged to know what had ſo cruelly alarmed her young friend. Amanda had already confided to the Prioreſs the events of her life, ſo that the good lady, on hearing Belgrave now mentioned, no longer wondered at the agitation of Amanda, yet as her fears ſhe ſaw were too powerful for her reaſon, ſhe endeavoured to convince her they were unneceſſary. She called to her remembrance the ſingular protection ſhe had already experienced from heaven, and the protection which, while ſhe was innocent, ſhe would ſtill have a right to expect. She alſo mentioned the ſecurity of her preſent ſituation, encompaſſed by friends whoſe integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could not be warped, and whoſe utmoſt zeal would be manifeſted in defeating any ſtratagems which might be laid againſt her.</p>
                     <p>Amanda grew compoſed as ſhe liſtened to the prior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs; ſhe was cheered by the voice of piety and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and her heart again felt firm and elevated. She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that, after the ſingular, nay, almoſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous interpoſitions of Providence ſhe had experienced in her favour, to give way to terror or deſpair, was ſinful, ſince it ſhewed a diſtruſt of the Power, who has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, with guardian care, to watch the footſteps of the innocent.</p>

                        <pb n="51" facs="unknown:038416_0451_1011E5247506DFF8"/>
It was however agreed that Amanda ſhould venture no more from the Convent, but confine her rambles to the garden, which was encloſed with a high wall, and had no places of concealment. Five weeks yet remained of the period Lord Mortimer had requeſted her to ſtay at St. Catherine's; before it was expired, ſhe truſted and believed Belgrave would be weary of watching her, and would decamp; if then ſhe neither ſaw no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> heard from Lord Mortimer, ſhe reſolved to relinquiſh all hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and immediately think upon ſome plan, which ſhould put her in a way of procuring ſubſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Her paintings and embroidery ſtill went on; ſhe had executed ſome elegant pictures in both, which, if obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to diſpoſe of, ſhe was ſure would fetch a good price<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet, whenever compelled by reflection to this idea, the tear of tender melancholy would fall upon her lovely cheek, a tear which was ever haſtily wiped away, while ſhe endeavoured to fortify her mind with pious reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whatever ſhould be her future fate.</p>
                     <p>Three weeks more elapſed without any event to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe their tranquillity; but as the termination of the deſtined period approached, the agitation of Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, in ſpite of all her efforts to the contrary, increaſed; ſhe deemed the awful criſis of her fate at hand, and ſhe trembled at the reflection.</p>
                     <p>She now, for the firſt time, avoided ſolitude; ſhe wanted to fly from herſelf, and ſat conſtantly with the Prioreſs, who had nothing of the gloomy recluſe, ſave the habit about her.</p>
                     <p>They were chatting together one evening after tea, when ſiſter Mary entered the room, bearing a large pacquet, which ſhe rather toſſed than preſented to Amanda, exclaiming, "From Lord Mortimer—I wiſh the troubleſome fellow had not come back again; here we ſhall have him friſking or ſtorming continually, and again plaguing us out of our lives."</p>
                     <p>"From Lord Mortimer!" exclaimed Amanda, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her chair, and claſping the letter between her hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She opened it with reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits, and read as follows:</p>

                           <p>Tears of joy guſhed from Amanda as ſhe exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "Can this, can this be true?

'Tis true, 'tis true, and never can my grateful heart ſufficiently acknowledge the goodneſs it experiences; but how was this event brought about? She wiped away her tears, and reſumed the letter.</p>
                           <p>Your ſolemn refuſal to unite yourſelf to me threw me into agonies; but true love, like true courage, will never deſpair, will never yield to difficulties, without firſt trying every effort to conquer them: I ſoon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rouſed myſelf from the heavy weight which oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſpirits at your reſolution, and ere long conceived a project ſo feaſible, ſo almoſt certain of ſucceſs, that my impatience to realize it cannot be deſcribed; yet you may conceive ſome idea of it from the abrupt manner in which I quitted Caſtle Carberry, without deſiring to bid you adieu; but ere it could be accompliſhed, I plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaw I had many difficulties to encounter, difficulties which it was abſolutely eſſential to overcome, that I might prove to the world I was not the dupe of love; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Martha Dormer ſtill at Lord Cherbury's houſe. I have already told you that I left town on pretence of viſiting my ſiſter in Wales. My father, I ſoon perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſuſpected that had not been the real motive of my departure; but I ſoon perceived he did not deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his ſuſpicions, as he aſked me ſome queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Lady Araminta, which you may be ſure I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered aukwardly enough, and, had a comic writer been preſent, he might have taken the hint of a good blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſcene from us both.</p>
                           <p>The Marquis of Roſline and his family I learned continued at his villa; their abſence from town rejoiced me, as it not only exempted me from ſociety I abhorred, but as it gave me an opportunity of interrogating their houſehold, amongſt whom I was convinced I ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the truſty agents the amiable Marchioneſs had made uſe of in her ſcheme againſt you. The morning after my arrival, I accordingly ſet off to Portman Square: the man who opened the door knew me not, which I conſidered a lucky circumſtance, for not being able to mention my name to the houſekeeper, whom I deſired him to ſend to me, ſhe was not as much on her guard as ſhe would otherwiſe have been:—She ſtarted as ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the parlour, and lifted up her hands and eyes with unfeigned aſtoniſhment. Soon, however, recovering her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhe addreſſed me in the moſt obſequious manner, and ſpoke as if ſhe ſuppoſed I was come purpoſely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after her Lord and Lady, an artful way of trying to terminate her own ſuſpenſe by learning the nature of my viſit. I ſoon gave her to underſtand it was not of the moſt amicable kind to her; I came, I ſaid, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand either the letter, or an account of the letter which

I pauſed for her reply. She appeared as if conſidering how ſhe ſhould act. I thought I ſaw ſomething yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her face, and eager to take advantage of it. I proceeded: What I have already ſaid, I am going again to repeat; that is, if you confeſs all you know relative to the plot which was contrived, and carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this houſe againſt Miſs Fitzalan, I will ſettle every thing relative to the letter, and its contents, in a manner pleaſing to you. Her innocence is unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by me; but it is eſſential to her peace that it ſhould alſo be ſo to the reſt of her friends, and they who regard her welfare will liberally reward thoſe, whoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations ſhall juſtify her.</p>
                           <p>Upon this ſhe turned to me, with a countenance of the utmoſt effrontery, and ſaid ſhe would not tell a lie to pleaſe any one. I will not ſhock you by repeating all ſhe ſaid: ſhe ended by ſaying, as to the letters ſhe ſet me at defiance; true, I had given her one for Miſs Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alan, but I might remember Miſs Fitzalan was in a fit on the ground at the time, and ſhe had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:038416_0455_1011E52F25594B68"/>
employed. The note, which I encloſed in the letter I had given her for you, I had received from my father's agent in the country, as a poſt note I had endorſed it, and taken the number in my pocket book; I therefore left Portman Square with a reſolution of going to the Bank, and, if not already received, ſtopping payment, I ſtepped into the firſt hackney-coach I met, and had the ſatisfaction of finding it had not been offered at the Bank. I ſuſpected ſhe would be glad to exchange it for caſh as ſoon as poſſible, and therefore left my direction, as well as a requeſt for the detention of any perſon who ſhould preſent it.</p>
                           <p>In conſequence of this a clerk came the following morning, to inform me a woman had preſented the note at the Bank, and was, agreeable to my requeſt, detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till I appeared. I immediately returned with him, and had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing the houſe-keeper caught in the ſnare. She burſt into tears at my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and coming up to me, in a low voice, ſaid, if I would have mercy upon her, ſhe would in return make a full confeſſion of all ſhe knew about the affair I had mentioned to her yeſterday.</p>
                           <p>I told her though ſhe deſerved no mercy, yet, as I had promiſed on ſuch condition to ſhew her lenity, I would not violate my word. I received the note, ſent for a coach, and handing the lady into it, ſoon conveyed her to Portman Square. She no ſooner entered the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour than ſhe fell on her knees, and beſought my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. I bid her riſe, and loſe no time in revealing all ſhe knew concerning the ſcheme againſt you. She then confeſſed, that both ſhe and Mrs. Jane, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant who had been placed about your perſon, were acquainted and concerned in all the contrivances the Marchioneſs had laid againſt you, who ſcrupled not in acknowledging to them the inveterate hatred ſhe bore you.

added ſhe had never kept; but this brief and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancial account was by no means ſatisfactory to me. I called for materials for writing, and inſiſted ſhe ſhould, to the beſt of her recollection, relate every word or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which had ever paſſed between her and the Marchioneſs, and their other aſſociate, relative to you. She heſitated at this. On thoſe terms only, I ſaid, I would grant her my forgiveneſs, and by her complying with them, not only that, but a liberal recompenſe ſhould be her's. This laſt promiſe had the deſired ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; ſhe laid open indeed a ſcene of complicated ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, related the manner in which Colonel Belgrave was brought into the houſe by her and Mrs. Jane, how they had ſtationed themſelves in a place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment to liſten, by which means they knew what paſſed between you, which ſhe now, in almoſt the very ſame words you made uſe of, repeated to me: as ſhe ſpoke I wrote it, and made her ſign the paper under a paragraph, purporting that it was a true confeſſion of the part ſhe had taken, and knew others to have taken, in attempting to injure Miſs Fitzalan.</p>
                           <p>I now mentioned Mrs. Jane, whoſe evidence I wiſhed for to corroborate her's. This ſhe aſſured me I might procure by promiſing a reward, as Mrs Jane was much diſſatisfied with the Marchioneſs and Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia, neither of whom had recompenſed her as ſhe expected, for her faithful ſervices to them. She was now at the villa; but the houſe-keeper added, that ſhe would ſtrike out ſome expedient to bring her to town in the courſe of the week, and would inform me imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately of her arrival. I told her the affair of the note ſhould be no more mentioned, and gave a bill for fifty pounds as the reward I had promiſed, and ſhe eagerly expected. I told her ſhe might promiſe a ſimilar one in my name to Mrs. Jane, provided ſhe alſo told truth. I alſo told her I would take care ſhe ſhould ſuffer no diſtreſs by quitting the Marquis's family, which ſhe lamented would be the conſequence of what ſhe had done.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="57" facs="unknown:038416_0457_1011E533821128D8"/>
Mrs. Jane did not come to town as ſoon as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; but on receiving a ſummons to inform me of her arrival I haſtened to the houſe like an inquiſitor ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with my ſcroll, prepared to take the confeſſion of the fair culprit, which exactly correſponded with the houſe-keeper's, and I had the felicity of ſeeing her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe her name to it. I gave her the promiſed recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe moſt cheerfully, as I had not half ſo much trouble in making her tell truth, as I had with the houſe-keeper. Mrs. Jennings, your old landlady, and Lady Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock's faithful friend, was the next and laſt perſon whoſe malice I wanted to refute. I made my ſervant enquire her character in the neighbourhood, and learned it was conſidered a very ſuſpicious one. I went to her one morning in my carriage, well knowing that the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of rank and ſplendour would have a greater weight in influencing a being like her to juſtice than any plea of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>. She appeared loſt in aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confuſion at my viſit, and I ſaw waited with trembling expectation to have the reaſon of it revealed. I kept her not long in ſuſpence. I was the friend, I told her, of a young lady, whoſe character ſhe had vilely and falſely aſperſed. Her conſcience I told her I believed would whiſper to her heart the name of this lady, and ſend its crimſon current to her face at the mention of Miſs Fitzalan.</p>
                           <p>The wretch ſeemed ready to ſink to the earth. I repeated to her all ſhe had ſaid concerning you to Lady Greyſtock. I told her of the conſequences of defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and declared ſhe might expect the utmoſt rigour of the law, except ſhe confeſſed her aſſertions were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous falſhoods, and the motives which inſtigated her to them. She trembled with terror, and ſupplicated mercy: I deſired her to deſerve it by her confeſſion. She then acknowledged ſhe had groſsly and cruelly wronged you, by what ſhe had ſaid to Lady Greyſtock, and that ſhe had many opportunities of being convinced, while you reſided in her houſe, that your virtue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence were of the pureſt nature; but that ſhe was provoked to ſpeak maliciouſly againſt you from reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

at loſing all the rich gifts Colonel Belgrave had promiſed her, if ſhe brought you to comply with his wiſhes. She related all the ſtratagems they had mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerted for your deſtruction, and ſhe brought me ſome letters, which I have kept, from him to you, and which ſhe pretended you had received, leſt ſhe ſhould loſe the money he always gave when ſhe was ſucceſsful in delivering one.</p>
                           <p>I bid her beware how ſhe ever attempted to villiſy innocence, leſt the friends of thoſe at whom ſhe leve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Oh! my Amanda, I cannot expreſs the tranſports I felt, when I found the difficulties, which I dreaded as intervening between me and happineſs thus removed. I felt myſelf the happieſt of men; my heart acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged your worth, I was convinced of your love and in my hands I held the refutation of falſhood, and the confirmation of your innocence.</p>
                           <p>The period for mentioning my project was now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived: I deſired the morning after my viſit to Mrs. Jennings, to be indulged in a tete-a-tete in Lady Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha's dreſſing room: I believe ſhe half gueſſed what the ſubject of it would be; ſhe ſaw by my countenance there was joyful news at hand. I ſhall not recapitulate our converſation; ſuffice it to ſay, that her excellent feeling heart participated largely in my ſatisfaction: it did more than participate, it wiſhed to increaſe it, and ere I could mention my project, ſhe declared my Amanda ſhould henceforth be conſidered as her adopted daughter, and ſhould from her receive ſuch a fortune as ſuch a title claimed; Yes, my Amanda, the fortune ſhe ever deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined for me, ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould now conſecrate to the purpoſe of procuring me a treaſure the moſt valuable Heaven could beſtow—the richeſt—the moſt valuable indeed—a treaſure dearer, far dearer to my ſoul for all the dangers it has encountered. I fell at Lady Martha's

feet in a tranſport of gratitude, and acknowledged that ſhe had anticipated what I was going to ſay, as I had been determined to throw myſelf on her generoſity from the time I was convinced of your inflexible reſolution, not to unite yourſelf to me without you brought a fortune.</p>
                           <p>It was now agreed we ſhould keep Lord Cherbury a little longer ignorant of our intentions; we propoſed taking the Marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia by ſurprize, and hoped by ſo doing, to be able to remove from his eyes the miſt which partiality had hitherto ſpread before them, to obſcure the defects of the above mentioned ladies.</p>
                           <p>He had hinted more than once his wiſhes for my paying my compliments at the Marquis's villa. I now propoſed going thither myſelf the enſuing day. He looked equally ſurpriſed and pleaſed: At this propoſal Lady Martha agreed to accompany <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           <p>We had the happineſs to find all the family at home when we reached the villa. The ladies all expreſſed themſelves delighted at my unexpected appearance, and quite charmed by my recovered looks. The Marquis with his uſual ſang froid declared himſelf glad to ſee me. Ye ſmiling deceivers, I cried to myſelf, as I ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the marchioneſs and Lady Euphraſia, your triumph over innocence and beauty will ſoon be over—After paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing half an hour in unintereſting chit chat, I took the opportunity of one of thoſe pauſes in converſation, which ſo frequently happen, to commence my attack; it would be as painful to you as to me, to recapitulate all which enſued in conſequence of it. Rage, guilt, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were conſpicuous in the Marchioneſs and Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia, the Marquis and Lady Greyſtock looked with aſtoniſhment, and my father ſeemed overwhelmed with ſurpriſe and conſternation.</p>
                           <p>I ſaid, (addreſſing the Marchioneſs) I now truſted the reſentment her Ladyſhip entertained againſt her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offending

niece was ſufficiently appeaſed by what ſhe had made her ſuffer, and that ſhe would rather rejoice than regret the opportunity which preſented itſelf of vindicating her fame. I wiſhed, I ſaid, as much as poſſible, to ſpare her Ladyſhip's feelings, and provided, ſhe would clear Miſs Fitzalan from the obloquy, which the tranſactions in her houſe caſt upon her, I was willing to conceal the ſhare her Ladyſhip had in them. In a voice of ſmothered rage, and with a look into which ſhe thew as much contempt as poſſible, ſhe replied, "She thanked me for the attention I profeſſed myſelf inclined to pay her feelings; but ſhe fancied I had overlooked all inclination of this kind, when I undertook to bribe her ſervants to aſperſe her character, that Miſs Fitzalan's might be cleared. She was ſorry, ſhe ſaid, to find I could be capable of ſuch complicated baſeneſs and weakneſs. Miſs Fitzalan ſhe perceived had made me her dupe again; but this was not ſurpriſing, as ſhe was the profeſſed pupil of art; too late I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her in her native colours, and find the diſgrace, which, by artifice, I now attempted to remove from her character, thrown back upon her, perhaps to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm me alſo by its weight."—"She has infatuated him, (ſaid Lord Cherbury) ſhe will be the bane of his life, the diſtruction of my hopes."</p>
                           <p>Not Miſs Fitzalan (cried I, aſſuming as much coolneſs as poſſible, though, like the Marchioneſs, I found it a difficult taſk) not Miſs Fitzalan, but the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Miſs Fitzalan deceived me. I own I was the dupe of the ſcheme contrived againſt her; any thing ſo horrid, ſo monſtrous, ſo execrable, I did not think could have entered into the minds of thoſe who were bound by the united ties of kindred and hoſpitality to protect her, and I rather believed I owed my miſery to the frailty than the turpitude of human nature.</p>
                           <p>"You ſee, my Lord, (exclaimed the Marchioneſs, turning to Lord Cherbury) Lord Mortimer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges his paſſion for this wretched girl."</p>

                           <p>"I followed her my Lord (I replied) in hope to withdraw her from her ſeducer's arms, and place her in her father's. I hoped, I truſted, I ſhould be able alſo to alleviate the bitter deſtiny of poor Fitzalan: Alas! not in the arms of a gay, ſucceſsful ſeducer, but appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in the arms of death did I find Amanda. I ſaw her at the ſolemn hour which conſigned her parent to his grave, and to have doubted her proteſtations of innocence then, would have been almoſt impious. Gracious Heaven! how impoſſible to diſbelieve her truth at the very moment her gentle ſpirit ſeemed about to take its flight to Heaven! From that period ſhe has ſtood acquitted in my mind, and from that period I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to develope, to the utmoſt of my power, the machinations which had made me doubt her innocence. My ſucceſs in their developement has been beyond my expectations; but Providence is on the ſide of ſuffering virtue, and aſſiſts thoſe who ſtand up in its ſupport."</p>
                           <p>"Contrary to my firſt intention, my dear Amanda, I have given you a ſketch of part of our converſation: For the remainder it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs perſevered in declaring I had bribed her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to blacken her character, in order to clear Miſs Fitzalan's, an attempt ſhe repeatedly aſſured me I would find unſucceſsful."</p>
                           <p>The Marquis talked in high terms of the dignity of his houſe, and how impoſſible it was the Marchioneſs ſhould ever have diſgraced it by ſuch actions as I accuſed her of committing. I anſwered him in a manner equally warm, that my accuſations were too well grounded and ſupported to dread refutation; that it was not only due to injured innocence, but eſſential to my own honour,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:038416_0462_1011E5418FB15580"/>
which would ſoon be materially concerned in whatever related to Miſs Fitzalan, to have thoſe accuſations made public, if her Ladyſhip refuſed to contradict the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which might be thrown upon Miſs Fitzalan, in conſequence of the ſcene which paſſed at his Lordſhip's houſe.</p>
                           <p>This the Marchioneſs, with mingled rage and contempt, refuſed doing, and Lady Euphraſia, after the hint I gave of ſoon being united to you, left the room in convulſive agitation.</p>
                           <p>Lord Cherbury I perceived ſuſpected ſoul play, by ſome ſpeeches which dropped from him, ſuch as, if there had been any miſunderſtanding between her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip and Miſs Fitzalan, it was better ſurely to have it done away, or certainly, if any miſtake was proved relative to the affair which happened in her Ladyſhip's houſe, it was but juſtice to the young Lady to have it cleared up.</p>
                           <p>Yet notwithſtanding the intereſt he felt in the cauſe of ſuffering innocence, it was obvious to me that he dreaded a rupture with the Marquis's family, and appeared ſhocked at the unequivocal declaration I had made of never being allied to it.</p>
                           <p>Lady Martha Dormer took up the cauſe: The teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony Lord Mortimer had received, ſhe ſaid, of Miſs Fitzalan's innocence was incontrovertible, and exempted him alike from being ſtigmatized either as the dupe of art or love; humanity ſhe was convinced, excluſive of every warmer feeling, would have influenced him to have undertaken Miſs Fitzalan's cauſe; it was the cauſe of innocence and virtue, a cauſe in which every deteſter of ſcandal and treachery ſhould join, ſince not only the defenceleſs orphan, but the protected child of rank and proſperity were vulnerable to their ſhafts.</p>
                           <p>I again repeated the evidence of her ſervants, and the refutation of Mrs. Jennings to her former ſtory; I produced, to ſtrengthen it, the unopened letters of Colonel Belgrave—thus continuing to put proof upon proof of your innocence (as Sancho Panza ſays) upon the ſhoulders of demonſtration.</p>

The paſſions of the Marchioneſs roſe at laſt to frantic violence. She perſiſted in alledging her inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and villifying your's; but with a countenance ſo legibly impreſſed with guilt and confuſion, that a doubt of her falſhood could not be entertained even by thoſe who wiſhed to doubt it.</p>
                           <p>The ſcene of violence we now became witneſs to was painful to me, and ſhocking to Lady Martha: I therefore ordered the horſes immediately to her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's chariot, in which, accompanied by me, ſhe had preceded Lord Cherbury's coach, from the idea that our continuance at the villa might not be quite ſo long as his Lordſhip's.</p>
                           <p>As we expected, his Lordſhip ſtaid behind, with the hope I perceived of being able to calm the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the Marchioneſs, and leſſen the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. He returned the next day to town. I have ſo long dwelt upon diſagreeable ſcenes, that to go over any others would be dreadful; nor ſhould I hint to you that I had ſuch ſcenes to encounter, was it not to excuſe and account to you for my abſence from Caſtle Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry: our difficulties (you ſee I already unite your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with mine) began to decreaſe, and are at laſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ovorcome.

But ere I cloſe my letter, I muſt inform you that, knowing you could never be ſelfiſhly wrapped up in your own enjoyments, I made every poſſible enquiry relative to your brother, and was at length referred by the agent of his late regiment to an officer in it: with ſome difficulty I found he had quitted his quarters on leave of abſence. I wrote immediately to his family reſidence, and after waiting long and impatiently for an anſwer to my letter, I diſpatched a ſpecial meſſenger to learn whether he was there or not. The courier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a polite note from the officer's father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me his ſon was gone on an excurſion of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with ſome friends, and that if he knew where to find him he would have tranſmitted my letter, which I might depend on being anſwered the moment he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
                           <p>I have no doubt but we ſhall receive intelligence from him concerning Mr. Fitzalan; it ſhall then be our buſineſs, if his ſituation is not already pleaſing, to change it, or render it as much ſo as poſſible to him.</p>
                           <p>Keep up your ſpirits therefore about him, for by the time we arrive in England I expect a letter from his friend, and let me not be any more pained by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your countenance clouded with care or anxiety.</p>
                           <p>As a reward for reining in my impatience to ſee you this evening, be propitious to my requeſt for early admiſſion to-morrow; if charitable you will allow me to breakfaſt with you, for I ſhall take none except with you, and without an expreſs command to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſhall take it for granted I am expected.</p>
                           <p>'Tis ſaid that contraſt heightens pleaſure, and I believe the ſaying. I believe that without having felt pain in all its accuteneſs as I have done, I never ſhould have felt ſuch pleaſure as I now enjoy. After ſo often giving you up, ſo often lamenting you as loſt foever, to think I ſhall ſoon call you mine, is a ſource of tranſport which words cannot expreſs. Mine, I may ſay, is the reſurrection of happineſs, for has it not been revived from the very grave of deſpair; but I forget that you have Lady Martha Dormer's letter ſtill to peruſe. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that, for old friendſhip's ſake I ſuppoſed you
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:038416_0465_1011E5499807A838"/>
would give mine the preference; but in all reaſon it is time I ſhould reſign my place to her Ladyſhip: But ere I bid you adieu, I muſt tell you that Araminta is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere participator in our happineſs; ſhe arrived from Wales but a few minutes previous to my leaving Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and I would not allow her time, as ſhe wiſhed, to write to you. I almoſt forgot to tell you, that the Marquis's family, amongſt whom Lady Greyſtock is ſtill numbered, inſtead of returning to town, ſet out for Brighthelmſtone: I have learned, contrary to my and their expectations, that neither the houſe keeper nor Mrs. Jane have been diſmiſſed, but both ſent to a diſtant ſeat of the Marquis's. As we know the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs's revengeful diſpoſition, it is plain ſhe has ſome ſecret motive for not gratifying it immediately by their diſmiſſion; but what it is can be of little conſequence for us to learn, ſince we are both too well guarded to ſuffer from any future plot of her's; like every other which was formed againſt my dear Amanda, I truſt they will ever prove abortive. I was diſturbed within a few miles of Caſtle Carberry by a gentleman paſſing on horſeback, who either ſtrongly reſembled, or was Colonel Belgrave. My blood boiled in my veins at his ſight; I left the carriage, mounted one of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's horſes, and endeavoured to overtake him. He certainly avoided me by taking ſome croſs-road, as his ſpeed could not have out-ſtripped mine; my efforts to diſcover his habitation were equally unſucceſsful. As to your perſonal ſecurity I had no apprehenſions, having heard conſtantly from my good friend the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor about you; but I dreaded the wretch, if it were really him, might diſturb your tranquillity, either by forcing into your preſence or writing; thank Heaven from all intruſions or dangers of this kind, my Amanda will now be guarded; but again am I treſpaſſing on the time you ſhould devote to Lady Martha's letter. Adieu, and do not diſappoint my hopes of being allowed to viſit you early.</p>

Amanda peruſed this letter with emotions which can be better conceived than deſcribed. She could ſcarcely have parted with it without a ſecond reading, had not Lady Martha's demanded her attention; ſhe ſnatched it haſtly from the ground where it hitherto lay neglected, and read to the following purpoſe:</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>That I warmly and ſincerely congratulate my dear and amiable Miſs Fitzalan on the happy revolution in her affairs ſhe will readily believe, perſuaded as ſhe muſt be of the deep intereſt I take in whatever concerns a perſon on whom the happineſs of him, whom I have loved from childhood, ſo materially, ſo entirely I may ſay depends.</p>
                           <p>Yet do not ſuppoſe me, my dear Miſs Fitzalan, ſo ſelfiſh, as not to be able to rejoice at your happineſs on your own account, excluſive of every conſideration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to Lord Mortimer; long ſince I was taught by deſcription to eſteem and admire you, and even when the hope of being connected with you became extinct, I could not ſo totally forego that admiration as to feel unintereſted about you. Oh! how truly do I rejoice at the revival of the hope I have juſt mentioned, and at its revival with every proſpect of its being ſpeedily realized. I ſhall conſider Lord Mortimer as one of the moſt fortunate of men in calling you his, and to think I have been able to promote his happineſs gives me a ſatisfaction, which never was, nor ever will be equalled by any circumſtance in my life.</p>
                           <p>Though I cannot give my adopted daughter a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by any means equal to that which Lady Euphraſia Southerland will poſſeſs, Lord Cherbury is fully ſenſible that her perfections will abundantly make up for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiciency in this reſpect. Ten thouſand pounds, and one thouſand a year, is at preſent to be her portion, and the reverſion of the remainder of my fortune is to be ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her and Lord Mortimer; the final adjuſtment of all affairs is to take place at my houſe in the country, whither, I propoſe going immediately, accompanied by Lady Araminta, and where we ſhall both moſt impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently expect your arrival, which we mutually entreat

may be haſtened as much as poſſible, conſiſtent with your health and convenience; Lord Cherbury has promiſed to follow us in a few days, ſo that I ſuppoſe he will alſo be at Thornbury to receive you. Would to Heaven, my dear Miſs Fitzalan, injured virtue and innocence, may always meet with ſuch champions to vindicate them as Lord Mortimer; was that the caſe we ſhould ſee many lovely victims of ſcorn and reproach raiſing their heads with triumph and ſatisfaction; But pardon my involuntarily adverting to paſt ſcenes, though at the ſame time I think you have reaſon to rejoice at your trials, which ſerved as ſo many teſts and proofs of the eſtimable qualities you poſſeſs. Farewel, my dear Miſs Fitzalan; I have been brief in my letter, becauſe I know I ſhould not be pardoned by a certain perſon, if I engroſſed too much of your time. I told him I would give you a hint of the impetuoſity of his diſpoſition; but he told me, perhaps to prevent this, that you were already acquainted with it. In one inſtance I ſhall commend him for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing it, that is, in haſtening you to Thornbury, to the arms of your affectionate friend,</p>

                     <p>Amanda's happineſs was now almoſt as great as it could be in this world, almoſt I ſay, for it received al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy, from the melancholy conſideration that her father, that faithful and affectionate friend who had ſhared her troubles, could not be a partaker of her joys; but the ſigh of unavailing regret which roſe in her mind ſhe checked, by reflecting, that happineſs all perfect was more than humanity could either ſupport or expect, and with pious gratitude ſhe bent to the power who had changed the diſcoloured proſpect, by which ſhe had been ſo long ſurrounded, into one of cheerfulneſs and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>If her pride was wounded by the hint, though ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately conveyed, which Lord Mortimer had given of the difficulties he encountered in gaining Lord Cherbury's approbation, it was inſtantly relieved by the flattering commendations of lady Martha Dormer, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:038416_0468_1011E551ADEF9138"/>
with her and Lady Araminta, ſhe looked upon amongſt the moſt valuable bleſſings ſhe could enjoy.</p>
                     <p>To expreſs what ſhe felt for Lord Mortimer would be impoſſible; language could not do juſtice to her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſhe felt love gratitude and admiration for him all in the fulleſt extent, and all united, and ſhe wept in the fulneſs of her heart over the joyful aſſurance of being his. With the two letters in her hand ſhe repaired to the Prioreſs's apartment, whom ſhe found alone. The good old lady ſaw the traces of tears on Amanda's face and exclaimed, in a voice which evinced her ſympathy in her concerns, "Oh! I fear, my child, ſomething has happened to diſturb you!" Amanda preſented her the letters, and bid her judge from them whether ſhe had not reaſon to be agitated. As the Prioreſs read, her ſudden and broken exclamations manifeſted her ſurpriſe and pleaſure, and frequently were her ſpectacles removed to wipe from off them the tears of joy by which they were bedewed. When ſhe finiſhed the welcome pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, ſhe turned to Amanda, who had been attentively watching the various turns in her countenance, and gave her a congratulatory embrace. "Lord Mortimer is worthy of you, my child," ſaid the Prioreſs, "and that is the higheſt eulogium I can paſs on him." After commenting upon different parts of the letter, ſhe aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Amanda, a little archly, "whether ſhe intended ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an expreſs command to his Lordſhip aginſt coming early in the morning?" Amanda honeſtly confeſſed ſhe had no ſuch intention, and expreſſed her wiſh to behold him. The Prioreſs ſaid ſhe would have breakfaſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them in the garden parlour, and that ſhe would take care they ſhould not be interrupted. She alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to keep every thing ſecret till matters were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged for Amanda's removal from St. Catherine's.</p>

                     <p>JOY is as great an enemy to repoſe as anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Amanda paſſed an almoſt ſleepleſs night, but her thoughts were too agreeably employed to allow her to ſuffer for want of reſt; early as ſhe aroſe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe was but a ſhort time in the parlour before Lord Mortimer arrived. He appeared with all the tranſports of his ſoul beaming from his eyes, and was received by Amanda with tender and trembling emotion. He caught her to his heart as a treaſure reſtored to him by the immediate hand of Heaven. He preſſed her to it with ſilent ec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>acy. Both for a few moments were unable to ſpeak; but the tears which burſt from Amanda, and thoſe that ſtopped on the glowing cheeks of Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, expreſſed their feelings more forcibly than any language could have done.</p>
                     <p>Amanda at length found utterance, and began to thank his Lordſhip for all the difficulties he had gone through in vindicating her fame. He haſtily ſtopped thoſe effuſions of gratitude, by bidding her aſk her heart whether he had not been ſerving himſelf as well as her by what he had done.</p>
                     <p>From the ſoft confuſion into which his tranſports threw her, Amanda endeavoured to recover herſelf by repairing to the breakfaſt table, on which the good ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had ſpread all the niceties (adapted for a morning repaſt) which the Convent could produce; but her hand was unſteady, ſhe ſpilt the tea in pouring it out, and committed twenty blunders in helping Lord Mortimer.
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:038416_0470_1011E557B1D9A860"/>
He laughed a little archly at her embarraſſment, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> inſiſted on doing the honours of the table himſelf, to which Amanda, with a deep bluſh conſented; but breakfaſt was little attended to. Amanda's hand was detained in Lord Mortimer's, while his eyes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually turning towards her, as if to aſſure his heart that, in the lovely evidence of his happineſs there was no deception; and the tenderneſs Amanda had no longer reaſon to reſtrain, beamed from her looks, which alſo evinced her perfect ſenſibility of her preſent felicity—a felicity heightened by her approving conſcience teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe had merited it. The pure, the delightful ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction reſulting from this reflection gave ſuch radiance to her complexion, that Lord Mortimer repeatedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her reſidence at St. Catherine's had made her more beautiful than ever. Twelve o'clock ſtruck, and found them ſtill loitering over the breakfaſt table. "The Nuns will think we have made a tolerable feaſt," cried Lord Mortimer, ſmiling, while Amanda aroſe with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation. "I need not," continued he, following her, "like Sterne, aſk nature what has made the meal ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious: I need only aſk my own heart and it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me love and tenderneſs."—Amanda bluſhed, and they went together into the garden.

with her at Thornbury; Lord Mortimer ſaid he had his choice of any of the Earl's ſeats, but choſe none, from an idea of the hall being more agreeable to Amanda. She aſſured him it was, and he proceeded to mention the preſents which Lady Martha had prepared for her; alſo the carriages and retinue he had provided, and expected to find at Thornbury againſt ſhe reached it, ſtill aſking if the arrangements he had made met her approbation.</p>
                     <p>Amanda was affected even to tears, by the ſolicitude he ſhewed to pleaſe her, and he perceiving her emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, changed the diſcourſe to talk about her removal from St. Catherine's, he entreated her not to delay it longer than was abſolutely neceſſary to adjuſt matters for it. She promiſed compliance to this entreaty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleging that ſhe but obeyed her inclination<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> in doing ſo, as ſhe longed to be preſented to her generous patroneſs, Lady Martha, and to her amiable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Lady Araminta.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer, delicately conſiderate about all which concerned her, begged ſhe would ſpeak to the prioreſs to procure a decent female, who ſhould be a proper attendant for her journey; they ſhould travel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one chaiſe, and he would follow them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Amanda promiſed ſhe would loſe no time in making this requeſt, which, ſhe had no doubt, would be ſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer preſented her with a very beautiful embroidered purſe, containing notes to the amount of five hundred pounds. Amanda bluſhed deeply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and felt her feelings a little hurt at the idea of being obliged to Lord Mortimer for every thing. He preſſed her hand, and, in a voice of ſoothing tenderneſs, told her he ſhould be offended if ſhe did not from this moment conſider her intereſt inſeparable from his. The notes, he ſaid, of right belonged to her, as they amounted to but the individual ſum he had already devoted to her uſe. He requeſted ſhe would not curb in the leaſt her gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit, but fulfil in the utmoſt extent, all the claims which gratitude had upon her. The benevolent ſiſters of St. Catherine's were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

who had conferred obligations upon her, and he deſired ſhe would not only reward them liberally at preſent, but promiſe them an annual ſtipend of fifty pounds.</p>
                     <p>Amanda was truly delighted at this, to be able to contribute to the comfort of thoſe who had ſo largely promoted her's, was a ſource of exquiſite felicity. Lord Mortimer preſented her with his picture, which he had drawn in London for that purpoſe; it was a ſtriking likeneſs and moſt elegantly ſet with brilliants, which formed a cypher upon a plait of hair at the back. This was indeed a precious preſent to Amanda, and ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it was ſuch. Lord Mortimer ſaid, that in return for it, he ſhould expect her's at ſome future time; but added, ſmiling, "I ſhall not heed the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow till I procure the ſubſtance." He alſo gave her a very beautiful ring, with an emblematical device, and adorned in the ſame manner as his picture, which lady Martha had ſent as a pledge of future friendſhip; and he now informed her, that her Ladyſhip, accompanied by Lady Araminta, intended meeting them at Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that all due honour and attention might be paid to her adopted daughter.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of their converſation the dinner bell rang from the Convent. Amanda ſtarted, and declared ſhe had not ſuppoſed it half ſo late.—The arch ſmile, which this ſpeech occaſioned in Lord Mortimer, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made her perceive it had been a tacit confeſſion of the pleaſure ſhe enjoyed in their tete-a-tete.</p>
                     <p>She bluſhed, and telling him ſhe could not ſtay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moment, was hurrying away. He haſtily caught her, and holding both her hands, declared ſhe ſhould not depart, neither would he to his ſolitary dinner, till ſhe promiſed he might return to her early in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. To this ſhe conſented, provided he allowed her to have the Prioreſs and ſiſter Mary at leaſt at tea. This was a condition Lord Mortimer by no means liked to agree to, and he endeavoured to prevail on her to drop it; but finding her inflexible, he ſaid ſhe was a provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing girl, and aſked her if ſhe was not afraid that, when he had the power, he would retaliate upon her for all
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:038416_0473_1011E55D97EB0FE8"/>
the trials ſhe had put his patience to; but ſince ſhe would have it ſo, why it muſt be ſo to be ſure, he ſaid; but he hoped the good ladies would have too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſit out the whole evening with them. That was all chance, Amanda ſaid. The bell again rang, and he was forced to depart.</p>
                     <p>She took the opportunity of being alone with the Prioreſs for a few minutes, to ſpeak to her about procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a female to attend her in her journey. The Prioreſs ſaid, ſhe doubted not but ſhe could procure her an eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible perſon from the neighbouring town, and promiſed to write there that very evening, to a family who would be able to aſſiſt her enquiries.</p>
                     <p>Both ſhe and ſiſter Mary were much pleaſed by being invited to drink tea with Lord Mortimer. He came even earlier than was expected. Poor Amanda was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, leaſt her companions ſhould over-hear him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly aſking her whether they would not retire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after tea? Though not over-heard, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oreſs had too much ſagacity not to know her departure was deſired; ſhe therefore, under pretence of buſineſs, retired and took Mary along with her. Amanda and Lord Mortimer went into the garden. He thanked her for not loſing time in ſpeaking to the prioreſs about her ſervant, and ſaid, that he hoped, at the end of the week, at fartheſt, ſhe would be able to begin her journey. Amanda readily promiſed to uſe all poſſible diſpatch They paſſed ſome delightful hours in rambling about the garden, and talking over their felicity.</p>
                     <p>The Prioreſs's expectation was anſwered relative to a ſervant; in the courſe of two days ſhe produced one in every reſpect agreeable to Amanda, and things were now in ſuch forwardneſs for her departure, that ſhe expected it would take place as ſoon as Lord Mortimer had mentioned. His time was paſſed almoſt continually at St. Catherine's, never leaving it except at dinner-time, when he went to Caſtle Carberry: His reſidence there was ſoon known, and viſitors and invitations without number came to the Caſtle, but he found means of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>

                     <p>Lord Mortimer, on coming to Amanda one evening as uſual, appeared uncommonly diſcompoſed, his face was fluſhed, and his whole manner betrayed agitation. He ſcarcely noticed Amanda; but ſeating himſelf, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his arm upon a table, and leaned his head deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly upon it. Amanda was inexpreſſibly ſhocked, her heart panted with apprehenſion of ill, but ſhe felt too timid to make an enquiry. He ſuddenly knit his brows, and muttered between his teeth, "curſe on the wretch."</p>
                     <p>Amanda could no longer keep ſilence: "What wretch?" ſhe exclaimed, "or what is the meaning of this diſorder?</p>
                     <p>"Firſt tell me, Amanda," ſaid he looking very ſtedfaſtly at her, "have you ſeen any ſtranger here lately?"</p>
                     <p>"Good heavens!" replied ſhe "what can you mean by ſuch a queſtion? but I ſolemnly aſſure you I have not."</p>
                     <p>"Enough," ſaid he, "ſuch an aſſurance reſtores me to quiet; but, my dear Amanda," coming over to her, and taking her hands in his, "ſince you have perceived my agitation, I muſt account to you for it. I have juſt ſeen Belgrave; he was but a few yards from me on the common when I ſaw him; but the mean deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable wretch, loaded as he is with conſcious guilt, durſt not face me; he got out of my way by leaping over the hedge, which divides the common from a lane with many intricate windings: I endeavoured, but without ſucceſs, to diſcover the one he had retreated through."</p>
                     <p>"I ſee," ſaid Amanda, pale and trembling, "he is deſtined to make me wretched. I had hoped indeed that Lord Mortimer would no more have ſuffered his quiet to be interrupted by him; it implies ſuch a doubt," ſaid ſhe, weeping, "as ſhocks my ſoul!

once, for miſery muſt be the conſequence of an union without mutual confidence.</p>
                     <p>"Gracious Heaven!" ſaid Lord Mortimer, "how unfortunate I am to give you pain! You miſtake entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, indeed, my deareſt Amanda, the cauſe of my unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; I ſwear by all that is ſacred, no doubt, no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of your worth has ariſen in my mind. No man can think more highly of a woman than I do of you; but I was diſturbed leſt the wretch ſhould have forced himſelf into your preſence, and leſt you, through ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions for me, concealed it from me."</p>
                     <p>The explanation calmed the perturbation of Amanda; as an atonement for the uneaſineſs he had given her, ſhe wanted Lord Mortimer to promiſe he would not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſcover Belgrave. This promiſe he avoided giving, and Amanda was afraid of preſſing it, leſt the ſpark of jealouſy, which ſhe was convinced exiſted in the diſpoſition of Lord Mortimer, ſhould be blown into a flame; that Belgrave would ſtudiouſly avoid him ſhe truſted, and ſhe reſolved, that if the things that ſhe had deemed it neceſſary to order from the neighbouring town, were not finiſhed, to wait no longer for them, as ſhe longed now more than ever to quit a place ſhe thought dangerous to Lord Mortimer. The enſuing morning, inſtead of ſeeing his Lordſhip at breakfaſt, a note was brought to her, couched in theſe words:</p>

                     <p>This note filled Amanda with the moſt alarming diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet; it was evident to her that he was gone in purſuit
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:038416_0476_1011E5669918F510"/>
of Belgrave. She ran into the hall to enquire of the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger about his maſter, but he was gone. She then haſtened to the Prioreſs, and communicated her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions to her. The Prioreſs endeavoured to calm them, by aſſuring her ſhe might be convinced that Belgrave had taken too many precautions to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                     <p>Amanda's breakfaſt, however, remained untouched, and her things unpacked, and ſhe continued the whole morning the picture of anxiety, impatiently expecting the promiſed viſit or letter; neither came and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſend, after dinner, the old gardner to Caſtle Carberry to enquire after Lord Mortimer. While ſhe was ſpeaking to him for that purpoſe, the maid followed her into the garden, and told her there was a meſſenger in the parlour from Lord Mortimer. She flew thither, but what words can expreſs her ſurpriſe, when the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed meſſenger raiſing a large hat which ſhadowed his face, and removing a handkerchief which he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto held up to it, diſcovered to her view the features of Lord Cherbury. She could only exclaim, "Gracious Heaven has any thing happened to Lord Mortimer?" ere ſhe ſunk into a chair in breathleſs agitation.</p>

                     <p>LORD Cherbury haſtened to ſupport and calm her agitation, by aſſuring her Lord Mortimer was in perfect ſafety. Recovering a little by this aſſertion, ſhe aſked him how he was aſſured of this. He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he had ſeen him, though without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:038416_0477_1011E56921028408"/>
by him, about an hour ago. Amanda, reſtored to her faculties, by being aſſured he was uninjured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reflect on the ſuddenneſs of Lord Cherbury's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. She would have flattered herſelf he came to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her to his family himſelf had not his looks almoſt forbid ſuch an idea; they were gloomy and diſordered, his eyes were faſtened on her, yet he appeared unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>Amanda felt herſelf in too aukward and embarraſſing a ſituation to break the unpleaſant ſilence. At laſt Lord Cherbury ſuddenly exclaimed: "Lord Mortimer does not, nor muſt not, know of my being here."</p>
                     <p>"Muſt not!" repeated Amanda, in inconceivable aſtoniſhment.</p>
                     <p>"Gracious Heaven!" ſaid Lord Cherbury, ſtarting from the chair on which he had thrown himſelf, oppoſite to her, "how ſhall I begin, how ſhall I tell her? Oh! Miſs Fitzalan," he continued, approaching her, "I have much to ſay, and you have much to hear, which will ſhock you, I believed I could better in an interview have informed you of particulars, but I find I was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. I will write to you."</p>
                     <p>"My Lord," cried Amanda, riſing, all pale and trembling, "tell me now, to leave me in ſuſpence, after receiving ſuch dreadful hints, would be cruelty. Oh! ſurely, if Lord Mortimer be ſafe—if Lady Martha Dormer—if Lady Araminta is well—I can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo very ſhocking to hear."</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" replied he, mournfully ſhaking his head, "you are miſtaken; be ſatisfied, however, that the friends you have mentioned are all well. I have ſaid I would write to you. Can you meet me this evening amongſt the ruins?" Amanda gave an aſſenting bow. "I ſhall then," purſued he, "have a letter ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you. In the mean time I muſt inform you, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world knows of my viſit here but yourſelf, and of all beings, Lord Mortimer is the laſt I ſhould wiſh to know it. Remember, then, Miſs Fitzalan," ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her hand, which he graſped with violence, as if to
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:038416_0478_1011E56CC8040468"/>
impreſs his words upon her heart, "remember, that on your ſecreſy every thing moſt eſtimable in life, even life itſelf perhaps depends."</p>
                     <p>With theſe dreadful and myſterious words he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leaving Amanda a picture of horror and ſurprize; it was many minutes ere ſhe moved from the attitude in which he laft her, and when ſhe did, it was only to walk in a diſordered manner about the room repeating his dreadful words. He was come perhaps to part her and Lord Mortimer, and yet, after conſenting to their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſurely Lord Cherbury could not be guilty of ſuch treachery and deceit; yet, this was not the caſe, why conceal his coming to Ireland from Lord Mortimer? Why let it be known only to her? And what could be the ſecrets of dreadful import he had to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate?</p>
                     <p>From theſe ſelf-interrogations, in which her reaſon was almoſt bewildered, the entrance of the Prioreſs drew her.</p>
                     <p>She ſtarted at ſeeing the pale and diſtracted looks of Amanda, and aſked, "if ſhe had heard any bad tidings of Lord Mortimer?"</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſighed heavily at this queſtion, and ſaid, "No." The ſecreſy ſhe had been ejoined ſhe durſt not violate, by mentioning the myſterious viſit to her friend; unable, however to converſe on any other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſhe reſolved to retire to her chamber. She placed her illneſs and agitation to the account of Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſaid a little reſt was abſolutely neceſſary for her, and begged, if his Lordſhip came in the courſe of the evening, he might be told ſhe was too ill to ſee him.</p>
                     <p>The Prioreſs preſſed her to ſtay for tea. She refuſed, and as ſhe retired from the room, deſired nothing might be ſaid of the perſon who had juſt ſeen her, to Lord Mortimer; ſaying, with a faint ſmile, "ſhe would not make him vain by letting him know of her anxiety about him." She retired to her chamber, and endeavoured to controul her perturbations, that ſhe might be the better
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038416_0479_1011E56E57DFF428"/>
enabled to ſupport what ſhe had ſo much reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. Neither the Prioreſs nor the nuns, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to her injunctions intruded upon her, and at the appointed hour ſhe ſoftly opened the chamber door, and, every place being clear, ſtole ſoftly from the Convent.</p>
                     <p>She found Lord Cherbury waiting for her amidſt the ſolitary ruins. He had a letter in his hand, which he preſented to her the moment ſhe appeared.</p>
                     <p>"In this letter, Miſs Fitzalan, ſaid he, "I have opened to you my whole heart: I have diſburthened it of ſecrets which have long oppreſſed it; I have entruſted my honour to your care. From what I have ſaid, that its contents are of a ſacred nature, you may believe, ſhould they be conſidered in any other light by you, the conſequences may, nay muſt be fatal." He ſaid this with a ſterneſs which made Amanda ſhrink, "Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate well on the contents of that letter, Miſs Fitzalan," continued he, with a voice of deep ſolemnity, "for it is a letter which will fix your deſtiny and mine; even ſhould the requeſt contained in it be refuſed, let me be the firſt acquainted with the refuſal;—then indeed I ſhall urge you no more to ſecreſy, for what will follow in conſequence of ſuch a refuſal, muſt divulge all."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! tell me, tell me," ſaid Amanda, catching hold of his arm, "tell me what is the requeſt, or what it is I am to fear: Oh! tell me all at once, and rid me of the torturing ſuſpence I endure."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot," he cried, "indeed I cannot. To-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row night I ſhall expect your anſwer here at the ſame hour."</p>
                     <p>At this moment Lord Mortimer's voice calling upon Amanda was heard. Lord Cherbury dropped her hand which he had taken, and inſtantly retired amongſt the windings of the pile, from whence Lord Mortimer ſoon appeared, giving Amanda only time to hide the fatal letter.</p>
                     <p>"Good Heaven!" exclaimed he, "what could have brought you hither, and who was the perſon who juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from you?" It was well for Amanda that the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:038416_0480_1011E57130732708"/>
twilight gave but an imperfect view of her face; ſhe felt her colour come and go; a cold dew overſpread her forehead; ſhe leaned againſt a rude fragment of the building and faintly exclaimed, "the perſon—"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid Lord Mortimer, "I am ſure I heard retreating footſteps."</p>
                     <p>"You are miſtaken," re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eated Amanda in the ſame faint accent.</p>
                     <p>"Well," ſaid he, "though you may diſpute the evidence of my ears, you cannot the evidence of my eyes; I ſee you here, and am aſtoniſhed at it."</p>
                     <p>"I came here for air," ſaid Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"For air," repeated Lord Mortimer, "I own I ſhould have thought the garden better adapted to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but why come hither in a clandeſtine manner? Why, if you have the fears you would perſuade me you have, expoſe yourſelf to danger from the wretch who haunts the place, by coming here alone? When I went to the convent I was told you were indiſpoſed, and could not be diſturbed: I could not depart, however, without making an effort to ſee you; but you can eaſier imagine than I deſcribe, the conſternation I felt when you could not be found; it was wrong, indeed, Amanda, it was wrong to come here alone, and affect concealment."</p>
                     <p>"Gracious Heaven!" ſaid Amanda, raiſing her hands and eyes, and burſting into tears, "how wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed am I!"</p>
                     <p>She was indeed at this moment ſuperlatively wretched; her heart was oppreſſed by the dread of evil, and ſhe perceived ſuſpicions in Lord Mortimer which ſhe could not attempt to remove, leaſt an intimation of the ſecret ſhe was ſo awfully enjoined to keep ſhould eſcape.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! Amanda," ſaid Lord Mortimer, loſing in a moment the aſperity with which he had addreſſed her at firſt, "ah! Amanda, like the reſt of your ſex, you know too well the power of your tears not to uſe them. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, or at leaſt forgive, all I have ſaid. I was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in not ſeeing you the moment I expected, and that put me out of temper. I know I am too impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but you will in time ſubdue every unruly paſſion; I
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:038416_0481_1011E574F011C170"/>
put myſelf into your hands, and you ſhall make me what you pleaſe."</p>
                     <p>He now preſſed her to his boſom, and finding her tremble univerſally, again implored her forgiveneſs, as he imputed the agitation ſhe betrayed entirely to the uneaſineſs he had given her. She aſſured him, with a faultering voice, he had not offended her. Her Spirits were affected, ſhe ſaid, by all ſhe had ſuffered during the day: Lord Mortimer placing, as ſhe wiſhed, thoſe ſufferings to his own account, declared her anxiety at once pained and pleaſed him, adding, he would truly confeſs what detained him from her during the day, as ſoon as they returned to the Convent.</p>
                     <p>Their return to it relieved the ſiſterhood, who had alſo been ſeeking Amanda, from many apprehenſions. The Prioreſs and ſiſter Mary followed them into the parlour, where Lord Mortimer begged, "they would have compaſſion on him, and give him ſomething for his ſupper, as he had ſcarcely eaten any thing the whole day."</p>
                     <p>Siſter Mary inſtantly replied, "He ſhould be gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Amanda was in the ſame predicament, and ſhe hoped he would now be able to prevail on her to eat." The cloth was accordingly laid, and a few trifles placed upon it. Siſter Mary would gladly have ſtaid, but the Prioreſs had underſtanding enough to think the ſupper would be more palatable if they were abſent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly retired.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer now, with the moſt ſoothing tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tried to cheer his fair companion, and make her take ſome refreſhment; but his efforts for either of thoſe purpoſes were unſucceſsful, and ſhe beſought him not to think her obſtinate, if ſhe could not in a moment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her ſpirits; to divert his attention a little from herſelf ſhe aſked him to perform his promiſe, by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what kept him the whole day from St. Catherine's.</p>
                     <p>He now acknowledged he had been in ſearch of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave; but the precautions he had taken to conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf baffled all enquiries; "which convinces me," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Lord Mortimer, "if I wanted conviction about
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:038416_0482_1011E5779B9D0BC8"/>
ſuch a matter, that he has not yet dropped his villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſigns upon you: but the wretch cannot always eſcape the vengeance he merits."</p>
                     <p>"May he never," cried Amanda fervently, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily, "meet it from your hands."</p>
                     <p>"We will drop that part of the ſubject," ſaid Lord Mortimer, "if you pleaſe. You muſt know," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, "after ſcouring the whole neighbourhood, I fell in about four miles hence with a gentleman, who had viſited at the Marquis of Roſline's laſt ſummer: he immediately aſked me to accompany him home to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. From his reſidence in the country I thought it probable he might be able to give ſome account of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, and therefore accepted the invitation, but my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries were as fruitleſs here as elſewhere. When I found it ſo I was on thorns to depart, particularly as all the gentlemen were ſet in for drinking, and feared I might be thrown into an improper ſituation to viſit my Amanda; I was on the watch, however, and to uſe their ſporting term, literally ſtole away.</p>
                     <p>"Thank Heaven!" ſaid Amanda, "your enquiries proved fruitleſs. Oh! never, never repeat them; think no more about a wretch ſo deſpicable."</p>
                     <p>"Well," cried Lord Mortimer, "why don't you hurry me from the neighbourhood; fix the day, the moment for our departure: I have been here already five days. Lady Martha's patience is, I dare ſay quite exhauſted by this time, and ſhould we delay much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I ſuppoſe ſhe will think we have both became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to the holy rites of this convent, and that I, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of taking the vows, which ſhould make me a joyful bridegroom, am about taking thoſe which ſhall doom me to celibacy; ſeriouſly, what but want of inclination can longer detain you!"</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" ſaid Amanda, "you know too well that my departure cannot be retarded by want of inclination."</p>
                     <p>"Then why not decide immediately upon the day?" Amanda was ſilent; her ſituation was agonizing; how could ſhe fix upon a day, uncertain whether ſhe did not
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:038416_0483_1011E57929B258D0"/>
poſſeſs a letter which would prevent her ever taking the projected journey?"</p>
                     <p>"Well," ſaid Lord Mortimer, after allowing her ſome time to ſpeak, "I ſee I muſt fix the day myſelf; this is Tueſday—let it be Thurſday."</p>
                     <p>"Let us drop the ſubject this night, my Lord," ſaid Amanda, "I am really ill, and only wait for your departure to retire to reſt."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer obeyed her, but with reluctance, and ſoon after retired.</p>

mankind, wretched in thinking he ſhall interrupt not only your peace, but the peace of a ſon, ſo noble, ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſo idolized, as Mortimer is by him; but I will no longer torture your feelings by keeping you in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; the preface I have already given is ſufficient, and I will be explicit: Gambling, that bane of fame and fortune, has been my ruin; but whilſt I indulged, ſo well did I conceal my propenſity for it, that even thoſe I called my friends are ignorant of it. With ſhame I confeſs I was ever foremoſt to rail againſt this vice, which was continually drawing ſums in ſecret from me, that would have given comfort and affluence to many a child of want for ſome time; my good and bad fortune were ſo equal, that my income ſuffered no conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution. About five years ago a Mr. Freelove, a particular friend of mine died, and left to my care his only ſon, who, I dare ſay, you may recollect having ſeen at my houſe laſt winter: this young man's property was conſigned to my care to manage as much for his advantage as I could; it conſiſted of a large eſtate, and fifty thouſand pounds. At the period Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love became my ward, I had had a conſtant run of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luck for many months. The ardour of gaining (unlike every other paſſion) is rather increaſed than diminiſhed by diſappointment: without being warned therefore by ill ſucceſs I ſtill went on, till all I could touch of my own property was gone. Did I then retire, aſhamed of my folly?—No—I could not bear to do ſo, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other effort for recovering my loſſes, and in that effort riſked ſomething more precious than I had ever yet done—namely, my honour, by uſing the money which lay in my hands belonging to Freelove, the long period, which was to elapſe ere he came of age, emboldened me to this. Ere that period I truſted I ſhould have retrieved my loſſes, and be enabled not only to diſcharge the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, but whatever intereſt it would have brought, if applied to another purpoſe. I followed the bent of my evil genius, ſum after ſum taken up, and all alike buried in the accurſed vortex which had already ſwallowed ſo
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:038416_0485_1011E57F488D02B8"/>
much from me! But when I found all was gone, oh, Miſs Fitzalan! I ſtill tremble at the diſtraction of that moment.</p>
                           <p>All, as I have ſaid before, that I could touch of property was gone, the remainder was ſo ſettled, I had no power over it, except joined by my ſon. Great as was the injury he would ſuſtain by mortgaging it, I was confident he never would heſitate doing ſo if acquainted with my diſtreſs; but to let him know it was worſe than a death of torture could be to me, his early excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the nobleneſs of his principles, mingled in the love I felt for him a degree of awe; to confeſs myſelf a villain to ſuch a caracter, to acknowledge my life had been a ſcene of deceit; to be abaſhed, confounded in the preſence of my ſon, to meet his piercing eye, to ſee the bluſh of ſhame mantle his cheeks for his father's crimes—oh horrible!—moſt! horrible! I raved at the idea, and reſolved, if driven by neceſſity, to tell him of my baſeneſs, not to ſurvive the confeſſion. At this critical juncture the Marquis of Roſline came from Scotland to reſide in London; an intimacy which had been dormant for years between our families was then revived, and I ſoon found that an alliance between them would be pleaſing. The proſpect of it raiſed me from the very depth of deſpair; but my tranſports were of ſhort continuance, for Mortimer not only ſhewed, but expreſſed the ſtrongeſt repugnance to ſuch a connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
                           <p>Time and daily experience I truſted would ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly convince him of the advantages of it, as at laſt to conquer this repugnance; nor did the hope of an alliance taking place entirely forſake my heart, till informed he was already beſtowed upon another object. My feelings at this information I ſhall not attempt to deſcribe; all hope of ſaving myſelf from diſhonour was now cut off; for though dutiful and attentive to me in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, I could not flatter myſelf that Mortimer would bindly ſacrifice his reaſon and inclination to my will. The moſt fatal intentions again took poſſeſſion of my
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:038416_0486_1011E581D2C8D680"/>
mind, but the uncertainties he ſuffed on your account, kept me in horrible ſuſpence as to their execution; after ſome months of torture I began again to revive, by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you and Mortimer were inevitably ſeparated, and ſuch is the ſelfiſh nature of vice, ſo abandoned is it to all feelings of humanity, that I rather rejoiced at than lamented the ſuppoſed diſgrace of the daughter of my friend.</p>
                           <p>But the perſevering conſtancy of Mortimer, rather let me ſay the immediate interpoſition of Providence, ſoon gave her reaſon to triumph over the arts of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and I was again reduced to deſpair. Mortimer, I dare ſay, from motives of delicacy, has concealed from you the oppoſition I gave to his wiſhes after your inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was cleared, and the intentions of Lady Martha Dormer relative to you were made known; at laſt I found I muſt either ſeem to acquieſce in theſe wiſhes and intentions, or divulge my real motive for oppoſing them, or elſe quarrel with my ſon and ſiſter, and appear in their eyes the moſt ſelfiſh of human beings: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to appearance, acquieſced, but reſolved in reality to throw myſelf upon your mercy, believing that a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſo tender, ſo perfect, ſo heroic like, as your's has been through every ſcene of diſtreſs, would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on a fallen fellow creature. Was my ſituation otherwiſe than it now is, were you even portionleſs, I ſhould rejoice at having you united to my family from your own intrinſic merit. Situated as I am, the fortune Lady Martha Dormer propoſes giving you can be of no conſequence to me; the projected match between you and Mortimer is yet a ſecret from the public, of courſe it has not leſſened his intereſt with the Roſline family. I have already been ſo fortunate as to adjuſt the unlucky difference which took place between them, and remove any reſentment they entertained againſt him, and I am confident the firſt overture he ſhould make for an union with Lady Euphraſia would be ſucceſsful; the fortune which would immediately be received with her is ſixty thouſand pounds, and five thouſand a year; the firſt would be given up to me in place of the ſettlement I
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:038416_0487_1011E5835EDF88B0"/>
ſhould make on Lord Mortimer, ſo that you ſee, my dear Miſs Fitzalan, his marriage with Lady Euphraſia would at once extricate me from all my difficulties—Freelove in a few months will be of age, and the ſmalleſt delay in ſettling with him, after he attains that period, muſt brand me with diſhonour.</p>
                           <p>I ſtand upon the verge of a dreadful abyſs, and it is in your power only to preſerve me from plunging into it: you, who like an angel of mercy, may bid me live, and ſave me from deſtruction: yet think not in reſigning Lord Mortimer, if indeed ſuch a reſignation ſhould take place, you ſacrifice your own intereſt—No—it ſhall be my grateful care to ſecure to you independence, and I am confident, among the many men you muſt meet ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your worth, and enraptured with your charms, you may yet ſelect one as calculated to render you happy as Mortimer, while he, diſappointed of the object of his affections, will, I have no doubt, without longer heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, accept the one I ſhall again propoſe to him.</p>
                           <p>But ſhould you determine on giving him up, you aſk how, and by what means, you can break with him after what has paſſed, without revealing your real motive for doing ſo to him.</p>
                           <p>That is indeed a difficulty; but after going ſo far, I muſt not heſitate in telling you how it can be removed. You muſt retire ſecretly from his knowledge, and leave no clue behind by which you can be traced. If you comply with the firſt of my requeſts, but ſtop ſhort here, you will defeat all that your mercy, your pity, your compaſſion could do to ſave me, ſince the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of any heſitation muſt be a full explanation, and I have already ſaid it, and now repeat it in the moſt ſolemn manner, that I will not ſurvive the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Pardon me, dear Miſs Fitzalan, if you think there is any thing arbitrary in my ſtile, I would have ſoftened, if I could, all I had to ſay; but the time, the danger, the neceſſity urged me to be explicit. I have now, to you, as to a ſuperior being, opened my whole

heart; it reſts with you whether I ſhall live to atone for my follies, or by one deſperate action terminate them. Should you ſhew me mercy, unworthy as I am of it, ſhould you in compaſſion to poor Mortimer, comply with a requeſt, which can only ſave him from the pangs he would feel at a father's quitting life unbidden, my gratitude, my admiration, my protection, whilſt I live will be yours, and the firſt act of my reſtored life will be to ſecure you a competence. I ſhall wait with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling anxiety for your appearance, to-morrow night; till then believe me</p>

                     <p>The fatal letter fell from Amanda, a miſt overſpread her eyes, and ſhe ſunk ſenſeleſs on her chair; but the privation of her miſery was of ſhort duration, and ſhe recovered as if from a dreadful dream; ſhe felt cold, trembling, and terrified; ſhe looked round the room with an eye of apprehenſion and diſmay, bewildered as to the cauſe of her wretchedneſs and terror, till the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at her feet again ſtruck her ſight.</p>
                     <p>"Was there no way," ſhe aſked herſelf, as ſhe again examined the contents, "was there no way by which the dreadful ſacrifice it doomed her to could be avoided Lady Martha and Lord Mortimer would unite their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to ſave the honour of their wretched relative; they would ſooth his feelings—they would compaſſionate his failings—they would—" but ſhe ſtarted in the midſt of theſe ideas; ſtarted as from ideas fraught with guilt and horror, as thoſe fatal words ruſhed upon her mind—"I will not ſurvive the divulgement of my ſecret"—and ſhe found that to ſave the father ſhe muſt reſign the ſon.</p>
                     <p>How unworthy of ſuch a ſacrifice, engaged as ſhe was to Lord Mortimer! ſhe began to doubt whether ſhe had a right to make it. What a doubt! She ſhuddered for having conceived it, and reproached herſelf for yielding a moment to the ſuggeſtions of tenderneſs which had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:038416_0489_1011E587A06F9E90"/>
riſe to it. She reſolved, without a farther ſtruggle, to ſubmit to reaſon and to virtue, convinced that, if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Lord Cherbury's death, nothing could aſſuage her wretchedneſs, and the unhappineſs Lord Mortimer would ſuffer at loſing her would be trifling, compared to that he would feel if he loſt his father by an act of ſuicide.</p>
                     <p>"In my fate," exclaimed ſhe, in a low and broken accent of deſpair, "there is no alternative! I ſubmit to it without a farther ſtruggle. I dare not call upon one being to adviſe me: I reſign him therefore," ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as if Lord Cherbury was really preſent to hear her reſignation; "reſign Lord Mortimer; but oh, my God!" raiſing her hands with agony to heaven, "give me fortitude to bear the horrors of my ſituation. Oh, Mortimer! dear, invaluable Mortimer! the hand of fate is againſt our union, and we muſt part, never, never more to meet! From the imputation of ingratitude and guilt I ſhall not be allowed to vindicate myſelf: No, I am completely the victim of Lord Cherbury—the cruel perfidious Cherbury, whoſe treachery, whoſe ſeeming acquieſcence in the wiſhes of his ſon has given me joy but to render my miſery more acute!"</p>
                     <p>That Lord Mortimer would impute withdrawing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from him to an attachment for Belgrave ſhe was convinced, and that her fame, as well as peace, ſhould be ſacrificed to Lord Cherbury, cauſed ſuch a whirl of contending paſſions in her mind, that reaſon and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a few minutes yielded to their violence, and ſhe reſolved to vindicate herſelf to Lord Mortimer. This reſolution, however was of ſhort continuance, as her ſubſiding paſſions again gave her power to reflect, ſhe was convinced that by trying to clear herſelf of an imaginary crime ſhe ſhould commit a real one, ſince to ſave her own character, Lord Cherbury's muſt be ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized, and the conſequence of ſuch an act he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared, ſo that not only by the world but by her own conſcience, ſhe ſhould for ever be accuſed of accelerating his death.</p>

"It muſt, it muſt be made," ſhe wildly cried, "the ſacrifice muſt be made, and Mortimer is loſt to me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever." She flung herſelf on the bed, and paſſed the hours till morning in agonies too great for deſcription. From a kind of ſtupefaction rather than ſleep, into which ſhe had gradually ſunk towards morning, ſhe was arouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a gentle tap at the chamber door, and the voice of Siſter Mary informing her that Lord Mortimer was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and impatient for his breakfaſt.</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſtarted from the bed, and bid her tell his Lordſhip ſhe would attend him immediately. She then adjuſted her dreſs, tried to calm her ſpirits, and, with uplifted hands and eyes, beſought Heaven to ſupport her through the trials of the day.</p>
                     <p>Weak and trembling ſhe deſcended to the parlour. The moment ſhe entered it, Lord Mortimer, ſhocked, and ſurpriſed by her altered looks, exclaimed, "Gracious Heaven! what is the matter? Then feeling the feveriſh heat of her hands continued, "Why, why, Amanda, had you the cruelty to conceal your illneſs? proper aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance might have prevented its increaſing to ſuch a degree."—With unutterable tenderneſs he folded his arms about her, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while her drooping head ſunk on his boſom, declared he would immediately ſend for the phyſician who had before attended her.</p>
                     <p>"Do not," ſaid Amanda, while tears trickled down her cheeks, "Do not," continued ſhe, in a broken voice, "for he could do me no good."</p>
                     <p>"No good," repeated Lord Mortimer, in a terrified accent.</p>
                     <p>"I mean," cried ſhe, recollecting herſelf, "he would find it unneceſſary to preſcribe any thing for me, as my illneſs only proceeds from the agitation I ſuffered yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; it made me paſs an indifferent night, but quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to day will recover me."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was with difficulty perſuaded to give up his intention, nor would he relinquiſh it till ſhe had promiſed, if not better before the evening, to inform him and let the phyſician be ſent for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:038416_0491_1011D044D1B71C48"/>
They now ſat down to breakfaſt, at which Amanda was unable either to preſide or eat. When over, ſhe told Lord Mortimer ſhe muſt retire to her chamber, as reſt was eſſential for her; but between nine and ten in the evening ſhe would be happy to ſee him. He tried to perſuade her that ſhe might reſt as well upon the ſofa in the parlour as in her chamber, and that he might then be allowed to ſit with her; but ſhe could not be perſuaded to this, ſhe ſaid, and begged he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe ſeeing her till the time ſhe had already mentioned.</p>
                     <p>He at laſt retired with great reluctance, but not till ſhe had ſeveral times deſired him to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>Amanda now repaired to her chamber, but not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in the ſupineneſs of grief, though her heart felt burſting, but to ſettle upon ſome plan for her future conduct. In the firſt place ſhe meant immediately to write to Lord Cherbury, as the beſt method ſhe could take of acquainting him with her compliance, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting any converſation between them, which would now have been inſupportable to her.</p>
                     <p>In the next place ſhe deſigned acquainting the Prior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs with the ſudden alteration in her affairs, only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing from her the occaſion of that alteration, and as but one day intervened between the preſent and the one fixed for her journey, meant to beſeech her to think of ſome place to which ſhe might retire from Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſuch was the opinion ſhe knew the Prioreſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of Lord Mortimer, that ſhe almoſt dreaded ſhe would impute her reſignation of him to ſome crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motive, and abandon her entirely. If this ſhould be the caſe (and ſcarcely could ſhe be ſurpriſed if it was) ſhe reſolved without delay to go privately to the neighbouring town, and from thence proceed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to Dublin; how ſhe ſhould act there, or what would become of her, never entered her thoughts; they were wholly engroſſed about the manner in which ſhe ſhould leave St. Catherine's.</p>
                     <p>But ſhe hoped, much as appearances were againſt her, ſhe ſhould not be deſerted by the Prioreſs: Providence
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:038416_0492_1011E58C36451CB8"/>
ſhe truſted, would be ſo compaſſionate to her miſery, as to preſerve her this one friend, who could not only aſſiſt but adviſe her.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as ſhe had ſettled the line of conduct ſhe ſhould purſue, ſhe ſat down to pen her renunciation, of Lord Mortimer, which ſhe did in the following words:</p>

                     <p>Amanda knelt before her, ſhe took her hands, ſhe preſſed them to her burning forehead and lips, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed them with her tears, whilſt ſhe exclaimed ſhe was wretched.</p>
                     <p>"Wretched!" repeated the Prioreſs; "for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſake be explicit; keep me no longer in ſuſpence; you ſicken my very heart by your agitation; it foretells ſomething dreadful!"</p>
                     <p>"It does indeed," ſaid Amanda; "it foretells that Lord Mortimer and I will never be united!"</p>
                     <p>The Prioreſs ſtarted, and ſurveyed Amanda with a look which ſeemed to ſay, "ſhe believed ſhe had loſt her ſenſes;" then with aſſumed compoſure, begged "ſhe would defer any farther explanation of her diſtreſs till her ſpirits were in a calmer ſtate."</p>
                     <p>"I will not riſe," cried Amanda, taking the Prioreſs's hand, which in her ſurpriſe ſhe had involuntarily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn—"I will not riſe till you ſay, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the myſterious ſituation in which I am involved, you will continue to be my friend. Oh! ſuch an aſſurance would aſſuage the ſorrows of my heart."</p>
                     <p>The Prioreſs now perceived that it was grief alone which diſordered Amanda; but how ſhe had met with any cauſe for grief, or what could occaſion it, were matters of aſtoniſhment to her. Surely, my dear child, cried ſhe, "ſhould know me too well to deſire ſuch an aſſurance; but however myſterious her ſituation may appear to others, ſhe will not I truſt and believe, let it appear ſo to me. I wait with impatience for an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation."</p>
                     <p>"It is one of my greateſt ſorrows," exclaimed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, "that I cannot give ſuch an explanation: No, no," ſhe continued in an agony, "a death-bed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion would not authoriſe my telling you the occaſion of Lord Mortimer's ſeparation and mine." The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oreſs now inſiſted or her taking a chair, and then beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as far as ſhe could, without farther delay, ſhe would let her into her ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Amanda immediately complied—"an unexpected ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to her union with Lord Mortimer," ſhe ſaid, "had ariſen, an obſtacle which, while compelled to ſubmit to it, ſhe was bound moſt ſolemnly to conceal; it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient therefore ſhe ſhould retire from Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, without giving him the ſmalleſt intimation of ſuch an intention, leſt, if he ſuſpected it, he ſhould enquire too minutely, and by ſo doing plunge not only her but himſelf into irremediable diſtreſs; to avoid this, it was neceſſary all but the Prioreſs ſhould be ignorant of her ſcheme, and by her means ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould be put in a way of finding ſuch a place of ſecrecy and ſecurity as ſhe required. She beſought the Prioreſs, with ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes, not to impute her reſignation of Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to any unworthy motive, to that Heaven, which could alone conſole her for her loſs, ſhe appealed for he innocence, ſhe beſought her to believe her ſincere, to pity, but not condemn her, to continue her friend now, when her friendſhip was moſt needful in this her deep diſtreſs, and ſhe aſſured her, if it was withdrawn, ſhe
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:038416_0495_1011E5911B79C0A0"/>
believed ſhe could no longer ſtruggle with her ſorrows. The Prioreſs remained ſilent a few minutes, and then addreſſed her in a ſolemn voice.</p>
                     <p>"I own, Miſs Fitzalan, your conduct appears ſo inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, ſo aſtoniſhing that nothing, but the opinion I have formed of your character, from ſeeing the manner in which you have acted, ſince left to yourſelf, could prevent my eſteem from being diminiſhed; but I am perſuaded you cannot act from a bad motive, therefore, till that perſuaſion ceaſes, my eſteem can know no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution. From this declaration you may be convinced, that, to the utmoſt of my power, I will ſerve you, yet, ere you finally determine and require ſuch ſervice, weigh well what you are about, conſider in the eyes of the world you are about acting a diſhonourable part, in breaking your engagement with Lord Mortimer without aſſigning ſome reaſon for doing ſo. Nothing ſhort of a point of conſcience ſhould influence you to this."</p>
                     <p>"Nothing ſhort of it has," replied Amanda, "there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pity, and do not aggravate my feelings by pointing out the conſequences, which will attend the ſacrifice I am compelled to make; only promiſe, taking the Prior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs's hand, only promiſe, in this great and ſad emergency to be my friend."</p>
                     <p>Her looks, her words, her agonies, ſtopped ſhort all the Prioreſs, was going to ſay. She thought it would be barbarity any longer to dwell upon the ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of an action, which ſhe was now convinced ſome fatal neceſſity compelled her to; ſhe therefore gave her all the conſolation now in her power, by aſſuring her ſhe ſhould immediately think about ſome place for her to retire to, and would keep all which had paſſed between them a profound ſecret. She then inſiſted on Amanda's lying down, and trying to compoſe herſelf, ſhe brought her drops to take, and drawing the curtains about her, retired from the room. In two hours ſhe returned; though ſhe entered the chamber ſoftly, Amanda imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately drew back the curtain, and appeared much more compoſed than when the Prioreſs had left her. The
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:038416_0496_1011E5968A8A9BC0"/>
good woman would not let her riſe, but ſat down on the bed to tell her what ſhe had contrived for her.</p>
                     <p>"She had a relation in Scotland," ſhe ſaid, "who from reduced circumſtances, had kept a ſchool for many years; but as the infirmities of age came on, ſhe was not able to pay ſo much attention to her pupils as their friends thought requiſite, and ſhe had only been able to retain them by promiſing to get a perſon to aſſiſt her, as ſhe thought her couſin (the Prioreſs) more in the way of procuring ſuch a one than herſelf, ſhe had written to her for that purpoſe; a clever well-behaved young woman who would be ſatisfied with a ſmall ſalary, was what ſhe wanted."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhould not mention ſuch a place to you," ſaid the Prioreſs, "but that the neceſſity there is for your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately retiring from Lord Mortimer, leaves me no time to look out for another: But do not imagine I wiſh you to continue there: No, indeed, I ſhould think it a pity ſuch talents as you poſſeſs ſhould be buried in ſuch obſcurity.—What I think is, that you can ſtay there till you grow more compoſed, and can look out for a better eſtabliſhment."</p>
                     <p>"Do not mention my talents," ſaid Amanda, "my mind is ſo enervated by grief, that it will be long before I can make any great exertion, and the place you have mentioned is, from its obſcurity, juſt ſuch a one as I deſire to go to.</p>
                     <p>"There is beſides another inducement," ſaid the Prioreſs, "namely, its being but a few miles from Port-Patrick, to which place a fair wind will bring us in a few hours from this. I know the maſter of a little wherry, which is perpetually going backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; he live, in this neighbourhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and both he and his wife conſider themſelves under obligations to me, and will rejoice, I am ſure, at an opportunity of oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me: I ſhall therefore ſend for him this evening, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him of the time you wiſh to go and deſire his care till be leaves you himſelf at Mrs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Amanda thanked the Prioreſs, who proceeded to ſay, that on the preſumption of her going to her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin's,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:038416_0497_1011E59819D84988"/>
ſhe had already written a letter for her to take; but wiſhed to know whether ſhe would be mentioned by her own or a fictitious name?</p>
                     <p>Amanda replied, "By a fictitious one," and, after a little conſideration, fixed on that of Frances Donald, which the Prioreſs accordingly inſerted, and then read the letter.</p>

                     <p>"I have not ſaid as much as you deſerve," ſaid the Prioreſs; but if the letter does not meet your approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will make any alteration you pleaſe in it."—A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda aſſured her "it did," and the Prioreſs then ſaid, "that Lord Mortimer had been again at the Convent to inquire after her, and was told ſhe was better."—Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:038416_0498_1011E59AA00BEB20"/>
ſaid, ſhe would not ſee him till the hour ſhe had appointed for his coming to ſupper.—The Prioreſs agreed, "that as things were changed ſhe was right in being in his company as little as poſſible, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her being in his way, ſhe ſhould have her dinner and tea in her own room." The cloth was accordingly laid in it, nor would the good natured Prioreſs depart till ſhe ſaw Amanda eat ſomething. Siſter Mary, ſhe ſaid, was quite anxious to come in, and perform the part of an attendant, but was prevented by her.</p>
                     <p>The diſtraction of Amanda's thoughts was now aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, from having every thing adjuſted relative to her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conduct, and the company of the Prioreſs, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her as ſoon as ſhe had dined, prevented her loſing the little compoſure ſhe had with ſuch difficulty acquired.</p>
                     <p>She beſought the Prioreſs not to delay writing after her departure, and to relate faithfully every thing which happened in conſequence of her ſlight. She entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her not to let a miſtaken compaſſion for her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings influence her to conceal any thing, as any thing like the appearance of concealment in her letter would only torture her with anxiety and ſuſpence.</p>
                     <p>The Prioreſs ſolemly promiſed ſhe would obey her requeſt, and Amanda with tears regretted that ſhe was now unable to recompenſe the kindneſs of the Prioreſs and the Siſterhood, and ſhe had lately intended doing by Lord Mortimer's deſire, as well as her own inclination. The Prioreſs begged her not to indulge any regret on that account, as they conſidered themſelves already libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally recompenſed, and had beſides quite ſufficient to ſatisfy their humble deſires.</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſaid ſhe meant to leave a letter on the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing table for Lord Mortimer, with the notes which he had given her encloſed in it. "The picture and the ring," ſaid ſhe, with a falling tear, "I cannot part with;" for the things which ſhe had ordered from the neighbouring town, ſhe told the Prioreſs ſhe would leave money in her hands, alſo a preſent for the woman who had been engaged to attend her to England, as
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:038416_0499_1011E59E55E7CDA8"/>
ſome ſmall recompenſe for her diſappointment: She meant only to take ſome linen and her mourning to Scotland, the reſt of her things, including her muſic and books at ſome future and better period, might be ſent after her.</p>
                     <p>Amanda was indebted to the Siſterhood for three month's board and lodging, which was ten guineas. Of the two hundred pounds, which Lord Mortimer had given her on leaving Caſtle Carberry, one hundred and twenty pounds remained, ſo that though unable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the claims of gratitude, ſhe thanked heaven ſhe was able to fulfil thoſe of juſtice. This ſhe told the Prioreſs, who inſtantly declared, "that, in the name of the whole Siſterhood, ſhe would take upon her to refuſe any thing from her." Amanda did not conteſt the point, being ſecretly determined how to act. The Prioreſs drank tea with her. When over, Amanda ſaid ſhe would lie down, in order to try and be compoſed againſt Lord Mortimer came. The Prioreſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly withdrew, ſaying, "ſhe ſhould not be diſturbed till then."</p>
                     <p>By this means Amanda was enabled to be in readineſs for delivering her letter to Lord Cherbury at the proper hour. Her heart beat with apprehenſion as it approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhe dreaded Lord Mortimer again ſurpriſing her amongſt the ruins, or ſome of the Nuns following her to them. At laſt the clock gave the ſignal for keeping her appointment. She aroſe trembling from the bed, and opened the door; ſhe liſtened, and no noiſe announced any one's being near; the moments were precious; ſhe glided through the gallery, and had the good fortune to find the hall door open. She haſtened to the ruins, and found Lord Cerbury waiting there. She preſented him the letter in ſilence. He received it in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but when he ſaw her turning away to depart he ſnatched her hand, and in a voice that denoted the moſt violent agitation, exclaimed, "Tell me, tell me, Miſs Fitzalan, is this letter propitious?" "It is," replied ſhe in a faultering voice. "Then may heaven eternally bleſs you," cried he, falling at her feet, and wrapping
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:038416_0500_1011E5A0CC454FC8"/>
his arms about her. His poſture ſhocked Amanda, and his detention terrified her.</p>
                     <p>"Let me go, my Lord," ſaid ſhe,: "In pity to me, in mercy to yourſelf, let me go, for one moment longer and we may be diſcovered."</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury ſtarted up—"From whom," cried he, "can I hear about you?"</p>
                     <p>"From the Prioreſs of St. Catherines," replied Amanda in a trembling voice, "ſhe only will know the ſecret of my retreat."</p>
                     <p>He again ſnatched her hand, and kiſſed it with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence. "Farewell, thou angel of a woman?" he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and diſappeared amongſt the ruins. Amanda hurried back, dreading every moment to meet Lord Mortimer; but ſhe neither met him nor any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. She had ſcarcely gained her chamber ere the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oreſs came to inform her his Lordſhip was in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. She inſtantly repaired to it. The air had a little changed the deadly hue of her complexion, ſo that from her looks he ſuppoſed her better, and her words ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the ſuppoſition. She talked with him, forced her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to eat ſome ſupper, and checked the tears from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which ſprang to her eyes whenever he mentioned the happineſs they muſt experience when united, the pleaſure they ſhould enjoy at Thornbury, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light Lady Martha and Lady Araminta would expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience whenever they met.</p>
                     <p>Amanda deſired him not to come to breakfaſt the next morning, nor to the Convent, till after dinner, as ſhe ſhould be ſo buſy preparing for her journey, ſhe would have no time to devote to him. He wanted to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nvince her he could not retard her preparations by coming, but ſhe would not allow this.</p>
                     <p>Amanda paſſed another wretched night. She break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted in the morning with the Nuns, who expreſſed their regret at loſing her—a regret however mitigated by the hope of ſhortly ſeeing her again, as Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer had promiſed to bring her to Caſtle Carberry as ſoon as ſhe had viſited his friends in England. This was a trying moment to Amanda; ſhe could ſcarcely conceal
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:038416_0501_1011E5A2641A1C78"/>
her emotions, to keep herſelf from weeping aloud, at the mention of a promiſe never to be fulfilled. She ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her breakfaſt in haſte, and withdrew to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on pretence of ſettling her things. Here ſhe was immediately followed by the Nuns, entreating they might ſeverally be employed in aſſiſting her. She thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with her uſual ſweetneſs, but aſſured them no aſſiſtance was neceſſary, as ſhe had but a few things to pack, never having unlocked the cheſts which had come from Caſtle Carberry. They retired on receiving this aſſurance, and Amanda, fearful of another interruption, ſat down to write her farewell letter to Lord Mortimer.</p>

                           <p>Farewell, dear Mrs. Dermot, dear and amiable inhabitants of St. Catherine's, farewell. As Amanda will never forget you in her's ſo let her never be forgotten in your oriſons, and never ceaſe to believe her</p>

                     <p>By this time ſhe was ſummoned to dinner. Her ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its were ſunk in the loweſt dejection at the idea of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the amiable woman who had been ſo kind to her, and above all, at the idea of the laſt ſad evening ſhe was to paſs with Lord Mortimer. His Lordſhip came early to the Convent. The dejected looks of Amanda immediately ſtruck him, and renewed all his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions about her health. She anſwered his tender enquiries by ſaying ſhe was fatigued.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps," ſaid he "you will like to reſt one day, and not commence your journey to-morrow?"</p>
                     <p>"No, no," cried Amanda, "It ſhall not be deferred. To-morrow," continued ſhe, with a ſmile of anguiſh, "I will commence it."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="unknown:038416_0504_1011E5AB88678CE0"/>
Lord Mortimer thanked her for a reſolution, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined dictated by an ardent deſire to pleaſe him, but at the ſame time again expreſſed his fears that ſhe was ill.</p>
                     <p>Amanda perceived that if ſhe did not exert herſelf, her dejection would lead him to enquiries ſhe would find it difficult to evade; but as to exert herſelf was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in order to withdraw his attention, in ſome degree, from herſelf, ſhe propoſed that as this was the laſt even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would be at the Convent, they would invite the Nuns to drink tea with them. Lord Mortimer immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately acquieſced in the propoſal, and the invitation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent was accepted.</p>
                     <p>But the converſation of the whole party was of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy kind. Amanda was ſo much beloved among them, that the proſpect of loſing her filled them with a regret, which, even the idea of ſeeing her ſoon again, could not baniſh. About nine, which was their hour for prayers, they roſe to retire, and would have taken leave of Lord Mortimer, had he not informed them, that on Miſs Fitzalan's account he would not commence the journey next day till ten o'clock, at which time he would again have the pleaſure of ſeeing them.</p>
                     <p>When they withdrew he endeavoured to cheer Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and beſought her to exert her ſpirits. Of his own accord, he ſaid, he would leave her early, that ſhe might get as much reſt as poſſible againſt the enſuing day: He accordingly roſe to depart. What an agonizing moment for Amanda—to hear, to behold the man, ſo tenderly beloved, for the laſt time, to think that ere that hour the next night ſhe ſhould be far, far away from him, conſidered as a treacherous and ungrateful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, deſpiſed, perhaps execrated, as a ſource of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſquiet and ſorrow to him! Her heart ſwelled at thoſe ideas with feelings ſhe thought would burſt it, and when he folded her to his boſom, and bid her be cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful againſt the next morning, ſhe involuntarily returned the preſſure, by ſtraining him to her heart in convulſive agitation, whilſt a ſhower of tears burſt from her.—Lord Mortimer, ſhocked and ſurpriſed at theſe tears
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:038416_0505_1011E5AD14968200"/>
and emotions, re-ſeated her, for her agitation was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, and he trembled ſo much he could not ſupport her; then throwing himſelf at her feet." My Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da! my beloved girl!" cried he, "what is the matter? Is any wiſh of your heart yet unfulfilled? If ſo, let no miſtaken notion of delicacy influence you to conceal it; on your happineſs you know mine depends; tell me therefore, I entreat, I conjure you, tell me, is there any thing I can do to reſtore you to cheerfulneſs?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! no," ſaid Amanda, "all that a mortal could do to ſerve me you have already done, and my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the fervent ſenſe I have of the obligations I lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to you, I cannot fully expreſs. May heaven," rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her ſtreaming eyes, "may heaven recompenſe your goodneſs, by beſtowing the choiceſt of its bleſſings on you!"</p>
                     <p>"That," ſaid Lord Mortimer, half ſmiling, "it has already done in giving you to me, for you are the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt bleſſing it could beſtow; but tell me what has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected you in this manner? ſomething more than fatigue I am ſure?"</p>
                     <p>Amanda aſſured him "he was miſtaken," and fearful of his further enquiries, told him, "ſhe only waited for his departure to retire to reſt, which ſhe was convinced would do her good."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer inſtantly roſe from his kneeling poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: "Farewell, then, my dear Amanda," cried he, "farewell, and be well and cheerful againſt the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
                     <p>She preſſed his hand between her's and laying her cold wet cheek upon it: "Farewell," ſaid ſhe, "when we next meet I ſhall, I truſt be well and cheerful; for in heaven alone (thought ſhe at that moment) we ſhall ever meet again."</p>
                     <p>On the ſpot in which he left her, Amanda ſtood mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs, till ſhe heard the hall door cloſe after him; all compoſure then forſook her, and in an agony of tears and ſobs, ſhe threw herſelf on the ſeat he had occupied. The good Prioreſs, gueſſing what her feelings at this minute muſt be, was at hand, and came in with drops
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:038416_0506_1011E5AFF8F67178"/>
and water, which ſhe forced her to take, and mingled the tears of ſympathy with her's.</p>
                     <p>Her ſoothing attentions in a little time had the effect ſhe deſired. They revived, in ſome degree, her unhappy young friend, who exclaimed, "that the ſevereſt trial ſhe could ever poſſibly experience was now over."</p>
                     <p>"And will, I truſt and believe," replied the Prioreſs "even in this life be yet rewarded."</p>
                     <p>It was agreed that Amanda ſhould put on her habit, and be prepared againſt the man came for her. The Prioreſs promiſed, as ſoon as the houſe was at reſt, to follow her to her chamber.—Amanda accordingly went to her apartment, and put on her travelling dreſs. She was ſoon followed by the Prioreſs, who brought in bread, wine, and cold chicken; but the full heart of Amanda would not allow her to partake of them, and her tears in ſpite of her efforts to reſtrain them, again burſt forth. "She was ſure," ſhe ſaid, "the Prioreſs would immediately let her know if any intelligence ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived of her brother, and ſhe again beſought her to write as ſoon as poſſible after her departure, and to be minute."</p>
                     <p>She left the letters, one for Lord Mortimer, and the other for the Prioreſs, on the table, and then, with a kind of melancholy impatience, waited for the man, who was punctual to the appointed hour of three, and announced his arrival by a tap at the window. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly roſe, and embraced the Prioreſs in ſilence, who almoſt as much affected as herſelf, had only power to ſay "God bleſs you, my dear child and make you as happy as you deſerve to be."</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſhook her head mournfully, as if to ſay "ſhe expected no happineſs," and then ſoftly ſtepping along the gallery, opened the hall-door, where ſhe found the man waiting. Her little trunk was already lying in the hall: She pointed it out to him, and as ſoon as he had taken it he departed. Never did any being feel more forlorn than Amanda now did; what ſhe did when quitting the Marchioneſs's was comparatively happineſs to what ſhe now endured. She then looked forward to the protection, comfort and ſupport, of a tender parent
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:038416_0507_1011D0434BF93F20"/>
now ſhe had nothing in view which could in the leaſt cheer or alleviate her feelings. She caſt her mournful eyes around, and the objects ſhe beheld, heightened if poſſible, her anguiſh. She beheld the old trees which ſhaded the grave of her father waving in the morning breeze, and, oh! how fervently at that moment did ſhe wiſh that by his ſide ſhe was laid beneath their ſhelter! ſhe turned from them with a heart rending ſigh, which. reached the ear of the man who trudged before her He inſtantly turned and ſeeing her pale, and trembling, told her he had an arm at he ſervice, which ſhe gladly accepted, being ſcarcely able to ſupport herſelf; a ſmall boat was waiting for them about half a mile above Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Carberry; it conveyed them in a few moments to the veſſel, which the maſter previouſly told her would be under weigh directly; ſhe was pleaſed to find his wife on board, who conducted Amanda to the cabin, where ſhe found breakfaſt laid out with neatneſs for her. She took ſome tea and a little bread being almoſt exhauſted with fatigue. Her companion imputing her dejection to fears of croſſing the ſea, aſſured her the paſſage would be very ſhort, and bid her obſerve how plainly they could ſee the Scottiſh hills, now partially gilded by the beams of the riſing ſun; but beautiful as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, Amanda's eyes were turned from them to a more beautiful object, Caſtle Carberry. She then aſked the woman if ſhe thought the Caſtle could be ſeen from the oppoſite coaſt, and ſhe replied in the negative.</p>
                     <p>"I am ſorry for it," ſaid Amanda mournfully. She continued at the window for the melancholy pleaſure of contemplating it, till compelled by ſickneſs to lie down on the bed. The woman attended her with the moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous care, and about four o'clock in the afternoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her they had reached Port Patrick. Amanda aroſe, and ſending for the maſter, told him, "As ſhe did not wiſh to go to an inn, ſhe would thank him to hire a chaiſe to carry her directly to Mrs. Macpher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons." He ſaid ſhe ſhould be obeyed, and Amanda having ſettled with him for her paſſage, he went on ſhore for that purpoſe, and ſoon returned to inform her a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:038416_0508_1011E5B693A59E08"/>
was ready.—Amanda, having thanked his wife for her kind attention, ſtepped into the boat, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the chaiſe the moment ſhe landed. Her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion told her he was well acquainted with Mrs. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherſon having frequently carried pacquets from Mrs. Dermot to her. She lived about five miles from Port Patrick, he ſaid, and near the ſea coaſt. They accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſoon reached her habitation; it was a ſmall low houſe, of a greyiſh colour, ſituated in the field almoſt covered with thiſtles, and divided from the road by a ragged looking wall; the ſea lay at a ſmall diſtance from it; the coaſt hereabouts was extremely rocky, and the proſpect on every ſide wild and dreary in the extreme.</p>
                     <p>Amanda's companion, by her deſire, went firſt into the houſe, to prepare Mrs. Macpherſon for her recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He returned in a few minutes, and telling her ſhe was happy at her arrival, conducted her into the houſe. From a narrow paſſage they turned into a ſmall gloomy looking parlour, with a clay floor. Mrs. Macpherſon was ſitting in an old-faſhioned arm chair—her face was ſharp and meagre—her ſtature low, and, like Otway's ancient Beldame, doubled with age: her gown was grey ſtuff, and though ſhe was ſo low, it was not long enough to reach her ancle; her black ſilk apron was curtailed in the ſame manner, and over a little mob cap ſhe wore a handkerchief tied under her chin. She juſt nodded to Amanda on her entrance, and, putting on a large pair of ſpectacles, ſurveyed her without ſpeaking. Amanda preſented Mrs. Dermot's introductory letter, and then though unbidden, ſeated herſelf on the window-ſeat till ſhe had peruſed it. Her trunk in the mean time was brought in, and ſhe paid for the carriage, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time the maſter of the veſſel to wait till ſhe had heard what Mrs. Macpherſon would ſay. At length the old Lady broke ſilence, and her voice was quite as ſharp as her face.</p>
                     <p>"So child," ſaid ſhe, again ſurveying Amanda, and elevating her ſpectacles to have a better opportunity of ſpeaking, "why, to be ſure I did deſire my couſin to
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:038416_0509_1011E5B8250514D0"/>
get me a young perſon, but not one ſo young, ſo very young, as you appear to be."</p>
                     <p>"Lord bleſs you!" ſaid the man, "if that is a fault, why it is one will mend every day."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, aye" cried the old Dame, but it will mend a little too ſlow for me: However, child, as you are ſo well recommended, I will try you. My couſin ſays ſomething about your being well born, and having ſeen better days: however, child, I tell you before hand, I ſhall not conſider what you have been, but what you are now; I ſhall therefore expect you to be mild, regular, and attentive; no flaunting, no gadding, no chattering, but ſtaid, ſober, and modeſt."</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs your heart," ſaid the man," "if you look in her face you will ſee ſhe'll be all you deſire."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, aye, ſo you may ſay; but I ſhould be very ſorry to depend upon the promiſe of a face; like the heart, it is often treacherous and deceitful; ſo pray, young woman, tell me, and remember I expect a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious anſwer, whether you think you will be able to do as I wiſh.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Madam," replied Amanda, in a voice almoſt choaked by the variety of painful emotions ſhe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.</p>
                     <p>"Well then we are agreed, as you know the ſalary I give!" The maſter of the veſſel now took his leave, never having been aſked by Mrs. Macpherſon to take any refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>The heart of Amanda ſunk within her from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe entered Mrs Macpherſon's door; ſhe ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at being left with ſo unſocial a being in a place ſo wild and dreary; a hovel near St. Catherine's ſhe would have thought a palace in point of real comfort to her preſent habitation, as ſhe then could have enjoyed the ſoothing ſociety of the tender and amiable Nuns. The preſence of the maſter of the veſſel, from the pity and concern he manifeſted for her, had ſomething conſolato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it, and when he left the room ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>urſt into tears, as if then, and not till then ſhe had been utterly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:038416_0510_1011E5BAE0D4CCE8"/>
She haſtily followed him out: "Give my love, my beſt love," ſaid ſhe, ſobbing violently, and laying her trembling hand on his, "to Mrs. Dermot, and tell her, oh! tell her to write directly, and give me ſome comfort."</p>
                     <p>"You may depend on my doing ſo," replied he; "but cheer up my dear young lady, what, though the old Dame in the parlour is a little cranky, ſhe will mend no doubt, ſo Heaven bleſs you, and make you as happy as you deſerve to be."</p>
                     <p>Sad and ſilent Amanda returned to the parlour, and ſeating herſelf in the window, ſtrained her eyes after the carriage, which had brought her to this diſmal ſpot.</p>

                     <p>"I thank you, Madam," replied Amanda, I ſhould like a little tea."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! as to tea I have juſt taken my own, and the things are all waſhed and put by; but if you like a glaſs of ſpirits and water, and a cruſt of bread, you may have it."</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſaid ſhe did not.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! very well," cried Mrs. Macpherſon, "I ſhall not preſs you, for ſupper will from be ready." She then deſired Amanda to draw a chair near her's, and began torturing her with a variety of minute and trifling queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, relative to herſelf, the Nuns, and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of St. Catherine's.</p>
                     <p>

Amanda briefly ſaid, "her father had been in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that many diſappointments and loſſes had prevented his making any proviſion for her, and that on his death, which happened in the neighbourhood of the Convent, the Nuns had taken her out of compaſſion till ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an eſtabliſhment for herſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, and a comfortable one you have procured your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf I promiſe you," ſaid Mrs. Macpherſon, "if it is not your own fault." She then told Amanda, "ſhe would amuſe her by ſhewing her her houſe and other concerns." This indeed was eaſily done, as it conſiſted but of the parlour, two cloſets adjoining it, and the kitchen on the oppoſite ſide of the entry; the other concerns were a ſmall garden planted with kale, and the field covered with thiſtles: "A good comfortable tenement this", cried Mrs. Macpherſon, ſhaking her head with much ſatisfaction, as ſhe leaned upon her ebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny headed cane, and caſt her eyes around. She bid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda admire the fine proſpect before the door, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to a red haired and bare-legged girl, deſired her to cut ſome thiſtles to put into the fire, and haſten the boiling of the kal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> On returning to the parlour ſhe unlocked a preſs, and took out a pair of coarſe brown ſheets to air for Amanda. She herſelf ſlept in one clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and in the other was a bed for Amanda, laid on a half decayed bedſtead, without curtains, and covered with a blue ſtuff quilt; the cloſet was lightened by one ſmall window, which looked into the garden, and its furniture conſiſted of a broken chair, and a piece of looking glaſs ſtuck to the wall.</p>
                     <p>The promiſed ſupper was at length ſerved; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of a few heads of kale, ſome oaten bread, a jug of water, and a ſmall phial half full of ſpirits, which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda would not taſte, and the old Lady herſelf took but ſparingly; they were lighted by a ſmall candle, which, on retiring to their cloſets, Mrs. Macpherſon cut between them.</p>
                     <p>Amanda felt relieved by being alone. She could now without reſtraint indulge her tears, and her reflections; that ſhe could never enjoy any ſatisfaction with a being

ſo ungracious in her manners, and ſo contracted in her notions, ſhe foreſaw; but, diſagreeable as her ſituation muſt be, ſhe felt inclined to continue in it, from the idea of its giving her more opportunities of hearing from Mrs. Dermot than ſhe could have in almoſt any other place, and by theſe opportunities alone could ſhe expect to hear of Lord Mortimer, and to hear of him, even the moſt trifling circumſtance, though divided, for ever divided from him, would be a ſource of exquiſite though melancholy pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>To think ſhe ſhould hear of him, at once ſoothed and fed her melancholy, it leſſened the violence of ſorrow, yet without abating its intenſeneſs, it gave a delicious ſadneſs to her ſoul, ſhe thought would be ill exchanged for any feelings ſhort of theſe ſhe muſt have experienced if her wiſhes had been accompliſhed; ſhe enjoyed the penſive luxury of virtuous grief, which mitigates the ſharp

                     <p>Amanda ſtarted from her ſleep, forgetting both the name ſhe had adopted, and the place where ſhe was; but Mrs. Macpherſon again calling her to riſe, reſtored her to her recollection. She replied, ſhe would attend her directly, and hurrying on her clothes was with her in a few minutes. She found the old lady ſeated at the breakfaſt table, who, inſtead of returning her ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaid, "that on account of her fatigue ſhe excuſed her lying ſo long in bed this morning, for it was now near eight o'clock; but in future ſhe would expect her to riſe before ſix in ſummer, and ſeven in winter, adding, as there was no clock, ſhe would rap at the door for that purpoſe every morning."</p>
                     <p>Amanda aſſured her "ſhe was fond of riſing early, and always accuſtomed to it." The tea was now poured out, it was of the worſt kind, and ſweetened with coarſe brown, ſugar, the bread was oaten, and there was no but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Amanda unuſed to ſuch unpalatable fare, ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little of it with difficulty, and then with ſome heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſaid, "ſhe would prefer milk to tea."Mrs. Macpherſon frowned exceedingly at this, and, after continuing ſilent a few minutes, ſaid, "ſhe had really made tea for two people, and ſhe could not think of having it waſted; beſides (ſhe added) the economy of her houſe was ſo ſettled ſhe could not infringe it for any tone. She kept no cow herſelf, and only took in as much milk as ſerved her tea, and an old tabby cat."</p>
                     <p>Amanda replied it was of no conſequence, and Mrs. Macpherſon ſaid, indeed ſhe ſuppoſed ſo, and muttered ſomething of people giving themſelves airs they had no pretentions to. The tea table was removed before nine, when the ſchool began; it conſiſted of about thirty girls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt of them daughters to farmers in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. Amanda and they being introduced to each other, and ſhe being previouſly informed what they were taught, was deſired to commence the taſk of inſtructing
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:038416_0514_1011E5C4498FFB98"/>
them entirely herſelf that day, as Mrs. Macpherſon wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to obſerve her manner—a moſt unpleaſant taſk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for poor Amanda, whoſe mind and body were both harraſſed by anxiety and fatigue. As ſhe had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, however, ſhe reſolved to go through it with as much cheerfulneſs and alacrity as poſſible; ſhe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly acquitted herſelf to the ſatisfaction of Mrs. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherſon, who only found fault with her too great gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, ſaying, the children would never fear her. At two the ſchool broke up, and Amanda almoſt as delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the children to be at liberty, was running into the garden to try if the air would be of uſe to a very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent head-ach, when ſhe was called back, to put the forms and other things in order; ſhe coloured, and ſtood motionleſs, till recollecting that if ſhe refuſed to obey Mrs. Macpherſon, a quarrel would probably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, which circumſtanced as ſhe was, without knowing where to go to, would be dreadful, ſhe ſilently perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what ſhe had been deſired to do. Dinner was then brought in; it was as ſimple and as ſparing as a Bramin could deſire to be. When over, Mrs. Macpherſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed herſelf to take a nap in the large chair, without making any kind of apology to Amanda.</p>
                     <p>Left at liberty, Amanda would now have walked out; but it had juſt began to rain, and every thing looked dreary and deſolate; from the window in which ſhe pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The little ſervant girl, as ſhe cleaned the kitchen, ſung a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Scotch ditty, ſo that all conſpired to oppreſs the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Amanda with a dejection greater than ſhe had ever before experienced; all hope was now extinct, the ſocial ties of life ſeemed broken never more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united. She had now no father, no friend, no lover, as heretofore, to ſoothe her feelings, or alleviate her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Like the poor Belvidera, ſhe might have ſaid,

                           <l>"There was a time</l>
                           <l>Her cries and ſorrows</l>

                        </q>
Like a tender ſapling, tranſplanted from its native ſoil, ſhe ſeemed to ſtand alone expoſed to every adverſe blaſt. Her tears guſhed forth, and fell in ſhowers down her pale cheeks. She ſighed forth the name of her father; "Oh! dear and moſt benignant of men," ſhe exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "my father and my friend, were you living I ſhould not be ſo wretched; pity and conſolation would then be mine: Oh! my father, one of the drearieſt caverns in yonder rocks would be an aſylum of comfort were you with me; but I am ſelfiſh in theſe regrets, certain as I am, that you exchanged this life of wretchedneſs for one of eternal peace, for one where you were again united to your Malvina."</p>
                     <p>Her thoughts adverted to what Lord Mortimer, in all probability now thought of her; but this was too dreadful to dwell upon, convinced as ſhe was, that, from appearances, he muſt think moſt unfavourably of her. His picture, which hung in her boſom, ſhe drew out; ſhe gazed with agonizing tenderneſs upon it; ſhe preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to her lips and prayed for its original. From this indulgence of ſorrow ſhe was diſturbed by the waking of Mrs. Macpherſon. She haſtily wiped away her tears, and hid the beloved picture. The evening paſt moſt diſagreeably. Mrs. Macpherſon was tedious and inquiſitive in her diſcourſe, and it was almoſt as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to liſten as to anſwer her.—Amanda was happy when the hour of retiring to bed arrived, and relieved her from what might be called a kind of mental bondage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="unknown:038416_0516_1011E5CB578D1168"/>
Such was the firſt day Amanda paſſed in her new habitation, and a week elapſed in the ſame manner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any variation, except that on Sunday ſhe had a ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from her labours, and went to the kirk with Mrs. Macpherſon. At the end of the week ſhe found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo extremely ill from the fatigue and confinement ſhe endured, as Mrs. Macpherſon would not let her walk out, ſaying "gadders were good for nothing; that ſhe told her, "except allowed to go out every evening ſhe muſt leave her, as ſhe could not bear ſo ſedentary a life." Mrs. Macpherſon looked diſconcerted, and grumbled a great deal; but as Amanda ſpoak in a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute manner ſhe was frightened, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t ſhe ſhould put her threats into execution, ſhe was ſo extremely uſeful in the ſchool, and at laſt told her, "ſhe might take as much exerciſe as ſhe pleaſed every day after dinner."</p>
                     <p>Amanda gladly availed herſelf of this permiſſion, ſhe explored all the romantic paths about the houſe, but the one ſhe chiefly delighted to take was that which led to the ſea; ſhe loved to ramble about the beach, when fatigued to ſit down upon the fragment of a rock, and look towards the oppoſite ſhore; vainly then would ſhe try to diſcover ſome of the objects ſhe knew ſo well: Caſtle Carberry was utterly undiſtinguiſhable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhe knew the ſpot on which it ſtood, and derived a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy pleaſure from looking that way.</p>
                     <p>In theſe retired rambles ſhe would freely indulge her tears, and gaze upon the picture of Lord Mortimer. She feared no obſervation, the rocks formed a kind of receſs about her, and in going to them ſhe ſeldom met a creature.</p>
                     <p>A fortnight paſſed in this way, and ſhe began to feel ſurpriſe and uneaſineſs, at not hearing from Mrs. Dermot; if much longer ſilent, ſhe reſolved on writing, feeling it impoſſible to endure much longer the agony her ignorance of Lord Mortimer's proceeding gave her. The very morning, previous to the one ſhe had fixed for writing, ſhe ſaw a ſailor coming to the houſe, and believing he was the bearer of a letter to her, ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got every thing but her feelings at the moment, and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:038416_0517_1011E5CF18CC57C8"/>
ſtarting from her ſeat ran from the room—She met him a few yards from the houſe, and then perceived he was one of the ſailors of the veſſel ſhe had came over in. "You have a letter for me I hope?" ſaid Amanda. The man nodded, and fumbling in his boſom for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pulled out a large pacquet, which Amanda ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eager tranſport from him; and knowing ſhe could not attempt to bring him into the houſe for refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gave him a crown to procure it elſewhere, which he received with thankfulneſs, and departed. She then returned to the parlour, and was haſtening to her cloſet to read the letter, when Mrs. Macpherſon ſtopped her. "Hey day," cried ſhe "what is the matter? What is all this fuſs about? Why, one would think that was a love letter, you are ſo very eager to read it."</p>
                     <p>"It is not then, I can aſſure you," ſaid Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Well, well, and who is it from?"—Amanda re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, that if ſhe ſaid from Mrs. Dermot, a number of impertinent queſtions would be aſked her, ſhe therefore replied, "from a very particular friend."</p>
                     <p>"From a very particular friend! Well, I ſuppoſe there is nothing about life or death in it, ſo you may wait till after dinner to read it, and pray ſit down now, and hear the children their ſpelling leſſons." This was a tantalizing moment to Amanda; ſhe ſtood heſitating whether ſhe ſhould obey, till reflecting, that if ſhe went now to read the pacquet, ſhe ſhould moſt probably be interrupted ere ſhe had got through half the contents, ſhe reſolved on putting it up till after dinner—The moment at laſt came for Mrs. Macpherſon's uſual nap, and Amanda inſtantly haſtened to a receſs amongſt the rocks, where ſeating herſelf ſhe broke the ſeal: the envelop contained two letters: the firſt ſhe caſt her eyes upon was directed in Lord Cherbury's hand. She trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, tore it open and read as follows:</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">

                           <p>In vain, my dear Madam, do you ſay you never will receive pecuniary favours from me. It is not you, but I, ſhould lie under obligations from their acceptance.
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:038416_0518_1011E5D224127F40"/>
I ſhould deem myſelf the moſt ungrateful of mankind if I did not inſiſt on carrying this point: I am juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to London, and ſhall immediately order my law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer t draw up a deed, entitling you to three hundred pounds a year, which when completed, I ſhall tranſmit to the Prioreſs (as I have this letter) to ſend to you. I am ſenſible, indeed that I never can recompenſe the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice you have made me, the feelings it has excited I ſhall not attempt to expreſs, becauſe language could never do them juſtice; but you may cenceive what I muſt feel for the being who has preſerved me from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and deſtruction. I am informed Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer has left Ireland, and therefore daily expect him in town. I have now not only every hope, but every proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his complying with my wiſhes: This I imagine, will be rather pleaſing to you to hear, that you may know the ſacrifice you have made is not made in vain; but will be attended with all the good conſequences I expected to derive from it. I ſhould again enjoy a tolerable degree of peace were I aſſured you were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; but this is an aſſurance I will hope ſoon to receive, for if you are not happy, who has a right to expect being ſo? you whoſe virtue is ſo pure, whoſe generoſity is ſo noble, ſo heroic, ſo far ſuperior to any I have ever met with?</p>
                           <p>That in this world, as well as the next, you may be rewarded for it, is, dear madam, the ſincere wiſh of him, who has the honour to ſubſcribe himſelf,</p>

                     <p>"Unfeeling man!" exclaimed Amanda, "how little is your heart intereſted in what you write, and how ſlight do you make of the ſacrifice I have made you, how cruelly mention your hopes which are derived from the deſtruction of mine!

                     <floatingText type="letter">

                           <p>Ah! my dear child, why extort a promiſe from me of being minute in relating every thing which happened in conſequence of your departure, a promiſe ſo ſolemnly given that I dare not recede from it; yet moſt unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly do I keep it, ſenſible as I am that the intelligence I have to communicate will but aggravate you ſorrows. Methinks I hear you exclaim at this; ſurely, my dear Mrs. Dermot, you who know my diſpoſition and temper ſo well, might ſuppoſe I would receive ſuch intelligence with a fortitude and patience that would prevent its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially injuring me; well, my dear, hoping this will be the caſe, I begin, without farther delay, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate particulars.</p>
                           <p>You left me, you may remember about three o'clock; I then went to bed, but ſo fatigued and oppreſſed I could ſcarcely ſleep, and was quite unrefreſhed by what I did get. After prayers I repaired to the parlour, where the aſſiduous care of ſiſter Mary had already prepared every thing for your breakfaſt and Lord Mortimer's. I told the ſiſters not to appear till they were ſent for. I had not been long alone when Lord Mortimer came in, cheerful, blooming, animated. Never did I ſee happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo ſtrongly impreſſed in any countenance as in his; he looked indeed the lover about receiving the precious reward of conſtancy. He aſked me had I ſeen you? I anſwered No. He ſoon grew impatient, ſaid you were a lazy girl, and feared you would make a bad traveller. He then rang the bell, and deſired the maid to go and call you. Oh! my dear girl, my heart almoſt died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me at this moment; I averted my head and pretended to be looking in the garden to conceal my confuſion.—The maid returned in a few minutes, and ſaid you were not above. Well, ſaid Lord Mortimer, ſhe is in ſome
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:038416_0520_1011E5D7ED3ECF38"/>
other apartment, pray ſearch and haſten her hither. In a few minutes after ſhe departed, ſiſter Mary, all pale and breathleſs, ruſhed into the room: "Oh, heavens!" cried ſhe, "Miſs Fitzalan cannot be found, but here are two letters, I found on her dreſſing table, one for you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and one for Lord Mortimer." I know not how he looked at this inſtant, for a guilty conſciouſneſs came over my mind, which prevented my raiſing my eyes to his. I took the letter in ſilence, opened, but had no power to read it. Siſter Mary ſtood by me, wringing her hands and weeping, as ſhe exclaimed, "What—what does ſhe ſay to you?" I could neither anſwer her nor move <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ill a deep ſigh or rather groan from Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer rouſed me. I ſtarted from my ſeat, and perceived him pale and motionleſs, the letter open in his hand, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which his eyes were rivetted. I threw open the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den door to give him air; this a little revived him. "Be comforted my Lord," ſaid I. "He ſhook his head mournfully, and waving his hand for me neither to ſpeak or follow him, paſſed into the garden,—"Bleſſed Heaven!" ſaid Siſter Mary again, "what does ſhe ſay to you?" I gave her your letter, and deſired her to read it aloud, for the tears which flowed at the affecting ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of Lord Mortimer, quite obſcured my ſight; and here my dear child, I muſt declare, that you have been too generous, and alſo, that the ſum you betrayed us into taking is but conſidered as a loan by us; but, to return to my firſt ſubject, the alarm concerning you now became general, and the nuns crowded into the room grief and conſternation in every countenance. In about half an hour I ſaw Lord Mortimer returning to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and I then diſmiſſed them. He had been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to compoſe himſelf, but his efforts for doing ſo were ineffectual. He trembled, was pale as death, and ſpoke with a faultering voice. He gave me your letter to read, and I put mine into his hand. "Well, my Lord," ſaid I, on peruſing it, we muſt rather pity than condemn her."</p>
                           <p>"From my ſoul," cried he, "I pity her—I pity ſuch a being as Amanda Fitzalan, for being the ſlave, the

prey of vice but ſhe has been cruel to me, ſhe has deceived, inhumanly deceived me, and blaſted my peace forever.</p>
                           <p>"Ah, my Lord!" I replied "though appearances are againſt her, I can never believe her guilty; ſhe who performed all the duties of a child as Amanda Fitzalan did, and who to my certain knowledge, was preparing herſelf for a life of poverty, can never be a victim to vice."</p>
                           <p>"Mention her no more," cried he "her name is like a dagger to my heart; the ſuſpicions, which but a few nights ago I could have killed myſelf for entertaining, are now confirmed; they intruded on my mind from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Belgrave haunting this place, and from finding her ſecreted amidſt the ruins at a late hour. Ah, heavens! when I noticed her confuſion, how eaſily did ſhe exculpate herſelf to a heart prepoſſeſſed like mine in her favour. Unhappy—unfortunate girl—ſad and pitiable is thy fate! but may an early repentance ſnatch thee from the villain who row triumphs in thy ruin, and may we, ſince thus ſeparated, never meet again. So well," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, "am I convinced of the cauſe of her flight, that I ſhall not make one enquiry after her. I again attempted to ſpeak in your juſtification, but he ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I begged he would allow me to get him break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. He could touch nothing, and ſaid he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn directly to Caſtle Carberry, but promiſed in the courſe of the day to ſee me again. I followed him into the hall; at the ſight of your corded boxes he ſtarted, and ſhrunk back with that kind of melancholy horror which we involuntarily feel when viewing any thing that belonged to a dear loſt friend. I ſaw his emotions were agonizing; he hid his face with his handkerchief, and with a haſty ſtep aſcended to his carriage, which, with a travelling chaiſe, was waiting at the door.</p>
                           <p>"I own I was often tempted, in the courſe of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to tell him all I knew about you; but the promiſe I had given you ſtill roſe to my view, and I felt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your permiſſion, I could not break it; yet, my dear,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:038416_0522_1011E5DC6E338B90"/>
it is ſhocking to me to have ſuch imputations caſt on you. We cannot blame Lord Mortimer for them; ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated as you were with him, your conduct has naturally excited the moſt injurious ſuſpicions; ſurely, my child, though not allowed to ſolve the myſtery which has ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you from him, you may be allowed to vindicate your conduct, the ſacrifice of fame and happineſs is too much; conſider and weigh well what I ſay, and if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, authorize me to inform Lord Mortimer that I know of your retreat, and that you have retired neither to a lover or a friend, but to indigence and obſcurity, led thither by a fatal neceſſity which you are bound to conceal, and feel more ſeverely from that circumſtance; he would, I am confident, credit my words, and then, inſtead of condemning, would join me in pitying you. The more I reflect on your unaccountable ſeparation, the more am I bewildered in conjectures relative to it, and convinced more ſtrongly than ever of the frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man joy, which like a ſummer cloud, is bright, but tranſitory in its ſplendor. Lord Mortimer had left the convent about two hours, when his man arrived to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs the travelling chaiſe and attendants: I went out and enquired after his Lord. "He is very bad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," ſaid he, "and this has been a ſad morning for us all." Never, my dear Miſs Fitzalan, did I, or the ſiſterhood, paſs ſo melancholy a day. About five in the afternoon I received another viſit from Lord Mortimer; I was alone in the parlour, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with an appearance of the deepeſt melancholy; one of his arms was in a ſling; I was terrified, leſt he and Belgrave had met. He conjectured, I fancy, the occaſion of the terror my countenance expreſſed, for he immediately ſaid he had been ill on returning to Caſtle Carberry, and was bled. He was ſetting off for Dublin directly, he ſaid, from whence he intended to embark for England; but I could not depart, my dear good friend, (continued he) without bidding you fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well; beſides I wanted to aſſure you, that any promiſe which the unfortunate girl made you in my name I ſhall hold ſacred. I knew he alluded to the fifty pounds which
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:038416_0523_1011E5E0CBB21078"/>
he deſired you to tell me ſhould be annually remitted to our houſe: I inſtantly therefore replied, that we had already been rewarded beyond our expectation or deſires for any little attention we ſhewed Miſs Fitza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan; but his generous reſolution was not to be ſhaken. He looked weak and exhauſted. I begged permiſſion to make tea for him ere he commenced his journey. He conſented, I went out of the room to order in the things. When I returned he was ſtanding at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow which looked into the garden, ſo abſorbed in meditation, he did not her me. I heard him ſay, "cruel Amanda! is it thus you have rewarded my ſufferings!" I retreated leſt he ſhould be confuſed by ſuppoſing himſelf overheard, and did not return till the maid brought in the tea things.</p>
                           <p>"When he aroſe to depart he looked wavering and agitated, as if there was ſomething on his mind he wanted courage to ſay. At laſt, in a faultering voice, while the deadly paleneſs of his complexion gave way to a deep crimſon, he ſaid, "I left Miſs Fitzalan's letter with you."</p>
                           <p>"Ah! my dear! never did man love woman better than he did, than he now loves you. I took the letter from my pocket, and preſented it to him. He put it in his boſom with an emotion that ſhook his whole frame. I hailed this as a favourable opportunity for again ſpeaking in your favour: I bid him retroſpect your paſt actions, and judge from them whether you could be guilty of a crime—. He ſtopped me ſhort; he begged me to drop a ſubject he was unable to bear. Had he been leſs credulous he ſaid, he ſhould now have been much happier; then wringing my hand he bid me farewell, in a voice and with a look that drew tears from me, "Ah, my dear Madam!" cried he, "when this day commenced, how differently did I think it would have terminated?"</p>
                           <p>I attended him to his carriage; he was obliged to lean upon his man as he aſcended it, and his looks and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proclaimed the deepeſt diſtreſs. I have ſent repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to Caſtle Carberry ſince his departure to inquire
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:038416_0524_1011E5E265FAC740"/>
about him, and have been informed, that they expect to hear nothing of him till Lord Cherbury's agent comes into the country, which will not be theſe three months.</p>
                           <p>I have heard much of the good he did in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; he was a bounteous and benevolent ſpirit indeed; to our community he has been a liberal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and our prayers are daily offered up for his reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration to health and tranquillity. Among his other actions, when in Dublin, about three months ago, he ordered a monument to the memory of Captain Fitza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, which has been brought down ſince your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and put up in the pariſh church where he is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I ſent Siſter Mary and another of the nuns the other evening to ſee it, and they brought me a deſcription of it; it is a white marble urn, ornamented with a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liage of laurel, and ſtanding upon a pedeſtal of grey, on which the name of the deceaſed, and words to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effect, are inſcribed, namely, "That he whoſe memory it perpetuates, performed the duties of a Chriſtian and a ſoldier, with a fidelity and zeal that now warrants his enjoying a bleſſed recompence for both."</p>
                           <p>I know this proof of reſpect to your father will deeply affect you; but I would not omit telling it, becauſe though it will affect, I am confident it will alſo pleaſe you. The late events have caſt a gloom over all our ſpirits. Siſter Mary now prays more than ever, and you know I have often told her ſhe was only fit for a religious vocation; it is a bad world ſhe ſays we live in, and ſhe is glad ſhe has ſo little to ſay to it.</p>
                           <p>I am longing to hear from you. Pray tell me how you like Mrs. Macpherſon; I have not ſeen her ſince her youth, and years often produce as great a change in the temper as the face; at any rate your preſent ſituation is too obſcure for you to continue in, and as ſoon as your thoughts are collected and compoſed you muſt look out for another. I hope you will be conſtant in writing; but I tell you beforehand, you muſt not expect me to be punctual in my anſwers; I have been ſo long diſuſed to writing, and my eyes are grown ſo weak; this letter has been the work of many days, beſides, I have really no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

intereſting to communicate, whenever I have, you may be aſſured I ſhall not loſe a moment in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming you.</p>
                           <p>The woman was extremely thankful for the five gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas you left her. Lord Mortimer ſent five more by his man, ſo that ſhe thinks herſelf well rewarded for any trouble or diſappointment ſhe experienced. If you wiſh to have any of your things ſent to you, acquaint me, you know I ſhall never want an opportunity by the maſter of the veſſel. He ſpeaks largely of your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity to him, and expreſſes much pity at ſeeing ſo young a perſon in ſuch melancholy. May Heaven if it does not remove the ſource, at leaſt leſſen this melancholy.</p>
                           <p>If poſſible, allow me to write to Lord Mortimer, and vindicate you from the unworthy ſuſpicions he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of you: I know he would believe me, and I ſhould do it without diſcovering your retreat.

                     <p>Poor Amanda wept over this letter. "I have ruined the health, the peace of Lord Mortimer," ſhe exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "and he now execrates me as the ſource of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs. Oh! Lord Cherbury, how ſeverely do I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for your crime!" She began to think her virtue had been too heroic in the ſacrifice ſhe had made; but this was a tranſient idea, for when ſhe reflected on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Lord Cherbury, ſhe was convinced the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulgement of his ſecret would have been followed by his death, and, great as was her preſent wretchedneſs, ſhe felt it light compared to the horrors ſhe knew ſhe would experience, could ſhe accuſe herſelf of being acceſſary to ſuch an event; ſhe now drank deeply of the cup of miſery, but conſcious rectitude, in ſome degree, leſſened its noxious bitterneſs. She reſolved to caution Mrs. Dermot againſt mentioning her in any manner to Lord Mortimer. She was well convinced he would believe
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:038416_0526_1011E5E71CB37920"/>
no aſſeveration of her innocence, and even if he did, what end could it anſwer? their union was oppoſed by an obſtacle not to be ſurmounted, and if he ſought and diſcovered her retreat, it would only lead to new ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, perhaps occaſion ſome dreadful cataſtrophe. "We are ſeparated," cried ſhe, folding her hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, "forever ſeparated in this world, but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven we ſhall again be re-united."</p>
                     <p>Abſorbed in the reflections and ſorrow this letter gave riſe to, ſhe remained in her ſeat till Mrs. Macpherſon's little girl ſuddenly appeared before her, and ſaid her Miſtreſs had made tea, and was wondering what kept her out ſo long.</p>
                     <p>Amanda inſtantly aroſe and carefully putting up the letter returned to the houſe where ſhe found Mrs. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherſon in a very bad humour. She grumbled exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly at Amanda's ſtaying out ſo long, and taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of her eyes being red and ſwelled, ſaid, "indeed, ſhe believed ſhe was right in ſuppoſing ſhe had got a love letter."</p>
                     <p>Amanda made no reply, and the evening paſſed away in peeviſhneſs on one ſide, and ſilence on the other.</p>
                     <p>The charm, which had hitherto rendered Amanda's ſituation tolerable, was now diſſolved, as Mrs. Dermot had ſaid ſhe could write but ſeldom, and ſcarcely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have any thing intereſting to relate; ſhe would gladly, therefore, have left Mrs. Macpherſon immediately, but ſhe knew not where to go to: She reſolved, however, ere winter was entirely ſet in, to requeſt Mrs. Dermot to look out for ſome other place for her, as ſhe had connections in Scotland, ſhe thought ſhe might recommend her to them as a governeſs, or a fit perſon to do fine works for a lady.</p>
                     <p>She aroſe long before her uſual hour the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wrote a letter expreſſive of her wiſhes and intentions to Mrs. Dermot, which ſhe ſent by a poor man who lived near the houſe to the poſt town reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him liberally for his trouble.</p>

                     <p>AMONG Mrs. Macpherſon's pupils were two little girls, who pleaſed and intereſted Amanda greatly. Their father for whom they were in mourning, had periſhed in a violent ſtorm, and their mother had pined in health and ſpirits ever ſince the fatal accident. The kindneſs with which Amanda treated them, they repaid with gratitude and attention; it had a double ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon their little hearts, from being contraſted with the four auſterity of Mrs. Macpherſon; they told Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, in a whiſper, one morning that their mama was coming to ſee their dear, good Frances Donald.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, in the courſe of the day, Mrs Duncan came; ſhe was young and pleaſing in her appearance; her weeds and deep dejection rendered her a moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting object. She ſat by Amanda, and took an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, while Mrs. Macpherſon was engaged with ſome of the children, to tell her in a low voice, "ſhe was truly obliged to her for the great attention and kindneſs ſhe ſhewed her little girls, ſo unlike their former treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the ſchool. The taſk of inſtructing them was her's," ſhe ſaid, "till her declining health and ſpirits rendered her no longer able to bear it." Amanda aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, it was a pleaſure to inſtruct minds ſo docile and ſweet tempered as theirs." Mrs. Duncan, as ſhe roſe to depart, aſked her and Mrs. Macpherſon to tea that evening, which invitation was inſtantly accepted by
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:038416_0528_1011E5EF07DF4628"/>
Mrs. Macpherſon, who was extremely fond of being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable every where but in her own houſe. Mrs. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can lived at but a little diſtance, and every thing in and about the houſe was neat and comfortable. She had an old neighbour in the parlour, who kept Mrs. Macpherſon in chat, and gave her an opportunity of converſing freely with Amanda. She marked the delicacy of her looks, and ſaid, "She believed ſhe was ill-qualified to endure ſo fatiguing a life as her preſent." She mentioned her own lonely and melancholy life, and the happineſs ſhe would derive from having ſuch a companion, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her hopes of often enjoying her ſociety. Amanda ſaid this would be impoſſible without diſobliging Mrs. Macpherſon, and Mrs. Duncan on reflection allowed it would be ſo. She then enquired if ſhe ever walked; Amanda replied ſhe did, and was aſked where ſhe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally rambled; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the ſea ſide ſhe replied.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Duncan ſighed deeply, and her eyes filled with tears: "It is there I generally ramble too," ſaid ſhe. This led to the mention of her late loſs: "Mr. Duncan had been the kindeſt, beſt of huſbands," ſhe ſaid; "the firſt years of their marriage were attended with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which were juſt removed, when he was loſt on a party of pleaſure with ſeveral others. It was ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, however," continued Mrs. Duncan, "that the body was caſt upon the ſhore, and I had the power of paying the laſt rites of decency and reſpect to him.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, between her and Amanda there appeared a mutual ſympathy, which rendered them truly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each other. From this period they met generally every evening, and paſſed many hours on the "ſea-beat ſhore," talking and often weeping over "joys departed never to return!" Mrs. Duncan was too delicate to enquire into Amanda's former ſituation, but was well convinced it had been very different from her preſent one. Amanda, however, of her own accord, told her what ſhe had told Mrs. Macpherſon, reſpecting herſelf. Mrs. Duncan lamented her misfortunes, but ſince ſhe had met them, bleſſed the happy chance which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her near her habitation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="unknown:038416_0529_1011E5F1C59035A8"/>
A month paſſed in this manner, when one evening, at the uſual place of meeting, Mrs. Duncan told her, "that ſhe believed ſhe ſhould ſoon be quitting that part of the country." Amanda ſtarted, and turned pale at this diſagreeable intelligence. She had received no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to her letter from Mrs. Dermot, conſequently dreaded that neceſſity would compel her to remain in her preſent ſituation, and on Mrs. Duncan's ſociety ſhe had depended for rendering it bearable to her.</p>
                     <p>"I have been invited my dear girl, ſaid Mrs. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, leaning on her arm as they walked up and down the beach, "to reſide with an aunt, who has always been kind, and was particularly ſo to me in my diſtreſs. She lives about ten miles from this, at an old place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Dunreath Abbey, of which ſhe is houſekeeper; have you ever heard of it?"—Amanda's agitation, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>earing her mother's native habitation mentioned, is not to be deſcribed; her heart palpitated; ſhe felt her colour change, and ſaid, Yes, and No, to Mrs. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, without knowing what ſhe anſwered; then recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting herſelf, ſhe replied, "ſhe had heard of it."</p>
                     <p>"Well then, my dear," continued Mrs. Duncan, "my aunt, as I have already told you, is houſekeeper there; ſhe lives in great grandeur, for it is a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent old ſeat, and has the abſolute command of every thing, as none of the family have reſided at it ſince the Ear, of Dunreath's deceaſe."</p>
                     <p>"My aunt is lately grown weary of the profound ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude in which ſhe lives, and has aſked me in a letter which I received this morning, to go immediately and take up my reſidence with her, promiſing, if I do ſhe will leave every thing ſhe is worth to me and my children, and as her ſalary is very good, I know ſhe muſt have ſaved a good deal; this is a very tempting offer, and I am only with held from accepting it direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the fear of depriving my children of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of education."</p>
                     <p>"Why," "ſaid Amanda, "what they learn at Mrs. Macpherſon's they could eaſily learn any where elſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="130" facs="unknown:038416_0530_1011E5F354862298"/>
"But I intended, when they were a little older," replied Mrs. Duncan, "to go to ſome one of the neighbouring towns with them; if I once go to my aunt I muſt entirely relinquiſh ſuch an idea, and to a boarding-ſchool I could not ſend them, for I have not fortitude to bear a ſeparation from them; what I wiſh therefore is, to procure a perſon who would be at once a pleaſing companion for me, and an elligible go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs for them; with ſuch a perſon the ſolitude of Dunreath-Abbey would be rather agreeable than irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to me."</p>
                     <p>She looked earneſtly at Amanda as ſhe ſpoke, and Amanda's heart began to throb with hope and agitation. "In ſhort my dear girl," continued ſhe, "you of all others, to be explicit, are the perſon I would chuſe to bring along with me; your ſweet ſociety would alleviate my ſorrows, and your elegant accompliſhments give to my children all the advantages I deſire them to poſſeſs."</p>
                     <p>"I am not only flattered, but happy by your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion in my favour," replied Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"I am pleaſed we agree in point of inclination," ſaid Mrs. Duncan; "but I muſt now inform you that my aunt has always been averſe to admit any ſtrangers to the Abbey: Why I know not, except it is by the commands of the family, and ſhe tells me in her letter, that if I accept her invitation I muſt not on any account let it be known where I am removing to; I dare not therefore bring you with me without her permiſſion; but I ſhall write immediately, and requeſt it. In the courſe of a day or two I may except an anſwer; in the mean time give Mrs. Macpherſon no intimation of our preſent intentions, leſt they ſhould be defeated." A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda promiſed ſhe would not, and they ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>She was now in a ſtate of the greateſt agitation, at the probability there was that ſhe might viſit the ſeat of her anceſtors. She dreaded a diſappointment, and felt that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ſhe went there as the companion of Mrs. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, ſhe ſhould be better ſituated than a few hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had ever expected to be again. Two evenings
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:038416_0531_1011E5F4E4DB45B0"/>
after her converſation with Mrs. Duncan, on going to the beach to meet her, ſhe ſaw her approaching with an open letter in her hand, and a ſmile on her face, which informed her its contents were pleaſing. They were ſo indeed, as they gave permiſſion to have Amanda brought to the Abbey, provided ſhe promiſed inviolable ſecrecy as to where ſhe was going. This Amanda cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully did, and Mrs. Duncan ſaid, ſhe had ſome affairs to ſettle, which would prevent their departure for a few days; at whatever time ſhe appointed, her aunt was to ſend a carriage for them, and it was now agreed, that Mrs. Macpherſon ſhould be informed Mrs. Duncan was leaving that part of the country, and had engaged A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda as a governeſs to her children.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Duncan then mentioned her own terms. Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da aſſured her an idea of them had never entered her thoughts. Mrs. Duncan ſaid ſhe was ſure of that, but at the ſame time thought between the moſt intimate friends exactneſs ſhould be preſerved. Every thing being ſettled to their mutual ſatisfaction they ſeparated, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, after ſchool broke up, Amanda informed Mrs. Macpherſon of her intended departure. The old Dame was thunder-ſtruck, and for ſome time unable to ſpeak, but when ſhe recovered the uſe of her tongue expreſſed the utmoſt rage and indignation againſt Amanda, Mrs. Duncan, and the Prioreſs, againſt the firſt for thinking of leaving her, the ſecond for inveigling her away, and the third for recommending a perſon who could ſerve her in ſuch a manner. When ſhe ſtopped exhauſted by her violence, Amanda took the opportunity of aſſuring her that ſhe had no reaſon to condemn any of them, as for her part, previous to Mrs. Duncan's offer, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to leave her, being unable to bear a life of ſuch fatigue; that, as her removal would not be immediate, Mrs. Macpherſon could ſuffer no inconvenience by it, there being time enough to look out for another perſon ere it took place: But the truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="132" facs="unknown:038416_0532_1011E5F7B112ED60"/>
torrent of bitter reproaches again burſt forth for her quitting her.</p>
                     <p>Amanda reſented them not, but did all in her power to molify her; as the moſt effectual method of doing ſo ſhe declared ſhe meant to take no recompenſe for the time ſhe had been with her, and added, if ſhe had her permiſſion, ſhe would write that very evening to Mrs. Dermot about a woman ſhe had ſeen at the Convent, who ſhe thought well qualified to be an aſſiſtant in her ſchool. This was the woman who had been engaged to attend her to England. Mrs. Macpherſon at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſhe ſhould write for her, as her wrath had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſubſided from the moment Amanda declared ſhe would take no payment—Amanda accordingly wrote to Mrs. Dermot, and informed her of the agreeable change there was about taking place in her ſituation; alſo of Mrs. Macpherſon's diſpleaſure, and her own wiſh that a perſon might immediately be procured to fill the place ſhe was reſigning. She mentioned the woman already ſpoken of as a proper perſon, but requeſted, if ſhe conſented to come, ſhe might not be allowed to do ſo till ſhe had left Mrs. Macpherſon's, elſe who ſhe really was would be betrayed; ſhe now thought little of the tedious and diſagreeable days ſhe ſpent, as the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which ſhe ſaw Mrs. Duncan preparing for their departure promiſed ſo ſpeedily to change them; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an anſwer from Ireland even ſooner than ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Mrs. Dermot congratulated her on having met ſo amiable a friend, as Mrs. Duncan; ſaid the woman accepted the offer made in Mrs. Macpherſon's name; but ſhould not depart till ſhe had written for that purpoſe, and concluded her letter by ſaying, there was no intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence yet of Lord Mortimer. Mrs. Macpherſon was pleaſed to find ſhe ſhould not be long without a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and two days after the receipt of the letter, Mrs. Duncan told Amanda their journey was fixed for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing day, and begged Amanda to ſleep at her houſe that night, to which ſhe gladly conſented; accordingly after dinner ſhe took leave of Mrs. Macpherſon, who grumbled out a farewell, and a hope that ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

have reaſon to repent quitting her, for the old lady was ſo incenſed to have the place Mrs. Duncan was going to, concealed from her, that all her ill humour had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. Amanda, with a pleaſure ſhe could ſcarcely conceal, quitted her inhoſpitable manſion, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a man who carried her trunk, ſoon found herſelf at Mrs. Duncan's where ſhe was received with every demonſtration of joy. The evening paſſed ſociably away; they aroſe early in the morning, and had juſt breakfaſted when the expected carriage from Dunreath Abbey arrived; it was a heavy old-faſhioned chaiſe, on whoſe faded pannels the arms of the Dunreath family were ſtill viſible.—Mrs. Duncan's luggage had been ſent off the preceding day, ſo that there was nothing now to delay them. Mrs. Duncan made Amanda and the children go into the chaiſe before her, but detained by an emotion of the moſt painful nature, ſhe lingered ſome time upon the threſhold; ſhe could not indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the habitation, where ſhe had paſt ſo many happy days with the man of her tendereſt affections, without a flood of tears, which ſpoke the bitterneſs of her feelings. Amanda knew too well the nature of thoſe feelings, to attempt reſtraining them; but the little children impatient to begin their journey, called out to their mamma to come into the carriage. She ſtarted when they ſpoke, but inſtantly complied with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; and when they expreſſed their grief at ſeeing her cheeks wet with tears, kiſſed them both, and ſaid ſhe would ſoon recover her ſpirits. She accordingly exerted herſelf for that purpoſe, and was ſoon in a condition to converſe with Amanda. The day was fine and ſerene; they travelled leiſurely, for the horſes had long outlived their mettleſome days, and gave them an opportunity of attentively viewing the proſpects on each ſide, which were various, romantic and beautiful; the novelty of the ſcenes, the diſagreeable place ſhe had left, and the idea of the one ſhe was going to, helped a little to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven the penſive ſoul of Amanda, and ſhe enjoyed a greater degree of tranquillity than ſhe had before expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſince her ſeparation from Lord Mortimer.</p>

                     <p>"MY dear, dear Fanny," ſaid Mrs. Duncan, addreſſing our heroine by her borrowed name, "if at all inclined to ſuperſtition, you are now going to a place which will call it forth. Dunreath-Abbey is Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic and gloomy in the extreme, and recalls to one's mind all the ſtories they ever heard of haunted houſes and apparitions; the deſertion of the native inhabitants has haſtened the depredations of time, whoſe ravages are unrepaired, except in the part immediately occupied by the domeſtics; yet what is the change of the building compared to the revolution which took place in the fortunes of her who once beheld a proſpect of being its miſtreſs; the Earl of Dunreath's eldeſt daughter, as I have often heard from many, was a celebrated beauty, and as good as ſhe was handſome; but a malignant ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother thwarted her happineſs, and forced her to take ſhelter in the arms of a man who had every thing but fortune to recommend him; but in wanting that he wanted every thing to pleaſe her family.</p>
                     <p>"After ſome years of diſtreſs ſhe found means to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the heart of her father; but here the invidious ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother again interfered, and prevented her experiencing any good effects from his returning tenderneſs, and it was rumoured, by a deep and iniquitous ſcheme, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her of her birth-right. Like other rumours, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it gradually died away, perhaps from Lady Malvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na and her huſband never hearing of it, and none but them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the pride and pomp of wealth can neither alleviate or recompenſe the ſtings of conſcience, much rather," continued Mrs. Duncan, laying her hands on her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's heads as they ſat at her feet, "much rather would I have my babes wander from door to door, to beg the dole of charity than live upon the birth right of the orphan.</p>
                     <p>"If Lady Dunreath in reality committed the crime ſhe was accuſed of, ſhe met, in ſome degree a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it. Soon after the Earl's death ſhe betrayed a partiality, for a man every way inferior to her, which partiality, people have not ſcrupled to ſay, commenced, and was indulged to a criminal degree during the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of her huſband. She would have married him had not her daughter, the Marchioneſs of Roſline, interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Proud and ambitious, her rage at the proſpect of ſuch an alliance knew no bounds, and ſeconded by the Marquis, whoſe diſpoſition was congenial to her own, they got the unfortunate mother into their power, and hurried her off to a convent in France. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe is yet living; indeed I believe there are few ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know or care, ſhe was ſo much diſliked for her haughty diſpoſition. I have ſometimes aſked my aunt about her, but ſhe would never gratify my curioſity. She has been brought up in the family; and no doubt thinks herſelf bound to conceal whatever they chuſe.</p>
                     <p>"She lives in eaſe and plenty, and is abſolute miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the few domeſtics that reſide in the Abbey; but of thoſe domeſtics I caution you in time, or they will be apt to fill your head with frightful ſtories of the Abbey, which ſometimes, if one's ſpirits are weak, in ſpite of reaſon, will make an impreſſion on the mind. They pretend that the Earl of Dunreath's firſt wife haunts the Abbey, venting the moſt piteous moans, which they aſcribe to grief for the unfortunate fate of her daughter, and that daughter's children being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their rightful patrimony.</p>
                     <p>"I honeſtly confeſs, when at the Abbey a few years ago, during ſome diſtreſſes of my huſband's, I heard ſtrange noiſes one evening at twilight as I walked in a
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:038416_0536_1011E604346DAD38"/>
gallery. I told my aunt of them, and ſhe was quite angry at the involuntary terror I expreſſed, and ſaid it was nothing but the wind whiſtling through ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining galleries which I heard. But this, my dear Fanny," ſaid Mrs. Duncan, who on account of her children had continued the latter part of her diſcourſe, in a low voice, "is all between ourſelves; for my aunt declared ſhe would never pardon my mentioning my ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous fears, or the yet more ridiculous fears of the ſervants to any human being."</p>
                     <p>Amanda liſtened in ſilence to Mrs. Duncan's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, fearful that if ſhe ſpoke ſhe ſhould betray the emotions it excited.</p>
                     <p>They at laſt entered between the mountains that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed the valley on which the Abbey ſtood. The ſcene was ſolemn and ſolitary; every proſpect, except one of the ſea, ſeen through an aperture in one of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains was excluded. Some of theſe mountains were bare, craggy, and projecting; others were ſkirted with trees, robed with vivid green, and crowned with white and yellow furze; ſome were all a wood of interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſhades, and others covered with long and purple heath, various ſtreams flowed from them into the valley, ſome ſtole gently down their ſides in ſilver rills, giving beauty and vigour wherever they meandered, others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>mbled from fragment to fragment, with a noiſe not undelightful to the ear, and formed for themſelves a deep bed in the valley, over which trees, that appeared coeval with the bulding, bent their old and leafy heads.</p>
                     <p>At the foot of what to the reſt was called a gently ſwelling hill, lay the remains of the extenſive gardens which had once given the luxuries of the vegetable world to the banquets of the Abbey; but the buildings which had nurſed thoſe luxuries were all gone to decay, and the gay plantations were over run with the progeny of neglect and ſloth.</p>
                     <p>The Abbey was one of the moſt venerable looking buildings Amanda had ever beheld; but it was in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy grandeur ſhe now ſaw it. In the wane of its days, when its glory was paſſed away, and the whole
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:038416_0537_1011E6070EF9D108"/>
pile proclaimed deſertion and decay, ſhe ſaw it, when to uſe the beautiful language of Hutchinſon, its pride was brought low, when its magnificence was ſinking in the duſt, when tribulation had taken the ſeat of hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and ſolitude reigned, where once the jocund gueſt had laughed over the ſparkling bowl, whilſt the owls ſung nightly their ſtrains of melancholy to the moon ſhine that ſlept upon its mouldering battlements.</p>
                     <p>The heart of Amanda was full of the fond idea of her parents, and the ſigh of tender remembrance ſtole from it. "How little room," thought ſhe, "ſhould there be in the human heart for the wordly pride which ſo often dilates it, liable as all things are to change, the diſtreſs in which the deſcendants of noble families are ſo often ſeen, the decline of ſuch families themſelves ſhould check that arrogant preſumption with which ſo many look forward to having their greatneſs and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity perpetuated through every branch of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</p>
                     <p>"The proud poſſeſſors of this Abbey, ſurrounded with affluence, and living in its full enjoyment, never perhaps admitted the idea as at all probable, that one of their deſcendants ſhould ever approach the ſeat of her anceſtors without that pomp and elegance which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſtinguiſhed its daughters. Alas! one now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches it neither to diſplay or contemplate the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry of wealth, but meek and lowly; not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſmile of love, or the embrace of relatives, but afflicted and unknown, glad to find a ſhelter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the bread of dependence beneath its decaying roof.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Duncan happily marked not Amanda's emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ſhe gazed upon the Abbey; ſhe was buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in anſwering her childrens' queſtions, who wanted to know whether ſhe thought they would be able to climb up the great big hills they ſaw.</p>
                     <p>The carriage at laſt ſtopped before the Abbey. Mrs. Bruce was already at the door to receive them; ſhe was a little ſmart old woman, and welcomed her niece and the children with an appearance of the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:038416_0538_1011E608DFC23FC0"/>
On Amanda's being preſented to her, ſhe gazed ſtedfaſtly in her face a few minutes, and then exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "Well, this is very ſtrange—though I know I could never have ſeen this young lady before, her face is quite familiar to me."</p>
                     <p>The hall into which they entered was large and gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, paved with black marble, and ſupported by pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, through which the arched doors that led to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious apartments were ſeen; rude implements, ſuch as the Caledonians, had formerly uſed in war and hunting, were ranged along the walls. Mrs. Bruce conducted them into a ſpacious parlour, terminated by an elegant ſaloon; this ſhe told them had once been the banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room; the furniture, though faded, was ſtill mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, and the windows, though ſtill in the Gothic ſtyle, from being enlarged conſiderably beyond their original dimenſions, afforded a moſt delightful view of the domain.</p>
                     <p>"Do you know ſaid Mrs. Duncan, "this apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though one of the pleaſanteſt in the Abbey in point of ſituation, always makes me melancholy; the moment I enter it I think of the entertainments once given in it, and then its preſent vacancy and ſtillneſs almoſt inſtantly reminds me, that thoſe who partook of theſe entertainments are now almoſt all humbled with the duſt?"—Her aunt laughed, and ſaid, "ſhe was very romantic."</p>
                     <p>The ſolemnity of the Abbey was well calculated to heighten the awe which ſtole upon the ſpirit of Amanda from her firſt view of it; no noiſe was heard through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, except the hoarſe creaking of the maſſy doors, as the ſervants paſſed from one room to another adjuſting Mrs. Duncan's things and preparing for dinner. Mrs. Duncan was drawn into a corner of the room by her aunt, to converſe, in a low voice, about family affairs, and the children were rambling about the hall, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enquiring about every thing they ſaw.</p>
                     <p>Thus left to herſelf, a ſoft languor gradually ſtole over the mind of Amanda, which was almoſt exhauſted from the emotions it had experienced. The murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſound of waterfalls and the buzzing of the flies,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:038416_0539_1011E60CAF598178"/>
that baſked in the ſunny rays which darted through the caſements, lulled her into a kind of penſive tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>"Am I really," ſhe aſked herſelf, "in the ſeat of my anceſtors? Am I really in the habitation where my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was born, where her irrevocable vows were plighted to my father? I am—and, oh! within it may I at laſt find an aſylum from the vices and dangers of the world; within it may my ſorrowing ſpirit loſe its agitation, and ſubdue, if not its affections, at leaſt its murmurs, at the diſappointment of thoſe affections."</p>
                     <p>The appearance of dinner interrupted her. She made exertions to overcome any appearance of dejection, and the converſation, if not lively, was at leaſt cheerful. After dinner Mrs. Duncan, who had been informed by Amanda of her predilection for old buildings, aſked her aunt's permiſſion to ſhew her the Abbey. Mrs. Bruce immediately aroſe, and ſaid ſhe would have that pleaſure herſelf. She accordingly led the way; many of the apartments yet diſplayed the ſumptuous taſte of thoſe who had furniſhed them. "It is aſtoniſhing to me," ſaid Mrs. Duncan, "that ſo magnificent a pile as this ſhould be abandoned, as I may ſay, by its poſſeſſors."</p>
                     <p>"The Marquis of Roſline's Caſtle is a more mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſtructure than this," ſaid Mrs. Bruce, "and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by them on that account."</p>
                     <p>"So, like the family monument," rejoined Mrs. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, "they are merely ſatisfied with permitting this to ſtand, as it may help to tranſmit the Marchioneſs's name to poſterity."</p>
                     <p>"How far does the Marquis live from this?" aſked Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"About twelve miles," replied Mrs. Bruce, who did not appear pleaſed with her niece's converſation, and led the way to a long gallery, ornamented with portraits of the family. This gallery Amanda knew well by deſcription; this was the gallery in which her father had ſtopped to contemplate the picture of her mother, and her heart throbbed with impatience and anxiety to ſee that picture.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Bruce, as ſhe went before her, told her the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:038416_0540_1011E610818C54F0"/>
names of the different portraits. She ſuddenly ſtopped before one;—"that," cried ſhe, "is the Marchioneſs of Roſline's drawn for her when Lady Auguſta Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reath." Amanda caſt her eyes upon it, and perceived in the countenance the ſame haughtineſs as ſtill diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marchioneſs. She looked at the next pannel, and found it empty.</p>
                     <p>"The picture of Lady Malvina Dunreath hung there," ſaid Mrs. Bruce; "but after her unfortunate marriage it was taken down."</p>
                     <p>"And deſtroyed," exclaimed Amanda mournfully.</p>
                     <p>"No; but it was thrown into the old Chapel, where with the reſt of the lumber (the ſoul of Amanda was ſtruck at theſe words)—it has been locked up for years."</p>
                     <p>"And is it impoſſible to ſee it?" aſked Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible indeed," replied Mrs. Bruce, "the Chapel, and the whole eaſtern part of the Abbey, have long been in a ruinous ſituation, on which account it has been locked up."</p>
                     <p>"This is the gallery," whiſpered Mrs. Duncan, "in which I heard the ſtrange noiſes; but not a word of them to my aunt."</p>
                     <p>Amanda could ſcarcely conceal the diſappointment ſhe felt at finding ſhe could not ſee her mother's picture. She would have entreated the chapel might be opened for that purpoſe, had ſhe not feared exciting ſuſpicions by doing ſo.</p>
                     <p>They returned from the gallery to the parlour, and in the courſe of converſation Amanda heard many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting anecdotes of her anceſtors from Mrs. Bruce. Her mother was alſo mentioned, and Mrs. Bruce, by dwelling on her worth, made amends in ſome degree, to Amanda for having called her picture lumber. She retired to her chamber with her mind ſoftened and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by hearing of her mother's virtues. She called upon her, upon her father's ſpirit, upon them whoſe kindred ſouls were re-united in heaven, to bleſs their child, to ſtrengthen, to ſupport her in the thorny path marked out for her to take; nor to ceaſe their tutelary care till ſhe was joined to them by Providence.</p>

                     <p>EXPERIENCE convinced Amanda that the change in her ſituation was, if poſſible, more pleaſing than ſhe expected it would be. Mrs. Duncan was the kindeſt and moſt attentive of friends. Mrs. Bruce was civil and obliging, and her little pupils were docile and affectionate. Could ſhe have avoided retroſpection, ſhe would have been happy; but the remembrance of paſt events was too deeply impreſſed upon her mind to be era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; it mingled in the viſions of the night, in the avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the day, and in the meditations of her lonely hours, forcing from her heart the ſighs of regret and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; her mornings were devoted to her pupils, and in the evenings ſhe ſometimes walked with Mrs. Duncan, ſometimes read aloud whilſt ſhe and her aunt were work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but whenever they were engaged in chatting about family affairs, or at a game of piquet, (which was often the caſe, as Mrs. Bruce neither loved walking or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) ſhe always took that opportunity of retiring from the room, and either rambled through the dark and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate windings of the Abbey, or about the grounds contiguous to it; ſhe ſighed whenever ſhe paſſed the Chapel which contained the picture of her mother; it was in a ruinous condition; but a thick foliage of ivy partly hid, while it proclaimed its decey; the windows were broken in many places, but all too high to admit the poſſibility of her gaining admittance thro' them, and the door was ſtrongly ſecured by maſſy bars of iron, as was every door which had a communication with the eaſtern
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:038416_0542_1011E614C4128AA0"/>
part of the Abbey. A fortnight paſſed away at the Abbey without any thing happening to diſturb the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity which reigned in it. No one approached it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few of the wandering children of poverty, and its inhabitants ſeemed perfectly content with their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from the world. Amanda, by Mrs. Duncan's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, had told Mrs. Dermot to direct her letters to a town about five miles from the Abbey; thither a man went every day, but conſtantly returned without one for her.</p>
                     <p>"Why," ſhe aſked herſelf, "this anxiety for a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this diſappointment for not receiving one, when I neither expect to hear any thing intereſting or agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Mrs. Dermot has already ſaid ſhe had no means of hearing about Lord Mortimer, and, even if ſhe had, why ſhould I deſire ſuch intelligence, torn as I am from him forever?"</p>
                     <p>At the expiration of another week an incident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, which again deſtroyed the compoſure of our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine. Mrs. Bruce one morning haſtily entered the room, where ſhe and Mrs. Duncan were ſitting with the little girls, and begged they would not ſtir from it till ſhe told them to do ſo, as the Marquis of Roſline's ſteward was below ſtairs, and if he knew of their reſidence at the Abbey, ſhe was confident he would reveal it to his Lord, which ſhe had no doubt would occaſion her own diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from it. The ladies aſſured her they would not leave the apartment, and ſhe retired, leaving them aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the agitation ſhe betrayed.</p>
                     <p>In about two hours ſhe returned, and ſaid ſhe came to releaſe them from confinement as the ſteward had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. "He had brought unexpected intelligence," ſaid ſhe; "the Marquis and his family are coming down to the caſtle; the ſeaſon is ſo far advanced I did not ſuppoſe they would viſit it till next ſummer: I muſt therefore," continued ſhe, addreſſing her niece, ſend to the neighbouring town to procure lodgings for you till the family leave the country, as no doubt ſome of them will come to the Abbey, and to find you in it would, I can aſſure you, be attended with unpleaſant conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to me."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:038416_0543_1011E61808955788"/>
Mrs. Duncan begged ſhe would not ſuffer the leaſt uneaſineſs on her account, and propoſed that very day leaving the Abbey.</p>
                     <p>"No," Mrs. Bruce replied, "there was no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, for quitting it for a few days longer, the family," continued ſhe, "are coming down upon a joyful oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to celebrate the nuptials of the Marquis's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Lady Euphraſia Sutherland."</p>
                     <p>"Lady Euphraſia's nuptials!<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Exclaimed Amanda, in an agitated voice, and forgetting her own ſituation, "To whom is ſhe going to be married?"</p>
                     <p>"To Lord Mortimer," Mrs. Bruce replied, "the Earl of Cherbury's only ſon, a very fine young man. I am told the affair has been long talked of; but—." Here ſhe was interrupted by a deep ſigh, or rather groan from the unfortunate Amanda, who at the ſame moment fell back on her chair, pale, and without motion. Mrs. Duncan ſcreamed, and flew to her aſſiſtance, Mrs. Bruce equally frightened, though leſs affected, ran for reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, and the children claſped her knees and wept. From her penſive look and manner Mrs. Duncan ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from their firſt acquaintance, that her heart had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a diſappointment of the tendereſt nature. Her little girls too had told her that they had ſeen Miſs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald crying over a picture. Her ſuſpicions concerning ſuch a diſappointment were now confirmed by a ſudden emotion and illneſs of Amanda; but ſhe had all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy which belongs to true ſenſibility, and determined never to let Amanda know ſhe conjectured the ſource of her ſorrows, certain as ſhe was that they had never ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated from any miſconduct.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Bruce's drops reſtored Amanda's ſenſes; but ſhe felt weak and trembling, and begged ſhe might be ſupported to her room to lie down on the bed. Mrs. Bruce and Mrs. Duncan accordingly led her to it. The former almoſt immediately retired, and the tears of Amanda now burſt forth. She wept a long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion, and as ſoon as her ſobs would permit her to ſpeak, begged Mrs. Duncan to leave her to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Mrs. Duncan knew too well the luxury of ſecret
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:038416_0544_1011E61C2BAE53C8"/>
grief to deny her the enjoyment of ſo melancholy a feaſt, and directly withdrew.</p>
                     <p>The wretched Amanda then aſked herſelf, if ſhe had not known before, that the ſacrifice ſhe had made Lord Cherbury would lead to the event ſhe now regretted? It was true ſhe did know it; but whenever an idea of its taking place occurred, ſhe had ſo ſedulouſly driven it from her mind, that ſhe at laſt almoſt ceaſed to think about it; was he to be united to any other woman than Lady Euphraſia, ſhe thought ſhe would not be ſo wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. "Oh, Mortimer! beloved of my ſoul!" ſhe cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "were you going to be united to a woman ſenſible of your worth, and worthy of your noble heart, in the knowledge of your happineſs my miſery would be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened; but what an union of miſery muſt minds ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congenial as your's and Lady Euphraſia's form! Alas! am I not wretched enough in contemplating my own proſpect of unhappineſs, but that your's alſo muſt be obtruded on me."</p>
                     <p>"Yet, perhaps," ſhe continued, "the evils I dread on Lord Mortimer's account may be averted.—Oh! that they may, "ſaid ſhe, with fervor, and raiſing her hands and eyes. "Soften, gracious Heaven! ſoften the flinty nature of Lady Euphraſia: Oh! render her ſenſible of the bleſſing you beſtow, in giving her Lord Mortimer, and render her not only capable of inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of feeling tenderneſs. May ſhe prove to him the tender friend, the faithful, the affectionate compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the unfortunate Amanda would have been. Oh! may ſhe build her happineſs on his, and may his be great as his virtues, extenſive as his charities, and may the knowledge of it ſoothe my afflicted heart."</p>
                     <p>Her ſpirits were a little elevated by the fervency of her language; but it was a traſient elevation; the fluſh it ſpread over her cheeks ſoon died away, and her tears again began to flow.</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſhe cried, "in a few days, it will be crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to think of Lord Mortimer as I have hitherto done and I ſhall bluſh," continued ſhe, gazing at his picture,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:038416_0545_1011E61ECC8D8BF8"/>
"to contemplate this dear ſhadow, when I reflect its original is the huſband of Lady Euphraſia."</p>
                     <p>The dinner-bell now ſounded through the Abbey, and almoſt at the ſame time ſhe heard a tap at her door. She ſtarted, and reflected for the firſt time, that her deep dejection would naturally excite ſuſpicions as to its ſource, if longer indulged.—Shocked at the idea of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring them, ſhe haſtily wiped away her tears, and opening the door, found her friend Mrs. Duncan at it, who begged ſhe would come down to dinner. Amanda did not refuſe, but was obliged to uſe the ſupporting arm of her friend to reach the parlour. She could not eat; with difficulty could ſhe reſtrain her tears, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the enquiries Mrs. Bruce made after what ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a mere bodily indiſpoſition. She forced herſelf, however, to continue in the parlour till after tea, when cards being produced ſhe had an opportunity of going out and indulging her anguiſh without fear of interruption: Unable, however, to walk far, ſhe repaired to the old Chapel, and ſitting down by it leaned her head againſt its decayed and ivy covered walls. She had ſcarcely ſat in this manner a minute when the ſtones gave way, with a noiſe that terrified her, and ſhe would have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len backwards, had ſhe not caught at ſome projecting wood. She haſtily roſe, and found that the ivy entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concealed the breach. She examined it however, and perceived it large enough to admit her into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. A ſudden pleaſure pervaded her heart at the idea of being able to enter it, and examine the picture ſhe had ſo long wiſhed to behold. There was nothing to oppoſe her entrance but the ivy. This ſhe parted with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſo as not to ſtrip it from the wall, and after ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping over the fallen rubbiſh, ſhe found herſelf in the body of the Chapel. The ſilent hour of twilight was now advanced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the moon be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ms that darted through the broken roof prevented the Chapel from being involved in utter darkneſs. Already had the owls begun their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſtrains on its mouldering pillars, while the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens croaked amongſt the luxuriant trees that ruſtled
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:038416_0546_1011E620B5DD9CA0"/>
around it, duſty and moth-eaten banners were ſuſpended from the walls, and ruſty caſques, ſhields and ſpears were promiſcuouſly heaped together, the uſeleſs armour of thoſe, over whoſe remains Amanda now trod with a light and trembling foot; ſhe looked for the picture, and perceived one reclined againſt the wall near the altar. She wiped away the duſt, and perceived this was indeed the one ſhe ſought, the one her father had ſo often deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to her, the light was too imperfect for her to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the features, and ſhe reſolved, if poſſible, to come at an earlier hour the enſuing evening. She felt impreſſed with reverential awe as ſhe ſtood before it. She recollected the pathetic manner in which her father had mentioned his emotions as he gazed upon it, and her tears began to flow for the diſaſtrous fate of her parents and her own. She ſunk into an agony of grief, which mournful remembrances and preſent calamities excited, upon the ſteps of that altar, where Fitzalan and Malvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na had plighted their irrevocable vows, ſhe leaned her arm on the rails, but her face was turned to the picture, as if it could ſee and would pity her diſtreſs. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in this ſituation till the ſtriking of the Abbey clock warned her to depart. In going towards the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſhe perceived a ſmall arched door at the oppoſite ſide, as the apartments Lady Malvina had occupied were in this part of the building, ſhe reſolved on viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them before ſhe left the Abbey, leſt the breach in the wall ſhould be diſcovered ere ſhe returned to it. She returned to the parlour ere the ladies had finiſhed their game of piquet, and the next evening immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tea, repaired to the Chapel leaving them as uſual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged at cards. She ſtood a few minutes before it to ſee if any one was near; but perceiving no object ſhe again entered it.—She had now ſufficient light to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the picture; though faded by the damp, it yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that lovelineſs for which its original was ſo much admired, and which Amanda had ſo often heard elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſcribed by her father. She contemplated it with awe and pity. Her heart ſwelled with the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it excited, and gave way to its feelings in tears.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:038416_0547_1011E62386FE5C08"/>
To weep before the ſhade of her mother, ſeemed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage the bitterneſs of thoſe feelings; ſhe pronounced the name of her parents, ſhe called herſelf their wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed orphan, a ſtranger, and a dependant, in the manſion of her anceſtors; ſhe pronounced the name of Lord Mortimer in the impaſſioned accents of tenderneſs and diſtreſs. As ſhe thus indulged the ſorrows of her ſoul in tears and lamentations, ſhe ſuddenly heard a faint noiſe like an advancing footſtep near her. She ſtarted up, for ſhe had been kneeling before her mother's pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, terrified leaſt her viſit to the Chapel had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, which ſhe knew, if the caſe, would mortally diſoblige Mrs. Bruce, though why ſhe ſhould be ſo averſe to any one's viſiting it ſhe could not conceive. She liſtened in trembling anxiety a few minutes; all again was ſtill, and ſhe returned to the parlour, where ſhe found the ladies as ſhe had left them, determined, notwithſtanding her late fright, to return the next even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Chapel, and viſit the apartments that were her mother's.</p>

                     <p>THE next evening Amanda's patience was put to the teſt; for after tea Mrs. Duncan propoſed a walk, which ſeemed to cut off her hopes of viſiting the chapel that evening; but after ſtrolling ſome time about the valley, complaiſance for her aunt made Mrs. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can return to the parlour, where ſhe was expected to take her uſual hand at piquet. The hour was late, and the ſky ſo gloomy, that the moon, though at its full, could ſcarcely penetrate the darkneſs; notwithſtanding
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:038416_0548_1011E626942CFE48"/>
all this Amanda reſolved on going to the chapel conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this as, in all probability, the only opportunity ſhe would have of viſiting the apartments her mother had occupied (which ſhe had an inexpreſſible deſire to enter) as in two days ſhe was to accompany Mrs. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can to lodgings in the neighbouring town; ſhe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſaid ſhe had a mind to walk a little longer. Mrs. Bruce bid her beware of catching cold, and Mrs. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſaid ſhe was too fond of ſolitary rambles; but no oppoſition being made to her intention ſhe hurried to the Chapel, and entering the little arched door, found herſelf in a lofty hall, in the centre of which was a grand ſtaircaſe, the whole enlightened by a large Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic window at the head of the ſtairs. She aſcended them with a trepidation, for her footſteps produced a hollow echo, which added ſomething awful to the gloom that enveloped her. On gaining the top of the ſtairs ſhe ſaw two large folding doors on either ſide, both cloſed. She knew the direction to take, and, by a ſmall exertion of ſtrength, pulled the one on the left ſide open, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a long gallery, which ſhe knew was terminated by the apartments ſhe wanted to viſit: Its almoſt total darkneſs, however, nearly conquered her wiſh, and ſhook her reſolution of proceeding; but aſhamed, even to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to give way to ſuperſtitious fears, or turn back without gratifying her inclination after going ſo far, ſhe advanced into the gallery, though with a trembling ſtep, and as ſhe let the door out of her hand, it ſhut too with a violence that ſhook the whole building. The gallery on one ſide had a row of arched doors, and on the other an equal number of windows; but ſo ſmall, and placed ſo high as ſcarcely to admit a ray of light. Amanda's heart began to beat with unuſual quickneſs, and ſhe thought ſhe ſhould never reach the end of the gallery. She at laſt came to a door, it was cloſed, not faſtened; ſhe puſhed it gently open, and could juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern a ſpacious room; this ſhe ſuppoſed had been her mother's dreſſing-room; the moon-beams, as if to aid her wiſh of examining it, ſuddenly darted through the caſements. Cheered by the unexpected light, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038416_0549_1011E62829696CD8"/>
into the room; at the upper end of it ſomething in white attracted her notice: She concluded it to be the portrait of Lady Malvina's mother, which ſhe had been informed hung in this room. She went up to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it; but her horror may be better conceived than deſcribed, when ſhe found herſelf not by a picture, but by the real form of a woman, with a death-like counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance! She ſcreamed wildly at the terrifying ſpectre, for ſuch ſhe believed it to be, and as quick lightning flew from the room. Again was the moon obſcured by a cloud, and ſhe involved in utter darkneſs. She ran with ſuch violence, that as ſhe reached the door at the end of the gallery, ſhe fell againſt it. Extremely hurt, ſhe had not power to move for a few minutes, but while ſhe involuntary pauſed ſhe heard approaching footſteps. Wild with terror, ſhe inſtantly recovered her faculties, and attempted opening it; but it reſiſted all her efforts. "Protect me, Heaven!" ſhe exclaimed, and at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment felt an icy hand upon her's! Her ſenſes inſtantly receded, and ſhe ſunk to the floor. When ſhe recovered from her inſenſibility, ſhe perceived a glimmering light around her. She opened her eyes with fearfulneſs, but no object appeared, and to her great joy ſhe ſaw the door ſtanding open, and found that the light proceeded from the large window. She inſtantly roſe, and deſcended the ſtair-caſe with as much haſte as her trembling limbs could make; but again, what was her horror when, on enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chapel, the firſt object ſhe beheld was the ſame that had already alarmed her ſo much! She made a ſpring to eſcape through the entrance, but the apparition, with a rapidity equal to her own, glided before her, and with a hollow voice, as ſhe waved her emaciated hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "Forbear to go."</p>
                     <p>A deadly faintneſs again came over Amanda; ſhe ſunk upon a broken ſeat, and put her hand over her eyes to ſhut out the frightful viſion.</p>
                     <p>"Loſe," continued the figure, in a hallow voice, "loſe your ſuperſtitious fears, and in me behold not an airy inhabitant of the other world, but a ſinful, ſorrowing, and repentant woman."</p>

The terrors of Amanda gave way to this unexpected addreſs; but her ſurprize <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I am indeed her child," replied Amanda: "Tell me then by what means you have been brought hither; you called yourſelf a ſtranger, and a dependant in the houſe of your anceſtors."</p>
                     <p>"I am both," ſaid Amanda; "my real name is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from circumſtances peculiarly diſtreſſing, and I have been brought to the Abbey as an inſtructreſs to two children related to the perſon who takes care of it."</p>
                     <p>"My prayers at length," exclaimed the ghaſtly fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, raiſing her hollow eyes and emaciated hands, "my prayers have reached the Throne of Mercy, and, as a proof that my repentance is accepted, power is given me to make reparation for the injuries I have committed."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! thou," ſhe cried, turning to Amanda, "whoſe form revives in my remembrance the youth and beauty blaſted by my means, if thy mind as well as face, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles Lady Malvina's thou wilt in pity to my ſufferings, forbear to reproach my crimes. In me," ſhe continued, "you behold the guilty but contrite widow of the Earl of Dunreath."</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſtarted: Oh, gracious Heaven!" ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "can this be poſſible?</p>
                     <p>"Have you not been taught to execrate my name?" aſked the unhappy woman.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! no," replied Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Lady Dunreath, "becauſe your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was an angel; but did ſhe not leave a ſon?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid Amanda."—"And does he live?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! I do not know," replied Amanda, melting into tears; "diſtreſs ſeparated us, and he is not more ignorant of my deſtiny than I am of his."</p>

"It is I," exclaimed Lady Dunreath, "have been the cauſe of this diſtreſs; it is I, ſweet and ſainted Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina, have been the cauſe of calamity to your children; but bleſſed be the wonder-working hand of Providence," ſhe continued, "which has given me an opportunity of making ſome amends for my cruelty and injuſtice: but," ſhe proceeded, "as I know the chance which led you to the Chapel, I dread to detain you longer, leſt it ſhould lead to a diſcovery. Was it known that you ſaw me, all my intentions would be defeated; be ſecret then, I conjure you, more on your account than on my own, and let not Mrs. Bruce have the ſmalleſt intimation of what has paſſed; but return to-morrow night, and you ſhall receive from me a ſacred depoſit, which will, if affluence can do it, render you completely happy. In the mean time do you throw upon paper a brief account of your life, that I may know the incidents which ſo providentially brought you to the Abbey." Amanda promiſed to obey her in every reſpect, and the unfortunate woman, unable longer to ſpeak, kiſſed her hand, and retired through the little arched door. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda left the Chapel, and full of wonder, pity and expectation, moved mechanically to the parlour. Mrs. Bruce and Mrs. Duncan had juſt riſen from cards, and both were inſtantly ſtruck with her pallid and diſordered looks. They inquired if ſhe was ill: their inquiries rouſed her from a deep reverie. She recollected the danger of exciting ſuſpicions, and replied, "ſhe was only fatigued with walking, and begged leave to retire to her chamber." Mrs. Duncan attended her to it, and would have ſat with her till ſhe ſaw her in bed, had A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda allowed; but it was not her intention indeed to go to bed, for ſome time; when left to herſelf, the ſurpriſing and intereſting diſcovery ſhe had made had ſo agitated her, that ſhe could ſcarcely compoſe herſelf enough to take up a pen to narrate the particulars of her life, as Lady Dunreath had requeſted. She ſketched them in a brief yet haſty manner, ſufficiently ſtrong, however, to intereſt the feelings of a ſympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic heart: the tender and peculiar ſorrows of her own
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:038416_0552_1011E6321561B1A0"/>
ſhe omitted; her life was repreſented ſufficiently calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, without mentioning the incurable ſorrow which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed love had entailed upon it. She was glad ſhe had executed her taſk with haſte, as Mrs. Duncan cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon her in the courſe of the next day to aſſiſt in packing for their removal to the neighbouring town. The evening was far advanced ere ſhe had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of repairing to the Chapel, where ſhe found the unfortunate Lady Dunreath reſting, in an attitude of deep deſpondence, againſt rails of the altar.</p>
                     <p>Her pale and woe-worn countenance—her emaciated form—her ſolitary ſituation—all inſpired Amanda with the tendereſt compaſſion, and ſhe dropped a tear upon the cold and withered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>and which was extended to her's as ſhe approached. "I merit not the tear of pity," ſaid the unhappy woman, "yet it caſts a gleam of comfort on my heart to meet with a being who feels for its ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, but the moments are precious."

                        </gap>h which ſhe opened it, and took from thence a ſealed paper. "Receive ſaid ſhe, preſenting it to Amanda, "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the will of your grandfather, a ſacred depoſit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to your care for your brother, the rightful heir of the Earl of Dunreath. Oh! may its reſtoration, and my ſincere repentance, atone for its long detention and concealment: Oh! may the fortune it will beſtow upon you as well as your brother, be productive to both of the pureſt happineſs!"</p>
                     <p>Trembling with joyful ſurpriſe, Amanda received the paper: "Gracious Heaven!" exclaimed ſhe, "is it poſſible? do I really hold the will of my grandfather—a will which will entitle my brother to affluence.—Oh! Providence, how myſterious are thy ways! Oh! Oſcar, beloved of my heart," ſhe continued, forgetting at that moment every conſideration of ſelf, "could thy ſiſter have poſſibly foreſeen her ſorrows would have
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:038416_0553_1011E635022BE880"/>
led to ſuch a diſcovery, half their bitterneſs would have been allayed. Yes, my father, one of thy children may at leaſt be happy, and in witneſſing that happineſs, the other will find a mitigation of miſery." Tears burſt from her as ſhe ſpoke, and relieved the ſtrong emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſwelled her heart, almoſt to burſting.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! talk not of your miſery," ſaid Lady Dunreath, with a convulſive ſigh, "leſt you drive me to deſpair. Forever muſt I accuſe myſelf of being the real ſource of calamity to Lady Malvina and her children."</p>
                     <p>"Excuſe me," cried Amanda, wiping her eyes, "I ſhould be ungrateful to Heaven and to you if I dwelt upon my ſorrows; but let me not neglect this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity," ſhe continued, "of enquiring if there is any way in which I can poſſibly ſerve you. Is there no friend to whom I could apply in your name, to have you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from this cruel and unjuſtifiable confinement?"</p>
                     <p>"No," ſaid Lady Dunreath, "no ſuch friend exiſts; when I had the power to do ſo, I never conciliated friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and if I am ſtill remembered in the world, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with contempt and abhorrence. The laws of my country would certainly liberate me at once; but if things turn out as I expect, there will be no occaſion for an application to them, and any ſtep of that kind at preſent might be attended with the moſt unpleaſant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; your future proſperity, my preſent ſafety, all depend on ſecrecy for a ſhort period. In this paper," drawing one from her pocket, and preſenting it to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, "I have explained my reaſon for deſiring ſuch ſecrecy." Amanda put it with the will into her boſom, and gave in return the little narrative ſhe had ſketched. They both aſſiſted in replacing the box and flag, and then ſeated themſelves on the ſteps of the altar. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda informed Lady Dunreath of her intended depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the next day from the Abbey, and the occaſion of it. Lady Dunreath expreſſed the utmoſt impatience to have every thing put into a proper train for the avowal of the will, declaring that the ſight of the rightful heir in poſſeſſion of the Abbey, would calm the agitations of a ſpirit which, ſhe believed, would ſoon forſake its
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:038416_0554_1011E636909E9BB0"/>
earthly habitation. Tears of compaſſion fell from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda at theſe words, and ſhe ſhuddered to think that the unfortunate woman might die abandoned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of comfort; again ſhe urged her to think of ſome expedient for procuring immediate liberty, and again Lady Dunreath aſſured her it was impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>Abſorbed in a kind of ſympathetic melancholy, they forgot the danger of delay till the Abbey clock chiming half an hour paſt ten, which was later than Mrs. Bruce's uſual hour of ſupper, ſtartled and alarmed them both. "Go, go," cried Lady Dunreath, with wild expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fear, "go, or we are undone!" Amanda preſſed her hand in ſilence, and trembling departed from the Chapel. She ſtopped at the outſide to liſten, for by her ear alone could ſhe now receive any intimation of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as the night was too dark to permit any object to be diſcerned; but the breeze ſighing amongſt the trees of the valley, and the melancholy murmur of waterfalls were the only ſounds ſhe heard. She groped along the wall of the Chapel to keep in the path, which wound from it to to entrance of the Abbey, and in doing ſo paſſed her hand over the cold face of a human being; terrified, an involuntary ſcream burſt from her, and ſhe faintly articulated: "Defend me, Heaven! In the next moment ſhe was ſeized round the waiſt, and her fenſes were receding, when Mrs. Duncan's voice recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them. She apologized to Amanda for giving her ſuch a fright; but ſaid, that her uneaſineſs was ſo great at her long abſence that, attended by a ſervant, ſhe had come in queſt of her."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Duncan's voice relieved Amanda from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of thinking ſhe had met with a perſon who would inſult her; but it had given riſe to a new alarm. She feared ſhe had been traced to the Chapel, that her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with Lady Dunreath had been overheard, and of courſe the ſecret of the will diſcovered, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Mrs. Duncan, amiable as ſhe was, might ſacrifice friendſhip to intereſt and conſanguinity. This idea overwhelmed her with anguiſh; her deep and heavy ſighs, her violent trembling, alarmed Mrs. Duncan, who haſtily called the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:038416_0555_1011E63ADCB95520"/>
ſervant to aſſiſt her in ſupporting Amanda home; drops were then adminiſtered, but they would have wanted their uſual efficacy with the poor night wanderer, had ſhe not ſoon been convinced by Mrs. Duncan's manner ſhe had not made the dreaded diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>Amanda would have retired to her chamber before ſupper, but that ſhe feared diſtreſſing Mrs. Duncan by doing ſo, who would have imputed her indiſpoſition to her fright.—She accordingly remained in the parlour, but with a mind ſo occupied by the intereſting events of the evening, that ſhe ſoon forgot the purpoſe for which ſhe ſat down to table, and neither heeded what was doing or ſaying. From this reverie ſhe was ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rouſed by the ſound of a name for ever dear and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which in a moment had power to recall her wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ideas. She raiſed her eyes, and with a ſad intent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fixed them on Mrs. Bruce, who continued to talk of the approaching nuptials of Lord Mortimer. Tears now fell from Amanda in ſpite of her efforts to reſtrain them, and while drooping her head to wipe them away, ſhe caught the eyes of Mrs. Duncan faſtened on her with an expreſſion of mingled pity and curioſity. A deep crimſon ſuffuſed the face of Amanda at the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of having betrayed the ſecret of her heart; but her confuſion was inferior to her grief, and the rich ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of one ſoon gave place to the deadly hue of the other. "Ah!" thought ſhe, "what is now the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of wealth when happineſs is beyond my reach!" Yet ſcarcely had ſhe conceived the thought ere ſhe wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it buried in oblivion; "Is the comfort of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the power of diſpenſing happineſs to others, nothing?" ſhe aſked herſelf. "Do they not merit gratitude of the moſt pure thankfulneſs, of the moſt fervent nature, to providence? They do," ſhe cried, and paid them at the moment in the ſilent tribute of her heart.</p>
                     <p>It was late ere the ladies ſeparated for the night, and as ſoon as Amanda had ſecured the door of her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe drew from her boſom the papers ſo carefully depoſited in them, and ſat down to peruſe the narrative of Lady Dunreath.</p>

Convinced, as I have already ſaid, that if your mind as well as form reſembles your mother's, you will, while you condemn the ſinner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate the penitent, and touched by that penitence, offer up a prayer to heaven (and the prayers of innocence are ever availing) for its forgiveneſs unto me. Many years are now elapſed ſince the commencement of my confinement, years which diminiſhed my hope of being able to make reparation for the injuſtice and cruelty I had done Lady Malvina Fitzalan, but left unabated my deſire of doing ſo.</p>

who covers herſelf with ſhame to atone for her injuries to thee.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt reſtrain theſe effuſions of my heart, leſt I encroach too much upon the limited time allotted to make what I may call my confeſſion, and inform you of particulars neceſſary to be known.</p>
                     <p>My cruelty and inſolence to Lady Malvina you no doubt already know, in my conduct to her. I forgot the obligations her mother had conferred upon me, whoſe patronage and kind protection laid the foundation of my proſperity. I rejoiced at her marriage with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fitzalan, as a ſtep that would deprive her of her father's favour, and place her in that ſtate of poverty which would conceal charms I deteſted for being ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to my daughter's.—The Earl's reſentment was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at firſt; but with equal ſurpriſe and concern I ſoon perceived it gradually ſubſiding; their revocableneſs of the deed, the knowldge that he wanted no acquiſition of fortune; above all, Fitzalan's noble deſcent, and the graces and virtues he poſſeſſed, worthy of the higheſt ſtation, dwelt upon the Earl's imagination, and pleaded ſtrongly in extenuation of his daughter; alarmed leſt my ſchemes againſt her ſhould be rendered abortive, like an evil ſpirit I contrived to rekindle, by means of my agents, the Earl's reſentment, they preſented the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, the daring contempt Lady Malvina had ſhewn to paternal authority, and that too eaſy a forgiveneſs to it might influence her ſiſter to ſimilar conduct with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon perhaps leſs worthy, and more needy, if poſſible, than Fitzalan. This laſt ſuggeſtion had the deſired effect, and Lady Malvina be declared in future ſhould be conſidered as alien to his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ly.</p>
                     <p>I now hoped my ambitious views, relative to my daughter, would be accompliſhed; I had long wiſhed her united to the Marquis of Roſline; but he had for years been Lady Malvina's admirer, and was ſo much attached to her, that on her marriage he went abroad. My arts were then tried to prevail on the Earl to make a will in Lady Auguſta's favour; but this was a point
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:038416_0558_1011E6435E9A1370"/>
I could not accompliſh, and I lived in continual appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, leſt his dying inteſtate ſhould give Lady Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina the fortune I wanted to deprive her of. Anxious, however, to procure a ſplendid eſtabliſhment for my daughter, I every where ſaid there was no doubt but ſhe would be ſole heireſs to the Earl. At the expiration of three years the Marquis returned to his native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; his unfortunate paſſion was ſubdued, he heard and believed the reports I circulated, and ſtimulated by avarice, his leading propenſity, offered his hand to my daughter, and was accepted. The Earl gave her a large portion in ready money; but, notwithſtanding all my endeavours, would not make a ſettlement of any of his eſtates upon her: I however ſtill hoped, and the Marquis from what I ſaid, believed that ſhe would poſſeſs all his fortune.—My daughter's nuptials added to my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral haughtineſs; they alſo increaſed my love of pleaſure by affording me more amply the means of gratifying it at the ſumptuous entertainments at the Marquis's Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; engaged continually in them, the Earl, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities confined him to the Abbey, was left to ſolitude, and the care of his domeſtics. My neglect, you will ſay, was impolitic, whilſt I had any point to carry with him; but Providence has ſo wiſely ordained it that vice ſhould ſtill defeat itſelf. Had I always acted in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the tenderneſs I once ſhewed the Earl, I have little doubt but what at laſt I ſhould have prevailed on him to act as I pleaſed; but infatuated by pleaſure, my prudence, no, it deſerves not ſuch an appellations, forſook me: though the Earl's body was a prey to the infirmities of age, his mind knew none of its imbecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and he ſenſibly felt, and ſecretly reſented my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect; the more he reflected on it, the more he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted it with the attention he was accuſtomed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from his baniſhed Malvina, and the reſentment I had hitherto kept alive in his mind againſt her gradually ſubſided, ſo that he was well prepared to give a favorable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The tears, which the agitated parent ſhed upon the infants lovely cheek ſeemed to expreſs affection for its mother, and regrets for its rigour to her; yet amidſt theſe tears I thought I perceived an exulting joy as he gazed upon the child, which ſeemed to ſay, "Thou wilt yet be the pride, the prop, the ornament of my ancient houſe." After circumſtances proved I was right in my interpretation of his looks: I drove the little Oſcar from the room with frantic rage. The Earl was extremely affected. He knew the violence of my temper, and felt too weak to enter into any altercation with me; he therefore reſerved his little remaining ſtrength and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to arrange his affairs, and by paſſiveneſs ſeemed yielding to my ſway; but I ſoon found though ſilent, he was reſolute. My preventing your brother from again gaining acceſs to his grandfather, and my repulſing your mother when ſhe requeſted an interview with the Earl, I ſuppoſe you already know. Gracious Heaven! my heart ſickens, even at this remote period, when I reflect on the night I turned her from her paternal home, from that manſion, under whoſe roof her benevolent mother had ſheltered my tender years from the rude ſtorms of adverſe life. Oh! black and baſe ingratitude, dire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for the benefits I had received, yet almoſt at the very inſtant I committed ſo cruel an action, ſhe was avenged. No language can deſcribe my horrors as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience repreſented to me the barbarity of my conduct. I trembled with involuntary fears; ſounds had power to terrify; every blaſt which ſhook the Abbey (and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was the tempeſts of that night) made me ſhrink, as if about to meet with an inſtantaneous puniſhment.</p>

                        <l>I trembled at my undivulged crimes</l>

                     </lg>
                     <p>I knew the Earl expected either to ſee or hear from your mother; he was ignorant of the reception ſhe had met from me, and I was determined, if poſſible, he ſhould continue ſo. As ſoon as certified of Lady Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina's departure from the neighbourhood of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, I contrived a letter, in Captain Fitzalan's name,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:038416_0560_1011E649B80C6B50"/>
to the Earl, filled with the moſt cutting and inſolent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to him for his conduct to his daughter, and imputing her precipitate departure from Scotland to it. Theſe unjuſt reproaches I truſted would irritate the Earl and work another revolution in his mind, but I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; he either believed the letter a forgery, or elſe reſolved the children ſhould not ſuffer for the fault of the parent, he accordingly ſent for his agent, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent lawyer in one of the neighbouring towns. This man was lately deceaſed, but his ſon bred to his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, obeyed the ſummons from the Abbey. I dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his coming, but ſcarely had I ſeen him ere this dread was loſt in emotions till then unknown; a ſoft, a tender, an ardent paſſion took poſſeſſion of my heart, on beholding a man, in the very prime of life, adorned with every natural and acquired grace that could pleaſe the eye and ear, married at an early period, poſſeſſed of all the advantages of art, ſaid and believing myſelf to be handſome, I flattered myſelf I might on his heart make an impreſſion equal to that he had done on mine; if ſo I thought how eaſily could the Earl's intentions, in favour of his daughter, be defeated, for that love will readily make ſacrifices I had often heard. A will was made, but my new ideas and ſchemes diveſted me of uneaſineſs about it. Melroſs continued at the Abbey much longer than he need have done, and when he left it his abſence was of ſhort continuance. The Earl's buſineſs was his pretext for his long and frequent viſits; but the real motive of them he ſoon diſcovered to me, encouraged no doubt by the partiality I betrayed. I ſhall not dwell on this part of my ſtory, but I completed my crime by violating my conjugial fidelity, and we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to be united whenever I was at liberty, which from the infirm ſtate of the Earl, I now believed would ſhortly be the caſe. In conſequence of this Melroſs agreed to put into my hands the Earl's will, which had been entruſted to his care, and he acknowledged drawn up entirely in favour of Lady Malvina Fitzalan and her offspring: It was witneſſed by friends of his, whom he had no doubt of bribing to ſilence. You may wonder
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:038416_0561_1011E64B4983AF28"/>
that the will was not deſtroyed as ſoon as I had it in my poſſeſſion; but to do ſo never was my intention; by keeping it in my hands I truſted I ſhould have a power over my daughter, which duty and affection had never yet given me. Violent and imperious in her diſpoſition, I doubted not but ſhe and the Marquis, who nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled her in theſe particulars, would endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, from pride and ſelfiſhneſs, my union with Melroſs; but to know they were in my power would cruſh all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I ſuppoſed, and obtain their moſt flattering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for him—a notice, from my pride, I found eſſential to my tranquillity. The Earl requeſted Melroſs to enquire about Lady Malvina, which he promiſed to do; but it is almoſt unneceſſary to ſay, never fulfilled ſuch a promiſe. In about a year after the commencement of my attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Melroſs he expired, and the Marchioneſs inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited his poſſeſſions by means of a forged will executed by Melroſs. Ignorant indeed at the time that it was by iniquity ſhe obtained them, though her conduct ſince that period has proved ſhe would not have ſuffered any compunction from ſuch a knowledge. I removed from the Abbey to an eſtate about fifteen miles from it, which the Earl had left me, and here, much ſooner than decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would have warranted, avowed my intention of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Melroſs to the Marquis and Marchioneſs of Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line. The conſequences of this avowal were pretty much what I had expected. The Marquis, more by looks than words, expreſſed his contempt; but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs openly declared her indignation; to think of uniting myſelf to a being ſo low in life and fortune, ſhe ſaid, as Melroſs, was an inſult to the memory of her father, and a degradation to his illuſtrious houſe; it would alſo be a confirmation of the ſcandalous reports which had already been circulated to the prejudice of my character about him. Her words rouſed all the violence of my ſoul: I upbraided her with ingratitude to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, who had ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pped beyond the bounds of rigid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety to give her an increaſe of fortune. My words alarmed her and the Marquis. They haſtily demanded
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:038416_0562_1011E64CD7D4E420"/>
an explanation of them. I did not, heſitate in giving one, proteſting at the ſame time that I would no longer hurt my feelings on their account, as I found no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to my wiſhes, but immediately avow Lady Malvina Fitzalan the lawful heireſs of the Earl of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reath. The Marquis and Marchioneſs changed colour; I ſaw they trembled leſt I ſhould put my threats into execution, though with conſummate art they pretended to diſbelieve that ſuch a will as I mentioned exiſted.</p>
                     <p>"Beware," cried I, riſing from my chair to quit the room, "leſt I give you too convincing a proof of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality; except I meet with the attention and complaiſance I have a right to expect, I ſhall no longer act contrary to the dictates of my conſcience by concealing it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited miſtreſs of my own actions, what but affection for my daughter could make me conſult her upon any of them? Her diſapprobation proceeds alone from ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſince an alliance with Melroſs, from his profeſſion, accompliſhments and birth, would not diſgrace a houſe even more illuſtrious than the one ſhe is deſcended from or connected to." I retired to my chamber, ſecretly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting at the idea of having conquered all oppoſition, for I plainly perceived by the Marquis and Marchioneſs's manner, they were convinced it was in my power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their newly acquired poſſeſſions, which, to ſecure, I doubted not their ſacrificing their pride to my wiſhes: I exulted in the idea of having my nuptials with Melroſs celebrated with that ſplendour I alwas delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and the proſpect of having love and vanity gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, filled me with a kind of intoxicating happineſs. In a few hours after I had retired to my room, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs ſent to requeſt an interview with me, which I readily granted. She entered the apartment with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful air, very unuſual to her, and immediately made an apology for her late conduct. She acknowledged I had reaſon to be offended; but a little reflection had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her of her error, and both ſhe and the Marquis thanked me for conſulting them about the change I was about making in my ſituation, and would pay every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in their power to the man I had honoured with
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:038416_0563_1011E65011D579B8"/>
my choice. That I did not think the Marchioneſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in her profeſſions you may believe, but complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance was all I required. I accompanied her to the Marquis; a general reconciliation enſued, and Melroſs was preſented to them.</p>
                     <p>In about two days after this the Marchioneſs came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my dreſſing room one morning, and told me ſhe had a propoſal to make, which ſhe hoped would be agreeable to me to comply with: It was the Marquis's intention and her's to go immediately to the Continent, and they had been thinking, if Melroſs and I would favour them with our company, that we had better defer our nuptials till we reached Paris, which was the firſt place they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended viſiting, as their ſolemnization in Scotland ſo ſoon after the Earl's deceaſe might diſpleaſe his friends, by whom we were ſurrounded, and on their return, which would be ſoon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would introduce Melroſs to their connexions, as a man every way worthy of their notice.</p>
                     <p>After a little heſitation I agreed to this plan, for where it interfered not with my own inclinations, I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſerve an appearance of propriety to the world, and I could not avoid thinking that my marrying ſo ſoon after the Earl's death would draw cenſure upon me, which I ſhould avoid by the projected tour, as the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time of my nuptials could not then be aſcertained. Melroſs ſubmitted cheerfully to our new arrangements, and it was ſettled, farther to preſerve appearances, that he ſhould go before us to Paris. I ſupplied him with every thing requiſite for making an elegant appearance, and he departed in high ſpirits at the proſpect of his ſplendid eſtabliſhment for life.</p>
                     <p>I counted the moments with impatience for rejoining him, and, as had been ſettled, we commenced our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney a month after his departure. It was now the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of winter, and ere we ſtopped for the night, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, almoſt impenetrable, had veiled the earth, fatigued and almoſt exhauſted by the cold, I followed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis through a long paſſage, lighted by a glimmering lamp, to a parlour which was well lighted, and had a comfortable fire.

it, at finding myſelf in a place I thought familiar to me; my ſurpriſe, however was but for an inſtant, yet I could not help expreſſing it to the Marquis. "Your eyes, Madam," cried he, with a cruel ſolemnity, "have not deceived you, for yea are now in Dunreath Abbey."</p>
                     <p>"Dunreath Abbey!" I repeated: "Gracious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! what can be the meaning of this?"</p>
                     <p>"To hide your folly, your imprudence, your deceit, from the world," he exclaimed; "to prevent your exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the wild projects of a depraved and diſtempered mind, by entering into an union at once contemptible and prepoſterous, and to ſave thoſe, from whom alone you derive your conſequence, by your connexion with them, farther mortification on your account."</p>
                     <p>To deſcribe fully the effect of this ſpeech upon a heart like mine is impoſſible; the fury which pervaded my ſoul would, I believe, have hurried me into a deed of dire revenge, had I had the power of executing it, my quivering lips could not expreſs my ſtrong indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>"And do you then, in a country like this," I cried, "dare to think you can deprive me of my liberty?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied he, with inſulting coolneſs, "when it is known you are incapable of making a proper uſe of that liberty; you ſhould thank me, he continued, "for palliating your late conduct, by imputing it rather to an intellectual derangement than to total depravity; from what other ſource than the former could you have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that there was a will in Lady Malvina Fitzalan's favour?" Theſe words at once developed the cauſe of his unjuſtifiable conduct, and proved that there is no real faith between the guilty. From my diſpoſition the Marquis was convinced that I would aſſume a haughty ſway over him, in conſequence of the ſecret of the will: He alſo dreaded that paſſion or caprice might one day induce me to betray that ſecret, and wreſt from him his unlawful poſſeſſions; thus pride and avarice tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and determined him, by confining me, to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of theſe fears.</p>
                     <p>

"Oh! would to heaven, cried I, replying to the laſt part of his ſpeech, "I had proved my aſſertion; had I done juſtice to others, I ſhould not have been entangled in the ſnare of treachery."</p>
                     <p>"Prove the aſſertion now," ſaid he, "by ſhewing me the will, and you may, perhaps," he continued, in a heſitating accent, "find your doing ſo attended with pleaſing conſequences." Rage and ſcorn flaſhed from my eyes at theſe words. "No," cried I, "had you the power of torturing, you ſhould not tear it from me. I will keep it to atone for my ſins, and expoſe your's to view by reſtoring it to the right owner. I demanded my liberty, I threatened, ſupplicated, but all in vain. The Marquis told me I might as well compoſe myſelf, for my fate was decided."</p>
                     <p>"You know," cri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

I called for my daughter."—"You will ſee her no more," he replied," the paſſions ſhe has ſo long bluſhed to behold ſhe will no more witneſs."</p>
                     <p>"Rather ſay," I exclaimed, "that ſhe dare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her injured parent, but let not the wretch, who has ſevered the ties of nature, hope to eſcape unpuniſhed; no, my ſufferings will draw a dreadful weight upon her head, and may, when leaſt expected, torture her heart with anguiſh." Canvinced that I was entirely in the Marquis's power, convinced that I had nothing to hope from him or my daughter, rage, horror and agony, at their unjuſt and audacious treatment, kindled in my breaſt a ſudden frenzy, which ſtrong convulſions only terminated. When I recovered from them I found myſelf on a bed in a room, which at the firſt glance, I knew to be the one the late Lady Dunreath had occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to whoſe honours I ſo unworthily ſucceeded. Mrs. Bruce, who had been houſekeeper at the Abbey before my marriage, ſat beſide me: I heſitated a few minutes whether I ſhould addreſs her as a ſuppliant or a ſuperior;
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:038416_0566_1011E658E233D048"/>
the latter, however, being moſt agreeable to my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I bid her, with an haughty air, which I hoped would awe her into obedience, aſſiſt me in riſing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome conveyance from the Abbey without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. The Marquis entered the chamber as I ſpoke. "Compoſe yourſelf, madam," ſaid he, "your deſtiny, I repeat it, is irrevocable; this Abbey is your future reſidence, and bleſs thoſe who have afforded your follies ſuch an aſylum; it behoves both the Marchioneſs and me indeed to ſeclude a woman who might caſt imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on our characters, which thoſe unacquainted with them might believe." I ſtarted from the bed, in the looſe dreſs in which they had placed me on it, and ſtamping round the room demanded my liberty.—The Marquis heard my demand with contemptuous ſilence, and quitted the room. I attempted to ruſh after him, but he puſhed me back with violence, and cloſed the door. My feelings again brought on convulſions, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in a delirium and fever. In this ſituation the Marquis and Marchioneſs abandoned me, hoping, no doubt, that my diſorder would ſoon lay me in a priſon, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more ſecure than the one they had devoted me to. Many weeks elapſed ere I ſhewed any ſymptom of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On regaining my ſenſes I ſeemed as if awaking from a tedious ſleep, in which I had been tortured with frightful viſions. The firſt object my eyes beheld, now bleſſed with the powers of clear perception, was Mrs. Bruce bending over my pillow, with a look of anxiety and grief, which implied a wiſh, yet a doubt of my recovery.</p>
                     <p>"Tell me," ſaid I, faintly, "am I really in Dunreath Abbey, am I really confined within its walls by order of my child?</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Bruce ſighed. "Do not diſturb yourſelf with queſtions now," ſaid ſhe; "the reaſon heaven has ſo mercifully reſtored, would be ill employed in vain mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs."</p>
                     <p>"Vain murmurs!" I repeated, and a deep deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſigh burſt from my heart. I lay ſilent a long time after this; the gloom which e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to draw back the curtains of the bed and windows. She obeyed, and the bright beams of the ſun darting into the room, diſplayed to my view an object I could not behold without ſhuddering; this was the portrait of Lady Dunreath exactly oppoſite the bed. My mind was ſoftened by illneſs, and I felt in that moment as if her ſainted ſpirit ſtood before me to awaken my conſcience to remorſe, and my heart to repentance, the benevolence which had irradiated the countenance of the original with a celeſtial expreſſion, was powerfully expreſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the canvas, and recalled, oh! how affectingly to my memory, the period in which this moſt amiable of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men gave me a refuge in her houſe, in her arms, from the ſtorms of life, and yet her child, I groaned her child I was acceſſary in deſtroying: Oh! how excruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating were my feelings at this period of awakened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; I no longer inveighed againſt my ſufferings; I conſidered them in the light of retribution, and felt an awful reſignation take poſſeſſion of my ſoul. Yes, groaned I to myſelf, it is fit that in the very ſpot in which I triumphed in deceit and cruelty, I ſhould meet the puniſhment due to my miſdeeds.</p>
                     <p>The change in my diſpoſition produced a ſimilar one in my temper, ſo that Mrs. Bruce found the taſk of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on me, eaſier than ſhe had imagined it would be; yet I did not ſubmit to my confinement, without many efforts to liberate myſelf through her means; but her fidelity to her unnatural employers was not to be ſhaken: Bluſhing, however, at my paſt enormities, I ſhould rather have ſhrunk from that ſolicited admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion again into the world, had not my ardent deſire of making reparation to the deſcendants of Lady Dunreath influenced me to deſire my freedom. Oh! never did that deſire ceaſe—never did a morning dawn, an eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cloſe, without entreating Heaven to allow me the means of reſtoring to the injured their inheritance. Mrs. Bruce, though ſteady, was not cruel, and nurſed me with the tendereſt attention till my health was re-eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed: She then ceaſed to ſee me except at night; but took care I ſhould be always amply ſtocked with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries.
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:038416_0568_1011E65F3304AF28"/>
She ſupplied me with religious and moral books; alſo materials for writing, if I choſe to amuſe myſelf with making comments on them; To thoſe books I am indebted, for being able to endure, with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of calmneſs my long and dreadful captivity; they enlarged my heart, they enlightened its ideas concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Supreme Being, they impreſſed it with awful ſubmiſſion to his Will, they convinced me more forcibly than my tranſgreſſions, yet with exciting deſpair, for while they ſhewed me the horrors of vice, they proved the efficacy of repentance. Debarred of the common en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of life, air, exerciſe and ſociety, in vain my heart aſſured me my puniſhment was inadequate to my crimes, nature repined and a total languor ſeized me. Mrs. Bruce at laſt told me that I ſhould be allowed the range of that part of the building in which I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined (for I had hitherto been limited to one room) and conſequently air from the windows, if I promiſed to make no attempt for recovering my freedom, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which ſhe aſſured me would prove abortive, as none but people attached to the Marquis lived in or about the Abbey, who would immediately betray me to him, and if he ever detected ſuch a ſtep, it was his determination to hurry me to France.</p>
                     <p>Certain that he would be capable of ſuch baſeneſs, touched by the ſmalleſt indulgence, and eager to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure any recreation, I gave her the moſt ſolemn aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of never attempting to make known my ſituation. She accordingly unlocked the ſeveral doors that had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto impeded my progreſs from one apartment to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and removed the iron bolts which ſecured the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the windows. Oh! with what mingled pain and pleaſure did I contemplate the rich proſpect ſtretched before them, now that I was debarred from enjoying it; at liberty, I wondered how I could ever have contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated it with a careleſs eye, and my ſpirits which the air had revived, ſuddenly ſunk into deſpondence, when I reflected I enjoyed this common bleſſing but by ſtealth; yet who (cried I with agony) can I blame but myſelf? The choiceſt gifts of Heaven were mine, and I loſt them

by my own means; wretch as I was, the firſt temptation that aſſailed, warped me from integrity, and my error is marked by the deprivation of every good; with eager, with enthuſiaſtic delight, I gazed on ſcenes which I had ſo often before regarded with a careleſs eye; it ſeemed as if I had only now perception to diſtinguiſh their beauties; the ſeaſon's difference made a material change to me, as all the windows were ſhut up in winter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe of the apartment I occupied, which only looked into a gloomy court; ah! how welcome to me then was the return of ſpring, which again reſtored to me the indulgence of viſiting the windows; how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to my eyes the green of the valley, and the glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bloom of the mountain ſhrubs juſt burſting into ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; ah! how ſoothing to my ear the lulling ſound of water-falls, and the lively carol of the birds; how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing the ſweetneſs of the air, the fragrance of the plants, which friendly zephyrs, as if pitying my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, wafted through the windows; the twilight hour was alſo hailed by me with delight; it was then I turned my eyes from earth to heaven, and regarding its blue and ſpangled vault but as a thin covering between me and myriads of angels, felt a ſweet ſenſation of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled piety and pleaſure, which for the time had power to ſteep my ſorrows in forgetfulneſs! But in relating my feelings, I wander from the real purpoſe of my narrative, and forget that I am deſcribing thoſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to a perſon who, from my injurious actions, can take but little intereſt in them.</p>

                     <p>THE emotions Amanda experienced from reading this narrative deeply affected but gradually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided from her mind, leaving it only occupied by pity for the penitent Lady Dunreath, and pleaſure at the proſpect of Oſcar's independence, a pleaſure ſo pure, ſo fervent, that it had power to ſteal her from her ſorrows, and when the recollection of them again returned, ſhe endeavoured to baniſh it by thinking of the neceſſity there was for immediately adopting ſome plan for the diſcloſure of the will, Lady Dunreath had adviſed her to put into the hands of a friend of integrity and abilities.</p>
                     <p>"But where," cried the diſconſolate Amanda, "can I find ſuch a friend?" The few, the very few whom ſhe had reaſon to think regarded her, had neither power nor ability to aſſiſt her in what would probably be an ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous demand for reſtitution. After ſitting a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time in deep meditation, the idea of Ruſhbrook
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038416_0575_1011E66CF4329838"/>
ſuddenly occurred, and ſhe ſtarted, as if in joyful ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe at the remembrance, ſhe conſidered that, though almoſt a ſtranger to him, an application of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt rather be regarded as a compliment than a liberty, from the great opinion it would prove ſhe had of his honour by intruſting him with ſuch a ſecret. From his looks and manner ſhe was convinced he would not only deeply feel for the injured, but ably adviſe how thoſe injuries ſhould be redreſſed. From his years and his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation there could be no impropriety in addreſſing him, and ſhe already in imagination beheld him her friend, advocate, and adviſer: He alſo, ſhe truſted, would be able to put her in a way of making enquiries after Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car. Oh! how delightful the proſpect of diſcovering that brother, of diſcovering but to put him in poſſeſſion of even a ſplendid independence. Ah! how ſweet the idea of being again folded to a heart intereſted in her welfare after ſo long a ſolitary mourner treading the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged path of life, and bending as ſhe went beneath its adverſe ſtorm. Ah! how ſweet again to meet an eye that ſhould beam with tenderneſs on her's; an ear, which ſhould liſten with attentive rapture to her accents, and a voice that would ſoothe with ſofteſt ſympathy her ſorrows; it is only thoſe, who like her, have known the ſocial ties of life in all their ſweetneſs, who like her have mourned their loſs with all the bitterneſs of anguiſh, that can poſſibly conceive her feelings as theſe ideas oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to her mind "Oh! Oſcar, oh! my brother," ſhe exclaimed, while tears wet her pale cheeks, "how rapturous the moment which reſtores you to me! How delightful to think our youth will no more experience the chill of poverty, your benevolence no longer ſuffer reſtraints! Now will your virtues ſhine forth with full luſtre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dignifying the houſe from which you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, doing ſervice to your country, and ſpreading diffuſive happineſs around.</p>
                     <p>The morning ſurpriſed Amanda in the midſt of her meditations. She opened the ſhutters, and hailed its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Spontaneous praiſe burſt from the lips of Amanda, and ſhe felt all that calm and ſweet delight which ever pervades a mind of religion and ſenſibility on viewing the rural beauties of nature; She left the charming ſcene to try and get a little reſt, but ſhe thought not of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing; ſhe ſoon ſunk into a gentle ſleep, and awoke with renovated ſpirits near the breakfaſt hour.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Bruce expreſſed the utmoſt regret at the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there was for parting with her gueſts; but added, that ſhe believed, as well as hoped, their abſence from her would be but ſhort, as ſhe was ſure the Marquis's family would leave Scotland almoſt immediately after Lady Euphraſia's nuptials. In vain did Amanda ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for fortitude to ſupport the mention of thoſe nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials; her frame trembled, her heart ſickened, whenever they were talked of; the ſpirits ſhe had endeavoured to collect, from the idea that they would all be requiſite in the important affair ſhe muſt undertake, fleeted away at Mrs. Bruce's words, and a heavy langour took poſſeſſion of her.</p>
                     <p>They did not leave the Abbey till after tea in the evening, and the idea that ſhe might ſoon behold her brother, the acknowledged heir of that Abbey, caſt again a gleam of pleaſure on the ſad heart of Amanda, a gleam I ſay, for it faded before the almoſt inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous recollection, that ere that period Lord Mortimer and Lady Euphraſia would be united; ſunk in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found melancholy, ſhe forgot her ſituation, heeded not the progreſs of the carriage, or remarked any object; a ſudden jolt rouſed her from her reverie, and ſhe bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſhe thought of the ſuſpicions it might give riſe to in the mind of Mrs. Duncan, whoſe intelligent eye, on the preceding night, had more than half confeſſed her knowledge of Amanda's feelings. She now, though
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038416_0577_1011E6732D50C0F8"/>
with ſome embarraſſment, attempted to enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and Mrs. Duncan, who with deep attention had marked her penſive companion, with much cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, rendered the attempt a ſucceſsful one. The chaiſe was now turning from the valley, and Amanda leaned from her window to take another view of Dunreath Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. The ſun was already ſunk below the horiſon, but a tract of glory ſtill remained, that marked the ſpot in which its daily courſe was finiſhed, a dubious luſtre yet played around the ſpires of the Abbey, and while it diſplayed its vaſt magnificence by contraſt added to its gloom, a gloom heightened by the dreary ſolitude of its ſituation, for the valley was entirely overſhadowed by the dark projection of the mountains, on whoſe ſummits a few bright and lingering beams yet remained, that ſhewed the wild ſhrubs waving in the evening breeze, a penſive ſpirit ſeemed now to have taken poſſeſſion of Mrs. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, a ſpirit congenial to the ſcene, and the reſt of the little journey was paſt almoſt in ſilence; their lodgings were at the entrance of the town, and Mrs. Bruce had taken care they ſhould find every requiſite refreſhment within them. The woman of the houſe had already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a comfortable ſupper for them, which was ſerved up ſoon after their arrival. When over, Mrs. Duncan, aſſiſted by Amanda, put the children to bed, as ſhe knew, till accuſtomed to her, they would not like the attendance of the maid of the houſe. Neither ſhe or Amanda felt ſleepy; it was a fine moon-light night, and they were tempted to walk out upon a terrace, to which a glaſs door from the room opened; the terrace overhung a deep valley which ſtretched to the ſea, and the rocky pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory that terminated it was crowned with the ruins of an ancient caſtle, the moon-beams ſeemed to ſleep upon its broken battlements, and the waves that ſtole murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſhore caſt a ſilvery ſpray around it. A penſive pleaſure pervaded the hearts of Mrs. Duncan and Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and, converſing on the charms of the ſcene, they walked up and down, when ſuddenly upon the floating air they diſtinguiſhed the ſound of a diſtant drum beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tattoo: both ſtopped, and leaned upon a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038416_0578_1011E674C36FB708"/>
of a parapet wall, which had once ſtretched along the terrace, and Mrs. Duncan, who knew the ſituation of the country, ſaid, "that the ſounds they heard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a fort near the town." They ceaſed in a ſhort time, but were almoſt immediately ſucceeded by martial m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>c, and Amanda ſoon diſtinguiſhed an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired march of her father's. Ah! how affectingly did it remind her of him. She recalled the moments in which ſhe had played it for him, whiſt he hung over her chair with delight and tenderneſs, ſhe wept at the tender remembrances it excited, wept at liſtening to ſounds which had ſo often given to his pale cheek the fluſh of ardor.</p>
                     <p>They did not return to the houſe till convinced, by a long interval of ſilence, that the muſic had ceaſed for the night.</p>
                     <p>Amanda having formed a plan relative to the will, determined not to delay executing it. She had often mentioned to Mrs. Duncan her uneaſineſs concerning her brother, as an excuſe for the melancholy that lady, in a half ſerious, half jeſting manner, ſo often rallied her about, and ſhe now intended to aſſign her journey to London (which ſhe was reſolved ſhould immediately take place) to her anxious wiſh of diſcovering, or at leaſt inquiring about him; the next morning ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly mentioned her intention. Mrs. Duncan was not only ſurpriſed but concerned, and endeavoured to diſſuade her from it, by repreſenting, in the moſt forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, the dangers ſhe might experience in ſo long a journey without a protector.</p>
                     <p>Amanda aſſured her ſhe was already aware of theſe, but the apprehenſions they excited were leſs painful than the anxiety ſhe ſuffered on her brother's account, and ended by declaring her reſolution unalterable.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Duncan, who in her heart could not blame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda for ſuch a reſolution, now expreſſed her hopes that ſhe would not make a longer ſtay in London than was abſolutely neceſſary, declaring that her ſociety would be a loſs ſhe could ſcarcely ſupport.</p>

                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:038416_0579_1011E677AEEFBB58"/>
Amanda thanked her for her tenderneſs, and ſaid, "ſhe hoped they ſhould yet enjoy many happy days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether." She pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>oſed travelling in a chaiſe to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of England, and then purſuing the remainder of the journey in a ſtage coach, the woman of the houſe was ſent for, and requeſted to engage a carriage for her againſt the morning, which ſhe promiſed to do, and the intervening time was almoſt entirely paſt by Mrs. Duncan in lamenting the approaching loſs of Amanda's ſociety, and in entreaties for her to return as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Till this period ſhe did not know, nor did A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda conceive, the ſtrength of her friendſhip. She preſented her purſe to our heroine, and in the impaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed language of ſincerity, entreated her to conſider it as the purſe of a ſiſter, and take from it whatever was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for her long journey and uncertain ſtay.</p>
                     <p>Amanda, who never wiſhed to lie under obligations when ſhe could poſſibly avoid them, declined the offer; but, with the warmeſt expreſſions of gratitude and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, declaring (what ſhe thought indeed would be the caſe) that ſhe had more than ſufficient for all her purpoſes, all therefore ſhe would accept was what Mrs. Duncan owed her.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Duncan begged her to take a letter from her to a family, near whoſe houſe her firſt day's journey would terminate; they were relations of Mr. Duncan's ſhe ſaid, and had been extremely kind to him and her; ſhe had kept up a correſpondence with them till her removal to Dunreath Abbey, when ſhe dropped it, leſt her reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there ſhould be diſcovered; but ſuch an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of writing to them, by a perſon who would anſwer all their inquiries concerning her, ſhe could not neglect; beſides, ſhe continued, they were the moſt agreeable and hoſpitable people ſhe had ever known, and ſhe was convinced would not ſuffer Amanda to ſleep at an inn, but would probably keep her a few days at their houſe, and then eſcort her part of her way.</p>
                     <p>Averſe to the ſociety of ſtrangers, in her preſent frame of mind, Amanda ſaid ſhe would certainly take the letter, but could not poſſibly preſent it herſelf. She
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038416_0580_1011E67B406925F8"/>
thanked Mrs. Duncan for her ſolicitous care about her; but added, whether ſhe lodged at an inn or private houſe, for one night, was of little conſequence, and as to her journey being retarded, it was what ſhe never could allow.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Duncan declared, "ſhe was too fond of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but did not argue the point with her; ſhe wrote the letter however."</p>
                     <p>They took leave of each other at night, as the chaiſe was ordered at an early hour. As Mrs. Duncan folded Amanda to her heart, ſhe again beſought her to haſten back, declaring, "that neither ſhe or her little girls would be themſelves till ſhe returned."</p>
                     <p>At an early hour Amanda entered the chaiſe, and as ſhe ſtepped into it, could not forbear caſting a ſad and lingering look upon a diſtant proſpect, where the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going evening a duſky grove of firs had pointed out to her, as encompaſſing the Marquis of Roſline's Caſtle. Ah! how did her heart ſicken at the idea of the event which either had or was ſo ſoon to take place in that Caſtle! Ah! how did ſhe tremble at the idea of her long and loneſome journey, and the difficulties ſhe might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter on its termination! How ſad, how ſolitary, did ſhe feel herſelf, her mournful eyes filled with tears as ſhe ſaw the ruſtic families haſtening to their daily labours, for her mind involuntarily drew a compariſon between their ſituation and her own! And, ah! how ſweet would their labour be to her, ſhe thought, if ſhe like them was encompaſſed by the ſocial ties of life, fears before unthought of roſe in her mind, from which her timid nature ſhrunk appalled, ſhould Ruſhbrook be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from London, or ſhould he not anſwer her expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; but "I deſerve diſappointment," cried ſhe, "if I thus anticipate it.

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038416_0581_1011E67EA66A1370"/>
ſomewhat of their heavineſs. On arriving in London ſhe deſigned going to the haberdaſher's, where it may be remembered ſhe had once met Miſs Ruſhbrook; here ſhe hoped to procure lodgings, alſo a direction to Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook. It was about five when they ſtopped for the night, as the ſhortened days of autumn would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a longer journey, had the tired horſes, which was not the caſe, been able to proceed. They ſtopped at the inn, which Mrs. Duncan had taken care to know would be the laſt ſtage of the firſt day's journey, a ſmall but neat and comfortable houſe, romantically ſituated at the foot of a ſteep hill, planted with ancient firs, and crowned with the ſtraggling remains of what appeared to have been a religious houſe, from a ſmall croſs which yet ſtood over a broken gateway; a ſtream trickled from the hill, though its murmur through the thick under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood alone denoted its riſing there, and winding round the inn, flowed in meanders through a ſpacious vale, of which the inn was not the lone inhabitant, for cottages appeared on either ſide, and one large manſion ſtood in the centre, whoſe ſuperior ſize, and neat plantations, proclaimed it maſter of the whole. This was really the caſe, for immediately on entering the inn, Amanda had enquired about the Macqueen family, to whom Mrs. Duncan's letter was directed, and learned that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited this houſe, and owned the grounds to a large extent ſurrounding it. Amanda gave Mrs. Duncan's letter to the landlady, and begged ſhe would ſend it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to Mrs. Macqueen. The inn was without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and its quiet retirement, together with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the owners, an elderly pair, ſoothed the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated ſpirits of Amanda. Her little dinner was ſoon ſerved up; but when over, and ſhe was left to herſelf, all the painful ideas ſhe had ſo ſedulouſly, and with ſome degree of ſucceſs, attempted to baniſh from her mind in the morning by attending to the objects ſhe paſſed, now returned with full, or rather aggravated force. Books, thoſe pleaſing and, in affliction, alleviating reſources, ſhe had forgotten to bring along with her, and all that the inn contained ſhe had been ſhewn on a ſhelf in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038416_0582_1011E68032B3A8F8"/>
apartment ſhe occupied, but without finding one that could poſſibly fix her attention, or change its melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ideas; a ramble, though the evening was uninviting, ſhe preferred to the paſſive indulgence of her ſorrow, and having ordered tea againſt her return, and invited the landlady to it, ſhe was conducted to the garden of the inn, from whence ſhe aſcended the hill by a winding path. She made her way with difficulty through a path which, ſeldom trodden was half choaked with weeds and brambles; the wind blew cold and ſharp around her, and the gloom of cloſing day was heightened by thick and louring clouds, that involved the diſtant mountains in one dark ſhade. Near thoſe mountains ſhe knew the domain of Roſline lay, and from the bleak ſummit of the hill, ſhe ſurveyed them as a lone mourner would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the ſad ſpot in which the pleaſure of his heart was buried; forgetting the purpoſe for which ſhe had walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, ſhe leaned in melancholy reverie againſt a frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ruined building, nor heard approaching footſteps, till the voice of her hoſt ſuddenly broke upon her ear. She ſtarted, and perceived him accompanied by two ladies, who he directly informed her were Mrs. and Miſs Macqueen. They both went up to Amanda, and after the uſual compliments of introduction were over, Mrs. Macqueen took her hand, and, with a ſmile of cordial good nature, invited her to her houſe for the night declaring that the pleaſure ſhe received from Mrs. Duncan's letter was heightened by being introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through its means to a perſon that lady mentioned as her particular friend. Miſs Macqueen ſeconded her mother's invitation, and ſaid, "the moment they had read the letter they had come out for the purpoſe of bringing her back with them."</p>
                     <p>"Aye, aye" ſaid the hoſt good humouredly, (who was himſelf deſcended from one of the inferior branches of the Macqueen's) "this is the way, ladies, you always rob me of my gueſts. In good faith I think I muſt ſoon me of my gueſts. In good faith I think I muſt ſoon change my dwelling, and go higher up the valley."</p>
                     <p>Conſcious, from her utter dejection, that ſhe would be unable, as ſhe wiſhed to participate in the pleaſures
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038416_0583_1011E6832B3BA080"/>
of converſation, Amanda declined the invitation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging as an excuſe for doing ſo, her intention of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on her journey the next morning by dawn of day.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Macqueen declared, that ſhe ſhould act as ſhe pleaſed in that reſpect, and both ſhe and her daughter renewed their entreaties for her company with ſuch ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, that Amanda could no longer refuſe them, and they returned to the inn, where Amanda begged they would excuſe her abſence a few minutes, and retired to pay her entertainers, and repeat her charges to the poſtilion to be at the houſe as ſoon as he ſhould think any of the family ſtirring. She then returned to the ladies, and attended them to their manſion, which might well be termed the ſeat of hoſpitality. The family conſiſted of Mr. and Mrs. Macqueen, four ſons and ſix daughters, all now paſt childhood, and united to one another by the ſtricteſt ties of duty and affection. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſiding a few years at Edenburgh for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the young people, Mr. and Mrs. Macqueen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their manſion in the valley, where a large fortune was ſpent in the enjoyment of agreeable ſociety and acts of benevolence. Mrs. Macqueen informed Amanda during the walk that all her family were now aſſembled together, as her ſons, who were already enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in different profeſſions and in buſineſs in various parts of the kingdom, made it a conſtant rule to pay a viſit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very autumn to their friends. It was quite dark before the ladies reached the houſe, and the wind was ſharp and cold, ſo that Amanda found the light and warmth of the drawing room, to which ſhe was conducted extremely agreeable. The thick window curtains and carpeting, and the enlivening fire, bid defiance to the ſharpneſs of the mountain blaſt which howled without, and rendered the comforts within more delectable by the effect of contraſt. In the drawing room were Mr. Macqueen, two of his daughters, and half a dozen ladies and gentlemen, to whom Amanda was preſented, and they in return to her. In the countenance of Mr. Macqueen, Amanda perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a benevolence equal to that which irradiated his wife's. Both were paſt the prime of life, but in him only was its
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038416_0584_1011E684D6644CC0"/>
decline viſible. He was lately grown ſo infirm as to be unable to remove without aſſiſtance, yet was his reliſh for ſociety undiminiſhed, and in his arm chair, his legs muffled in flannel, and ſupported by pillows, he promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as much as ever the mirth of his family, and ſaw with delight the dance go on in which he had once mixed with his children. Mrs. Macqueen appeared but as the elder ſiſter of her daughters, and between them all Amanda perceived a ſtrong family likeneſs; they were tall, well, but not delicately made; handſome yet more indebted to the animation of their countenances than to regularity of features for beauty, which was rendered luxuriant by a quantity of rich auburn-hair, that unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by ſuperfluous ornaments, fell in long ringlets on their ſhoulders, and curled with a ſweet ſimplicity on their white poliſhed foreheads.</p>
                     <p>"So the boys and girls are not yet returned," ſaid Mrs. Macqueen addreſſing one of her daughters; "I am afraid they have taken their friends too far." She had ſcarcely ſpoken when a party was heard under the windows laughing and talking, who aſcended the ſtairs immediately in a kind of gay tumult. The drawing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room door opened, and a lady entered (of a moſt prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing appearance, though advanced in life) and was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a number of young people.</p>
                     <p>But, oh! what were the powerful emotions of Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das ſoul, when amongſt them ſhe beheld lady Aramin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Dormer and Lord Mortimer!—Shocked, confuſed, confounded, ſhe ſtrained an eye of agony upon them, as if with the hope of detecting an illuſion, then dropped her head, anxious to conceal herſelf, though ſhe was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally convinced ſhe could be but a few minutes, unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by them. Never, amidſt the many trying mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her life, had ſhe experienced one more dreadful, to behold Lord Mortimer, when ſhe knew his eſteem for her was loſt, at a period too when he was haſtening to be united to another woman, oh! it was agony, torture in the extreme! vainly did ſhe reflect ſhe deſerved not to loſe his eſteem. This conſciouſneſs could not at preſent

inſpire her with fortitude; her heart throbbed as if it would burſt, her boſom, her frame trembled, and ſhe alternately experienced the glow of confuſion and the chill of diſmay—diſmay at the idea of meeting the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but expreſſive reproach of Lord Mortimer's eye for her imaginary errors—diſmay, at the idea of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contempt of his aunt (who was the Lady that firſt entered the room) and ſiſter.</p>

                     <p>BITTERLY did Amanda regret having been tempted from the inn, and gratefully would ſhe have acquitted fortune of half its malignancy to her, had ſhe been able to ſteal back unnoticed, the party that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered engaged in talking to thoſe they found in the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room (laughing and deſcribing their ramble, which Lady Araminta ſaid was in the ſtyle of Will-o'-the wiſp over breaks and through briars) were ſome time before they obſerved Amanda; but ſoon, ah! how much too ſoon, did ſhe perceive Mrs. Macqueen approaching to introduce thoſe of her family, who were juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
                     <p>"The trying moment is come," cried Amanda, "oh! let me not by my confuſion look as if I really was the guilty thing I am ſuppoſed to be." She endeavoured to collect herſelf, and roſe to meet the young Macqueens,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038416_0586_1011E68ADDC37608"/>
by a timid glance perceiving that they yet hid her from the eyes ſhe moſt dreaded to encounter: ſhe was unable however to return their compliments, except by a ſaint ſmile, and was again ſinking upon her ſeat, for her frame trembled univerſally, when Mrs. Macqueen tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hand led her forward, and preſented her to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Martha and Lady Araminta Dormer. It may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered that Lady Martha had never before ſeen A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, ſhe therefore gave her, as Miſs Donald, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignant ſmile, which had ſhe ſuppoſed her Miſs Fitza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, would have been loſt in a contemptuous frown; ſeldom, indeed, had ſhe ſeen a form more intereſting than our heroine's; her mourning habit ſet off the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of her form, and the languid delicacy of her complexion, whilſt the ſad expreſſion of her countenance denoted that habit but the ſhadow of the unſeen grief which dwelt within her ſoul; her large blue eyes were half concealed by their long laſhes, but the beams that ſtole from beneath thoſe fringed curtains were full of ſweetneſs and ſenſibility; her fine hair, diſcompoſed by the jolting of the carriage and the blowing of the wind, had partly eſcaped the braid on which it was turned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her hat, and hung in long ringlets of gloſſy brown upon her ſhoulders, and careleſs curls about her face, giving a ſweet ſimplicity to it, which heightened its beauty. How different was the look ſhe received from Lady Araminta to that ſhe had received from Lady Martha! in the expreſſive countenance of the former ſhe read ſurpriſe, contempt and anger; her cheeks were fluſhed with unuſual colour, her eyes ſparkled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common luſtre, and their quick glances pierced the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating heart of Amanda, who heard her repeat, as if involuntary, the name of Donald. Ah! how dreadful was the ſound to her ear!—Ah! how ſad a confirmation did it convey that every ſuſpicion to her prejudice would now be ſtrengthened!—Ah! why—why," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "was I tempted to take this hated name? Why did I not prefer incurring any danger to which my own might have expoſed me, rather than aſſume any thing like deceit?" happily the party were too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038416_0587_1011E68D4A386CB0"/>
by one another to heed the words or manner of Lady Araminta.</p>
                     <p>Amanda withdrew her hand from Mrs. Macqueen, and moved tremblingly to her ſeat; but that Lady, with a politeneſs poor Amanda had reaſon to think officious, ſtopped her.—"Miſs Donald—Lord Mortimer!" ſaid ſhe. Amanda raiſed her head, but not her eyes, and neither ſaw or heard his Lordſhip. The ſcene ſhe had dreaded was over, and ſhe felt a little relieved at the idea. The haughty glance of Lady Araminta dwelt upon her mind, and when her agitation had a little ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, ſhe ſtole a look at her, and ſaw Mrs. Macqueen ſitting between her and Lady Martha, and from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered countenance of the latter, ſhe inſtantly conjectur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe had been informed by her niece of her real name. She alſo conjectured, from the glances directed towards her, that ſhe was the ſubject of converſation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it was begun for the purpoſe of diſcovering whether Mrs. Macqueen knew any thing of her real hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>From theſe glances ſhe quickly withdrew her own, and one of the young Macqueens drawing a chair near her's, began a converſation with all that ſpirit and viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which diſtinguiſhed his family. The mind of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda was too much occupied by its own concerns to be able to attend to any thing foreign to them; ſhe ſcarcely knew what he ſaid, and when ſhe did reply, it was only by monoſyllables. At laſt a queſtion, enforced with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar earneſtneſs, rouſed her from this inattention, and bluſhing for it, ſhe looked at the young man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him regarding her with ſomething like wonder, ſhe now, for the firſt time, conſidered the ſtrange ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſhe muſt make amongſt the company, if ſhe did not collect and compoſe her ſpirits. The family too, to whom ſhe was (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:038416_0588_1011E690ECAEF318"/>
Young Macqueen, with a friendly warmth, ſaid he would acquaint his mother, or one of his ſiſters, with her indiſpoſition, and procure ſome remedy for it; but ſhe inſiſted he ſhould on no account diſturb the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, aſſuring him ſhe would ſoon be well: She then endeavoured to ſupport a converſation with him; but ah! how often did ſhe pauſe in the midſt of what ſhe was ſaying, as the ſweet inſinuating voice of Mortimer reached her ear, who, with his native elegance and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, was participating in the lively converſation then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward. In her's, with young Macqueen, ſhe was ſoon interrupted by his father, who, in a good humoured manner, told his ſon he would no longer ſuffer him to engroſs Miſs Donald to himſelf, and deſired him to lead her to a chair near his.</p>
                     <p>Young Macqueen immediately aroſe, and taking Amanda's hand led her to his father, by whom he ſeated her, and by whom, on the other ſide ſat Lady Martha Dormer; then, with a modeſt gallantry, declared it was the firſt time he ever felt reluctance to obey his father's commands, and hoped his ready acquieſcence to them would be rewarded with ſpeedy permiſſion to reſume his converſation with Miſs Donald. Amanda had hitherto prevented her eyes from wandering, though they could not exclude the form of Lord Mortimer; ſhe had not yet ſeen his face, and ſtill ſtrove to avoid doing ſo. Mr. Macqueen began with various inquiries relative to Mrs. Duncan, to which Amanda, as ſhe was prepared for them, anſwered with tolerable compoſure. Suddenly he dropped the ſubject of his relation, and aſked Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da "from what branch of the Donald's ſhe deſcended?" A queſtion ſo unexpected, ſhocked, diſmayed, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed her with confuſion.—She made no reply till the queſtion was repeated, when, in a low and faultering voice, her face covered with bluſhes, and almoſt buried in her boſom ſhe ſaid, ſhe did not know."</p>
                     <p>"Well," cried he again changing his diſcourſe, after looking at her a few minutes, "I did not know any girl but yourſelf would take ſuch pains to hide ſuch a pair of eyes as you have; I ſuppoſe you are conſcious
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038416_0589_1011E69387A01660"/>
of the miſchief they have the power of doing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is from compaſſion to mankind you try to conceal them.</p>
                     <p>Amanda bluſhed yet more deeply than before at find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her down caſt looks were noticed. She turned her's with quickneſs to Mr. Macqueen, who having anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a queſtion of Lady Martha's thus proceeded: "And ſo you do not know from which branch of the Donald's you are deſcended? Perhaps now you only forget, and if I was to mention them one by one your memory might be refreſhed; but firſt let me aſk your father's ſir-name, and what country-woman he married, for the Donalds generally marry amongſt each other?"</p>
                     <p>Oh! how forcibly was Amanda at this moment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced (if indeed her pure ſoul wanted ſuch conviction) of the pain, the ſhame of deception, let the motive be what it may which prompts it. Involuntarily were her eyes turned from Mr. Macqueen as he pauſed for a reply to his laſt queſtion, and at the moment encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe of Lord Mortimer, who ſat directly oppoſite to her, and with deep attention regarded her, as if anxious to hear how ſhe would extricate herſelf from the embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment her aſſumed name had plunged her into.</p>
                     <p>Her confuſion, her bluſhes, her too evident diſtreſs, were all imputed by Mrs. Macqueen to fatigue at liſtening to ſuch tedious enquiries; ſhe knew her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's only foible was an eager deſire to trace every one's pedigree; in order therefore to relieve Amanda from her preſent ſituation, ſhe propoſed a party of whilſt at which Mr. Macqueen often amuſed himſelf, and for which the table and cards were already laid before him. As ſhe took up the cards, to hand them to thoſe who were to draw, ſhe whiſpered Amanda to go over to the tea-table.</p>
                     <p>Amanda required no repetition now, and thanking Mrs. Macqueen in her heart for the relief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe afforded her, went to the table around which almoſt all the young people were crowded; ſo great was the mirth going on amongſt them, that Miſs Macqueen, the graveſt of the ſet, in vain called upon her ſiſters to aſſiſt her in ſerving
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038416_0590_1011E69517691A60"/>
the trays, which the ſervants handed about, and Mrs. Macqueen had more than once called for; Miſs Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen made room for Amanda by herſelf, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda anxious to do any thing which could keep her from encountering the eyes ſhe dreaded, requeſted to be employed in aſſiſting her, and was deputed to fill out the coffee. After the firſt performance of her taſk, Miſs Macqueen, in a whiſpering voice, ſaid to Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, "Do you know we are all here more than half in love with Lord Mortimer; he is certainly very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and his manner is quite as pleaſing as his looks, for he has none of that foppery and conceit which hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome men ſo generally have, and nothing but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his engagement could keep us from pulling caps about him. You have heard to be ſure of Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia Sutherland, the Marquis of Roſline's daughter; well, he is going to be married to her immediately. She and the Marquis and the Marchioneſs were here the other day; ſhe is not to be compared to Lord Mortimer, but ſhe has what will make her be conſidered very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in the eyes of many, namely, a large fortune. They only ſtopped to breakfaſt here, and ever ſince we have been on the watch for the reſt of the party, who arrived this morning and were on Lady Martha's account, whom the journey has fatigued, prevailed to ſtay, till to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. I am very glad you came while they were here: I think both Ladies charming women, and Lady Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minta quite as handſome as her brother: but ſee," ſhe continued touching Amanda's hand, "the conquering hero comes." Lord Mortimer with difficulty made his way round the table, and accepted a ſeat from Miſs Macqueen, which ſhe eagerly offered him, and which ſhe contrived to procure by ſitting cloſer to Amanda. To her next neighbour, a fine lively girl, Amanda now turned, and entered into converſation with her; but from this ſhe was ſoon called by Miſs Macqueen requeſting her to pour out a cup of coffee for Lord Mortimer.</p>
                     <p>Amanda obeyed, and he aroſe to receive it; her hand trembled as ſhe preſented it. She looked not in his face, but ſhe thought his hand was not quite ſteady. She
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038416_0591_1011E696D4495430"/>
ſaw him lay the cup on the table, and bend his eyes to the ground. She heard Miſs Macqueen addreſs him twice ere ſhe received an anſwer, and then it was ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt that it ſeemed the effect of ſudden recollection. Miſs Macqueen grew almoſt as inattentive to the table as her ſiſters, and Mrs. Macqueen was obliged to come over to know what they were all about. At length the buſineſs of the tea-table was declared over, and almoſt at the ſame moment the ſound of a violin was heard from an adjoining room, playing an Engliſh country dance, in which ſtile of dancing the Macqueens had been inſtructed in Edinburgh, and choſe this evening in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to their gueſts. The muſic was a ſignal for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal motion; all in a moment was buſtle and gay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. The young men inſtantly ſelected their part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who ſeemed ready to dance from one room to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The young Macqueen, who had been ſo aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous about Amanda, now came, and taking her hand, as if her dancing was a thing of courſe, was leading her after the reſt of the party, when ſhe drew back, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe could not dance. Surpriſed and diſappointed, he ſtood looking on her in ſilence, as if irreſolute whether he ſhould not attempt to change her reſolution. At laſt he ſpoke, and requeſted ſhe would not mortify him by a refuſal.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Macqueen hearing her ſon's requeſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and joined in it. Amanda pleaded her head ache.</p>
                     <p>"Do, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Macqueen, "try one dance, my girls will tell you dancing is a ſovereign rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy for every thing." It was painful to Amanda to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe; but ſcarcely able to ſtand ſhe was utterly unable to dance; had even her ſtrength permitted her to do ſo, ſhe could not have ſupported the idea of mingling in the ſet with Lord Mortimer, the glance of whoſe eye ſhe never caught without a throb in her heart, which ſhook her whole frame. One of the Miſs Macqueens now ran into the room, exclaiming, "Lord, Collin, what are you about? Lord Mortimer and my ſiſter have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready led off; do pray make haſte and join us," and away ſhe ran again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:038416_0592_1011E699659352E0"/>
"Let me no longer detain you," ſaid Amanda, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing her hand—Young Macqueen finding her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, at length went off to ſeek a partner. He was as fond of dancing as his ſiſters, and feared he ſhould not procure one; but luckily there were fewer gentlemen than Ladies preſent, and a Lady having ſtood up with his youngeſt ſiſter, he eaſily prevailed on her to change her partner.</p>
                     <p>"We will go into the dancing-room, if you pleaſe," ſaid Mrs. Macqueen to Amanda, "that will amuſe without fatiguing you."—Amanda would rather have not gone, but ſhe could not ſay ſo, and they proceeded to it. Lord Mortimer had juſt concluded the dance, and was ſtanding near the door in a penſive attitude, Miſs Macqueen being too much engroſſed by ſomething ſhe was ſaying to the young Lady next to her to mind him. The moment he perceived Amanda enter, he again approached his partner, and began chatting in a lively manner to her.—Amanda and Mrs. Macqueen ſat down together, and in liſtening to the converſation of that Lady, Amanda found herſelf inſenſibly drawn from a too painful attention to ſurrounding objects. On expreſſing the pleaſure which a mind of ſenſibility muſt feel on witneſſing ſuch family happineſs as Mrs. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen poſſeſſed, that lady, ſaid, "ſhe had reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be grateful to heven, and was truly ſo for her domeſtice comforts. You ſee us now (ſhe continued) in our gayeſt ſeaſon becauſe of my ſon's company; but we are ſeldom dull; though ſummer is delightful, we never think the winter tedious; yet though we love amuſement, I aſſure you, we diſlike diſſipation; the mornings are appropriated to buſineſs, and the evenings to recreation; all the work of the family goes through the hands of my daughters, and they wear nothing orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental which they do not make themſelves; aſſiſted by their good neighbours they are enabled to diverſify their amuſements; the dance ſucceeds the concert, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſmall plays, and now and then little dramatic en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments. About two years ago they perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038416_0593_1011D047DAB57E70"/>
the Winter's Tale; their poor father was not then in his preſent ſituation. Mrs. Macqueen ſighed, pauſed a minute and then proceeded; "time muſt take ſomething from us; but I ſhould and do bleſs, with heart-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>elt gratitude, the power which only by its ſtealing hand has made me feel the lot of human nature.—Mr. Macqueen (continued ſhe) at the time I mentioned was full of ſpirits, and performed the part of Antolicus. They made me take the character of the good Paulina; By thus mixing in the amuſements of our children, we have added to their love and reverence, perfect confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and eſteem, and find when our preſence is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the diverſion, let it be what it may, wants ſomething to render it complete. They are now about acting the Gentle Shepherd. Several rehearſals have already taken place in our great barn, which is the Theatre. On theſe occaſions one of my ſons leads the band, another paints the ſcene, and Colin, your rejected partner, acts the part of Prompter." Here this converſation, ſo pleaſing to Amanda, and intereſting to Mrs. Macqueen, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by a meſſage from the drawing room, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the latter the rubber was over, and a new ſet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cut in.</p>
                     <p>I will return as ſoon as poſſible," ſaid Mrs. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen, as ſhe was quitting her ſeat. If Amanda had not dreaded the looks of Lady Martha almoſt as much as thoſe of Lord Mortimer or Lady Araminta, ſhe would have followed her to the drawing-room. As this was the caſe ſhe reſolved on remaining in her preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it was ſome time ere ſhe was obſerved by the young Macqueens. At laſt Miſs Macqueen came over to her: "I declare," ſaid ſhe, "you look ſo ſad and ſolitary, I wiſh you could be prevailed upon to dance; do try this, it is a very fine lively one, and take Flora for your partner, who you ſee has ſat in a corner quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed ſince ſhe loſt her partner, and by the next ſet Colin will be diſengaged."</p>
                     <p>Amanda declared ſhe could not dance, and Miſs Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen being called to her place at the inſtant, ſhe was again left to herſelf: Miſs Macqueen, however, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038416_0594_1011E69F6CFDD668"/>
to come and chat with her, whenever ſhe could do ſo without loſing any part of the dance. At laſt Lord Mortimer followed her. The eyes of Amanda were involuntarily bent to the ground when ſhe ſaw him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: "You are an abſolute runaway," cried he to Miſs Macqueen, "how do you ſuppoſe I will excuſe your frequent deſertions?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, Miſs Donald is ſo loneſome," ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"See," cried he, with quickneſs, "your ſiſter beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you to her; ſuffer me (taking her hand) to lead you to her."</p>
                     <p>Amanda looked up as they moved from her, and ſaw Lord Mortimer's head half turned back; but the inſtant ſhe perceived him he averted it, and took no farther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of her. When the ſet was finiſhed Miſs Macqueen returned to Amanda, and was followed by ſome of her brothers and ſiſters: ſome of the gentlemen alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached Amanda, and requeſted the honour of her hand, but ſhe was ſteady in refuſing all. Rich wines, ſweetmeats, and warm lemonade, were now handed about in profuſion, and the ſtrains of the violin were ſucceeded by thoſe of the bagpipe, played by the family muſician, venerable in his appearance, and habited in the ancient Highland dreſs; with as much ſatisfaction to himſelf as his Scotch auditors, he played a lively Scotch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eel, which in a moment brought two of the Miſs Macqueens and two gentlemen forward, and they continued this dance till politeneſs induced them to ſtop, that one might be begun in which the reſt of the party could join. Dancing continued in this manner with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle intermiſſion, but whenever there was an interval the young Macqueens paid every attention to Amanda, and on her expreſſing her admiration of the Scotch muſic, made it a point that ſhe ſhould mention ſome favourite airs that they might be played for her: but theſe airs, the lively dances, the animated converſation, and the friendly attentions paid her, could not remove her dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with truth they might have ſaid,
<q>
                           <l>That nothing could a charm impart</l>
                           <l>To ſoothe the ſtranger's woe.</l>

The entrance of Mrs. Macqueen was the ſignal for the dance being ended. She made the young people ſit down to refreſh themſelves before ſupper, and apologized to Amanda for not returning to her; but ſaid Lady Martha Dormer had engaged her in a converſation which ſhe could not interrupt. At laſt they were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to ſupper, which, on Mr. Macqueen's account, was laid out in a room on the ſame floor; thither, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceremony, whoever was next the door firſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Mr. Macqueen was already ſeated at the table in his arm chair, and Lady Martha Dormer on his right hand; the eldeſt ſon was deputed to do the honours of the foot of the table; the company was chequered, and Amanda found herſelf ſeated between Lord Mortimer and Mr. Colin Macqueen; and in converſing with the latter Amanda ſought to avoid noticing or being noticed by Lord Mortimer; and his Lordſhip, by the particular attention which he paid Miſs Macqueen, who ſat on his other ſide, appeared actuated by the ſame wiſh. The ſports of the morning had furniſhed the table with a variety of the choiceſt wild fowl, and the plenty and beauty of the confectionary denoted at once the hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit and elegant taſte of the miſtreſs of the feaſt; gaiety preſided at the board, and there was ſcarcely a tongue, except Amanda's which did not utter ſome lively ſally; the piper ſat in the lobby, and if his ſtrains were not melodious, they were at leaſt cheerful. In the courſe of the ſupper Lord Mortimer was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to follow the univerſal example of drinking Amanda's health; obliged to turn her looks to him, oh! how did her heart ſhrink at the glance, the expreſſive glance of his eye, as he pronounced Miſs Donald; unconſcious whether ſhe had noticed in the uſual manner his diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compliment, ſhe abruptly turned to young Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen, and addreſſed ſome ſcarcely articulate queſtion to him. The ſupper things removed, the ſtrains of the piper were ſilenced, and toaſts, ſongs, and ſentiments ſucceeded. Old Mr. Macqueen ſet the example by a favourite Scotch air, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At laſt it came to Lord Mortimer's turn. Amanda ſuddenly ceaſed ſpeaking to young Macqueen. She ſaw the glaſs of Lord Mortimer filled, and in the next moment heard the name of Lady Euphraſia Sutherland. A feeling, like wounded pride, ſtole into the ſoul of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda: ſhe did not decline her head as before, and ſhe felt a faint glow upon her cheek. The eyes of Lady Martha and Lady Araminta ſhe thought directed to her with an expreſſive meaning. "They think," cried ſhe, "to witneſs mortification and diſappointment in my looks, but they ſhall not (if indeed they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of enjoying ſuch a triumph) have it.</p>
                     <p>At length ſhe was called upon for a ſong. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the call; but Mr. Macqueen declared, except aſſured ſhe could not ſing, ſhe ſhould not be excuſed. This aſſurance, without a breach of truth, ſhe could not give; ſhe did not wiſh to appear ungrateful to her kind entertainers, or unſocial, in the midſt of mirth, by refuſing what ſhe was told would be pleaſing to them and their company; She alſo wiſhed, from a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den impulſe of pride, to appear cheerful in thoſe eyes, ſhe knew were attentively obſerving her, and therefore, after a little heſitation, conſented to ſing. The firſt ſong which occurred to her was a little ſimple but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic air, which her father uſed to delight in, and which Lord Mortimer more than once had heard from her; but indeed ſhe could recollect no ſong which at ſome time or other ſhe had not ſung for him. The ſimple air ſhe had choſen ſeemed perfectly adapted to her ſoft voice, whoſe modulations were inexpreſſibly affecting. She had proceeded through half the ſecond verſe when her voice began to faulter; the attention of the company became if poſſible more fixed; but it was a vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, no rich ſtrain of melody repaid it for the voice of the ſongſtreſs had totally ceaſed. Mrs. Macqueen, with the delicacy of a ſuſceptible mind, feared increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her emotion by noticing it, and, with a glance of her expreſſive eye, directed her company to ſilence. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda's eyes were bent to the ground. Suddenly a glaſs
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038416_0597_1011E6A7A8A0B9F0"/>
of water was preſented to her by a trembling hand, by the hand of Mortimer himſelf. She declined it with a motion of her's, and reviving a little raiſed her head. Young Macqueen then gave her an entreating whiſper to finiſh her ſong; ſhe thought it would look like affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to require farther ſolicitation, and, faintly ſmiling again began in ſtrains of liquid melody, ſtrains that ſeemed to breathe the very ſpirit of ſenſibility, and came over each attentive ear,
<q>
                           <l>Like a ſweet ſound</l>
                           <l>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</l>
                           <l>Stealing and giving odour.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The plaudits ſhe received for her ſinging gave to her cheeks ſuch a ſaint tinge of read, as is ſeen in the boſom of the wild roſe. She was now authorized to call for a ſong, and, as if doomed to experience cauſe for agitation, Lord Mortimer was the perſon from whom in the rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the table, ſhe was to claim it. Thrice ſhe was requeſted to do this ere ſhe could obey. At laſt ſhe raiſed her eyes to his face, which was now turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, and ſhe ſaw in it a confuſion equal to that ſhe herſelf trembled under. Pale and red by turns he appeared to her to wait in painful agitation for the ſound of her voice; her lips moved, but ſhe could not articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a word. Lord Mortimer bowed, as if he had heard what they would have ſaid, and then turning abruptly to Miſs Macqueen began ſpeaking to her.</p>
                     <p>"Come, come, my Lord," ſaid Mr. Macqueen, "we muſt not be put off in this manner."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer laughed, and attempted to rally the old gentleman; but he ſeemed unequal to the attempt, for with a ſudden ſeriouſneſs he declared his inability of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the preſent demand; all further ſolicitation on the ſubject was immediately dropped. In the round of toaſts they forgot not to call upon Amanda for one, if ſhe had liſtened attentively when Lord Mortimer was about giving one, no leſs attentively then did he now liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to her. She heſitated a moment, and then gave Sir Charles Bingley, After the toaſt had paſſed, Sir Charles
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038416_0598_1011E6AA2274FBE0"/>
Bingley, repeated Miſs Macqueen, leaning forward, and ſpeaking acroſs Lord Mortimer. Oh! I recollect him very well his regiment was quartered ſome years ago at a little fort ſome diſtance from this, and I remember his coming with a ſhooting party to the mountains, and ſleeping one night here; we had a delightful dance that evening, and all thought him a charming young man.</p>
                     <p>"Pray, are you well acquainted with him?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes—No"—replied Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! I believe you are a ſly girl," cried Miſs Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen, laughing. "Pray, my Lord, does not that bluſh declare Miſs Donald guilty?"</p>
                     <p>"We are not always to judge from the countenance," ſaid he, darting a penetrating, yet quickly withdrawn glance at Amanda. "Experience," continued he, "dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves how little dependence is to be placed on it." Amanda turned haſtily away, and pretended, by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to young Macqueen, not to notice a ſpeech ſhe knew directly pointed at her; for often had Lord Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer declared, that "in the lineaments of the human face divine, each paſſion of the ſoul might well be traced."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Macqueen laughed, and ſaid, "ſhe always judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the countenance, and that her likings and diſlik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were always the effect of firſt ſight."</p>
                     <p>The company broke up ſoon after this, and much earlier than the uſual hour, on account of the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: All but thoſe then immediately belonging to the family having departed, ſome maids of the houſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to ſhew the ladies to their reſpective chambers. Lady Martha and Araminta retired firſt: Amanda was following them, when Mrs. Macqueen detained her to try and prevail on her to ſtay two or three days along with them. The Miſs Macqueens joined their mother, but Amanda aſſured them ſhe could not comply with their requeſt, though ſhe felt with gratitude its friendly warmth. Old Mr. Macqueen had his chair turned to the fire, and his ſons and Lord Mortimer was ſurrounding it. "Well, well," ſaid he, calling Amanda to him and taking her hand, "if you will not ſtay with us now, remember on your return we ſhall lay an embargo on you; in the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038416_0599_1011E6ACAF0F5918"/>
mean time I ſhall not loſe the privilege, which my being an old married man gives me." So ſaying, he gently pulled Amanda to him, and kiſſed her cheek. She could only ſmile at this innocent freedom, but ſhe attempted to withdraw her hand to retire. Now," ſaid Mr. Macqueen ſtill detaining it, "are all theſe young men half mad with envy!" The young Macqueens joined in their father's gallantry, and not a tongue was ſilent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Lord Mortimer's his head reſted on his hand, and the cornice of the chimney ſupported his arm; his hair, from which the dancing had almoſt ſhaken all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hung negligently about his face, adding to its pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſudden dejection. One of the young Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queens turning from his brothers, who were yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their mirth with their father, addreſſed ſome queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Lordſhip, but received no anſwer. Again he repeated it. Lord Mortimer then ſuddenly ſtarted, as if from a profound reverie, and apologized for his abſence.</p>
                     <p>"Ay, ay, my Lord," exclaimed old Mr. Macqueen, jocoſely, "we may all gueſs where your Lordſhip was then travelling in idea—a little beyond the mountains I fancy; ay, we all know where your heart and your treaſure now lie."</p>
                     <p>"Do you?" ſaid Lord Mortimer, with a tone of deep dejection, and a heavy ſigh, with an air alſo which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to declare him ſcarcely conſcious of what he ſaid: He recollected himſelf, however, at the inſtant, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan rallying himſelf as the ſureſt means of preventing others doing ſo. The ſcene was too painful to Amanda; ſhe haſtily withdrew her hand, and faintly wiſhing the party a good night, went out to the maid, who was waiting for her in the lobby, and was conducted to her room. She diſmiſſed the ſervant at the door, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf into a chair, availed herſelf of ſolitude to give vent to the tears, whoſe painful ſuppreſſion had ſo long tortured her heart. She had not ſat long in this ſituation, when ſhe heard a gentle tap at the door She ſtarted, and believing it to be one of the Miſs Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queens, haſtily wiped away the tears, and opened the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038416_0600_1011E6B0987AE438"/>
door. A female ſtranger appeared at it, who curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying reſpectfully, ſaid, "Lady Martha Dormer, her Lady, deſired to ſee Miſs Donald for a few minutes, if not inconvenient to her."</p>
                     <p>"See me!" repeated Amanda, with the utmoſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, "can it be poſſible!" She ſuddenly checked herſelf, and ſaid, "ſhe would attend her Ladyſhip im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately." She accordingly followed the maid, a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſtrange ideas crowding upon her mind. Her conductreſs retired as ſhe ſhut the door of the room into which ſhe ſhewed Amanda; it was a ſmall anti-chamber adjoining the apartment Lady Martha was to lie in. Here with increaſing ſurpriſe ſhe beheld Lord Mortimer, pacing the room in an agitated manner. His back was to the door as ſhe entered, but he turned round with quickneſs, approached, looked on her for a few minutes, then ſtriking his hand ſuddenly againſt his fore-head, turned from her with an air of diſtraction.</p>
                     <p>Lady Martha, who was ſitting at the head of the room, and only bowed as Amanda entered it, motioned for her to take a chair; a motion Amanda gladly obeyed, for her trembling limbs could ſcarcely ſupport her.</p>
                     <p>All was ſilent for a few minutes, Lady Martha then ſpoke in a grave voice:—"I ſhould not Madam, have taken the liberty of ſending for you at this hour, but that I believed ſo favourable an opportunity would not again have occurred of ſpeaking to you, on a ſubject particulary intereſting to me—an opportunity which has ſo unexpectedly ſaved me the trouble of trying to find you out, and the neceſſity of writing to you."</p>
                     <p>Lady Martha pauſed, and her ſilence was not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Amanda.—"Laſt ſummer," continued Lady Martha—again ſhe pauſed—the throbbings of Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's heart became more violent. Laſt ſummer, ſaid ſhe again, "there were ſome little gifts preſented to you by Lord Mortimer; from the events, which followed their acceptance, I muſt preſume they are valueleſs to you; from the events about taking place they are of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038416_0601_1011E6B222FC8EE8"/>
importance elſewhere." She ceaſed, but Amanda could make no reply.</p>
                     <p>"You cannot be ignorant," ſaid Lady Martha, with ſomething of ſeverity in her accent, as if offended by the ſilence of Amanda, "you cannot be ignorant, I ſuppoſe, that it is the picture and ring I allude to; the latter from being a family one of particular value, I always deſtined for the wife of Lord Mortimer, I therefore claim it in my own name. The picture I have his Lordſhip's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and authority to demand, and to convince you I have, indeed if ſuch a conviction be neceſſary, have prevailed on him to be preſent at this converſation."</p>
                     <p>"No, Madam, ſuch a conviction was not neceſſary," cried Amanda—"I ſhould—." She could utter no more at the moment, yet tried to ſuppreſs the agoniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feelings that tumultuouſly heaved her boſom.</p>
                     <p>"If not convenient to reſtore them immediately," ſaid Lady Martha, "I will give you a direction where they may be left in London, to which place Mrs. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen has informed me you are going."</p>
                     <p>"It is perfectly convenient now to reſtore them Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am," replied Amanda, with a voice perfectly recovered, animated with conſcious innocence and offended pride, which alſo gave her ſtrength. "I ſhall return," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe moving to the door, "with them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to your Ladyſhip."</p>
                     <p>The picture was ſuſpended from her neck, and the ring in its caſe lay in her pocket; but, by the manner in which they had been aſked, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ck; yet when in her own room ſhe haſtily untied the picture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rom her neck, pulled the black ribbon from it, and laid it in its caſe; her grief overcame every other feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a ſhower of tears fell from her.—"Oh, Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer! dear Mortimer! "ſhe ſighed, "muſt I part even with this little ſhadow? Muſt I retain no veſtige of happier hours! Yet why, why ſhould I wiſh to retain it, when the original will ſo ſoon be another's. Yes, if
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038416_0602_1011E6B4C8E7F3F8"/>
I behold Mortimer again, it will be as the huſband of Lady Euphraſia."</p>
                     <p>She recollected ſhe was ſtaying beyond the expected time, and wiped away her tears: yet ſtill ſhe lingered a few minutes in her chamber, to try and calm her agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. She called her pride to her aid, it inſpired her with fortitude, and ſhe proceeded to Lady Martha, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that Lady ſhould ſee nothing in her manner, which ſhe could poſſibly conſtrue into weakneſs or meanneſs.</p>
                     <p>Never did ſhe appear more intereſting than at the moment ſhe re-entered the apartment. The paſſion ſhe had called to her aid gave a bright glow to her cheeks, and the traces of the tears ſhe had been ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding appeared upon thoſe glowing cheeks like dew on the ſilken leaves of the roſe ere the ſun-beams of the morning has exhaled it. Thoſe tears left a humid luſtre in her eyes, even more intereſting than their wonted brilliancy—Her hair hung in rich and unreſtrained lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriance, for ſhe had thrown off her hat on firſt going to her chamber, and gave to the beauty of her face, and the elegance of her form, a complete finiſhing.</p>
                     <p>"Here, madam, is the ring," cried ſhe, preſenting it to Lady Martha, "and here is the picture," ſhe would have added, but her voice faltered, and a tear ſtarted from her eye; determined to conceal, if poſſible, her feelings, ſhe haſtily daſhed away the pearly fugitive. Lady Martha was again extending her hand, when Lord Mortimer ſuddenly ſtarted from a couch on which he had thrown himſelf, and ſnatched the picture from the trembling hand that held it, pulled it from its caſe, and flinging it on the floor trampled it beneath his feet:—"Thus periſh," exclaimed he, "every memento of my attachment to Amanda! Oh! wretched, wretched girl!" cried he, ſuddenly graſping her hand, and as ſuddenly relinquiſhing it, "Oh! wretched, wretched girl, you have undone yourſelf and me!" He turned abruptly away, and inſtantly quitted the room. Shocked by his word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and terrified by his manner, Amanda had juſt power to gain a chair. Lady Martha ſeemed alſo thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtruck:
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:038416_0603_1011E6B69A786DA0"/>
but from the muſing attitude in which ſhe ſtood, the deep convulſive ſuffocating ſobs of Amanda ſoon called her. She went to her, and finding her una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to help herſelf, looſened her cravat, bathed her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with lavender, and gave her water to drink. Thoſe attentions, and the tears ſhe ſhed, revived Amanda. She raiſed herſelf in her chair, on which ſhe had fallen back, but was yet too much agitated to ſtand.</p>
                     <p>"Poor unhappy young creature!" ſaid Lady Martha, "I pity you from my ſoul. Ah! if your mind reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled your perſon, what a perfect creature had you been! How happy had then been my poor Mortimer!"</p>
                     <p>Now, now was the teſt, the ſhining teſt of Amanda's virtue, agonized by knowing ſhe had loſt the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe whom ſhe loved with ſuch ardor, eſteemed with ſuch reverence. She knew by a few words ſhe could explain the appearances which had deprived her of his good opinion, and fully regain it, regain, by a few words, the love, the eſteem of her valued, her ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mortimer, the affection, the protection of his amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aunt and ſiſter. She leaned her head upon her hand, the weight on her boſom became leſs oppreſſive, ſhe rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her head: Of my innocence I can give ſuch proofs," cried ſhe—Her lips cloſed, a mortal paleneſs overſpread her face, the ſound of ſuicide ſeemed piercing through her ear, ſhe trembled, the ſolemn, the dreadful declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Lord Cherbury had made of not ſurviving the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure of his ſecret, her promiſe of inviolably keeping it, both ruſhed upon her mind, ſhe beheld herſelf on the very verge of a tremendous precipice, and about plunging her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and a fellow creature into it, from whence, at the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of her God, ſhe ſhould have to anſwer for acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating the death of that fellow creature: "And is it by a breach of faith!" ſhe aſked herſelf; "I hoped to be re-eſtabliſhed in the opinion of Lord Mortimer and his relations.—Ah! miſtaken idea, and how great is the deluſion paſſion ſpreads before our eyes, even if their eſteem could be thus regained! Oh! what were that, or what the eſteem, the plaudits of the world, if thoſe of my own heart was gone forever? Oh! never," cried
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:038416_0604_1011E6B8347F8788"/>
ſhe, ſtill to herſelf, and raiſing her eyes to heaven, "oh! never may the pang of ſelf-reproach be added to thoſe which now oppreſs me!" her heart at the moment form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſolemn vow never by any wilful act, to merit ſuch a pang: "And, Oh! my God," ſhe cried, "forgive thy weak creature, who, aſſailed by ſtrong temptation, thought for a moment of wandering from the path of truth and integrity, which can alone conduct her to the region where peace and immortal glory will be her's."</p>
                     <p>Amanda, amidſt her powerful emotions, forgot ſhe was obſerved, except by that Being to whom ſhe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for pardon and future ſtrength. Lady Martha had been a ſilent ſpectator of her emotions, and, thinking as ſhe did of Amanda, could only hope they proceeded from contrition for her paſt conduct, forcibly awakened by reflecting on the deprivations it had cauſed her.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe again ſaw Amanda able to pay attention ſhe addreſſed her: "I ſaid I was ſorry for witneſſing your diſtreſs, I ſhall not repeat the expreſſion, thinking as I now do, I hope that it is occaſioned by regret for paſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; the tears of repentance waſh away the ſtains of guilt, and that heart muſt indeed be callous which the ſigh of remorſe will not melt to pity." Amanda turned her eyes with earneſtneſs on Lady Martha, as ſhe ſpoke, and her cheeks were again tinged with a faint glow.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps, I ſpeak too plainly," cried Lady Martha witneſſing this glow, and imputing it to reſentment; but I have ever liked the undiſguiſed language of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It gave me pleaſure, ſhe continued, "to hear you had been in employment at Mrs. Duncan's, but that pleaſure was deſtroyed by hearing you were going to London, though to ſeek your brother, Mrs. Duncan has informed Mrs. Macqueen. If this were indeed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, there are means of inquiring without taking ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent a ſtep."</p>
                     <p>"Imprudent!" repeated Amanda, involuntarily.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," cried Lady Martha, "a journey ſo long without a protector to a young, I muſt add, a lovely woman, teems with danger, from which a mind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038416_0605_1011E6BCC3922F40"/>
would ſhrink appalled. If indeed you go to ſeek your brother, and he regards you a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he ſhould, he would rather have you neglect him (though that you need not have done by ſtaying with Mrs. Duncan) than run into the way of inſults. No emergency in life ſhould lead us to do an improper thing, as trying to produce good by evil is impious, ſo trying to produce pleaſure by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence is folly; they are trials, however flatteringly they may commence, which are ſure to end in ſorrow and diſappointment."</p>
                     <p>"You will," continued Lady Martha, "if indeed anxious to eſcape from any further cenſure than what has already befallen you, return to Mrs. Duncan. When I inform you (if indeed you are already ignorant of it) that Col. Belgrave paſſed this road about a month ago, in his way from a remote part of Scotland to London, where he now is."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot help," ſaid Amanda, "the miſconſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which may be put on my actions; I can only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port myſelf under the pain they inflict by conſcious rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>

                     <p>"If," ſaid Lady Martha, "your journey is really not prompted by the intention of ſeeing your brother, you heighten every other error by duplicity."</p>

                     <p>Amanda hoped and believed, that in a place ſo large as London, with her aſſumed name (which ſhe now reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to drop till in a more ſecure ſituation) ſhe ſhould eſcape Belgrave. As to meeting him on the road ſhe had not the ſmalleſt apprehenſions concerning that, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally concluding that he never would have taken ſo long a journey as he had lately done, if he could have ſtaid but a few weeks away; time ſhe truſted would prove the falſity of the inferrence, which ſhe already was informed would be drawn from her perſeverance in her journey. She told Lady Martha that ſhe thanked her for her kind offer, but muſt decline it, as the line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhe had marked out for herſelf rendered it unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, whoſe innocence would yet be juſtified, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

ſhe; "but, notwithſtanding it is ſo contrary to my ideas of what is right, I cannot let you depart without telling you, that, ſhould you at any time want or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſervices, which you would, or could not aſk from ſtrangers, or perhaps expect them to perform, acquaint me, and command mine; yet, in doing juſtice to my own feeling, I muſt not do injuſtice to the noble ones of Lord Mortimer; it is by his deſire, as well as my own inclination, I now ſpeak to you in this manner, though paſt events and the ſituation he is about entering into, muſt forever preclude his perſonal interference in your affairs. He could never hear the daughter of Captain Fitzalan ſuffered inconvenience of any kind, without wiſhing, without having her indeed, if poſſible, extricated from it."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Madam," cried Amanda, unable to repreſs her guſhing tears, "I am already well acquainted with the noble feelings of Lord Mortimer, already oppreſſed with a weight of obligations." Lady Martha was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by her energy, her eyes grew humid, and her voice ſoftened. "Error in you will be more inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than others," cried Lady Martha, "becauſe, like too many unhappy creatures, you cannot plead the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of all the world; to regret paſt errors, be they what they may, is to inſure my aſſiſtance and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if both or either are at any time required by you; was I even gone, I ſhould take care to leave a ſubſtitute behind me, who ſhould fulfil my intentions towards you, and by doing ſo, at once ſoothe and gratify the feelings of Lord Mortimer."</p>
                     <p>"I thank you, Madam," cried Amanda, riſing from her chair, and as ſhe wiped away her tears, ſummoning all her fortitude to her aid, "for the intereſt you expreſs about me; the time may yet come, perhaps, when I ſhall prove I never was unworthy of exciting it, when the notice now offered from compaſſion may be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from eſteem—then," continued Amanda, who could not forbear this juſtice to herſelf, "the pity La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Martha Dormer will not humble but exalt me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then I ſhall know that it proceeds from that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

ſympathy, which one virtuous mind feels for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in diſtreſs." She moved to the door. "How la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſaid Lady Martha, "to have ſuch talents miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied!"</p>
                     <p>"Ah! Madam," cried Amanda, ſtopping, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mournfully to her, "I find you are inflexible."</p>
                     <p>Lady Martha ſhook her head, and Amanda had laid her hand upon the lock, when Lady Martha ſaid ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, "there were letters paſſed between you and Lord Mortimer." Amanda bowed.</p>
                     <p>"They had better be mutually returned," ſaid La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Martha. "Do you ſeal up his, and ſend them to Lord Cherbury's houſe in London directed to me, and I pledge myſelf to have your's returned."</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall be obeyed, Madam," replied Amanda, in a low broken voice, after the pauſe of a moment. Lady Martha then ſaid ſhe would no longer encroach upon her reſt, and ſhe retired.</p>
                     <p>In her chamber the feelings ſhe had ſo long, ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tried to ſuppreſs, broke forth without again meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſition; the pride which had given her tranſient animation, was no more, for as paſt circumſtances aroſe to recollection, ſhe could not wonder at her being condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them. She no longer accuſed Lady Martha in her mind of ſeverity, no longer felt offended with her; but, oh! Mortimer, the bitter tears ſhe ſhed fell not for herſelf alone, ſhe wept to think thy deſtiny, though more proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, was not leſs unhappy than her own, for in thy broken accents, thy altered looks, ſhe perceived a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſtrong and ſincere as ever for her, and well ſhe knew Lady Euphraſia not calculated to ſoothe a ſad heart, or ſteal an image from it which corroded its felicity. Reſt after the incidents of the evening was not to be thought of, but nature was exhauſted, and inſenſibly Amanda ſunk upon the bed in a deep ſleep, ſo inſenſibly, that when ſhe awoke, which was not till the morning was pretty far advanced, ſhe felt ſurpriſed at her ſituation; ſhe felt cold and unrefreſhed from having lain in her clothes all night, and when ſhe went to adjuſt her dreſs
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:038416_0609_1011E6C7270D8F00"/>
at the glaſs, was ſurpriſed with the pallidneſs of her looks. Anxious to eſcape a ſecond painful meeting, ſhe went to the window to ſee if the chaiſe was come, but was diſappainted on finding that ſhe had ſlept at the back of the houſe; ſhe heard no noiſe, and concluding the family had not yet riſen after the amuſements of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding night, ſat down, by the window which looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſpacious garden, above which roſe romantic hills that formed a ſcreen for ſome young and beautiful plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that lay between them and the garden; but the miſty tops of the hills, the varied trees which autumn ſpread over the plantations, nor the neat appearance of the garden, had power to amuſe the imagination of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda! Her patience was exhauſted after ſitting ſome time, and going to the door ſhe ſoftly opened it, to try if ſhe could hear any one ſtirring. She had not ſtood long, when the ſound of footſteps and voices roſe from below. She inſtantly quitted her room, and deſcended the ſtairs into a ſmall hall, acroſs which was a folding door; this ſhe gently opened, and found it divided the hall ſhe ſtood in from one that was ſpacious and lofty, and which her paſſing through the preceding night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was lighted up, had prevented her taking notice of; here, at a long table, were the men ſervants belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the family and the gueſts aſſembled at a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, the piper at the head, lik the king of the feaſt. Amanda ſtepped back the moment ſhe perceived them, well knowing Lord Mortimer's ſervants would recollect her, and was aſcending the ſtairs to her room to ring for one of the maids, when a ſervant haſtily followed her, and ſaid the family were already in the breakfaſt room; at the ſame moment Mr. Colin Macqueen came from a parlour which opened in the little hall, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Amanda, in a lively and affectionate manner the compliments of the morning, he led her to the parlour, where not only all the family gueſts who had laid in the houſe, but ſeveral gentlemen, who had been with them the preceding night, were aſſembled.—Doctor Johnſon has already celebrated a Scotch breakfaſt, nor was the one at which Mrs. Macqueen and her fair daughters
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:038416_0610_1011E6C9AE1827D8"/>
preſided, inferior to any he had ſeen; beſides chocolate, tea and coffee, with the uſual appendages, there were rich cakes, choice ſweetmeats, and a variety of cold p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſtry, with ham and chickens, to which ſeveral of the gentlemen did honour; the diſhes were ornamented with ſweet herbs and wild flowers, gathered about the feet of the mountains and in the valley, and by every gueſt was placed a fine bouquet from the green-houſe, with little French mottos on love and friendſhip about them, which being opened and read, added to the mirth of the company.</p>
                     <p>"I was juſt going to ſend one of the girls for you," ſaid Mrs. Macqueen, when Amanda had taken a place at the table, "and would have done ſo before, but wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to get as much reſt as poſſible, after your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing journey."</p>
                     <p>"I aſſure you, madam," ſaid Amanda, "I have been up this long time, expecting every moment a ſummons to the chaiſe."</p>
                     <p>"I took care of that laſt night," ſaid Mrs. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen, "for I was determined you ſhould not depart at leaſt without breakfaſting." Amanda was ſeated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. Colin Macqueen and his elder ſiſter, and ſought by converſing with the former, for the latter was too much engroſſed by the general gaiety to pay particular attention to any one, to avoid the looks ſhe dreaded to ſee; yet the ſound of Lord Mortimer's voice affected her as much almoſt as his looks.</p>
                     <p>"Pray, Lady Martha," ſaid the ſecond Miſs Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen, a lively thoughtleſs girl, "will your Ladyſhip be ſo good as to guarantee a promiſe Lord Mortimer has juſt made me, or rather that I have extorted from him, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"You muſt firſt, my dear," anſwered Lady Martha, "let me know what the promiſe is."</p>
                     <p>"Why, gloves and bridal favours, but moſt unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly granted, I can aſſure your Ladyſhip." Amanda was obliged to ſet down the cup ſhe was raiſing to her lips, and a glance ſtole involuntarily from her towards Lord Mortimer, a glance inſtantly withdrawn when ſhe

ſaw his eyes in the ſame direction. "I declare," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Miſs Phoeby Macqueen, "I ſhould do the favour all due honour."</p>
                     <p>"I am ſure," cried Lord Martimer, attempting to ſpeak cheerfully, "your acceptance of it would do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the preſenter.</p>
                     <p>"And your Lordſhip may be ſure too," ſaid one of her brothers, "it is a favour ſhe would wiſh with all her heart to have an opportunity of returning."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Amanda could ſcarcely ſpeak; ſhe tried however to hide her agitation, and forcing a faint ſmile, with a voice nearly as faint, ſaid, "that was not a fair queſtion." The Miſs Macqueens took upon themſelves to anſwer it, and Amanda through their means was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from farther embarraſſment.</p>
                     <p>Breakfaſt over, Amanda was anxious to depart, and yet wanted courage to be the firſt to move; a charm ſeemed to bind her to the ſpot where, for the laſt time, ſhe ſhould behold Lord Mortimer, at leaſt the laſt time ſhe ever expected to ſee him unmarried.</p>
                     <p>Her dread of being late on the road, and ſhe heard the deſtined ſtage for the night was at a great diſtance, at laſt conquered her reluctance to move, and ſhe ſaid to Mr. Colin Macqueen it was time for her to go. At that moment Lord Mortimer roſe, and propoſed to the young Macqueens going with them to ſee the new plantations behind the houſe, which old Mr. Macqueen had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a deſire his Lordſhip ſhould give his opinion of.</p>
                     <p>All the young gentlemen, as well as the Macqueens, Colin excepted, attended his Lordſhip, nor did they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part without wiſhing Amanda a pleaſant journey.</p>
                     <p>Silent and ſad ſhe continued in her chair, for ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

when Mrs. Macqueen riſing drew her to the window, and in a low voice repeated her requeſt for Amanda's company a few days. This Amanda again declined, but gratefully expreſſed her thanks for it, and the hoſpitality ſhe had experienced. Mrs. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queen ſaid, on her return to Scotland, ſhe hoped to be more ſucceſsful. She alſo added, that ſome of her boys and girls would gladly have accompanied Amanda a few miles on her way, had not they all agreed ere her arrival to eſcort Lord Mortimer's party to an inn at no great diſtance, and take an early dinner with them. She ſhould write that day, ſhe ſaid to Mrs. Duncan, and thank her for having introduced to her family a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whoſe acquaintance was an acquiſition. Amanda, having received the affectionate adieus of this amiable woman and her daughters, courtſeyed, though with down caſt looks to Lady Martha and Lady Araminta, who returned her ſalutation with coolneſs.</p>
                     <p>Followed by two of the Miſs Macqueens, ſhe hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the hall, from which the ſervants and their breakfaſt things were already removed; but how was ſhe diſtreſſed when the firſt object ſhe ſaw out-ſide the door was Lord Mortimer, by whom ſtood Colin Macqueen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had left the parlour to ſee if the chaiſe was ready, and one of his brothers; haſtily would ſhe have ſtepped forward to the chaiſe, had not the gallantry of the young men impeded her way; they expreſſed ſorrow at her not ſtaying longer amongſt them, and hopes on her return ſhe would.</p>
                     <p>"Pray my Lord," cried the Miſs Macqueens, (while their brothers were thus addreſſing Amanda) "pray my Lord," almoſt in the ſame breath, "what have you done with the Gentlemen?"</p>
                     <p>"You ſhould aſk your brother," he replied; he has locked them up in the plantation; a frolic was at all times pleaſing to the light hearted Macqueens, and to enjoy the preſent one, off they ran directly, followed by their brothers, all calling as they ran to Amanda not to ſtir till they came back, which would be in a few minutes; but Amanda, from the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Amanda," in the next moment, ſaid a voice to which her heart vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. She turned with involuntary quickneſs, and ſaw Lord Mortimer cloſe by her. "Amanda," he repeated; then ſuddenly claſping his hands together, exclaimed, with an agonized expreſſion, while he turned abruptly from her: "Gracious Heaven! what a ſituation! Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da," ſaid he again looking at her, "the ſcene which happened laſt night was diſtreſſing. I am now ſorry on your account that it took place, notwithſtanding paſt events I bear you no ill will; the knowledge of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs would give me pain; from my heart I forgive you all that you have cauſed, that you have entailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; at this moment I could take you to my arms, and weep over you, like a fond mother over the loſt dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of her hopes, tears of pity and forgiveneſs."</p>
                     <p>Amanda unutterably affected, covered her face to hide the tears which bedewed it.</p>
                     <p>"Let me have the pleaſure of hearing," continued Lord Mortimer, "that you forgive the uneaſineſs and pain I might have occaſioned you laſt night."</p>
                     <p>"Forgive!" repeated Amanda, "Oh! my Lord," and her voice ſunk in the ſobs which heaved her boſom. "Could I think you were, you would be happy." Lord Mortimer ſtopt, overcome by ſtrong emotions.</p>
                     <p>"Happy!" repeated Amanda, "Oh! never—ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver," continued ſhe, raiſing her ſtreaming eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, "oh! never—never in this world!"</p>
                     <p>At this moment the Macqueens were not only heard but ſeen running back, followed by the gentlemen whom they had been prevailed on the liberate. Shocked at the idea of being ſeen in ſuch a ſituation, Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da would have called the poſtillion; but he was

too far off to hear her weak voice, had ſhe then even been able to exert that voice.—She looked towards him, however, with an expreſſion which denoted the feeling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of her ſoul.—Lord Mortimer, ſenſible of thoſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, haſtily pulled open the door of the chaiſe, and taking the cold and trembling hand of Amanda, with one equally cold and trembling, aſſiſted her into the chaiſe, then preſſing the hand he held between both his, he ſuddenly let it drop from him, and cloſing the door without again looking at Amanda, called to the driver, who inſtantly obeyed the call, and had mounted ere the Macqueens arrived.—Oh! what a contraſt did their looks, blooming with health and exerciſe, their gaiety, their protected ſituation, form to the wan, dejected, deſolate Amanda. With looks of ſurpriſe they were going up to the chaiſe, when Lord Mortimer ſtill ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it, and anxious to ſave his unhappy loſt Amanda, the pain of being noticed in ſuch agitation, gave the man a ſignal to drive off, which was inſtantly obeyed.</p>
                     <p>Thus did Amanda leave the manſion of the Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queens, where ſorrow had ſcarcely ever before entered without meeting alleviation, a manſion, where the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the way faring man, and the needy, were ſure of a welcome, cordial as benevolence and hoſpitality could give, and where happineſs, as pure as in this ſublumery ſtate can be experienced, was enjoyed. As ſhe drove from the door ſhe ſaw the ſplendid equipages of Lord Mortimer and Lady Martha driving to it. She turned from them with a ſigh, at reflecting they would ſoon grace the bridal pomp of Lady Euphraſia. She purſued the remainder of her journey without meeting any thing worthy of relation. It was in the evening ſhe reached London. The momet ſhe ſtopped at the hotel ſhe ſent for a carriage, and proceeded in it to Mrs. Connel's in Bond Street.</p>

                     <p>SHE alighted from the carriage when it ſtopped at the door, and entered the ſhop, where, to her inexpreſſible ſatisfaction, the firſt object ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held was Miſs Ruſhbrook ſitting penſively at one of the counters. The moment ſhe ſaw Amanda ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected her, and ſtarting up exclaimed, as ſhe took her hand, "Ah! dear madam, this it indeed a joyful ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe! Ah! how often have I wiſhed to meet you again to expreſs my gratitude." The affectionate reception ſhe met, and the unexpected ſight of Miſs Ruſhbrook, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promiſe Amanda, that her wiſhes relative to Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook would not only be a accelerated, but crowned with ſucceſs. She returned the fervent preſſure of Miſs Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook's hand and enquired after her parents; the enquiry appeared diſtreſſing, and ſhe was anſwered with heſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they were indifferent; the evident embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her queſtion excited prevented her renewing it at this time. The miſtreſs of the houſe was not preſent, and Amanda requeſted, if ſhe was within, ſhe might ſee her directly. Miſs Ruſhbrook immediately ſtepped to a parlour behind the ſhop; and almoſt inſtantly returned followed by the Lady herſelf, who was a little fat Iriſh woman, paſt her prime, but not paſt her reliſh for the good things of this life: "Dear Madam," ſaid ſhe, courtſeying to Amanda, "you are very welcome; I proteſt I am very glad to ſee you, though I never had that pleaſure but once before; but it is no wonder I ſhould be ſo, for I have heard your praiſes every day ſince, I am ſure, from that young Lady, looking at Miſs Ruſhbrook. Amanda bowed, but her heart was

too full of the purpoſe of this viſite to allow her to ſpeak about any thing elſe. She was juſt come from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhe told Mrs. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Dear Ma'am," ſaid Mrs. Connel, "I proteſt I ſhould have been happy to have accommodated you, but at preſent my houſe is quite full."</p>
                     <p>The diſappointment this ſpeech gave Amanda render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſilent for a moment and ſhe was then going to aſk Mrs. Connel if ſhe could recommend her to a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, when ſhe perceived Miſs Ruſhbrook whiſpering her. "Why, Madam," cried the former, who by a nod of her head ſeemed to approve of what the latter had been ſaying, "ſince you diſlike ſo much going amongſt ſtrangers, which indeed ſhews your prudence, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>! moſt joyfully, moſt thankfully, do I accept the offer," ſaid Amanda, whoſe heart had ſunk at the idea of going amongſt ſtrangers.—"Any place," ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſpeaking in the fulneſs of that agitated heart, "beneath ſo reputable a roof, would be an aſylum of comfort I ſhould prefer to a palace, if utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the people who inhabited it; her trunk was now brought in, and the carriage diſcharged; "I ſuppoſe Ma'am," ſaid Mrs. Connel, looking at the trunk on which her aſſumed name was marked, "you are Scotch by your name, though indeed you have not much of the accent about you?"</p>
                     <p>"I declare," cried Emily, alſo looking at it, "till this moment I was ignorant of your name."</p>
                     <p>Amanda was pleaſed to hear this, and reſolved not to diſcloſe her real one, except convinced Ruſhbrook would

intereſt himſelf in her affairs. She was conducted into the parlou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, which was neatly furniſhed, and opened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſhop by a glaſs door. Mrs. Connel ſtirred a declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire into a cheerful blaze, and deſired to know if Amanda would chuſe any thing for dinner. "Speak the word only, my dear," ſaid ſhe, "and I think I can procure you a cold bone in the houſe. If you had came two hours ſooner I could have given you a nice bit of veal for your dinner."—Amanda aſſured her ſhe did not wiſh to take any thing till tea-time.</p>
                     <p>"Well, well," cried Mrs. Connel, "you ſhall have a ſnug cup of tea by and by, and a hot muffin with it. I am very fond of tea myſelf though poor Mr. Connel, who is dead and gone, uſed often and often to ſay, I that was ſo n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Emily retired ſoon after Amanda entered; but return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a few minutes with her hat and cloak on, and ſaid, "nothing but a viſit ſhe muſt pay her parents ſhould have induced her to forego, for the firſt evening at leaſt, the pleaſure of Miſs Donald's ſociety."</p>
                     <p>Amanda thanked her for her politeneſs, but aſſured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I aſſure you," ſaid Mrs. Connel, as Emily departed, "ſhe is very fond of you."</p>
                     <p>"I am happy to hear it," replied Amanda, "for I think her a moſt amiable girl."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed ſhe is," cried the other, "all the fault I find with her is being too grave for her time of life. Poor thing, one cannot wonder at that however, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſituation of her parents."</p>
                     <p>"I hope," interrupted Amanda, "it is not ſo bed as it was."</p>
                     <p>"Bad! Lord, it connot be worſe; the poor Captain has been in goal above a year."</p>

"To Lady Greyſtock! why, Lord, one might as well apply to one of the wild beaſts in the Tower. Ah! poor Gentleman, if he was never to get nothing but what ſhe gave him, I believe he would not long be a trouble to any one. It is now about fourteen years ſince my acquaintance with him firſt commenced. My poor huſband, that is no more, and I kept a ſhop in Dublin, where the Captain's regiment was quartered, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only a Lieutenant had not room enough for his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the barracks, ſo he took lodgings at our houſe, where Mrs. Ruſhbrook lay in, and I being with her now and then during her confinement, a kind of friendſhip grew amongſt us. They had not left us long to go to America, when a relation of my huſband's, who owned this houſe and ſhop, having loſt his wife, and being loneſome, without either chick or child, invited us to come and live with him, promiſing us if we did to ſettle us in his buſineſs, and leave us every thing he had.—Well, ſuch offers do not come every day, ſo to be ſure we took him at his word, and here we had not been long when the poor man bid adieu to all mortal care, and was ſoon followed by Mr. Connel. Well, to be ſure, I was ſad and ſolitary enough; but when I thought how irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious it was to break one's heart with grief, I plucked up my ſpirits, and began to hold up my head again; ſo to make a ſhort ſtory of a long one, about ſix years ago Mrs. Ruſhbrook and Miſs Emily came one day into the ſhop to buy ſomething, little thinking they ſhould ſee an old friend, it was to be ſure a meeting of joy and ſorrow as one may ſay, we told all our griefs to each other, and I found things were very bad with the poor Captain; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have a great regard for him and his family, and when he was confined I took Emily home as an aſſiſtant in my buſineſs; the money ſhe earned was to go to her parents, and I agreed to give her her clothes gratis; but that would have gone but a little way in feeding ſo many mouths, had I not procured plain work for Mrs. Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook and her daughters. Emily is a very good girl in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and it is to ſee her parents ſhe is now gone; but while I am gabbling away I am ſure the kettle is boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:038416_0619_1011E6DFE6A5F390"/>
ſo ſaying, ſhe ſtarted up, and ringing the bell, took the tea-things from a beaufet where they were kept; the maid, having obeyed the well known ſummons, then retired, and as ſoon as the tea was made, and the muffins buttered, Mrs. Connel made Amanda draw her chair cloſe to the table that ſhe might, as ſhe ſaid, look ſnug, and drink her tea comfortably.</p>
                     <p>"I aſſure you, ma'am," cried ſhe, "it was a lucky hour for Miſs Emily when ſhe entered my houſe."</p>
                     <p>"I have no doubt of that," ſaid Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"You muſt know, madam," proceeded Mrs. Connel, "about a month ago a gentleman came to lodge with me, who I ſoon found was making ſpeeches to Miſs E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; he was one of thoſe wild looking ſparks who, like Ranger in the play, look as if they would be pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping through every one's doors and windows, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch tricks, as made poor Mr. Strickland ſo jealous of his wife. Well, I took my gentleman to taſk one day unawares: ſo Mr. Sipthorpe," ſays I, "I am told you have caſt a ſheep's-eye upon one of my girls; but I muſt tell you ſhe is a girl of virtue and family, ſo if you do not mean to deal honourably with her, you muſt either decamp from this, or ſpeak to her no more. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he made me a ſpeech as long as a member of parliament's upon a new tax. "Lord! Mr. Sipthorpe," ſays I, "there is no occaſion for all this orotory, a few words will ſettle the buſineſs between us. Well, this was coming cloſe to the point you will ſay, and he told me th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n he always meant to deal honourably by Miſs Emily, and told me all about his circumſtances, and I found he had a fine fortune, which indeed I partly gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before from the appearance he made, and he ſaid he would not only marry Miſs Emily, but take her parents out of priſon, and provide for the whole family. Well, now comes the provoking part of my ſtory: A young clergyman had been ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, at the beginning of their diſtreſs, to them, and he and Miſs Emily, took it into their heads to fall in love with each other. Well, her parents gave their conſent to their being married, which to be ſure I thought a very fooliſh thing, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:038416_0620_1011E6E18D4B3A90"/>
the young man's inability to ſerve them. To be ſure he promiſed fair enough; but, Lord! what could a poor curate do for them, particularly when he got a wife and houſe full of children of his own I thought? ſo I ſuppoſed they would be quite glad to be off with him, and to give her to Mr. Sipthorpe; but no ſuch thing I aſſure you. When I mentioned it to them, one talked of honour, and another of gratitude, and as to Miſs Emily ſhe fairly went into fits. Well, I thought I would ſerve them in ſpite of themſelves, ſo knowing the curate to be a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic young fellow, I writes off to him, and tells him what a cruel thing it would be, if, for his own gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he kept Miſs Emily to her word, and made her loſe a match, which would free her family from all their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and in ſhort I touched up his paſſion not a little I aſſure you, and, as I hoped, a letter came from him, in which he told her he gave her up. Well, to be ſure there was ſad work when it came, with her I mean, for the Captain and his wife were glad enough of it I believe in their hearts, ſo at laſt every thing was ſettled for her marriage with Mr. Sipthorpe, and he made a number of handſome preſents to her, I aſſure you, and they are to be married in a few days. He is only waiting for his rents in the country to take the Captain out of priſon; but here is Miſs Emily, inſtead of being quite merry and joyful, is as dull and as melancholy as if ſhe was going to be married to a frightful old man."</p>
                     <p>"Conſider," ſaid Amanda, "you have juſt ſaid her heart was pre-engaged."</p>
                     <p>"Lord!" cried Mrs. Connel, "a girl at her time of life can change her love as eaſily as her cap."</p>
                     <p>"I ſincerely hope," exclaimed Amanda, "that ſhe either has or may ſoon be able to transfer hers."</p>
                     <p>"And now, pray, Madam," ſaid Mrs. Connel, with a look which ſeemed to ſay Amanda ſhould be as commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative as ſhe had been, "may I aſk from whence you have travelled?"</p>
                     <p>"From a remote part of Scotland."</p>

                     <p>"Welch," ſaid Amanda.—"Really; well, I ſuppoſe, Ma'am, you have had many a ſcramble up the mountains after the goats, which they ſay are marvellous plenty in that part of the world."</p>
                     <p>"No, indeed," replied Amanda.—"Are you come to make any long ſtay in London, Ma'am?" "I have not determined"—"I ſuppoſe you have come about a little buſineſs, Ma'am?" reſumed Mrs. Connel. "Yes," replied Amanda. "To be ſure, not an affair of great conſequence, or ſo young a lady would not have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it." Amanda ſmiled, but made no reply, and was at length relieved from theſe tireſome and inquiſitive queſtions by Mrs. Connel's calling in her girls to tea; after which ſhe waſhed the tea things, put them into the beaufet, and left the room to order ſomething for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Left to herſelf, Amanda reflected that at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent juncture of Ruſhbrook's affairs, when his attention and time were engroſſed by the approaching ſettlement of his daughter, an application to him on her account would be not only impertinent but unavailing; ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined to wait till the hurry and agitation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſuch an event had ſubſided, and moſt ſincerely did ſhe hope that it might be productive of felicity to all. Mrs. Connel was not long abſent, and Emily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Have you, Ma'am?" cried Emily, with a faint ſmile, and a dejected voice. Amanda looked earneſtly in her face, and ſaw an expreſſion of the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>epeſt ſadneſs in it. From her own heart ſhe readily imagined what her feelings muſt be at ſuch a diſappointment as Mrs. Connel had mentioned, and felt the ſincereſt pity for her.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:038416_0622_1011E6E9C8067D38"/>
Mrs. Connel's volubility tormented them both; ſupper happily terminated it, as ſhe was then much better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in her own opinion, than ſhe could poſſibly have been in talking—Amanda pleaded fatigue for retiring early. Mrs. Connel adviſed her to try a few glaſſes of wine as a reſtorative; but ſhe begged to be excuſed, and was allowed to retire with Emily. The chamber was ſmall, but neat, and enlivened by a good fire, to which Amanda and Emily ſat down while undreſſing. The latter eagerly availed herſelf of this opportunity to expreſs the gratitude of her heart. Amanda tried to change the diſcourſe, but could not ſucceed. "Long, madam," continued Emily, "have we wiſhed to return our thanks for a benefaction ſo delicately conveyed as your's, and happy were my parents to night when I informed them I could now expreſs their grateful feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings."</p>
                     <p>"Though intereſted exceedingly in your affairs," ſaid Amanda, making another effort to change the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, "be aſſured I never ſhould have taken the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of inquiring minutely into them, and I mention this left you might ſuppoſe, from what Mrs. Connel ſaid, that I had done ſo."</p>
                     <p>"No, madam," replied Emily, "I had no ſuch idea, and an inquiry from you would be rather pleaſing than otherwiſe, becauſe I ſhould then flatter myſelf you might be induced to liſten to griefs which have long wanted the conſolation of ſympathy—ſuch, I am ſure, as they would receive from you."</p>
                     <p>"Happy ſhould I be," cried Amanda, "had I the power of alleviating them."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! madam, you have the power," ſaid Emily, "for you would commiſerate them, and commiſeration from you would be balm to my heart; you would ſtrength<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At the time I firſt had the happineſs of ſeeing you, the little credit my father had was exhauſted, and his inability to pay being well known, he was arreſted one evening as he ſat by the bed-ſide of my almoſt expiring mother! I will not pain your gentle nature by dwelling on the horrors of that moment, on the agonies of a parent, and a huſband torn from a family ſo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated as was my father's; feeble, emaciated, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſufficient clothing to guard him from the inclemency of the weather, he leaned upon the arm of one of the bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs, as he turned his eyes from that wife he never more expected to behold. She fainted at the moment he left the room, and it was many minutes ere I had power to approach her. The long continuance of her fit at length recalled my diſtracted thoughts; but I had no reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to apply, no aſſiſtance to recover her, for my eldeſt brother had followed my father, and the reſt of the children, terrified by the ſcene they had witneſſed, wept together in a corner of the room. I had at laſt recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a Lady, who lived nearly oppoſite to us, and from whom I hoped to procure ſome relief for her; nothing but the preſent emergency could have made me apply to

her, for the attention ſhe had paid us on firſt coming to Mr. Heathfield's was entirely withdrawn after his death. Pride, however, was forgotten at the preſent moment, and I flew to the houſe.—The ſervant ſhewed me into a parlour, where ſhe, her daughters, and a young clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I had never before ſeen, were ſitting at tea. I could not bring myſelf to mention my diſtreſs before a ſtranger, and accordingly begged to ſpeak to her in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther room; but ſhe told me, in a blunt manner, I might ſpeak there. In a low and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

How great was my confuſion when ſhe declared aloud all I had told her, and turning to her daughter, bid her give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"Aye, aye," cried ſhe, "I always thought things would turn out ſo; it was really very fooliſh of Mr. Heathfield to bring you to his houſe, and lead you all into ſuch expences! I liſtened to no more, but, taking the wine with a ſilent pang, retired.</p>
                     <p>"I had not been many minutes returned, and was kneeling by the bedſide of my mother who began to ſhew ſome ſymptoms of returning life, when a gentle knock came to the hall door: I ſuppoſed it my brother, and bid one of the children fly to open it. What was my ſurpriſe when in a few minutes ſhe returned, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the young clergyman I had juſt ſeen! I ſtarted from my kneeling poſture, and my looks expreſſed my wonder. He approached, and, in the ſoft accent of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, appoligized for his intruſion; but ſaid, he came with a hope and a wiſh that he might be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Oh! how ſoothing were his words! Oh! how painfully pleaſing the voice of tenderneſs to the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! The tears, which pride and indignation had ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a few moments before, again began flowing.</p>
                     <p>"But I will not dwell upon my feelings; ſuffice it to ſay, that every attention which could mitigate my wretchedneſs he paid, and that his efforts, aided by mine, ſoon reſtored my mother. His looks, his mannre, his profeſſion, all conſpired to calm her ſpirits, and ſhe
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:038416_0625_1011E6F1F8DFCC98"/>
bleſſed the power which ſo unexpectedly gave us a friend. My brother returned from my father merely to enquire how we were, and to go back to him directly. The ſtranger requeſted permiſſion to accompany him, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt moſt pleaſing to us, as we truſted his ſoothing attention would have the ſame effect upon his ſorrowing heart as it had upon our's. Scarcely had he gone ere a man arrived from a neighbouring hotel with a baſket loaded with wine and proviſions; but to enumerate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtance of this young man's goodneſs would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon your patience; in ſhort, by his care my mother in a few days was able to be carried to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's priſon. Mrs. Connel, who on the firſt intimation of our diſtreſs, had come to us, took me into her houſe at a ſtated ſalary, which was to be given to my parents, and the reſt of the children were to continue with them. My mother deſired me one evening to take a walk with the children to Kenſington, as ſhe thought them injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by conſtant confinement. Our friend attended us, and in our way thither informed me that he muſt ſoon leave town, as he was but a country curate, and his leave of abſence from his rector was expired: it was above a month ſince we had known him, during which time his attentions were unremitted, and he was a ſource of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us all. A ſudden chill came over my heart as he ſpoke, and every ſorrow at that moment ſeemed aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. On entering Kenſington gardens, I ſeated my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on a little riſing mount, for I felt trembling and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, and he ſat beſide me. Never had I before felt ſo oppreſſed, and my tears guſhed forth in ſpite of my efforts to reſtrain them. Something I ſaid of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſioned by the recollection of the period when my parents enjoyed the charming ſcene I now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated along with me. "Would to heaven," cried he, "I could reſtore them to the enjoyment of it."</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" ſaid I, "they already lie under unreturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able obligations to you; in loſing you," added I, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily, "they will loſe their only comfort."</p>
                     <p>"Since then," "cried he, "you flatter me, by ſaying it is in my power to give them comfort, oh! let them

have a conſtant claim upon me for it. Oh! Emily," he continued, taking my hand, "let them be my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as well as your's; then will their too ſcrupulous delicacy be conquered, and they will receive as a right what they now conſider as a favour." I felt my cheeks glow with bluſhes, but ſtill did not perfectly conceive his meaning. "My deſtiny is humble," he continued; "was it otherwiſe, I ſhould long ſince have entreated you to ſhare it with me; could you be prevailed on to do ſo, you would give it pleaſures it never yet experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced." He pauſed for a reply, but I was unable to give one.</p>
                     <p>Ah! Madam, how little neceſſity either was there for one, my looks, my confuſion, betrayed my feelings. He urged me to ſpeak, and at laſt I acknowledged I ſhould not heſitate to ſhare his deſtiny, but for my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who by ſuch a meaſure would loſe my aſſiſtance. "Oh do not think," cried he, "I would ever wiſh to tempt you into any ſituation which ſhould make you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect them. He then proceeded to ſay, "that though unable at preſent to liberate them, yet he truſted that, if they conſented to our union, he ſhould, by economy, be enabled to contribute more eſſentially to their ſupport than I could do, and alſo be able in a ſhort time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their debts." His propoſals were made known to them, and met their warmeſt approbation. The pleaſure they derived from them was more on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count than their own, as the idea of having me ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled removed a weight of anxiety from their minds; ſome of my brothers and ſiſters ſhould live with us, he ſaid, and promiſed my time ſhould be chiefly ſpent in doing fine works, which ſhould be ſent to Mrs. Connel to diſpoſe of for my parents, and alſo that, from time to time, I ſhould viſit them till I had the power of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to my cottage, for ſuch he deſcribed his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

where I had been on a meſſage from Mrs. Connel, a gentleman joined me in the ſtreet, and, with a rude fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, endeavoured to enter into converſation with me. I endeavoured to ſhake him off, but could not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and haſtened home with the utmoſt expedition, whither I ſaw he followed me. I thought no more of the incident till about-two days after I ſaw him enter the ſhop, and heard him enquire of Mrs. Connel about her lodgings, which to my great mortification he immediately took, for I could not help ſuſpecting he had ſome impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motive for taking them: I reſolved, however, if ſuch a motive really exiſted, to diſappoint it by keeping out of his way; but all my vigilance was unavailing, he was continually on the watch for me, and I could not go up or down ſtairs without being inſulted by him. I at length informed Mrs. Connel of his conduct, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to fulfil the ſacred truſt her friends repoſed in her, when they gave me to her care, by terminating the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Alas! could I have poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly foreſeen the conſequences that would have followed my application to her, I ſhould have borne thoſe inſults in ſilence. She has already informed you of them. Oh! Madam, when the letter came, which diſſolved a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo cheerfully, ſo fondly given, every proſpect of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity was in a moment overſhadowed? For a long time I reſiſted every effort that was made to prevail on me to marry Sipthorpe; but when at laſt my mother ſaid ſhe was ſorry to find my feelings leſs than his, who had ſo generouſlly reſigned me that my father might be extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from his difficulties, I ſhrunk with agony at the rebuke. I wondered, I was ſhocked, how I could have ſo long heſitated to open the priſon gates of my father, and determined from that moment to ſacrifice myſelf for him; for oh! Miſs Donald, it is a ſacrifice of the moſt dreadful nature I am about making. Sipthorpe is a man I never could have liked, had my heart even been diſengaged."</p>
                     <p>Amanda felt the trueſt pity for her young friend, who ended her narrative in tears: but ſhe did not, by yielding entirely to that pity (as too many girls, with

She ſpoke of the rapture attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the triumph of reaſon and humanity over ſelf and paſſion, and mentioned the ſilent plaudits of the heart as ſuperior to all gratification, or external advintages. She ſpoke from the real feelings of her ſoul; ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the period at which, to a father's admonition, ſhe had reſigned a lover, and had that father been in captain Ruſhbrook's ſituation, and the ſame ſacrifice been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from her as from Emily, ſhe felt, without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſhe would have made it. She was indeed a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itreſs that had practiſe, and would practice (was there a neceſſity for ſo doing) the leſſons ſhe gave, not as poor Ophelia ſays,
<q>
                           <l>Like ſome ungracious paſtors,</l>

The ſweet conſciousneſs of this gave energy, and more than uſual eloquence to her language; but, whilſt ſhe wiſhed to inſpire her young friend, ſhe felt from the tenderneſs of her nature, and the ſad ſituation of her own heart, what the friend muſt feel from diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed affection and a reluctant union. Scarcely could ſhe refrain from weeping over a fate ſo wretched, and which ſhe was tempted to think as dreadful as her own; but a little reflection ſoon convinced her ſhe had the ſad pre-eminence of miſery, for in her fate there was none of thoſe alleviations as in Emily's, which ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced muſt, in ſome degree, reconcile her to it; her ſufferings, unlike Emily's, would not be rewarded by knowing that they contributed to the comfort of thoſe deareſt to her heart."</p>

"Your words my dear Madam," ſaid Emily, "have calmed my ſpirits, henceforth I will be more reſolute in trying to baniſh regrets from my mind; but I have been inconſiderate to a degree in keeping you ſo long from reſt after your fatiguing journey." Amanda indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at this moment nearly exhauſted, and gladly haſtened to bed. Her ſlumbers were ſhort and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing; the cares which clung to her heart when wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were equally oppreſſive whilſt ſleeping. Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer mingled in the meditations of the morning, in the viſions of the night, and when ſhe awoke ſhe found her pillow wet with the tears ſhe had ſhed on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Emily was already up, but on Amanda's draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the curtain ſhe laid down the book ſhe was reading, and came to her. She ſaw ſhe looked extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ill, and imputing this to fatigue, requeſted ſhe would breakfaſt in bed; but Amanda, who knew her illneſs proceeded from a cauſe which neither reſt nor aſſiduous care could cure, refuſed complying with this requeſt, and immediately dreſſed herſelf. As ſhe ſtood at the toilet, Emily ſuddenly exclaimed, "If you have a mind to ſee Sipthorpe I will ſhew him to you now, for he is juſt going out." Amanda went to the window, which Emily gently opened; but, oh! what was the ſhock of that moment, when in Sipthorpe ſhe recognized the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous Belgrave! A ſhivering horror ran through her veins, and recoiling a few paces, ſhe ſunk half fainting on a chair. Emily, terrified by her appearance, was flying to the bell to ring for aſſiſtance, when, by a faint motion of her hand, Amanda prevented her. "I ſhall ſoon be better," ſaid ſhe, ſpeaking with difficulty; "but I will lie down on the bed for a few minutes, and I beg you may go to your breakfaſt." Emily refuſed to go, and entreated that, inſtead of leaving her, ſhe might have breakfaſt brought up for them both. Amanda aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her ſhe could take nothing at preſent, and wiſhed for quiet: Emily therefore reluctantly left her. Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da now endeavoured to compoſe her diſtracted thoughts, and quiet the throbbings of her agonized heart, that ſhe might be able to arrange ſome plan for extricating her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:038416_0630_1011E6FF17F85A40"/>
from her preſent ſituation, which appeared replete with every danger to her imagination; for from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine principles of Belgrave, ſhe could not hope that a new object of purſuit would detach him from her, when he found her ſo unexpectedly thrown in his way; unprotected as ſhe was, ſhe could not think of openly avowing her knowledge of Belgrave, to diſcover his baſeneſs required therefore caution and deliberation, leſt in ſaving Emily from the ſnare ſpread for her deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe ſhould entangle herſelf in it; to declare at once his real character muſt betray her to him, and tho' ſhe might baniſh him from the houſe, yet, unſupported as ſhe was by friends or kindred, unable to procure the protection of Ruſhbrook, in his preſent ſituation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever willing he might be to extend it; ſhe trembled to think of the dangers to which, by thus diſcovering, ſhe might expoſe herſelf to, dangers which the deep trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and daring effrontery of Belgrave would, in all probability, prevent her eſcaping. As the ſafeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhe reſolved on quitting the houſe in the courſe of the day; but without giving an intimation that ſhe meant not to return to it. She recollected a place where there was a probability of her getting lodgings, which would be at once ſecret and ſecure, and by an anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous letter to Captain Ruſhbrook, ſhe intended to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him of his daughter's danger, and refer him to Sir Charles Bingle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"It is very uncertain indeed," anſwered ſhe.</p>

She accordingly put on her habit, and requeſted materials for writing from Emily, which were immediately brought, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily then retired till ſhe had written her letter. Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, left to herſelf, haſtily unlocked her little trunk, and

She was anxious to be gone, but thought it better to wait till towards evening, when there would be the leaſt chance of meeting Belgrave, who at that time would probably be fixed in ſome place for the remainder of the day. Emily returned in about an hour and finding Amanda diſengaged requeſted permiſſion to ſit with her. Amanda, in her preſent agitation, would have preferred ſolitude; but could not decline the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the affectionate girl, who in converſing with her ſought to forget the heavy cares which the dreadful idea of an union with Sipthorpe had drawn upon her. Amanda liſtened with a beating heart to every ſound, but no inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Belgrave's return reached her ear. At length
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:038416_0632_1011E703A72B5BE8"/>
they were ſummoned to dinner, but Amanda could not think of going to it, leſt ſhe ſhould be ſeen by him. To avoid this riſk, and alſo the particularity of a refuſal, ſhe determined immediately to go out, and having told Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her intention they both deſcended the ſtairs together. Emily preſſed her exceedingly to ſtay for dinner, but ſhe poſitively refuſed, and left the houſe with a beating heart, without having anſwered Emily's queſtion, who deſired to know if ſhe would not ſoon return? Thus perpetually threatened with danger, like a frighted bird, again was ſhe to ſeek a ſhelter for her innocent head.—She walked with quickneſs to Oxford-ſtreet, where ſhe directly procured a carriage, but was ſo weak and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the coachman was almoſt obliged to lift her into it. She directed it to the priſon, and on reaching it ſent for one of the turnkeys, to whom ſhe gave her letter for Ruſhbrook, with a particular charge, to deliver it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to him. She then ordered the carriage to Pall-Mall, where it may be remembered ſhe had once lodged with lady Greyſtock. This was the only lodging-houſe in London ſhe knew, and in it ſhe expected no ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but what would be derived from thinking herſelf ſafe, as its miſtreſs was a woman of a moſt unpleaſant temper. She had once been in affluent circumſtances, and the remembrance of thoſe circumſtances ſoured her temper, and rendered her, if not incapable of enjoying, at leaſt unwilling to acknowledge the bleſſings ſhe yet poſſeſſed, on any one in her power ſhe vented her ſpleen. Her chief purſuit was the gratification of a moſt inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate curioſity, and her firſt delight, relating the affairs, good or bad, which that curioſity dived into. Amanda, finding ſhe was at home, diſmiſſed the coach, and was ſhewn by the maid into the back parlour, where ſhe ſat. "Oh! dear!" cried ſhe, with a ſupercilious ſmile, the moment Amanda entered, without riſing from her chair to return her ſalute, "when did you return to London? and pray, may I aſk, what brought you back to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>
                     <p>Amanda was now convinced, from Mrs. Hanſard's altered manner, who had once been ſervile to a degree to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:038416_0633_1011E70646D803A0"/>
her, that ſhe was perfectly acquainted with her deſtitute condition, and a heavy ſigh burſt from her heart at the idea of aſſociating with a woman who had the meanneſs to treat her ill becauſe of that condition. A chilneſs crept through her frame when ſhe reflected that her ſad ſituation might long compel her to this. Sick, weak, exhauſted, ſhe ſunk upon a chair, which ſhe had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been offered nor deſired to take.</p>
                     <p>"Well, Miſs, and pray what is your buſineſs in town?" again aſked Mrs. Hanſard, with an increaſed degree of pertneſs.</p>
                     <p>"My buſineſs, Madam," replied Amanda, "can be of no conſequence to a perſon not connected with me. My buſineſs with you is to know whether you can accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate me with lodgings?" "Really; well you might have paid me the compliment of ſaying you would have called at any rate to know how I did. You may gueſs how greatly flattered an humble being like me would be by the notice of ſo amiable a young lady."</p>
                     <p>Theſe words were pronounced with a kind of ſneer, that, by rouſing the pride of Amanda, a little revived her ſpirits. "I ſhould be glad, Madam," ſaid ſhe, with a compoſed voice, while a faint glow ſtole over her cheek, "to know whether you can, or chuſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate me with lodgings?"</p>
                     <p>"Lord! my dear," replied Mrs. Hanſard, "do not be in ſuch a wondrous hurry; take a cup of tea with me, and then we will ſettle about that buſineſs." Theſe words implied, that ſhe would comply with the wiſh of Amanda, and however diſagreeable the aſylum, yet to have ſecured one, cheered her ſinking heart. Tea was ſoon made, which to Amanda, who had touched nothing ſince breakfaſt, and but little then, would have been a pleaſant refreſhment, had ſhe not been tormented and fatigued by the queſtions of Mrs. Hanſard, who laid a thouſand baits to betray her into a full confeſſion of what had brought her to London. Amanda, though a ſtranger in herſelf to every ſpecies of art, from fatal experience was aware of it in others, and therefore guarded her ſecret. Mrs. Hanſard, who loved what ſhe
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:038416_0634_1011E709012EC3D0"/>
called a goſſiping cup of tea, ſat a tedious time over the tea table. Amanda, at laſt mortified and alarmed by ſome expreſſions which dropped from her, again ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to aſk if ſhe could be lodged under her roof.</p>
                     <p>"Are you really ſerious in that queſtion?" ſaid Mrs. Hanſard. There was a certain expreſſion of contempt in her features as ſhe ſpoke, which ſhocked Amanda ſo much that ſhe had not power to reply: "becauſe if you are, my dear," continued Mrs. Hanſard, "you have more aſſurance than I thought y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Do you think I would ruin my houſe, which lodges people of the firſt rank and character, by admitting you into it; you who, it is well known, obtained Lady Greyſtock's protection from charity, and loſt it through miſconduct. Poor Lady, I had the whole ſtory from her own mouth. She ſuffered well by having any thing to ſay to you: I always gueſſed how it would be; notwithſtanding your demure look, I ſaw well enough how you would turn out. I aſſure you, to uſe your own words, if I could accommodate you in my houſe, it would not anſwer you at all, for there are no convenient cloſets in it, in which a lady of your diſpoſition might now and then want to hide a ſmart young fellow. I adviſe you, if you have had a tiff with any of your friends, to make up the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, though, indeed, if you do not, in ſuch a place as London you can never be at a loſs for ſuch friends. Perhaps you are now beginning to repent of your evil courſes, and if I took you into my houſe, I ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as much in my pocket, I ſuppoſe, as in my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter."</p>
                     <p>The terrified and diſtreſſed look with which Amanda liſtened to this ſpeech, would have ſtopped Mrs. Hanſard in the middle of it, had ſhe poſſeſſed a ſpark of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even if ſhe believed her (which was not the caſe) guilty; but loſt to the noble, the gentle feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, ſhe exulted in the triumph of malice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced to have an opportunity of piercing the panting heart of helpleſs innocence with the ſharp darts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and unmerited reproach. Amidſt the various ſhocks
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:038416_0635_1011E70CA3B5BD28"/>
Amanda had experienced in the ſhort but eventful courſe of her life, one greater than the preſent ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt—petrified by Mrs. Hanſard's words, it was ſome time ere ſhe had power to ſpeak. Gracious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!" exclaimed ſhe, looking up to that Heaven ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, and which ſhe now conſidered her only refuge from evil, "to what trials am I continually expoſſed, perſecuted, inſulted, ſhocked! Oh! what happineſs to lay my feeble frame, my woe-ſtruck heart, within that low aſylum, where malice could no more annoy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit no more betray me! I am happy," ſhe continued, ſtarting up, and looking at Mrs. Hanſard, "that the accommodation I deſired in this houſe you refuſed me, for I am now well convinced, from my knowledge of your diſpoſition, that the ſecurity my ſituation requires I ſhould not have found within it." She haſtily quitted the room, but on entering the hall her ſpirits entirely forſook her, at the dreadful idea of having no home to go to; overcome with horror, ſhe ſunk in a flood of tears upon one of the hall chairs. A maid, who had probably been liſtening to her miſtreſs's converſation, now came from a front parlour, and, as Mrs. Hanſard had ſhut the door after Amanda, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I promiſe you, if we minded her, we ſhould have red eyes here every day in the week. Do pray, Miſs, tell me if I can be of any ſervice to you?"</p>
                     <p>Amanda in a voice ſcarcely articulate, thanked her, and ſaid, "in a few minutes ſhe ſhould be better able to ſpeak." To ſeek lodgings at this late hour was not to be thought of, except ſhe wiſhed to run into the very dangers ſhe had wanted to avoid, and Mrs. Connel's houſe returned to her recollection, as the impoſſibility of procuring a refuge in any other was confirmed in her mind; ſhe began to think it could not be ſo dangerous as her fears in the morning had repreſented it to be; ere this ſhe thought Belgrave (for ſince the delivery of the letter there had been time enough for ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding)

might be baniſhed from it, if not, ſhe had a chance of concealing herſelf, and even if diſcovered, ſhe believed Mrs. Connel would protect her from his open inſults, whilſt ſhe truſted her own precaution would, under Heaven, defeat his ſecret ſchemes, ſhould he again contrive any; ſhe therefore reſolved, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſity compelled her, for could ſhe have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it, ſhe would not have done ſo, to return to Mrs. Connel's; ſhe accordingly requeſted the maid to procure her a carriage, and rewarded her for her trouble. As ſhe was returning to Mrs. Connel's, ſhe endeavoured to calm her ſpirits, and quell her apprehenſions. When the carriage ſtopped, and the maid appeared, ſhe could ſcarcely prevent herſelf ere ſhe alighted from enquiring whether any one but the family was within; conſcious, however, that ſuch a queſtion might create ſuſpicions, and that ſuſpicions would naturally excite enquiries, ſhe checked herſelf, and re-entered, though with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling limbs, that houſe from whence in the morning ſhe had fled with ſuch terror.</p>

                     <p>AMANDA had not reached the parlour when the door opened, and Mrs. Connel came from it. "Oh! oh! Miſs," cried ſhe, "ſo you are returned; I proteſt I was beginning to think you had ſtolen a march upon us." There was a rude bluntneſs in this ſpeech which
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:038416_0637_1011E711D17AA3D0"/>
confounded Amanda; and her mind miſgave her that all was not right. "Come," continued Mrs. Connel, "come in, Miſs, I aſſure you I have been very impatient for your return." Amanda's fears increaſed. She follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mrs. Connel in ſilence into the parlour, where ſhe beheld an elderly woman, of a pleaſing but emaciated appearance, who ſeemed in great agitation and diſtreſs: How ſhe could poſſibly have any thing to ſay to this woman ſhe could not conjecture, and yet an idea that ſhe had inſtantly darted into her mind, ſhe ſat down trembling in every limb, and waited with impatience for an explanation of this ſcence. After a general ſilence of a few minutes, the ſtranger looking at Amanda, ſaid, "My daughter, Madam, has informed me we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to your bounty, I am therefore happy at an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of diſcharging the debt. Theſe words an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Mrs. Ruſhbrook, but Amanda was confounded at her manner; its coldneſs and formality were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of diſlike and ſeverity, than of gentleneſs or gratitude. Mrs. Ruſhbrook roſe as ſhe ſpoke, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a note to her. Speechleſs from aſtoniſhment, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda had not power either to decline or accept it, and it was laid on a table before her.</p>
                     <p>"Allow me, Madam," ſaid Mrs. Ruſhbrook, as ſhe reſumed her ſeat, "to aſk if your real name is Donald?" Amanda's preſentiment of underhand doings was now verified; it was evident to her that their author was Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, and that he had been too ſucceſsful in contriving them.</p>
                     <p>Amanda now appeared to have reached the criſis of her fate; in all the various trials ſha had hitherto expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, ſhe had ſtill ſome ſtay, ſome hope, to ſupport her weakneſs, and ſoothe her ſorrows, when groaning under the injuries her character ſuſtained by the ſucceſs of an execrable plot, ſhe had the conſolation to think an idolizing father would ſhelter her from farther inſult; when deprived of that father, tender friends ſtepped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, who mingled tears of ſympathy with her's, and poured the balm of pity on her ſorrowing heart; when torn from the beloved object enſhrined within that heart

while her ſick ſoul languiſhed under the heavy burthen of exiſtence, again did the voice of friendſhip penetrate its gloom, and, though it could not remove, alleviated its ſufferings; now helpleſs, unprotected, ſhe ſaw a dreadful ſtorm ready to burſt over he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>You ſee," ſaid Mrs. Connel, after a long ſilence, "ſhe cannot brave this diſcovery."</p>
                     <p>Amanda raiſed her head at theſe words; ſhe had grown a little more compoſed. "The Being in whom I truſt," ſhe ſaid to herſelf, "and whom I never wilfully offended, will ſtill, I doubt not, as heretofore, protect me from danger." Mrs. Ruſhbrook's unanſwered queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill ſounded in her ear. "Allow me, Madam," ſhe cried, turning to her, "to aſk your reaſon for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring whether my real name is Donald?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, Lord! my dear," ſaid Mrs. Connel, addreſſing Mrs. Ruſhbrook," you need not peſter yourſelf or her with any more queſtions about the matter, her queſtion is an anſwer in itſelf."</p>
                     <p>"I am of your opinion, indeed," exclaimed Mrs. Ruſhbrook, "and think any farther enquiry needleſs."</p>
                     <p>"I acknowledge, Madam," ſaid Amanda, whoſe voice grew firmer from the conſciouſneſs of never hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acted improperly, "that my name is not Donald. I muſt alſo do myſelf the juſtice to declare (let me be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited or not) that my real one was not concealed from any motive which could deſerve reproach or cenſure.—My ſituation is peculiarly diſtreſſing.

"I do not want, Madam," replied Mrs. Ruſhbrook' "to enquire into your ſituation; you have been candid in one inſtance, I hope you will be eqally ſo in another. Pray, Madam," handing to Amanda the letter ſhe had written to Ruſhbrook, "is this your writing?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes Madam, anſwered Amanda, whoſe pride was rouſed by the contempt ſhe met, "it is my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting."</p>
                     <p>"And pray," ſaid Mrs. Ruſhbrook, looking ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly at her, while her voice grew more ſevere, "what was your motive for writing this letter?"</p>
                     <p>"I think Madam," cried Amanda, "the letter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that."</p>
                     <p>"A pretty explanation, truly! exclaimed Mrs. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; "and ſo you would try to villify the poor gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's character; but, Miſs we have had an explanation you little dream of; aye we found you out, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your ſlyneſs in writing like one of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's in a Novel, a bit of a letter without ever a name to it. Mr. Sipthorpe knew directly who it came from. Ah! poor gentleman he allowed you wit enough, a pity there is not more goodneſs with it; he knows you very well to his coſt."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid Amanda, "he knows I am a being whoſe happineſs he diſturbed, but whoſe innocence he never triumphed over.

She then proceeded to relate every thing ſhe knew concerning Belgrave; but ſhe had the mortification to find her ſhort and ſimple ſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with every mark of incredulity. "Beware, Madam," ſaid ſhe to Mrs. Ruſhbrook, "of this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, I adjure you beware of the conſequences of it; Oh! doom not your innocent, your reluctant Emily to deſtruction; draw not upon your own head by ſuch a deed horrible and excruciating anguiſh. Why does not Mr. Sipthorpe, if I muſt call him ſo, appear, and in my preſence ſupport his allegations?"</p>
                     <p>"I aſked him to do ſo," replied Mrs. Ruſhbrook; but he has feeling, and he wiſhed not to ſee your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, however merited it might be."</p>
                     <p>"No, Madam," cried Amanda, "he refuſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew that without ſhrinking he could not behold the innocence he has ſo abuſed, becauſe he knew the conſcious colouring of his cheek would betray the guilty feelings of his ſoul. Again I repeat he is not what he appears to be. I refer you for the truth of my words to Sir Charles Bingley; I feel for you, though you have not felt for me. I know from falſe repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you think me a poor miſguided creature; but was I even ſo, my too evident anguiſh might ſurely have excited pity.

Oh!

at theſe laſt words, and tears again trickled down her lovely cheeks; a faint glow tinged the pale cheek of Mrs. Ruſhbrook at Amanda's accuſation of unkindneſs; ſhe bent her eyes to the ground as if conſcious it was merited, and it was many minutes ere ſhe could again look on the trembling creature before her. "Perhaps," ſaid ſhe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"For my part I wonder you ſpoke ſo mildly to her," exclaimed Mrs. Connel: "I proteſt in future I ſhall be guarded who I admit into my houſe. I declare ſhe ſeemed ſo diſtreſſed at the idea of going amongſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that ſooner than let her do ſo, I believe, if Miſs Emily had not, I ſhould have offered her part of my bed; but this diſtreſs was all a pretext to get into the houſe with Mr. Sipthorpe, that ſhe might try to entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle him in her ſnares again. Well, I am determined ſhe ſhall not ſtay another night under my roof. Aye, you may ſtare as you pleaſe, Miſs, but you ſhall march directly; you are not ſo ignorant about London, I dare ſay, as you pretend to be."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Connel roſe as ſhe ſpoke, and approached her with a look, which ſeemed to ſay ſhe would put her threat into execution. It was Amanda's intention to quit the houſe the next morning; but to be turned from it at ſuch an hour, a wanderer in the ſtreet, the idea was replete with horror!"—She ſtarted up, and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few paces, looked at Mrs. Connel with a kind of melancholy wildneſs. "Yes," repeated Mrs. Connel, "I ſay you ſhall march directly." The wretched Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's head grew giddy, her ſight failed, her limbs refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſupport her, and ſhe would have fallen to the ground, had not Mrs. Ruſhbrook, who perceived her ſituation, timely caught her. She was replaced in a chair, and water ſprinkled on her face: "Be compoſed, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Ruſhbrook, whoſe ſoftened voice proclaimed the return of her compaſſion, "you ſhall not leave this houſe to night, I promiſe in the name of

                     <p>"Aye, Lord knows good nature is my foible," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Mrs. Connel; "ſo Miſs, as Mrs. Ruſhbrook has promiſed, you may ſtay here to night." Amanda opened her languid eyes, and raiſing her head from Mrs. Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook's boſom, ſaid in a low tremulous voice, "To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, Madam I ſhall depart. Oh! would to Heaven," cried ſhe, claſping her hands together, and burſting into an agony of tears, "before to-morrow I could be rid of the heavy burthen that oppreſſes me!</p>
                     <p>"Well, we have had wailing and weeping enough to night," ſaid Mrs. Connel, "ſo, Miſs you may take one of the candles off the table, and go to your chamber if you chuſe."</p>
                     <p>Amanda did not require to have this permiſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. She aroſe, and taking the light left the parlour.

"Oh! dear ma'am," cried ſhe, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Amanda, "I declare it quite grieves me to ſee you in ſuch a ſituation. Poor Miſs Emily is in juſt as ſad a plight. Well, it is no matter, but I think both the old ladies will be puniſhed for plaguing you in this manner. Madam Ruſhbrook will be ſorry enough, when, after giving her daughter to Mr. Sipthorpe, ſhe finds he is not what he ſeems to be." Amanda ſhrunk with horror from the idea of Emily's deſtruction, and by a motion of her hand ſignified to the maid her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the ſubject. "Well, Ma'am," ſhe continued, "Miſs Emily, as I was ſaying, is quite in as bad a plight as yourſelf; they have clapped her into my miſtreſs's chamber, which ſhe durſt not leave without running the riſk of bringing their tongues upon her: However ſhe contrived to ſee me, and ſent you this note.

"Why Ma'am," ſaid the maid, "I have a ſiſter who is houſe maid at a very grand place on the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond road. All the family are now gone to Brighton, and ſhe is left alone in the houſe, where you would be very welcome to take up your reſidence till you could get one to your mind. My ſiſter is a ſage ſober body, and would do every thing in her power to pleaſe and oblige you, and you would be as ſnug and ſecure with her as in a houſe of your own; and poor Miſs Emily begged you would go to her, till you could get lodgings with people whoſe characters you know, and indeed, Ma'am, it is my humble opinion it would be ſafe and pleaſant for you to do ſo, and if you conſent I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you there to-morrow morning, and I am ſure, Ma'am, I ſhall be happy if I have the power of ſerving you." Like the Lady in Comus, Amanda might have ſaid,
<q>
                           <l>I take thy word</l>
                           <l>And truſt thy honeſt offer'd courteſy;</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>To take refuge in this manner in any one's houſe was truly repugnant to the feelings of Amanda; but ſad ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity conquered her ſcrupulous delicacy, and ſhe aſked the maid "at what hour in the mourning ſhe ſhould be ready for her?"</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall come to you, Ma'am," anſwered ſhe, "as ſoon as I think there is a carriage on the ſtand, and then we can go together to get one; but I proteſt, Ma'am, you look ſadly; I wiſh you would allow me to aſſiſt in undreſſing you, for I am ſure you want a little reſt; I dare ſay, for all my miſtreſs ſaid, if you choſe it, I could get a little wine from her to make whey for you." A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda refuſed this, but accepted her offer of aſſiſtance, for ſhe was ſo overpowered by the ſcenes of the day, as
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:038416_0645_1011E722457EEBE0"/>
to be almoſt unequal to any exertion. The maid retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after ſhe had ſeen her to bed. Amanda entreated her to be punctual to an early hour and alſo requeſted her to give her moſt affectionate love to Miſs Ruſhbrook, and her ſincere thanks for the kind ſolicitude ſhe had expreſſed about her. Her reſt was now as on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The maid came to her ſoon after ſhe was dreſſed, and ſhe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately accompanied her down ſtairs, trembling as ſhe went, leſt Belgrave ſhould ſuddely make his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and either prevent her departure, or follow her to her new reſidence. She left the houſe, however, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting any creature, and ſoon obtained the ſhelter of a carriage.</p>
                     <p>As they proceeded Amanda beſought the maid, who ſeemed perfectly acquainted with every thing relative to Belgrave, to tell Miſs Ruſhbrook to believe her aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt him, if ſhe wiſhed to ſave herſelf from deſtruction. The maid aſſured her ſhe would, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhe always ſuſpected Mr. Sipthorpe was not as good as he ſhould be. Amanda ſoon found herſelf at the end of her little journey. The houſe was elegant and ſpacious, with a ſhort avenue before it, planted with cheſnuts. The maid's ſiſter was an elderly plain-look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman, who received Amanda with every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reſpect, and conducted her into a handſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, where a neat breakfaſt was laid out. "I took care, Ma'am, ſaid the maid, ſmiling, "to appriſe my ſiſter laſt night of the honour ſhe was to have this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I am ſure ſhe will do every thing in her power to oblige you."</p>
                     <p>"I thank you both," cried Amanda, with her uſual ſweetneſs; but while ſhe ſpoke a ſtraggling tear ſtole down her lovely cheek at the idea of that forlorn ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had thus caſt her upon the kindneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="5 letters">

In the mean time I muſt inſiſt on making ſome recompence for the attention I have received, and the expence I have put you to." She accordingly forced a preſent upon each, for both the women appeared unwilling to accept them, and Mrs. Deborah, the maid's ſiſter, ſaid "it was quite unneceſſary at preſent to think of leaving the houſe, as the family would not return to it for ſix weeks."—Amanda, however was reſolved on doing what ſhe had ſaid, as ſhe could not conquer the repugnance ſhe felt to continue in a ſtrangers houſe. Mrs. Connel's maid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in a few minutes; of the breakfaſt prepared for her, Amanda could only take ſome tea; her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

She was immediately conducted to an elegant chamber, where Mrs. Deborah left her, ſaying, "ſhe would prepare ſome little nice thing for her dinner, which ſhe hoped would tempt her to eat."</p>

Mrs. Deborah came up two or three times to know how ſhe was, and at laſt appeared with dinner. She laid a ſmall table by the bedſide, and beſought Amanda to riſe and try to eat; there was a friendlineſs in her manner, which recalled to Amanda's recollection her faithful nurſe Edwin, and ſhe ſighed to think that the ſhelter of her humble cottage ſhe could no more enjoy (ſhould ſuch a ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

to be alone, ſaid ſhe would no longer detain her; yet no ſooner was ſhe alone than ſhe found ſolitude inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſhe could not ſleep, the anguiſh of her mind was ſo great, and aroſe with the idea that a walk in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den might be of uſe to her. As ſhe was deſcending the ſtairs ſhe heard, notwithſtanding the door was ſhut, a man's voice from a front parlour. She ſtarted, for ſhe thought it was a voice familiar to her ear; with a light foot and throbbing heart ſhe turned into a parlour at the foot of the ſtairs which communicated with the other. Here ſhe liſtened, and ſoon had her fears confirmed by recollecting the voice to be that of Belgrave's ſervant, whom ſhe had often ſeen in Devonſhire. She liſtened with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Aye, I aſſure you," cried the man, "we are blown up at Mrs. Connel's, but that is of little conſequence to us; the Colonel thinks the game now in view better than that he has loſt, ſo to night you may expect him in a chaiſe and four to carry off your fair gueſt."</p>
                     <p>"I declare I am glad of it," ſaid Mrs. Deborah; "for I think ſhe will die ſoon."</p>
                     <p>"Die ſoon! repeated he. "Oh! yes indeed; great danger of that; and he added ſomething elſe, which being delivered with a violent burſt of laughter, Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da could not hear; ſhe thought ſhe heard them moving towards the door; ſhe inſtantly ſlipped from the parlour, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In a few minutes ſhe heard them coming into the hall, and the man ſoftly let out by Mrs. Deborah. Amanda now entered the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and cloſed the door, and knowing a guilty conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is eaſily alarmed, ſhe threw herſelf on the bed, leſt Mrs. Deborah, if ſhe found her up, ſhould have her ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions awakened. Her deſperate ſituation inſpired her with ſtrength and courage, and ſhe truſted, by preſence of mind, to be able to extricate herſelf from it; it was her intention, if ſhe effected her eſcape, to proceed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to London, though the idea of entering it without

a certain place to go to, was ſhocking to her imagination yet ſhe thought it a more ſecure place for her than any of the neighbouring cottages, which might be ſearched. Mrs. Deborah, as ſhe expected, ſoon came up to her—Amanda involuntarily ſhuddered at her appearance, but knowing her ſafety depended on the concealment of her feelings, ſhe forced herſelf to converſe with the treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous creature. She at laſt aroſe from the bed, declaring ſhe had indulged her langour too much, and after a few turns about the room, went to the window, and pretended to be engroſſed in admiring the garden. "There is a great deal of fruit in the garden" ſaid ſhe, turning to Mrs. Deborah; "if I did not think it encroaching too much on your kindneſs, I ſhould aſk you for a nectarine or two"</p>
                     <p>"Dear Ma'am," replied Mrs. Deborah, "you are heartily welcome. I declare I ſhould have offered them to you, only I thought you would like a turn in the garden and pull them yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"No," ſaid Amanda, "I cannot at preſent." Mrs. Deborah went off, and Amanda watched at the window till ſhe ſaw her at the very end of the garden; ſhe then ſnatched up her hat, and tied it on with a handkerchief, better to conceal her face, then haſtily deſcended the ſtairs, and locked the back door to prevent an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate purſuit. She ran down the avenue, nor flagged in her courſe till ſhe had got ſome paces from it; ſhe was then compelled to do ſo, as much from weakneſs as from fear of attracting notice, if ſhe went on in ſuch a wild manner. She ſtarted at the ſound of every carriage, and haſtily averted her head as they paſſed; but ſhe reached London without any alarm but what her own fears gave her. The hour was now late and gloomy, and warned Amanda of the neceſſity there was for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions to procure a lodging. Some poor women ſhe ſaw retiring from their little fruit ſtands drew a ſhower of tears from her, to think her ſituation was more wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than theirs, whom but a few days before ſhe ſhould have conſidered as objects of compaſſion. She knew at ſuch an hour ſhe would only be received into houſes of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:038416_0649_1011E72D2F507510"/>
an inferior deſcription, and looked for one in which ſhe could think there might be a chance of gaining admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. She at laſt came to a ſmall mean looking houſe: "This humble roof, I think," cried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She turned into the ſhop, where butter and cheeſe were diſplayed, and where an elderly woman ſat knitting behind the counter. She roſe immediately, as if from ſurpriſe and reſpect at Amanda's appearance, who in univerſal agitation leaned againſt the door for ſupport, unable for ſome minutes to ſpeak. At laſt, in faultering accents, whilſt over her pale face a crimſon bluſh was diffuſed, ſhe ſaid, "I ſhould be glad to know if you have any lodgings to let?"</p>
                     <p>The woman inſtantly dropped into her ſeat, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtedfaſtly at Amanda, "This is a ſtrange hour," cried ſhe, "for any decent body to come looking for lodgings!"</p>
                     <p>"I am as ſenſible of that as you can be," ſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda; "but peculiar circumſtances have obliged me to it: if you can accommodate me, I can aſſure you you will not have reaſon to repent doing ſo."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! I do not know how that may be," cried ſhe; "it is natural for a body to ſpeak a good word for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; however, if I do let you a room, for I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one to ſpare, I ſhall expect to be paid for it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand"</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall indeed," ſaid Amanda.</p>
                     <p>"Well, I will ſhew it you," ſaid ſhe. She accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly called a little girl to watch the ſhop, and taking a candle went up, before Amanda, a narrow winding flight o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She tried to ſubdue the diſguſt it inſpired her with, by reflecting that, after the imminent danger ſhe had eſcaped, ſhe ſhould be happy to procure any aſylum ſhe could conſider ſafe; ſhe alſo tried to reconcile herſelf to it, by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in the morning ſhe ſhould quit it.</p>
                     <p>"Well, Ma'am," ſaid the woman, the price of this room is neither more nor leſs than one guinea per week,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038416_0650_1011E731CCE6A490"/>
and if you do not like it, you are very welcome not to ſtay."</p>
                     <p>"I have no objection to the price," replied Amanda; "but I hope you have quiet people in the houſe."</p>
                     <p>"I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I am glad to hear it," anſwered Amanda, "and I hope you are not offended by the enquiry." She now put her hand in her pocket for the purſe, to give the expected guinea; but the purſe was not there. She ſat down on the ſide of the bed and ſearched the other, but with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Now—now," cried ſhe, claſping her hands together, in an agony which precluded reflection, "now—now, I am loſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! My purſe is ſtolen," ſhe continued, "and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give you the promiſed guinea."</p>
                     <p>"No, nor never could, I ſuppoſe," exclaimed the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Ah! I ſuſpected all along what you were; and ſo you were glad my houſe had a good name? I ſhall take care it does not loſe that name by lodging you."</p>
                     <p>"I conjure you, cried Amanda, ſtarting up and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hand on the woman's, "I conjure you to let me ſtay this night; you will not, you ſhall not loſe by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo.

                     <p>"Your trunk!" replied the woman, in a ſcornful tone, "oh! yes, you have a trunk with things of value in it as much as you have a purſe in your pocket. A pretty ſtory indeed; but I know too much of the ways of the world to be deceived now a days—ſo march directly."</p>
                     <p>Amanda again began to entreat, but the woman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted her, and declared, "if ſhe did not depart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſhe would be ſorry for it."—Amanda inſtantly ceaſed her importunities, and in trembling ſilence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her down ſtairs.—Oppreſſed with weakneſs ſhe involuntarily heſitated in the ſhop, which the woman perceiving, ſhe rudely ſeized her, and puſhing her from it ſhut the door. Amanda could not now, as in former

exigencies, conſider what was to be done. Alas! if even capable of reflection, it could have ſuggeſted no plan, which there was a hope of accompliſhing, the powers of her mind were overwhelmed with horror and anguiſh; ſhe moved mechanically along, nor ſtopped, till from weakneſs ſhe ſunk upon the ſtep of a door, againſt which ſhe leaned her head in a kind of letharg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>; but from this ſhe was ſuddenly rouſed by two men who ſtopped before her. Death alone could have conquered her terrors of Belgrave. She inſtantly concluded theſe to be him and his man. She ſtarted up, uttered a faint ſcream, and, calling upon heaven to defend her, was ſpringing paſt them, when her hand was ſuddenly caught. She made a feeble but unſucceſsful effort to diſengage it, and overcome by terror and weakneſs, fell though not fainting, unable to ſupport herſelf, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the boſom of him who had arreſted her courſe:—"Gracious Heaven!" cried he, "I have heard that voice before."</p>
                     <p>Amanda raiſed her head:—"Sir Charles Bingley!" ſhe exclaimed. The feelings of joy, ſurpriſe, and ſhame, that pervaded her whole ſoul, and thrilled through her frame, were in its preſent weak ſtate too much for it, and ſhe again ſunk upon his ſhoulder. The joy of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected protection, for protection ſhe was convinced ſhe would receive from Sir Charles Bingley, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by reflecting on the injurious ideas her preſent ſituation muſt excite in his mind, ideas ſhe feared ſhe ſhould never be able to remove, ſo ſtrongly were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances againſt her.</p>

                     <p>"Miſs Fitzalan," cried Sir Charles, after the ſilence of a minute, "you are ill, allow me to have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing you home."</p>
                     <p>"Home!" repeated Amanda, in the ſlow and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low voice of deſpair, and raiſing her languid head, "Alas! I have no home to go to."</p>
                     <p>Every ſurmiſe of horror which Sir Charles had formed from ſeeing her in her preſent ſituation was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. He groaned—he ſhuddered, and ſcarcely able to ſtand was obliged to lean with the lovely burthen he ſupported againſt the rails. He beſought his friend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to procure a chair, or coach, in which he might have her conveyed to a houſe where he knew he could gain her admittance. Touched by his diſtreſs, and the powerful impulſe of humanity, his friend inſtantly went to comply with his requeſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſilence of Amanda Sir Charles imputed to ſhame and illneſs, and grief and delicacy forbad him to notice it. His friend returned in a few minutes with a coach, and Sir Charles then found that Amanda's ſilence did not altogether proceed from the motives he had aſcribed it to, for ſhe had fainted on his boſom. She was lifted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the carriage, and he again received her in his arms. On the carriage ſtopping he committed her to the care of his friend, whilſt he ſtepped into the houſe to procure her a reception.

He had previouſly informed them of the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:038416_0653_1011E737ACB461B8"/>
ſituation in which he found her, little ſuſpecting at the time ſhe was the Miſs Donald they mentioned being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch obligations to.</p>
                     <p>"It is I, it is I," cried Mrs. Ruſhbrook, gazing on her with mingled horror and anguiſh, "it is I have been the occaſion of her diſtreſs, and never ſhall I forgive myſelf for it.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my preſerver, my friend, my benefactreſs," ſaid Emily, claſping her in an agony of tears to her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, "is it thus your Emily beholds you!" Amanda was laid upon a couch, and her h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t being removed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played a face which, with the paleneſs of death, had all the wildneſs of deſpair, a wildneſs that denoted more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſively than language could have done the conflicts her ſpirit had endured; heavy ſighs announced her hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recovered from her fainting fit; but her eyes ſtill continued cloſed, and her head too weak to be ſelf ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, reſted againſt the arm of the couch. Mrs. Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook and her daughter hung over her in inexpreſſible agonies. "If they were thus affected, oh! how was Sir Charles Bingley diſtreſſed: Oh! how was the heart, which loved her with the moſt impaſſioned tenderneſs, agonized." As he bent over the couch, the big tear trickled down his manly cheek and fell upon the cold pale face he contemplated. He ſoftly aſked himſelf, "Is this Amanda! Is this ſhe, whom but a ſhort time ago I beheld moving with unequalled elegance, adorned with unrivalled beauty, whom my heart worſhipped as the firſt of women, and ſought to unite its deſtiny to as the ſureſt means of rendering that deſtiny happy? Oh! what a change is here! How feeble is that form—how hollow is that cheek—how heavy are thoſe eyes, whoſe languid glance ſpeak incurable anguiſh of ſoul! Oh, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda! was the being preſent, who firſt led you into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, what horror and remorſe muſt ſeize his ſoul at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſequence of that error!" "Has this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py young creature," aſked Ruſhbrook, who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the couch, and viewed her with the trueſt pity, "no connexions that could be prevailed on to ſave her."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="unknown:038416_0654_1011E73B67BDCC30"/>
"None that I know of," replied Sir Charles; "her parents are both dead."</p>
                     <p>"Happy are the parents," reſumed Ruſhbrook, "who ſhrouded in the duſt, cannot ſee the misfortunes of their children—the fall of ſuch a child as this!" glancing his tearful eyes as he ſpoke on his daughters.</p>
                     <p>"And pray, Sir," ſaid Mrs. Connel, who was chafing her temples with lavender, "if ſhe recovers, what is to become of her?</p>
                     <p>"It ſhall be my care," cried Sir Charles, "to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an aſylum. Yes, Amanda," he continued, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her with an expreſſion of mingled tenderneſs and grief, "he that muſt for ever mourn thy fate, will try to mitigate it; but does ſhe not want medical aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance!"</p>
                     <p>"I think not," replied Mrs. Connel; "it is want of nouriſhment and reſt has thrown her into her preſent ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,"</p>
                     <p>"Want of nouriſhment and reſt!" repeated Sir Charles: "Good Heavens!" continued he, in the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den agony of his ſoul, (and walking from the couch) "is it poſſible that Amanda was a wanderer in the ſtreets, without food, or a place to lay her head in?—Oh! this is dreadful!—Oh! my friends," he proceeded, looking around him, whilſt his eyes beamed the divine compaſſion of his ſoul, "be kind, be careful of this poor creature; but it is unneceſſary to exhort you to this, and excuſe me for having done ſo. Yes, I know you will delight in binding up a broken heart, and drying the tears of a wretched outcaſt. A ſhort time ago, and ſhe appeared"—he ſtopped, overcome by his emotions, and turned away his head to wipe away his tears; "a ſhort time ago," he reſumed, "and ſhe appeared all that the heart of man could deſire, all that a woman ſhould wiſh and ought to be. Now ſhe is fallen indeed, loſt to herſelf and to the world."</p>
                     <p>"No," cried Emily, with generous warmth, ſtarting from the ſide of the couch at which ſhe had been kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "I am confident ſhe never was guilty of an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="unknown:038416_0655_1011E73E043A0BE8"/>
"I am inclined, indeed, to be of Emily's opinion," ſaid Mrs. Ruſhbrook. "I think the monſter, who ſpread ſuch a ſnare for her diſtruction, traduced Miſs Donald, in order to drive her from thoſe who would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her from his ſchemes."</p>
                     <p>"Would to Heaven the truth of your conjectures could be proved," exclaimed Sir Charles. Again he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the couch; Amanda remained in the ſame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but ſeeing her eyes open, he took her cold hand, and, in a ſoothing voice, aſſured her ſhe was ſafe; but the aſſurance had no effect on her; her's like the dull cold ear of death, was inſenſible of ſound, a faint ſpark of life ſeemed only quivering through her woe worn frame. "She is gone!" cried Sir Charles, preſſing her hand between his; "ſhe is gone, indeed! Oh, ſweet Amanda! the mortal bounds that encloſe thy afflicted ſpirit will ſoon be broken."</p>
                     <p>"I truſt not, Sir," exclaimed Capt. Ruſhbrook; his wife and daughter were unable to ſpeak. "In my opinion ſhe had better be removed to bed."</p>
                     <p>Amanda was accordingly carried to a chamber, and Sir Charles remained in the drawing room till Mrs. Ruſhbrook had returned to it. She informed him Miſs Donald continued in the ſame ſtate. He deſired a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician might be ſent for, and departed in inexpreſſible dejection.</p>

                     <p>WE ſhall now account for the incidents in the laſt Chapter. Amanda's letter to the Ruſhbrooks filled them with ſurpriſe and conſternation. Mrs. Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook directly repaired to Mrs. Connel, who without he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:038416_0656_1011E7411A9701C0"/>
gave it as her opinion, that the whole was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brication, invented by malice to ruin Sipthorpe in their opinion, or elſe by envy to prevent their enjoying the good fortune which he offered to their acceptance.—Mrs. Ruſhbrook was inclined to be of the ſame opinion; her mind was ſenſibly affected by the favours Sipthorpe had conferred on her family, and yielding to its grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſhe reſolved to be guided implicitly by her friend, who adviſed her to ſhew the letter to him. She conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this the beſt meaſure ſhe could purſue; if innocent, he would be pleaſed by the confidence repoſed in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; if guilty, his confuſion muſt betray him; but Belgrave was guarded againſt detection; his ſervant had ſeen Amanda as ſhe was alighting from the coach the evening ſhe arrived in town. He inquired from the maid concerning her, and learned that ſhe was to lodge in the houſe, and go by her aſſumed name. Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he related to his maſter the moment he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, who was tranſported at the intelligence; from her change of name he ſuppoſed her not only in deep diſtreſs, but removed from the protection of her friends, and he determined not to looſe ſo favourable an opportunity as the preſent for ſecuring her in his power. He inſtantly reſolved to relinquiſh his deſigns on Emily; deſigns which her beautiful ſimplicity and deſtitute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had ſuggeſted, and to turn all his thoughts on Amanda, who had ever been the firſt object of his wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. His pride, as well as love, was intereſted in again enſnaring her, as he had been mortified by her ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully baffling all his ſtratagems; he knew not of the manner ſhe had left his houſe. Half diſtracted at what he ſuppoſed her eſcape from it, he had followed her to Ireland, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained incognito near the Convent till the appearance of Mortimer convinced him any ſchemes he formed againſt her muſt prove abortive; but to concert a plan about ſecuring her required ſome deliberations, ere he could deviſe one, he was ſummoned to Mrs. Connel's parlour to peruſe the letter, and from the hand, as well as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, inſtantly knew Amanda to be its author. With
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:038416_0657_1011E7454B5C14C0"/>
the daring effrontery of vice, he directly declared ſhe was a diſcarded miſtreſs of his, who from jealouſy had taken this ſtep to prevent, if poſſible, his union. He aſſured them her real name was not Donald, bid them tax her with that deceit, and judge from her confuſion whether ſhe was not guilty of that, as well as every thing elſe, he alledged againſt her. His unembarraſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner had the appearance of innocence to his too credulous auditors, prejudiced as they were already in his favour, and in their minds he was now fully acquitted of his imputed crimes. He was now careleſs whether Amanda ſaw him or not (for he had before ſtolen into the houſe) being well convinced, nothing ſhe could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge againſt him would be credited. When night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached without bringing her, he grew alarmed, left he had loſt her again. At laſt her return relieved him from this fear. The converſation which paſſed in the parlour he heard through means of his ſervant, who had liſtened to it. The mention of Amanda's removal in the morning made him immediately conſult this ſervant about meaſures for ſecuring her, and he, with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the maid, contrived the ſcheme which has been already related, having forged the letter in Emily's name. But how inadequate is language to deſcribe the rage that took poſſeſſion of his ſoul, when going at the appointed hour to carry Amanda off, he found her already gone. He raved, curſed, ſtamped, and accuſed the woman and his ſervant of being privy to her eſcape. In vain Mrs. Deborah told him of the trick ſhe had played on her, and how ſhe had been obliged to get into the houſe through the window. He continued his accuſations, which ſo provoked his ſervant, conſcious of their unjuſtneſs, that he at laſt replied to them with inſolence.—This, in the preſent ſtate of Belgrave's mind, was not to be borne, and he immediately ſtruck him over the forehead with his ſword, and with a violence which felled him to the earth. Scarcely had he obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ere he repented this impulſe of paſſion, which ſeemed attended with fatal conſequences, for the man gave no ſymptoms of exiſtence. Conſideration for his own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:038416_0658_1011E746D9CCCC20"/>
was more prevalent in his mind than any feeling of humanity, and he inſtantly ruſhed from the houſe, ere the woman was ſufficiently recovered from her horror and amazement, to be able to call to the other ſervants, as ſhe afterwards did, to ſtop him. He fled to town, and haſtened to an hotel in Pall Mall, from whence he determined to hire a carriage for Dover, and thence em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark for the Continent. Aſcending the ſtairs he met a man of all others he would have wiſhed to avoid, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sir Charles Bingley. He ſtarted, but it was too late to retreat. He then endeavoured to ſhake off his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment, from a faint hope that Sir Charles had not heard of his villainous deſign upon Miſs Ruſhbrook; but this hope vaniſhed the moment Sir Charles addreſſed him who with coldneſs and contempt, ſaid, "he would be glad to ſpeak to him for a few minutes;" but ere we relate their converſation it is neceſſary to relate a few particulars of the Ruſhbrooks.</p>
                     <p>Captain Ruſhbrook, from knowing more of the deceits of mankind than his wife, was leſs credulous! the more he reflected on the letter, the more he felt doubts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding on his mind, and he reſolved ſooner to forfeit the friendſhip of Sipthorpe than permit any farther inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between him and his daughter, till thoſe doubts were removed. He ſent his ſon to Sir Charles's agent, and had the ſatisfaction of hearing he was then in town, and lodged at an hotel in Pall Mall. He immediately wrote to Sir Charles, and requeſted to ſee him whenever he was at leiſure, adding, he was well convinced his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence would excuſe the liberty he had taken, when informed of the purpoſe for which his viſit was requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Sir Charles was fortunately within, and directly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended little Ruſhbrook to the priſon. The letter had filled him with ſurpriſe, but that ſurpriſe gave way the moment he entered the wretched apartment of Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook, to the powerful emotions of pity; a ſcene more diſtreſſing he had never ſeen, or could not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. He ſaw the emaciated form of the ſoldier, for ſuch his dreſs announced him, ſeated beſide a dying fire, his little children ſurrounding him, whoſe faded counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:038416_0659_1011E748686961F8"/>
denoted their keen participation of his grief, and the ſad partner of his miſery bending her eyes upon thoſe children with mingled love and ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook was unable to ſpeak for a few minutes after his entrance. When he recovered his voice, he thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for the kind attention he had paid his requeſt, briefly informed him of the motives for that requeſt, and ended by putting Amanda's letter into his hand. Sir Charles peruſed it with horror and amazement: "Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heaven!" he exclaimed, "what a monſter! I know not the lady who has referred you to me, but I can teſtify the truth of her allegations. I am ſhocked to think ſuch a monſter as Belgrave exiſts.</p>
                     <p>Shocked at the idea of the deſtruction ſhe was ſo near devoting her daughter to, diſappointed in the hopes ſhe entertained of having her family liberated from priſon, and ſtruck with remorſe for her conduct to Amanda, Mrs Ruſhbrook fell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ainting to the floor, overpowered by her painful emotions; Sir Charles aided in raiſing her from it, for the trembling hand of Ruſhbrook refuſed its aſſiſtance. "Unhappy woman!" he exclaimed, "the diſappointment of her hopes is too much for her feeble frame." Water, the only reſtorative in the room, being ſprinkled in her face, ſhe ſlowly revived, and the firſt object ſhe beheld was the pale and weeping Emily, whom her father had inſiſted on being brought to the priſon. "Oh my child," ſhe cried, claſping her to her boſom, "can you forgive the mother who was ſo near devoting you to deſtruction? Oh! my children for your ſake, how near was I ſacrificing this dear, this precious girl! I bluſh, I ſhudder, when I reflect on my conduct to the unhappy young creature, who, like her guardian angel; interpoſed between my child and ruin; but theſe dreary walls," ſhe continued, burſting into an agony of tears, "which now we muſt never hope to paſs, will hide my ſhame and ſorrows together!"</p>
                     <p>"Do not deſpair, my dear Madam," ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ir Charles, in the ſoft accent of benevolence, "nor do you," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, turning to Ruſhbrook, "deem me imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in inquiring into thoſe ſorrows." His accent, his
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:038416_0660_1011E74C5C3C16A0"/>
manner, were ſo ſoothing, that theſe children of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who had long been ſtrangers to the voice of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gave him, with tears and ſighs, a ſhort relation of their ſorrows. He heard them with deep attention, and when he departed gave them ſuch a ſmile, as we may ſuppoſe would beam from an angel, if ſent by Heaven to pour the balm of comfort and mercy over the ſorrows of a burſting heart.</p>
                     <p>He returned early in the morning: how bright, how animated was his countenance! O ye ſons of riot and extravagance! ye children of diſſipation! never did ye experience a pleaſure equal to his, when he entered the apartment of Ruſhbrook to inform him he was free; when in the impaſſioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet faltering accents of ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he communicated the joyful tidings, and heard the little children repeat his words, while their parents gazed on each other with ſurpriſe and rapture.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook at length attempted to pour out the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart, but Sir Charles ſtopped him. "Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a fortune," cried he, "beyond my wants, to what nobler purpoſe could ſuperfluous wealth be devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than to the enlargement of a man who has ſerved his country, and who has a family, which he may bring up to act as he has done. May the reſtoration of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be productive of every happineſs! Your priſon gates, I rejoice to repeat it, are open; may the friendſhip which commenced within theſe walls be laſting as our lives!" To dwell longer on this ſubject is unneceſſary. The tranſported family were conveyed to Mrs. Connel's where he had been the preceding night to order every thing for their reception. He then had enquired about Sipthorpe, or rather Belgrave, whom he meant to upbraid for his cruel deſigns againſt Miſs Ruſhbrook; but Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, as ſoon as his plan was ſettled about Amanda, had quitted Mrs. Connel's. The joy of the Ruſhbrooks was greatly damped the next morning on hearing of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret departure of Amanda. What Belgrave had ſaid againſt her they never would have credited, but for the appearance of myſtery which enveloped her, ſtill her amiable attention to them merited their trueſt gratitude,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:038416_0661_1011E75050E6C070"/>
they wiſhed to have expreſſed that gratitude to her, and offer her their ſervices. Much as appearances were againſt Amanda, yet from the very moment Mrs. Ruſhbrook declared it her idea that Belgrave had traduced her for the purpoſe of depriving her of protection, a ſimilar idea ſtarted in Sir Charles's mind, and he reſolved to ſeek Belgrave, and never reſt till he had diſcovered whether there was any truth in his aſſertions againſt Amanda. Their meeting at the hotel was conſidered as fortunate as unexpected by him; yet could he not diſguiſe for a moment the contempt his character inſpired him with. He reproached hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"You are," continued Sir Charles, "not only the violator, but the defamer of female innocence; I am well convinced, from reflection on paſt and preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that your allegations agaiſt Miſs Fitzalan were as falſe as vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"Oh, Belgrave!" cried Sir Charles, "can you think without remorſe of having deſtroyed not only the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but the exiſtence of an amible young creature."</p>
                     <p>"The exiſtence! repeated Belgrave, ſtarting, and with a kind of horror in his look, "what do you mean?"</p>
                     <p>"I mean that Amanda Fitzalan, involved through your means in a variety of wretchedneſs ſhe was unable to ſupport, is now on her death bed!—Belgrave chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed colour, trembled, and in an agitated voice demanded an explanation of Sir Charles's words.</p>

horror, and enervated with fear, at the idea of the crime he had recently committed, could make no oppoſition to the grief he experienced on hearing of her ſituation, a grief heightened almoſt to diſtraction, by reflecting that he was acceſſary to it. "Dying!" he repeated, "A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda Fitzalan dying! but ſhe will be happy; her's will be a pure and miniſtering ſpirit in Heaven, while mine lies howling; the angels are not purer in mind and perſon than ſhe is!"</p>
                     <p>"Then you are an execrable villain!" exclaimed Sir Charles, laying his hand on his ſword.</p>
                     <p>"Strike!" exclaimed Belgrave, with an air of wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; "death will rid me of horrors; death from you will be better than the ignominious one which now ſtares me in the face; for I have—oh! horrible—this night I have committed murder!"</p>
                     <p>Aſtoniſhed and diſmayed, Sir Charles gazed on him with earneſtneſs.</p>
                     <p>"It is true!" continued he, in the ſame wild manner, "it is true! therefore ſtrike! but againſt you I will not raiſe my hand; it were impious to touch a life like your's, conſecrated to the purpoſes of virtue: no, I would not deprive the wretched of their friend."</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles, ſtill ſhuddering at his words, demanded an explanation of them; and the tortured ſoul of Belgrave, as if happy to meet any one it could confide in, after a little heſitation, divulged at once its crimes and horrors. "No," cried Sir Charles, when he had concluded, "to raiſe a hand againſt him over whom the arm of juſtice is uplifted, were cruel, as well as cowardly; go then, and may repentance, not puniſhment overtake you." To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the raptures Sir Charles experienced at the acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of Amanda is impoſſible; not a fond father rejoicing over the reſtored fame of a darling child could experience more exquiſite delight. The next morning, as ſoon as he thought it poſſible<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

With almoſt trembling impatience,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:038416_0663_1011E75490A24148"/>
he communicated the tranſports of his heart, and his auditors rejoiced as much at theſe tranſports on Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's account as on his. Mrs. Ruſhbrook and Emily had ſat up with her the preceding night, which ſhe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a moſt reſtleſs manner without any perception of ſurrounding objects. Towards morning ſhe fell into a profound ſleep, which they truſted would recruit her exhauſted frame. Mrs. Ruſhbrook then withdrew to her huſband. It was paſt noon ere Amanda awoke. At firſt a pleaſing langour was diffuſed through her frame, which prevented her from having an idea of her ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but gradually her recollection returned, and with it anxiety to know where ſhe was. She remembered to the moment ſhe had met Sir Charles, but no farther. She gently opened the curtain, and beheld, oh! how great the pleaſure of that moment, Emily ſitting by the bed-ſide, who inſtantly riſing, kiſſed her cheek in a tranſport of affection, and inquired how ſhe did? Oh! how delightful, how ſoothing was that gentle voice to the ears of Amanda! the ſofteſt muſic could not have been more grateful, her heart vibrated to it with an exquiſite degree of pleaſure, and her eyes feaſted on the rays of benevolence which ſtreamed from thoſe of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's.—At laſt in a faint voice, ſhe ſaid, "I am ſure I am ſafe, ſince I am with Emily."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ruſhbrook entered at that inſtant; her delight at the reſtored faculties of Amanda was equal to her daughter's, yet the recollection of her own conduct made her almoſt reluctant to approach her. At laſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, "I bluſh, yet I rejoice, oh! how truly rejoice, to behold you," ſhe exclaimed; "that I could be tempted to harbour a doubt againſt you fills me with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and the vindication of your innocence can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yield you more pleaſure than it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"The vindication of my innocence!" repeated A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda, raiſing her head from the pillow: "Oh, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Heaven! is it then vindicated! Tell me, I conjure you, how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by what means."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ruſhbrook haſtened to obey her, and related all ſhe had heard from Sir Charles; the reſtoration of
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:038416_0664_1011E7561E5818D0"/>
her fame ſeemed to re-animate the ſoul of Amanda, yet tears burſt from her and ſhe trembled with emotion. Mrs. Ruſhbrook was alarmed, and endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her.</p>
                     <p>"Do not be uneaſy," ſaid Amanda, "thoſe tears will never injure me; it is long—it is very long, ſince I have ſhed tears of joy!" She implored Heaven's choiceſt bleſſings on Sir Charles for his generoſity to her, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to the Ruſhbrooks. Her heart relieved of a heavy burthen of anxiety on her account, now grew more anxious than ever to learn ſomething of her poor Oſcar, and, notwithſtanding Mrs. Ruſhbrook's entreaties to the contrary, who feared ſhe was exerting herſelf beyond her ſtrength, ſhe aroſe in the afternoon, for the purpoſe of going to the drawing-room, determined, as Sir Charles's generous conduct merited her confidence, to relate to him as well as Mr. Ruſhbrook, the motives which had brought her to town, the particulars of her life neceſſary to be known, and to requeſt their aſſiſtance in trying to learn intelligence of her brother; Emily helped her to dreſs, and ſupported her to the drawing-room. Sir Charles had continued in the houſe the whole day, and met her as ſhe entered with mingled love and pity, for in her feeble form, her faded cheek, he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the ravages of grief and ſickneſs; his eyes more than his tongue expreſſed his feelings, yet, in the ſofteſt accent of tenderneſs did he pour forth thoſe feelings, whilſt his hand trembled as it preſſed her's to his boſom.</p>
                     <p>"My feelings, Sir Charles," ſaid ſhe, cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; but my gratitude to you will ceaſe but with my exiſtence."</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles beſought her to be ſilent on ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. "He was ſelfiſh," he ſaid, "in every thing he did for her, for on her happineſs his depended."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook approached to offer his congratulations. He ſpoke of her kindneſs, but, like Sir Charles, the ſubject was painful to her, and dropped at her requeſt. The idea of being ſafe, the ſoothing attentions ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, gave to her mind a tranquillity it had long
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:038416_0665_1011E75B17228410"/>
been a ſtranger to, and ſhe looked back on her paſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers but to enjoy more truly her preſent ſecurity; as ſhe witneſſed the happineſs of the Ruſhbrooks, ſhe could ſcarcely forbear applauding aloud the author of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; but ſhe judged of his heart by her own, and therefore checked herſelf by believing he would prefer the ſilent plaudits of that heart to any praiſe whatſoever. After tea, when only Sir Charles, Mr. and Mrs. Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook, and Emily, were preſent, ſhe entered upon the affairs ſhe wiſhed to communicate. They heard her with deep attention, wonder and pity, and when ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, both Sir Charles and Ruſhbrook declared their readineſs to ſerve her. The latter, who had betrayed ſtrong emotions during her narrative, aſſured her, "he doubted not, nay, he was almoſt convinced, he ſhould ſoon be able to procure her intelligence of her brother."</p>
                     <p>This was a ſweet aſſurance to the heart of Amanda, and cheered by it ſhe ſoon retired to bed. Her ſtrength being exhauſted by ſpeaking, ſhe ſunk into a tranquil ſlumber, and next morning ſhe aroſe for breakfaſt.—"Well," ſaid Ruſhbrook to her, as they ſat at it, "I told you laſt night I ſhould ſoon be able to procure you intelligence of your brother, and I was not miſtaken."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, Heavens!" cried Amanda, in trembling emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "have you really heard any thing of him?"</p>
                     <p>"Be compoſed, my dear girl," ſaid he, taking her hand in the moſt ſoothing, moſt affectionate manner, "I have heard of him, but—"</p>
                     <p>"But what?" interrupted Amanda, with increaſed emotion.</p>
                     <p>"Why, that he has experienced ſome of the trials of life; but let the reflection that thoſe trials are over, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your ſuffering pain by hearing of them."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! tell me, I entreat," ſaid Amanda, "where he is. Tell me, I conjure you, ſhall I ſee him?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Ruſhbrook, "you ſhall ſee him; to keep you no longer in ſuſpenſe, in that dreary priſon from which I have been juſt releaſed, he has languiſhed for many months."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="unknown:038416_0666_1011E75DE11CDA38"/>
"Oh! my brother," exclaimed Amanda, while tears guſhed from her.</p>
                     <p>"I knew not," continued Ruſhbrook, "from the concealment of your name, that he was your brother till laſt night. I then told Sir Charles, and he is gone this morning to him; but you muſt expect to ſee him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what altered. The reſtoration of liberty, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of fortune, will no doubt ſoon re-eſtabliſh his health. Hark! I think I hear a voice on the ſtairs."</p>
                     <p>Amanda ſtarted, aroſe, attempted to move, but ſunk again upon her chair. The door opened, and Sir Charles entered, followed by—Oſcar. Though prepared for an alteration in his looks, ſhe was not by any means prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the alteration which ſtruck her the moment ſhe beheld him; pale and thin even to a degree of emacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he was dreſſed or rather wrapped, in an old regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental great coat, his fine hair wildly diſhevelled. As he approached her, Amanda aroſe.</p>
                     <p>"Amanda, my ſiſter!" ſaid he in a faint voice. She tottered forward, and falling upon his boſom, gave way in tears to the mingled joy and anguiſh of the moment. Oſcar preſſed her to his heart. He gazed one her with the fondeſt rapture; yet a rapture ſuddenly checked, by ſurveying the alteration in her appearance, which was as ſtriking to him as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Oh, my father!" groaned Oſcar, unable to controul the ſtrong emotions of his mind—"Oh, my father! when laſt we met we were bleſſed with your preſence." He claſped Amanda cloſer to his heart as he ſpoke, as if doubly endeared to her by her deſolate ſituation.</p>
                     <p>"To avoid regretting him is indeed impoſſible," ſaid Amanda; "yet had he lived, what tortures would have wrung his heart in witneſſing the unhappineſs of his children, when he had not the power of removing it."</p>
                     <p>"Come," cried captain Ruſhbrook, whoſe eyes, like thoſe of every perſon preſent, confeſſed his ſympathetic

As ſoon as Oſcar and Amanda grew compoſed they were left to themſelves, and Oſcar then ſatisfied the anxious and impatient heart of his ſiſter, by informing her of all that had befallen him. He began with his attachment for Adela, and the diſappointment of that attachment; but as this part of the ſtory is already known, we ſhall paſs it over in ſilence, and merely relate the occaſion of his quarrel with Belgrave.</p>

The idea of the happineſs I might have attained, rendered me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of any I might ſtill have enjoyed. I perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the duties of my ſituation mechanically, and ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſociety as much as poſſible, unable to bear the rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of my gay companions on my melancholy.</p>
                     <p>The ſummer you came to Ireland, the regiment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Bray, whoſe romantic ſituation allowed me to enjoy many delightful and ſolitary rambles. It was there a man enliſted, whoſe manner and appearance were, for many days, ſubjects of ſurpriſe and converſation to us all: from both it was obvious, he had been accuſtomed to one of the ſuperior ſituations in life. A form more ſtrikingly elegant I never beheld: the officers made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny attempts to try and diſcover who he really was, but he evaded all their enquiries, yet with the utmoſt agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What rendered him, if poſſible, more intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was his being accompanied by a young and lovely woman, who like him, appeared ſunk beneath her ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtate: but to their preſent one both conformed, if not with cheerfulneſs, at leaſt with reſignation.</p>
                     <p>Mary obtained work from almoſt all the officers. Henry was diligent in his duties, and both were univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally admired and reſpected.

                     <p>The lovelineſs of Mary was too ſtriking not to attract the notice of Belgrave, and from her ſituation he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf ſhe would be an eaſy prey; he was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, miſtaken; ſhe repulſed his overtures with equal abhorrence and indignation. She wiſhed to conceal them from her huſband, but he heard of them through the means of his fellow ſoldiers, who had ſeveral times ſeen the Colonel following his wife. It was then he really felt the bitterneſs of a ſervile ſituation. Of his wife he had no doubt; ſhe had already given him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof of conſtancy, but he dreaded the inſults ſhe might receive from the Colonel. The united vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:038416_0669_1011E7639C4ABCA0"/>
of both prevented, however, for ſome time, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of thoſe inſults. Exaſperated by their vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, the Colonel at laſt concerted one of the moſt dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical plans which could have entered into the heart of man. A party of the ſoldiers were ordered to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to watch there for ſmuggled goods; Henry was named to be of the party, but when the ſoldiers were drawn out, he was not to be found. Belgrave's ſervant the vile agent of his maſter, had informed him that the Colonel meant to take advantage of his abſence, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit his wife. He, trembling for her ſafety, reſolved to run every riſk, ſooner than leave her unguarded, and accordingly abſconded till the departure of the party. The conſequence of this was, that on his re-appearance he was put under an arreſt for diſobedience of orders, tried the next day, and ſentenced to be flogged on the following one. The very officers that paſſed the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence regretted it: but the ſtrictneſs of military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline rendered it unavoidable.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not attempt to deſcribe the ſituation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy young couple; they felt for each other more than for themſelves, and pride heightened the agonies of Henry.</p>

But to ſerve this wretched couple, I felt I could almoſt humble myſelf to the earth.</p>
                     <p>The Colonel was on the parade; and, as if aware of my intention, appeared ſedulous to avoid me. But I would not be repulſed by this, and following him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his attention for a few minutes.</p>
                     <p>"Diſpatch your buſineſs then in haſte, Sir," ſaid he, with an unuſual haughtineſs.</p>

"I ſhall, Sir," cried I, endeavouring to repreſs the indignation his manner excited," and I alſo hope with ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>"What is your buſineſs, Sir?" demanded he.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis the buſineſs of humanity," I replied, "and 'tis only for others I could aſk a favour."</p>
                     <p>I then proceeded to mention it. Rage and malice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed his countenance as I ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>"Never," exclaimed he, "ſhall the wretch receive pardon from me; and I am aſtoniſhed at your preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in aſking it."</p>
                     <p>"Yet not half ſo aſtoniſhed," replied I, as I am at your obduracy:—though why do I ſay ſo? from your paſt actions, I ſhould not be ſurpriſed at any you may now commit.</p>
                     <p>His paſſion grew almoſt to frenzy; he aſked me "if I knew who I was addreſſing?"</p>
                     <p>"Too well," I replied, "I know I am addreſſing one of the completeſt villains upon earth."</p>
                     <p>He raiſed a ſmall rattan he held at theſe words, in a threatening manner. I could no longer oppoſe my indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; I ruſhed upon him, wreſted it from his hand, broke it, and flung it over his head.</p>
                     <p>"Now," cried I, laying my hand upon my ſword, "I am ready to give you the ſatisfaction you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for my words—words, whoſe truth I will uphold with my life."</p>
                     <p>"No," ſaid he, with the coolneſs of deliberate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, "'tis a far different ſatisfaction I ſhall expect to receive."</p>
                     <p>Some of the officers had by this time gathered round us, and attempted to interfere; but he commanded their ſilence in a haughty manner, and ordered me under an immediate arreſt.</p>
                     <p>My fate I then knew decided, but I reſolved to bear that fate with fortitude, not let him, triumph in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ever me. I was confined to my room, and Henry the next morning was brought forth to receive his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

He attempted to aſſume compoſure; but when he reached the deſtined ſpot, he could no longer controul his feelings; the idea of being expoſed, diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, was too much for his noble ſoul: the paleneſs of his face encreaſed, he tottered, he fell into the arms of a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and expired, groaning forth the name of Mary.</p>
                     <p>Four days after this melancholy event, a court-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial was held on me, when, as I expected, I was broken, for contempt to my ſuperior officer. I retired to a little ſolitary inn near Bray, in a ſtate of mind which baffles deſcription, deſtitute of friends or fortune. I felt at that moment, as if I had no buſineſs in the world.</p>
                     <p>I was followed to the inn by a young Lieutenant, with whom I had been on an intimate footing. The grief he expreſſed at my ſituation rouſed me from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a ſtupefaction that was ſtealing on me. The voice of friendſhip will penetrate the deepeſt gloom, and I felt my ſorrows gradually allayed by it. He aſked me "had I fixed on any plan for myſelf?" I replied "I had not, for it was vain to fix on plans when there were no friends to ſupport them." He took my hand, and told me "I was miſtaken; in a few days he truſted to procure me letters to a gentleman in London, who had conſiderable poſſeſſions in the Weſt Indies, if ſuch a thing was agreeable to me." It was juſt what I wiſhed for, and I thanked him with the ſincereſt gratitude.</p>
                     <p>In the evening I received a meſſage from the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Mary, requeſting to ſee me directly; the ſoldier who brought it ſaid ſhe was dying. I haſtened to her; ſhe was in bed, and ſupported by a ſoldier's wife. The declining ſun-beams ſtole into the apartment, and ſhed a kind of ſolemn glory around her. The beauty that had cauſed her misfortunes was faded, but ſhe looked more intereſting than when adorned with that bloom of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Sighs and tears impeded her words for ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after I approached her; at laſt, in a faint voice, ſhe ſaid, "I ſent for you, Sir, becauſe I knew your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, your benevolence, would excuſe the liberty; I
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:038416_0672_1011E769E4FA7DE0"/>
knew you would think that no trouble which could ſooth the laſt ſad moments of a wretched woman."</p>
                     <p>She then proceeded to inform me of the motives which made her ſend, namely, to convey her infant to her father, a perſon of fortune in Dublin, and to ſee her remains, ere I did ſo, laid by thoſe of her huſband's. Her unfortunate Henry," ſhe added, "had been ſon to a reſpectable merchant: their families were intimate, and an attachment which commenced at an early period between them, was encouraged. Henry's father expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced a ſudden reverſe of fortune, and her's in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, forbid their ever thinking more of each other: but they could not obey his commands, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried clandeſtinely, thus forfeiting the favour of all their friends, as Henry's thought he wanted ſpirit, and her's deemed her deficient in reſpect to her father, they were therefore compelled, by neceſſity, to a ſtate of life infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beneath them; but in my grave," continued ſhe, "I truſt my father will bury all his reſentment, and protect this little orphan."</p>
                     <p>I promiſed a religious obſervance to her commands, and ſhe expired in about an hour after I quitted her. Mournful were the taſks ſhe enjoined me. I attended her remains to the grave, and then conveyed her child to Dublin.</p>
                     <p>Startled, amazed, diſtreſſed, her father too late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted his rigor, and received her infant to his arms with floods of repentant tears.</p>
                     <p>I now procured my recommendatory letters, and ſailed for England, having firſt written farewell ones to my father and Mrs. Marlowe, in which I informed both I was about quitting the kingdom. As ſoon as I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured cheap lodings in London, I repaired to the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to whom I was recommended; but to conceive my conſternation when I heard he was himſelf gone to the Weſt Indies. I turned into a coffee-houſe, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of communicating this intelligence to my friend. While the waiter was getting me materials for writing, I took up a newſpaper, and caſt my eyes careleſsly over it. Oh! my Amanda, what was the ſhock of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:038416_0673_1011E76C6A490ED8"/>
when I read my father's death: grief for him, anxiety for you, both aſſailed my heart too powerfully for its feelings: my head grew giddy, my ſight failed me, and I fell back with a deep groan. When recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the aſſiſtance of ſome gentlemen, I requeſted a carriage might be ſent for, but I was too weak to walk to it. On returning to my lodings I was compelled to go to bed, from which I never roſe for a fortnight. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my illneſs, all the little money I had brought along with me was expended, and I was, beſides, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in debt with the people of the houſe, for procuring me neceſſaries. When able to ſit up, they furniſhed their accounts, and I candidly told my inability to diſcharge them; in conſequence of this I was arreſted, and ſuffered but to take of my clothes a change or two of linen. The horrors of what I imagined would be a laſting captivity, were heightened by reflecting on your unprotected ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A thouſand times was I on the point of writing, to inquire into that ſituation, but ſtill checked myſelf by reflecting, that as I could not aid you, I ſhould only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The company of Captain Ruſhbrook alleviated in ſome degree the drearineſs of my time. I knew I ſhould ſuſtain an irreparable loſs in loſing him, but I ſhould have deteſted myſelf if any ſelfiſh motives had prevented my rejoicing at his enlargement. Oh! lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did I think his liberation was leading the way to mine. Early this morning he returned and introduced Sir Charles Bingley to me. Gently, and by degrees, they broke the joyful intelligence they had to communicate; with truth I can aver, that the announcement of a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did fortune was not ſo pleaſing to my heart, as the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my ſiſter's ſafety.

                     <p>"Oh! my ſiſter," continued Oſcar, with a heavy ſigh, while tears ſell from him and mingled with thoſe Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Oſcar here concluded his narrative, with ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of melancholy, as gave to Amanda the ſad idea of his paſſion for Adela being incurable. This was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the caſe, neither reaſon, time, or abſence could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or leſſen it, and the acquiſition of liberty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune loſt half their value by brooding o'er her loſs.</p>
                     <p>When their friends returned to the drawing room, and again offered their congratulations, Oſcar's dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not permit him to reply to them. When Mr. and Mrs. Ruſhbrook ſpoke of the happineſs he might now enjoy, he liſtened to their recapitulation of it as to a fulſome tale, to which his heart in ſecret gave the lie; an innate ſenſe of piety, however, recalled him to a proper recollection of the bleſſings ſo unexpectedly declared to be his; he accuſed himſelf of ingratitude to heaven in yielding to murmurs, after ſo aſtoniſhing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in his ſituation: perfect happineſs he had been ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught, and daily experience confirmed the truth of the remark, was rarely to be met with; how preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in him, therefore, to repine at the common lot of humanity: to be independent, to have the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the obligations Sir Charles Bingley had confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>iſed his heart with thankfulneſs to their divine diſpenſer. His feelings grew compoſed; a kind of ſoft and ſerene me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſtole over his mind: he ſtill thought of Adela, but not with that kind of diſtracting anguiſh he had ſo recently experienced; it was with that kind of tender regret which a ſoul of ſenſibility feels when reflecting on a departed friend, and to him Adela was as much loſt
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:038416_0675_1011E7722B675018"/>
as if already ſhrouded in her native clay. "Yes, my love," he ſaid, as if her gentle ſpirit had already forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken its earthly manſion, "in that happy world we ſhall be re-united, which only could reward thy goodneſs and thy ſufferings."</p>
                     <p>He could now enter into converſation with his friends about the meaſures which ſhould be taken to forward his pretentions. It was the opinion of Captain Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook and Sir Charles, that to make known his claim to the Marquis of Roſline, was all that was neceſſary; a claim which they did not imagine he would or could diſpute, when ſuch proofs of its validity as the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Lady Dunreath, and the will, could be produced: was it diſputed, it was then time enough to apply elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles knew the Marquis perſonally, and was alſo well acquainted in his neighbourhood, and declared he would accompany Oſcar to Scotland. Oſcar thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his intention: the ſupport of a perſon ſo well known, and univerſally eſteemed, he was convinced would eſſentially ſerve him.</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles ſaid regimental buſineſs required his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in Ireland, which, however, would occaſion no great delay, as he ſhould have it tranſacted in a few days; and as his regiment lay near Donaghadee, they could crooſs over to Port Patrick, and in a few hours after reach the Marquis of Roſline's Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>The day after the next he had fixed for commencing his journey, and he aſked Oſcar if it would be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and convenient to accompany him then. Oſcar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly aſſured him it was both.</p>
                     <p>Amanda's heart fluttered at the idea of a journey to Ireland; it was probable, ſhe thought, that they would take Wales in their way; and her ſoul ſeemed already on the wing to accompany them thither, and be left at the cottage of nurſe Edwin, from whence ſhe could again wander through the ſhades of Tudor-Hall, and take a laſt, a ſad farewell of them; for ſhe ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, from the moment ſhe ſhould be appriſed of Lord Mortimer's return to England, to viſit them no
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:038416_0676_1011E7750A0886F8"/>
more: in ſuch a farewell ſhe believed ſhe ſhould find a melancholy conſolation that would ſooth her ſpirits. She imagined there was no neceſſity for accompanying her brother into Scotland, and except told there was an abſolute one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe determined to decline the journey, if ſhe ſhould be aſked to undertake it. To go to the very ſpot where ſhe would hear particulars of Lord Mortimer's nuptials ſhe felt would be too much for her fortitude, and might betray to her brother a ſecret ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved carefully to conceal from him, as ſhe well knew the pain he would feel from knowing that the pangs of a hopeleſs attachment were entailed upon her life, and would defeat whatever flattering hopes he entertained for her. Excluſive of the above-mentioned objections, ſhe could not bear to go to a place where ſhe might, perhaps, witneſs the pain which Lord Mortimer muſt unavoidably feel from having any diſgrace befal a family he was ſo nearly connected with. O how her heart ſwelled at the idea, that ere Oſcar reached Scotland, the intereſt of the Marquis of Roſline and Lord Mortimer would be but one. From her apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of being aſked to undertake a journey ſo truly repugnant to her feelings ſhe was ſoon relieved, by Oſcar's declaring, that except ſhe wiſhed it, he would not aſk her to take ſo fatiguing a one, particularly as her preſence he could not think at all neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles Bingley aſſured him it was not, though in a low voice he ſaid to her, "it was againſt his own intereſt he ſpoke."</p>
                     <p>She would now have mentioned her wiſh of going to Wales, had not a certain conſciouſneſs checked her; ſhe feared her countenance would betray her motives for ſuch a wiſh; while ſhe heſitated about mentioning it, Sir Charles Bingley told Capt. Ruſhbrook, that he had applied to a friend of his in power for a place for him, and had been fortunate enough to make application at the very time there was one of tolerable emolument va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, at—, about ſeventy miles diſtant from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, whither it would be neceſſary he ſhould go as ſoon
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:038416_0677_1011E7769A2F7208"/>
as poſſible. He therefore propoſed that he and Mrs. Ruſhbrook ſhould begin preparations for their journey the enſuing morning, and exert themſelves to be able to undertake it in the courſe of the week.</p>
                     <p>They were all rapture and gratitude at this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which opened a proſpect of ſupport through their own means, and the bread of independence, however hardly earned, which here was not the caſe, muſt ever be ſweet to ſouls of ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>Oſcar looked with anxiety at his ſiſter, on the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ruſhbrook's removal from town, as if to ſay, to whoſe care then can I entruſt you. Mrs. Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook interpreted his look, and inſtantly requeſted that Miſs Fitzalan might accompany them, declaring her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety would render their felicity complete. This was the moment for Amanda to ſpeak; ſhe took courage, and mentioned her earneſt wiſh of viſiting her faithful nurſe, declaring ſhe could not loſe ſo favourable an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity as now offered for the gratification of that wiſh, by accompanying her brother into Wales. Emily pleaded, but Amanda, though with the utmoſt gratitude and tenderneſs, as if to ſoften her refuſal, was ſteady. Oſcar was pleaſed with his ſiſter's determination, as he truſted going into what might be called her native air, joined to the tender care of nurſe Edwin, would recruit her health.</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles was in raptures at the idea of having her company ſo far on their way.</p>
                     <p>Every thing relative to the proceedings of the whole party was arranged before dinner, at which Sir Charles preſided, giving pleaſure to all around him by the inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable ſweetneſs of his manner. He withdrew at an early hour at night, and his friends ſoon after retired to their reſpective chambers. On entering the breakfaſt room next morning, Amanda found not only her brother and the Ruſhbrooks, but Sir Charles Bingley there. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after breakfaſt he drew Oſcar aſide, and in the moſt delicate terms inſiſted on being his banker at preſent, to which Oſcar gratefully conſented. As ſoon as this affair was ſettled, he put a note into his ſiſter's
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:038416_0678_1011E77A1B55AE40"/>
hands to purchaſe whatever ſhe ſhould deem neceſſary, and ſhe went out with the Ruſhbrook's, who, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sir Charles's directions, began preparations for their journey this day. After their return, Sir Charles found an opportunity of again making an offer of his hand to Amanda.</p>
                     <p>The ſincere friendſhip ſhe had conceived for him, made her determine to terminate his ſuſpence on her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. "Was I to accept your generous propoſal, Sir Charles," ſaid ſhe, "I ſhould be unworthy of that eſteem which it will be my pride to retain, and my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to return, becauſe beyond eſteem I cannot go my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: it is due to your friendſhip," cried ſhe, after the heſitation of a moment, whilſt a roſy bluſh ſtole over her lovely face, and as quickly faded from it, "to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that ere I ſaw you the fate of my heart was deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded."</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles, turned pale; he graſped her hands in a kind of ſilent agony to his boſom, then exclaimed, "I will not, Miſs Fitzalan, after your generous confidence, teaze you with farther importunity.</p>

                     <p>THE enſuing morning Oſcar, Amanda, and Sir Charles, began their journey. The Ruſhbrooks, who regarded Amanda as the cauſe of their preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, took leave of her with a tender ſorrow that deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected her heart. The journey to Wales was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and expeditious, the weather being fine, and relays of horſes being provided at every ſtage. On the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the third day they arrived about ſun-ſet at the village which lay contiguous to Edwin's abode; from
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:038416_0679_1011E77DA87ABF48"/>
whence, as ſoon as they had taken ſome refreſhment, Amanda ſet off, attended by her brother, for the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, having ordered her luggage to be brought after her. She would not permit the attendance of Sir Charles, and almoſt regretted having travelled with him, as ſhe could not help thinking his paſſion ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by her having done ſo. "How dearly," cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, as he handed her down ſtairs, "ſhall I pay for a few ſhort hours of pleaſure, by the unceaſing regret their remembrance will entail upon me."</p>
                     <p>Amanda withdrew her hand, and bidding him fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, hurried on. Oſcar proceeded no farther than the lane which led to the cottage with his ſiſter. He had no time to anſwer the interrogations which its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants might deem themſelves privileged to make; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he wiſh his preſent ſituation to be known to any others than thoſe already acquainted with it: Amanda therefore meant to ſay ſhe had taken the opportunity of travelling ſo far with two particular friends, who were going to Ireland. Oſcar promiſed to write to her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from thence, and from Scotland, as ſoon as he had ſeen the Marquis. He gave her a thouſand charges concerning her health, and took a tender farewell. From his too viſible dejection, Amanda rejoiced ſhe had not revealed her own ſorrows to him. She truſted it would be in her power, by ſoothing attentions, by the thouſand little nameleſs offices of friendſhip, to alleviate his, to pluck the thorn from his heart, which rankled within it, was beyond her hopes; in their diſpoſitions, as well as ſates, there was too great a ſimilitude to expect this.</p>
                     <p>Amanda lingered in the walk as he departed: ſhe was now in the very ſpot that recalled a thouſand fond and tender remembrances; it was here ſhe had given a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well look to Tudor Hall, it was here her father had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a laſt look at the ſpire of the church where his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved wife was interred; it was here Lord Mortimer uſed ſo often to meet her; her ſoul ſunk in the heavieſt ſadneſs; ſighs burſt from her overcharged heart, and with difficulty ſhe prevented her tears from falling; all around was ſerene and beautiful, but neither the ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:038416_0680_1011E77F33914F28"/>
nor the beauty of the ſcene could ſhe now enjoy; the plaintive bleating of the cattle, that rambled about the adjacent hills, only heightened her melancholy, and the appearance of autumn, which was now far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, only made her look back to the happy period when admiring its luxuriance had given her delight; the parting ſun-beams yet glittered on the windows of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Hall; ſhe pauſed involuntarily to contemplate it; hours could ſhe have continued in the ſame ſituation, had not the idea that ſhe might be obſerved from the cottage made her at laſt haſten to it.</p>
                     <p>The door lay open; ſhe entered, and found only the nurſe within, employed at knitting. Her aſtoniſhment at the appearance of Amanda is not to be deſcribed.—She ſtarted, ſcreamed, ſurveyed her a minute, as if doubting the evidence of her eyes; then running to her, flung he arms about her neck, and claſped her to her boſom.</p>
                     <p>"Good gracious!" cried ſhe, "well, to pe ſure, who ever would thought of ſuch a thing; well, to pe ſure, you are as welcome as the flowers in May. Here we have been in ſuch peck of troubles about you, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and many a time has my good man ſaid, that if he knew where you were he would go to you." Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da returned the embraces of her faithful nurſe, and they both ſat down together.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! I fear," ſaid the nurſe, looking tenderly at her for a few minutes, "you have been in a ſad way ſince I laſt ſaw you. The poor tear Captain, alack! little did I think when he took you away from us I ſhould never ſee him more!" Amanda's tears could no longer be ſuppreſſed, they guſhed in torrents from her, and her deep ſobs ſpoke the bitterneſs of her feelings.</p>
                     <p>"Aye," ſaid the nurſe, wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron, "gentle or ſimple, ſooner or later, we muſt all go the ſame way: ſo, my tear child, don't take it ſo much to heart. Well, to pe ſure, long pefore this I thought I ſhould have ſeen or heard of your being greatly married; put I pelieve it is true enough, that
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:038416_0681_1011E78238F29918"/>
men are like the wind, always changing. Any one that has ſeen Lord Mortimer after you went away would never have thought he could prove fickle; he was in ſuch grief my very heart and ſoul pitied him; to pe ſure, if I had known where you were I ſhould have told him: I comforted myſelf, however, by thinking he would certainly find you out, when, Lort! inſtead of looking for you, here he's going to be married to a great Laty, with ſuch a long hard name, a Scotch heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs I think they call her; aye, golt is every thing in theſe days. Well, all the harm I wiſh him is, that ſhe may plague his life out.</p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe was too painful to Amanda; her tears had ſubſided, and ſhe endeavoured to change it, by aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the nurſe's family. The nurſe, in a haſty manner, ſaid they were well, and thus proceeded:—"Then there is Parſon Howell, I am ſure one would have thought him as ſteady as Penmaenmawr, but no ſuch thing: I am ſure he has changed, for he does not come to the cottage half ſo often to aſk about you as he uſed to do."</p>
                     <p>Amanda, notwithſtanding her dejection, ſmiled at the nurſe's anger about the curate, and again requeſted to hear particulars of her family. The nurſe no longer heſitated to comply with her requeſt; She informed her they were all well, and then at a little tance at the mill in the valle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The nurſe, in her turn, enquired into all that had befallen Amanda ſince their ſeparation, and ſhed tears at hearing of her dear child's ſufferings ſince that

period. She aſked about Oſcar, and was briefly informed he was well. The family ſoon returned, from the dance, and it would be difficult to ſay whether ſurpriſe or joy was moſt predominant at ſeeing Amanda. One of the young men ran over for Ellen, and returned in a few minutes with her, followed by her huſband, carrying his little child. She looked with wild delight. She claſped Amanda in her arms, as if ſhe would never let her depart from them, and wept in the fullneſs of her heart. "Now—now," cried ſhe, "I ſhall be quite happy; but, oh! why, my tear young Laty, did you not come amongſt us peſore? you know all in our power we would have done to render you happy." She now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected herſelf, and modeſtly retired to a little diſtance. She took her child and brought it to Amanda, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted her extremely by the notice ſhe took of it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d Chip. If Amanda had had leſs cauſe for grief, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of theſe affectionate cottagers would have ſoothed her mind; but at preſent nothing could dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh her dejection. Her luggage was by this time arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhe had brought preſents for all the family and now diſtributed them. She tried to converſe about their domeſtic affairs, but found herſelf unequal to the effort and begged to be ſhewn to her chamber. The nurſe would not ſuffer her to retire till ſhe had taſted her new cheeſe and Welch ale. When alone within it ſhe found freſh objects to remind her of Lord Mortimer, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to augment her grief; here lay the book caſe he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ent her. She opened it with trembling impatience; but ſcarcely a volume did ſhe examine, in which ſelect paſſages were not marked by his hand for her particular peruſal. Oh! what mementos were thoſe volumes of the happy hour ſhe had paſſed at the cottage; the night wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, and ſtill ſhe continued weeping over them. She could with difficulty bring herſelf to cloſe the book-caſe, and when ſhe retired to reſt her ſlumbers were ſhort and unrefreſhing. The next morning, as ſhe ſat at breakfaſt aſſiduouſly attended by the nurſe and her daughters (for Ellen had come over early to enquire after her health) Howell entered to pay her a viſit; the previous intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:038416_0683_1011E78775E8EF10"/>
ſhe had received of the alteration in his ſentiments, rendered his viſit more pleaſing than it would otherwiſe have been to her; his pleaſure was great at ſeeing her, but it was not the wild and extravagant delight of a lover, but the ſoft and placid joy of a friend. After his departure, which was not ſoon, ſhe accompanied Ellen to view her cottage, and was infinitely pleaſed by its neatneſs and romantic ſituation; it lay on the ſide of a hill, which commanded a beautiful proſpect of Tudor-Hall; every thing ſhe beheld reminded Amanda of Lord Mortimer, even the balmy air ſhe breathed, on which his voice had ſo often floated.</p>
                     <p>The ſad indulgence of wandering through the ſhades of Tudor Hall, which ſhe had ſo eagerly deſired, and fondly anticipated, ſhe could not long deny herſelf.—The ſecond evening after her arrival at the cottage, ſhe turned her ſolitary ſteps to them; their deep embower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glens, their ſolitude, their ſilence, ſuited the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive turn of her feelings: here, undiſturbed and unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſhe could indulge the ſorrows of her heart; and oh! how did recollection augment thoſe ſorrows, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracing the happy hours ſhe had ſpent within thoſe ſhades. A cold, a death-like melancholy pervaded her feelings, and ſeemed repelling the movements of life; her trembling limbs were unable to ſupport her, and ſhe threw herſelf on the ground. For ſome minutes ſhe could ſcarcely breathe; tears at length relieved her pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful oppreſſion, ſhe rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed her languid head, ſhe looked around, and wept with encreaſing violence, at beholding what might be termed mementos of former happineſs. She repeated, in ſoft and tremulous accents, the name of Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I will ſtrive to do right, ſhe cried, I will try to wean my ſoul from remembrances no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proper to be indulged. Yet ſtill ſhe lingered in the wood; the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

ſighed mournfully through the trees, and the droning Bat fluttered in the air, upon which the wild muſic of a harp from one of the neighbouring cottages ſoftly floated.</p>
                     <p>Amanda drew nearer to it; it looked dark and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; ſhe ſighed; ſhe involuntarily exclaimed, oh! how ſoon will it be enlivened by bridal pomp and feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
                     <p>She now recollected the uneaſineſs her long abſence might create at the cottage, and as ſoon as the idea oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, haſtened to it. She met Edwin in the lane, who had been diſpatched by his wife in queſt of her. The good woman expreſſed her fears, that ſuch late rambles would injure the health of Amanda; "it was a ſad thing," ſhe ſaid, "to ſee young people giving way to diſmal fancies.</p>
                     <p>Amanda did not confine her rambles entirely to Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Hall; ſhe viſited all the ſpots where ſhe and Lord Mortimer uſed to ramble together. She went to the humble ſpot where her mother lay interred. Her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were now infinitely more painful than when ſhe had firſt ſeen it; it recalled to her mind, in the moſt agonizing manner, all the viciſſitudes ſhe had experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince that period; it recalled to view the calamitous cloſure of her father's life; the ſorrows, the diſtreſſes of that life, and ſhe felt overwhelmed with grief; ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could ſhe prevent herſelf from falling on the grave, and giving way, in tears and lamentations, to that grief. Deprived of the deareſt connexions of life; blaſted in hopes and expectations, oh! well had it been for me, ſhe cried, had this ſpot at once received the mother and the child:—and yet, ſhe exclaimed, after a minute's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, oh! what, my God, am I, that I ſhould dare to murmur or repine at thy decrees? Oh! pardon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary expreſſion of a woe-worn heart, of a heart that feels the pureſt gratitude for thy protection through paſt dangers. Oh! how preſumptuous, ſhe continued, to repine at the common lot of humanity—at the lot of her, ſhe continued, caſting her tearful eyes upon the grave, where the laſt flowers of autumn were now wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, who repoſes in this earthly bed, who in life's
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:038416_0685_1011E78BA6916DA8"/>
meridian, in beauty's prime, ſunk the ſad victim of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row into the arms of death. Oh! my parents, how ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous were your deſtinies? even your aſhes were not permitted to ſhoulder together; but in a happier region your kindred ſpirits are now united. Bleſſed ſpirits! your child will ſtrive to imitate your example; in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient reſignation to the will of heaven, ſhe will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſupport life; ſhe will ſtrive to live, though not from an idea of enjoying happineſs, but from an humble hope of being able to diſpenſe it to others.</p>
                     <p>Such were the words of Amanda at the grave of her mother, from which ſhe turned like a pale and drooping lily, ſurcharged with tears.</p>
                     <p>At the end of a week ſhe heard from Oſcar, who told her in the courſe of a few days he expected to embark for Scotland. Amanda had brought materials for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her, and ſhe felt a paſſionate deſire of taking views of Tudor-Hall; views ſhe believed would yield her a melancholy pleaſure, when ſhe ſhould be far, and for ever diſtant from the ſpots they repreſented.</p>
                     <p>This deſire, however, ſhe could not gratify, without the aſſiſtance of her nurſe, for ſhe meant to take her views from the library, and ſhe feared if ſhe went there without apprizing the houſe-keeper, ſhe ſhould be liable to interruption. She therefore requeſted her nurſe to aſk permiſſion for her to go there. The nurſe ſhook her head as if ſhe ſuſpected Amanda had a motive for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſhe did not divulge. She was, however, too anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to gratify her dear child, to refuſe complying with it, and accordingly loſt no time in aſking the deſired per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which Mrs. Abergwilly readily gave, ſaying, "Miſs Fitzalan was welcome to go to the library when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe pleaſed, and ſhould not be interrupted."</p>
                     <p>Amanda did not delay availing herſelf of this permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but it was ſome time after ſhe entered the library, ere ſhe could compoſe herſelf ſufficiently for the purpoſe which had brought her to it. In vain did nature appear from the windows, diſplaying the moſt beautiful and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic ſcenery to her view, as if to tempt her to take up the pencil. Her eyes were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

looked upon this ſcenery, and reflected, that he who had once pointed out its various beauties, was loſt to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. By degrees, however, her feelings grew compoſed, and every morning ſhe repaired to the library, feeling, whilſt engaged within it, a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mpory alleviation of ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Three weeks paſſed in this manner, and at the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that period, ſhe received a letter from Oſcar. She trembled in the moſt violent agitation as ſhe broke the ſeal, for ſhe ſaw, by the poſt ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k, he was in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but how great was her ſurpriſe and joy at the contents of this letter, which informed her, every thing relative to the important affair ſo lately in agitation, was ſettled in the moſt amicable manner: that the avowal of his claim occaſioned not the ſmalleſt litiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that he was then in full poſſeſſion of the fortune bequeathed him by the Earl, and had already received the congratulation of the neighbouring families on his acceſſion, or rather reſtoration to it. He had not time, he ſaid, to enumerate the many particulars which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the adjuſtment of affairs ſo eaſy, and hoped the pleaſing intelligence his letter communicated, would atone for its brevity; he added he was then preparing to ſet off for London, with Sir Charles Bingley, of whoſe friendſhip he ſpoke in the higheſt terms, to ſettle ſome affairs relative to his new poſſeſſions, and particularly about the revival of the Dunreath, title, which, not from any oſtentatious pride, he deſired to obtain, as he was ſure ſhe would ſuppoſe, but from gratitude and reſpect to the wiſhes of his grandfather, who, in his will, had expreſt his deſire that the honours of his family ſhould be ſupported by his heir. When every thing was finally ſettled, he proceeded to ſay, he would haſten on the wings of love and impatience to her, for in her ſweet ſociety alone, he found any balm for the ſorrows of his heart, ſorrows which could not be eradicated from it, though fortune had been ſo unexpectedly propitious; and he hoped, he ſaid, he ſhould find her then gay as the birds, blooming as the flowers of ſpring, and ready
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:038416_0687_1011E7922D309A80"/>
to accompany him to the venerable manſion of their anceſtors.</p>
                     <p>The joyful intelligence this letter communicated ſhe had not ſpirits at preſent to mention to the inhabitants of the cottage; the pleaſure it afforded was only damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reflecting on what Lord Mortimer muſt feel from a diſcovery which could not fail of caſting a dark ſhade of obloquy upon his new connexions. She was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>w doubly anxious to finiſh her landſcapes, from the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect there wes for quitting Wales ſo ſoon. Every viſit ſhe now paid the library was paid with the ſad idea of its being the laſt. As ſhe was preparing for going there one morning, immediately after breakfaſt, the nurſe, who had been out ſome time previous to her riſing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room with a look of breathleſs impatience, which ſeemed to declare ſhe had ſomething wonderful to communicate. "Goot lack-a-taiſy," cried ſhe, as ſoon as ſhe had recovered her breath, lifting up her head from the back of the chair on which ſhe had thrown herſelf, "goot lack-a-taiſy, well to pe ſure, there is nothing put wonderful things happening in this world! Here old Dame Abergwilly ſent in ſuch a hurry for me this morning; to pe ſure I was ſurpriſed, put what was that to the ſurpriſe I felt, when I heard what ſhe had ſent to me for." It was not Amanda's turn to feel breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs impatience. "Good Heavens!" ſhe exclaimed, "what did ſhe tell you?"</p>
                     <p>"Aye, I knew," cried the nurſe, "the commotion you would be in when I told you the news; if you were gueſſing from this time till this time to-morrow, you would never ſtumble upon what it is."</p>
                     <p>"I dare ſay I ſhould not," cried Amanda, "ſo do be brief."</p>
                     <p>"Why, you muſt know—put, Lort, my tear chilt, I am afraid you made but a bad breakfaſt, for you look very pale; inteed I made no great one myſelf, for I was in ſuch a hurry ſlurry with what Mrs. Abergwilly told me, that, though ſhe made ſome nice green tea, and we had a ſlim cake, I could ſcarcely touch any thing."</p>

"Well," ſaid Amanda, tortured with anxiety and impatience, "what did ſhe t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Why, my tear chilt, down came a ſpecial meſſenger from London laſt night, to let them know that Lort Cherbury was tead, and that Lort Mortimer had ſold Tudor-Hall, and the ſteward is ordered to pay all the ſervants off, and tiſcharge them and to have every thing in readineſs againſt the new lantlort comes down to take poſſeſſion.—Oh! Lort, there is ſuch weeping and wailing at the Hall, the poor creatures, who had grown old in the ſervice, hoped to have finiſhed their tays in it; it is not that they are in fear of want, the young Lort has taken care of that, for he has ſettled ſomething yearly upon them all, but that they are ſorry to quit the family.

She ſays ſhe thinks ſhe will come and lodge with me; put if ſhe does, ſhe ſays I muſt not put her in a room from whence ſhe can have a view of Tudor Hall, for ſhe ſays ſhe will never be able to look at it when once it gets a new maſter; ſo this my dear chilt, is the ſum totem of what I have heard."</p>
                     <p>Amanda was equally aſtoniſhed and affected by what ſhe heard. She wiſhed to know if the nurſe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any intelligence of Lord Mortimer's marriage, but ſhe could not bring herſelf to aſk the queſtion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, upon reflection, ſhe was convinced ſhe ſhould have heard it had it been the caſe. With Lord Cherbury died all hopes of the reſtoration of her fame in the opinion of his ſon: "Yet why," ſhe aſked herſelf, "ſhould I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret this? Since thus ſeparated, it is better, perhaps, he had ceaſed to eſteem me, as undoubtedly it muſt leſſen his feelings on my account." Why he ſhould part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Tudor-Hall ſhe could not conceive, except it was to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſome caprice of lady Emphraſia's, who it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable (ſhe imagined) knew that the attachment between Lord Mortimer and her had there commenced. "Ah!"
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:038416_0689_1011E7978DF93D70"/>
cried Amanda, "ſhe never could have reliſhed its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties—beauties which, if Lord Mortimer thinks as I do, would, if reviewed, only have augmented his ſorrows—ſorrows which propriety now demands his repelling."—She haſtened to the hall, but was ſometime there ere ſhe could commence her employment, ſo much had ſhe been agitated. The landſcape ſhe was finiſhing was taken from the little valley which lay beneath the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the muſic-room, the romantic ruins of an old caſtle overhung an eminence at its extremity; and of the whole ſcene ſhe had taken a moſt accurate copy; it wanted but one charm to pleaſe her, and that charm was the figure of Lord Mortimer, with whom ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Her hand was ready in obeying the impulſe of her heart, and ſhe ſoon beheld ſketched, in the moſt ſtriking manner, the elegant fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of him ſo ardently beloved. She gazed with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon them, but it was a ſhort lived rapture. She ſtarted, as if conſcious ſhe had committed a crime, when ſhe reflected on the ſituation in which he now ſtood with another woman; her trembling hand haſtened to atone for its error, by expunging the dangerous likeneſs, and the warm involuntary tear ſhe ſhed at the moment aided her deſign. "Oh! how unneceſſary," ſhe cried, as ſhe made this ſacrifice to delicacy, "to ſketch features which are indelibly engraven on my heart." As ſhe ſpoke a deep and long drawn ſigh reached her ear: alarmed, confounded at the idea of being overheard and of courſe the feelings of her heart diſcovered, ſhe ſtarted, with precipitation from her ſeat, and looked around her with a kind of wild confuſion; but gracious Heavens! who can deſcribe the emotions of her ſoul, when the original of that picture, ſo fondly ſketched, ſo haſtily obliterated, met her eye. Amazed, unable to ſpeak, to move, almoſt to breathe, ſhe ſtood motionleſs and aghaſt, the pale ſtatue of ſurpriſe, as if ſhe neither durſt or could believe the evidence of her eyes. Well, indeed, might ſhe have doubted them, for in the pale countenance of Lord Mortimer ſcarce a veſtige of his former ſelf (except in the bemgnancy of his looks) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained.

She had nearly reached it, when the ſoft, the tremulous voice of Lord Mortimer arreſted her courſe. "You go, then, Miſs Fitzalan," cried he, "without one adieu; you go, and we never more ſhall meet." The agonizing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which thoſe words were pronounced, ſtruck a death-like chill upon the heart of Amanda. She ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and turned around involuntarily, as if to receive that laſt, and ſad adieu, which ſhe was half reproached for avoiding. Lord Mortimer approached her; he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak, but his voice was inarticulate; a guſt of ſorrow burſt from his eyes, and he haſtily covered his face with a handkerchief, and walked to a window.</p>
                     <p>Amanda, unutterably affected, was unable to ſtand, ſhe ſunk upon a chair, and watched with a burſting heart the emotions of Lord Mortimer. Oh! with what difficulty at this moment did ſhe confine herſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the cold, the rigid rules of propriety—with what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty did ſhe prevent herſelf from flying to Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer—from mingling tears with his, and lamenting the cruel deſtiny which had diſunited them forever. Lord Mortimer in a few minutes was ſufficiently recovered again to approach her. "I have long wiſhed for an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeeing you," ſaid he, "but had not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to deſire an interview. How little did I imagine this morning, when, like a ſad exile, I came to take a laſt farewell of a favourite reſidence, that I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you! Fate, in granting this interview, has for once befriended me. To expreſs my horror, my remorſe, my anguiſh, not only for the error a combination of events influenced me into concerning you—but for the conduct that error led me to adopt, will, I think, a little lighten my heart; to receive your pardon will be a ſweet, a ſad

conſolation; yet," continued he, after a moment's pauſe, "why do I ſay it will be conſolation? Alas! the ſweetneſs that may lead you to accord it, will only heighten my wretchedneſs at our eternal ſeparation." Here he pauſed. Amanda was unable to ſpeak. His words ſeemed to imply he was acquainted with the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhe had ſuſtained through his father's means, and ſhe waited in trembling expectation, for an explanation of them. "The purity of your character," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, "was at length fully revealed to me. Good heaven! under what afflicting circumſtances? By that Being, to whom you ſo generouſly made a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of what then—you might have conſidered your happineſs."</p>
                     <p>"Did Lord Cherbury, then," ſaid Amanda, with inexpreſſible eagerneſs, "did he then (at laſt) juſtify me?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," cried Lord Mortimer, "he proved you were indeed the moſt excellent, the moſt injured of human beings, that you were all which my fond heart had once believed you to be; but, oh! what were the dreadful emotions of that heart to know his juſtification came too late to reſtore its peace. Once there was a happy period, when, after a ſimilar error being removed, I had hoped, by a life forever devoted to you, to have made ſome reparation, ſome atonement, for my invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary injuſtice; but alas! no reparation, no atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can now be made."</p>
                     <p>Amanda wept; ſhe raiſed her ſtreaming eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and again caſt them to the earth.</p>
                     <p>"You weep," cried Lord Mortimer, in a tone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of ſurpriſe, after ſurveying her ſome minutes in ſilence; "my love, my Amanda," continued he, ſuddenly ſeizing her hand, while he ſurveyed her with a moſt rapturous fondneſs, a crimſon glow mantling his cheek, and a beam of wanted brilliancy da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Amanda ſtarted; ſhe feared the emotions ſhe betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had convinced Lord Mortimer of the continuance,

the unabated ſtrength of her affection; ſhe felt ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her imprudence, which had alone, ſhe was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, tempted Lord Mortimer to addreſs her in ſuch a manner. "I know not, my Lord," cried ſhe, "in what ſenſe you aſk whether I am unchanged; but of this be aſſured, a total alteration muſt have taken place in my ſentiments, if I could remain a moment longer with a perſon, who ſeems at once forgetful of what is due to his own ſituation and mine."</p>
                     <p>"Go, then, Madam," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, in an accent of diſpleaſure, "and pardon my having thus detained you, pardon my involuntary offence, excuſe, my having diſturbed your retirement, and obtruded my ſorrows on you."</p>

"Oh! my Amanda," cried he, ſeizing her hand, and almoſt breathleſs with emotion, "add not, by your anger, to the bitterneſs of this ſad hour; ſince we muſt part, oh! let us part in amity as friends that regard each other. You have not yet (if indeed it is poſſible for you to do ſo) pronounced your forgiveneſs of the perſecutions you underwent on my account; you have not yet granted your pardon for the harſhneſs, the cruelty with which a dreadful error tempted me to treat you."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my Lord," ſaid Amanda, again yielding to the ſoftneſs of her ſoul, while tears trickled down her cheeks, "why torture me by ſpeaking in this manner? How can I pronounce forgiveneſs when I never was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended? when wretched and deſerted I appeared to ſtand upon the great theatre of life, without one hand to offer me aſſiſtance, your ready friendſhip came to my relief, and poured the balm of comfort over the ſorrows of my

heart? when deprived by deceit and cruelty of your good opinion, even then your attention and ſolicitude purſued my wandering footſteps, and ſtrove to mark a path of comfort for me to take? Theſe, theſe are obligations that never can be forgotten, that demand, that poſſeſs my eternal gratitude, my—." A warmer expreſſion roſe to her lips, but was again buried in her heart. She ſighed, and after a pauſe of a minute, thus went on: "For your happineſs, my warmeſt, pureſt prayers are daily offered up; oh! may it yet be equal to your vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, greater I cannot wiſh it."</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer groaned in the excruciating agony of his ſoul. "Oh! Amanda," he ſaid, "where—where can I receive conſolation for your loſs? Never—never in this world!" He took her hands within his, he raiſed them to Heaven, as if ſupplicating its choiceſt bleſſings on her head; "For my happineſs you pray," he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—"ah! my love, how unavailing is the prayer!"</p>
                     <p>Amanda now ſaw more than ever the neceſſity of haſtening away. She gently withdrew her hands, and hurried on as faſt as her trembling limbs could carry her. Still Lord Mortimer attended her: Yet Amanda, cried he," a little moment. Tell me," he continued, again ſeizing her hand, "Do not theſe ſhades remind you of departed hours? Oh! what bliſsful ones have we not paſſed beneath their foliage, that foliage which I ſhall never more behold expanding to the breath of ſpring."</p>
                     <p>Amanda trembled: this involuntary, but ſad dclara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the loſs of a ſeat ſo valued by him, overpowered her; her reſpiration grew faint, ſhe could not ſupport herſelf, and made a motion to ſit down upon the graſs, but Lord Mortimer eagerly caught her to his boſom. She had not ſtrength to reſiſt the effort, and her head reclined upon his ſhoulder; but who can ſpeak her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as ſhe felt the beating heart of Mortimer, which, from its violent palpitations, ſeemed as if it would burſt his boſom to find a paſſage to her feet. In a few minutes ſhe was a little recovered, and ſenſible of the impropriety of her ſituation, was now reſolutely determined to quit Lord Mortimer. "We muſt part, my Lord," cried ſhe,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:038416_0694_1011E7A3717865F0"/>
diſengaging herſelf from his arms, notwithſtanding a gentle effort he made to detain her; "we muſt part, my Lord," ſhe repeated, "and part for ever."</p>
                     <p>"Tell me, then," he exclaimed, ſtill impeding her courſe, "tell me whether I may ſtill hope to live in your remembrance, whether I may hope not to be obliterated from your memory by the happineſs which will ſhortly ſurround you; promiſe I ſhall at times be thought of with your wonted, though, alas! unavailing wiſhes for my happineſs, and the promiſe will perhaps afford me conſolation in the ſolitary exile I have doomed myſelf to."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my Lord," ſaid Amanda, unable to repreſs her feelings, "why do I hear you ſpeak in this manner? In mentioning exile, do you not declare your intention of leaving unfulfilled the claims which ſituation, family and ſociety have upon you? Oh! my Lord, you ſhock, ſhall I ſay more, you diſappoint me! Yes, I repeat it, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the idea I had formed of the virtue and fortitude of him who, as a friend, I ſhall ever regard: to yield thus to ſorrow, to neglect the incumbent duties of life, to abandon a woman to whom ſo lately you plighted your ſolemn vows of love and protection: Oh! my Lord, what will her friends, what will Lady Euphraſia herſelf ſay to ſuch cruel, ſuch unjuſtifiable conduct?"</p>
                     <p>"Lady Euphraſia!" repeated Lord Mortimer, recoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few paces, "Lady Euphraſia!" he again exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in tremulous accents, regarding Amanda with an expreſſion of mingled horror and wildneſs, "Gracious Heaven! is it, can it be poſſible you are ignorant of the circumſtances which lately happened? Yes, your words, your looks declare you are ſo."</p>
                     <p>It was now Amanda's turn to repeat his words. She demanded, with a wildneſs of countenance, equal to that he had juſt diſplayed, "what were the circumſtances he alluded to?</p>
                     <p>"Firſt tell me," cried he, was the alteration in your manner produced by you ſuppoſing me the huſband of Euphraſia?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="unknown:038416_0695_1011E7A8434D6DB0"/>
"Suppoſing you her huſband!" repeated Amanda, unable to anſwer his queſtion, in a moment of ſuch tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing ſuſpenſe: "And are you not ſo?"</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Lord Mortimer, "I never had the misfortune to offer vows which my heart could not ratify. Lady Euphraſia made another choice. She was your enemy, but I know your gentle ſpirit will mourn her ſad and ſudden fate." He ceaſed, for Amanda had no longer power to liſten; ſhe ſunk, beneath ſurpriſe and joy, into the expanded arms of her beloved Mortimer. It is ye alone who, like her, have ſtood upon the very brink of deſpair, who, like her, have been reſtored, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly reſtored to hope, to happineſs, that can form any judgment of her feelings at the preſent moment—at the moment when recovering from her inſenſibility, the ſoft accent of Lord Mortimer ſaluted her ear, and made her heart, without one cenſure from propriety, reſpond to rapture, as he held her to his boſom; as he gazed on her with tears of impaſſioned tenderneſs, he repeated his queſtion, whether the alteration in her manner was produced alone by the ſuppoſition of his marriage; but he repeated it with a ſweet, a happy conſciouſneſs of having it anſwered according to his wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>"Theſe tears, theſe emotions, oh! Mortimer, what do they declare?" exclaimed Amanda: "Ah! do they not ſay my heart never knew a diminution of tenderneſs, that it never could have forgotten you. Yes," ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, raiſing her eyes, ſtreaming with tears of rapture, to Heaven, "I am now recompenſed for all my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: yes, in this bliſsful moment I meet a full reward for them." Lord Mortimer now led her back to the library, to give an explanation of the events which had produced ſo great a reverſe of ſituation; but it was long ere he could ſufficiently compoſe himſelf to commence his narrative; alternately he fell at the feet of Amanda, alternately he folded her to his boſom, and aſked his heart if its preſent happineſs was real. A thouſand times he queſtioned her whether ſhe was indeed unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as often implored her forgiveneſs for one moment
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:038416_0696_1011E7AAF23ABBF0"/>
doubting her conſtancy. Amanda exerted her ſpirits to calm her own agitation, that ſhe might be enabled to ſooth him into tranquillity. At length ſhe ſucceeded, and he terminated her anxious impatience by giving her the promiſed relation.</p>

His dejection was unconquerable; all his ſchemes of felicity were overthrown, and the deſtruction of his hopes was the deſtruction of his peace. It was not in theſe firſt tranſports of bitter ſorrow that Lord Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury ventured to ſpeak his wiſhes to his ſon: he waited till by ſlow degrees he ſaw a greater degree of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his manner, though it was a compoſure attended with no abatement of melancholy. At firſt he only hinted thoſe wiſhes; hints, however, which Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer appeared deſignedly inſenſible of. At laſt the Earl ſpoke plainer; he mentioned his deep regret at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding a ſon, whom he had ever conſidered the pride of his houſe, and the ſolace of his days, waſting his youth in wretchedneſs for an ungrateful woman, who had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ong triumphed in the infatuation which bound him to her: it filled his ſoul with anguiſh, he ſaid, to behold him loſt to himſelf, his family, and the world, thus diſappointing all the hopes and expectations which the fair promiſe of
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:038416_0697_1011E7AC9580B708"/>
his early youth had given riſe to in the boſom of his friends, concerning the meridian of his day.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was unutterably affected by what his father ſaid. The Earl beheld his emotions, and bleſt it as a happy omen. His pride, as well as ſenſibility, he continued, were deeply wounded at the idea of having Lord Mortimer ſtill conſidered the ſlave of a paſſion which had met ſo baſe a return. Oh! let not the world, added he, with encreaſing energy, triumph in your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; try to ſhake it off, ere the finger of ſcorn and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule is pointed at you, as the dupe of a deceitful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's art.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer was inexpreſſibly ſhocked: his pride had frequently repreſented as weakneſs the regret he felt for Amanda; and the Earl now ſtimulating that pride, he felt at the moment as if he could make any ſacrifice which ſhould prove his having triumphed over his unfortunate attachment; but when his father called upon him to make ſuch a ſacrifice, by uniting himſelf to Lady Euphraſia, he ſhrunk back, and acknowledged he could not give ſo fatal a proof of fortitude. He declared his total repugnance at preſent to any alliance; time, and the efforts of reaſon, he truſted would ſubdue his ill placed attachment, and enable him to comply with the wiſhes of his friends.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury would not, could not drop the ſubject next his heart, a ſubject ſo important, ſo infinitely inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting to him; he exerted all his eloquence, he entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he implored his ſon, not forever to diſappoint his wiſhes: he mentioned the compliance he had ſo recently ſhewn to his, though againſt his better judgment, in the uſeleſs conſent he had given to his marriage with Miſs Fitzalan.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer, perſecuted by his arguments, at length declared, that was the object he pointed out for his alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, any other than Lady Euphraſia Sutherland, he would not, perhaps, be ſo reluctant to comply with his wiſhes; but ſhe was a woman he could never eſteem, and muſt, conſequently, for ever refuſe; ſhe had given ſuch ſpecimens of cruelty and deceit, in the ſchemes ſhe

had entered into with the Marchioneſs, againſt (he bluſhed, he faltered, as he pronounced her name) Miſs Fitzalan, that his heart felt unutterable diſlike to her.</p>
                     <p>The Earl was prepared for this; he had the barbarity to declare, in the moſt unheſitating manner, he was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtill to find him blinded by the art of that wretched girl; he bid him reflect on her conduct, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Lord Mortimer was ſtartled; her conduct, indeed, as his father ſaid, might well make him doubt her veracity. But ſtill the evidence of the ſervants; they acknowledged having been inſtruments in forwarding the ſcheme which ſhe ſaid was laid againſt her. He mentioned this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; the Earl was alſo prepared for it; the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he declared, had been examined in his preſence, when, with ſhame and contrition they confeſt, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtrong anxiety of Lord Mortimer for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Miſs Fitzalan's fame, and tempted by the large bribes he offered, if they could or would ſay any thing in her juſtification, they had, at laſt made the allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo pleaſing to him.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer ſighed deeply; on every ſide, cried he I find I have been the dupe of art; but it was only the deceit of one could agonize my ſoul. Still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he was inex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Lady Martha was at laſt brought in as an auxilliary; ſhe was now as ſtrenuous for the connection as ever Lord Cherbury had been; a longer indulgence of Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer's grief, ſhe feared would completely undermine his health, and either render him a burthen to himſelf, or precipitate him to an early grave. Whilſt he continued ſingle, ſhe knew he would not conſider any vigorous exertions for overcoming that grief neceſſary; but if once united, ſhe was convinced, from the rectit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She joined in her brother's arguments and entreaties, with tears ſhe joined in them, and beſought Mortimer to accede to their wiſhes: ſhe called him the laſt hope of their houſe; he had long, ſhe ſaid, been the pride, the delight of their days; their comfort, their exiſtence, were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in his; if he ſunk, they ſunk with him.</p>
                     <p>The yielding ſoul of Mortimer could not reſiſt ſuch tenderneſs, and he gave a promiſe of acting as they wiſhed. He imagined he could not be more wretched; but ſcarcely had this promiſe paſt his lips, ere he felt an augmentation of miſery. To enter into new engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to reſign the ſweet, though melancholy privilege of divulging his feelings, to fetter at once both ſoul and body, were ideas that filled him with unutterable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. A thouſand times was he on the point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting his regretted and reluctant promiſe, had not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour interpoſed, and ſhewed the inability of doing ſo, without an infringement on its principles. Thus entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, Mortimer endeavoured to collect his ſcattered thoughts, and in order to try and gain ſome compoſure, he altered his former plan of acting, and mingled as much as poſſible in ſociety; he ſtrove to fly from himſelf, that by ſo doing he might fly from the corroſive remembrances which embittered his life. But who ſhall paint his ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies at the unexpected ſight of Amanda at the Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queens. The exertions he had for ſome time before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled himſelf to make, had a little abated the pain of his feelings, but that pain returned with redoubled vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence at her preſence, and every idea of preſent compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or future tranquillity, vaniſhed.

how delightful unto him; but either he durſt not do, ſituated as he then was.</p>
                     <p>With the utmoſt difficulty Lady Martha Dormer prevailed on him to be preſent, when ſhe demanded the picture from Amanda. That ſcene has already been deſcribed, alſo his parting one with her; but to deſcribe the anguiſh he endured after this period, is impoſſible. He beheld Lady Euphraſia with a degree of horror; his faltering voice refuſed even to pay her the accuſtomed compliments of meeting; he loathed the ſociety he met at the caſtle, and regardleſs of what might be thought of him; regardleſs of health, or the bleakneſs of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wandered for hours together in the moſt unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts of the domain, the veryeſt ſon of wretchedneſs and deſpair.</p>
                     <p>The day, the dreaded day at length arrived, which was to complete his miſery. The company were all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the great hall of the Caſtle, from whence they were to proceed to the Chapel and every moment expected the appearance of the bride. The Marquis, ſurpriſed at her long delay, ſent a meſſenger, to requeſt her immediate preſence, who returned in a few minutes with a letter which he preſented to the Marquis, who broke the ſeal in viſible trepidation, and found it from Lady Euphraſia.</p>
                     <p>"She had taken a ſtep," ſhe ſaid, "which ſhe muſt depend on the kind indulgence of her parents to excuſe, a ſtep which nothing but a firm conviction, that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not be experienced in an union with Lord Mortimer, ſhould have tempted her to. His uniform indifference had, at laſt convinced her, that motives, of the moſt intereſted nature, influenced his addreſſes to her, and if her parents enquired into his, or at leaſt Lord Cherbury's conduct, they would find her aſſertion true, and would conſequently, ſhe truſted, excuſe her for not ſubmitting to be ſacrificed at the ſhrine of intereſt. In ſelecting Mr. Freelove for her choice, ſhe had ſelected a man, whoſe addreſſes were not prompted by ſelfiſh views, but by a ſincere affection, which he
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:038416_0701_1011E7B7701EEC88"/>
would openly have avowed, had he not been aſſured, in the preſent ſituation of affairs, it would have met with oppoſition. To avoid, therefore, a poſitive act of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ſhe had conſented to a private union. To Lord Mortimer and Lord Cherbury," ſhe ſaid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſhe deemed no apology neceſſary for her conduct, as their hearts, at leaſt Lord Cherbury's, would at once excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate her, from his own conſciouſneſs of not having act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either generouſly or honourably to her."</p>
                     <p>The violent tranſports of paſſion the Marquis experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced are not to be deſcribed. The Marchioneſs haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſed the letter, and her feelings were not inferior in violence to his. Its contents were not known, and amazement ſat on every countenance. But oh! what joy did they inſpire in the ſoul of Lord Mortimer; not a reſpite, or rather a full pardon to the condemned wretch, at the very moment when preparing for death, could have yielded more exquiſite delight; but to Lord Cherbury, what a diſappointment! it was, indeed a death ſtroke to his hopes; the hints in Lady Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia's letter concerning him, plainly declared her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his conduct; he foreſaw an immediate demand from Freelove; foreſaw the diſgrace he ſhould experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when his inability to diſcharge that demand was known. His ſoul was ſhaken in its utmoſt receſſes, and the excruciating anguiſh of his feelings was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as ſevere a puniſhment as he could ſuffer. Pale, ſpeechleſs, aghaſt, the moſt horrid ideas took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his mind; yet he ſought not to repel them, for any thing was preferable to the ſhame he ſaw awaiting him.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer's indignation was excited by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions caſt upon his father, aſperſions he imputed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the malice of Lady Euphraſia, and which, from the character of Lord Cherbury, he deemed it unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to attempt refuting. But alas! what a ſhock did his noble, his unſuſpicious nature receive, when, in a ſhort time after the peruſal of her letter, one from Freelove was brought him, which fully proved the truth of her aſſertions. Freelove, in his little trifling manner
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:038416_0702_1011E7B90D15B370"/>
expreſſed his hopes that there would be no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between his Lordſhip and him, for whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the moſt entire frienſhip, on account of the fair lady who had honoured him with her regard: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her partiality was quite irreſiſtible: and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that in love, as in war, every advantage was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable: begged to trouble his Lordſhip with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to Lord Cherbury, and a requeſt that every thing might be prepared to ſettle matters between them on his return from his matrimonial expediton. An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate compliance with this requeſt, he was convinced, could not be in the leaſt diſtreſſing; and it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely eſſential to him, from the eclat with which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Lady Euphraſia Freelove ſhould make her bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal entry into public. As to the report, he ſaid, which he had heard relative to Lord Cherbury's loſing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which was entruſted to his care for him at the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming table, he quite diſbelieved it.</p>
                     <p>The moſt diſtreſſing, the moſt mortifying ſenſations took poſſeſſion of Lord Mortimer at this part of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it explained the reaſons of Lord Cherbury's ſtrong anxiety for an alliance with the Roſline family, which Lord Mortimer indeed had often wondered at, and he at once pitied, condemned, and bluſhed for him. He ſtole a glance at his father, and his deep deſpairing look filled him with horror. He reſolved, the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to declare his knowledge of the fatal ſecret which oppreſſed him, and his reſolution of making any ſacrifice which could poſſibly remove or leſſen his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury was anxious to fly from the now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Caſtle, ere farther confuſion overtook him. He mentioned his intention of immediately departing, an intention oppoſed by the Marquis, but in which he was ſteady, and alſo ſupported by his ſon.</p>
                     <p>Every thing was ready for their departure, when Lord Cherbury, overwhelmed by the dreadful agitations he experienced, was ſeized with a fit of the moſt violent and alarming nature; he was carried to a chamber, and recourſe was obliged to be had to a phyſician, ere the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:038416_0703_1011E7BCEE127AB8"/>
reſtoration of his ſenſes were effected; but he was then ſo weak, that the phyſician declared, if not kept quiet, a return of his diſorder might be expected.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer, tenderly impatient to lighten the burthen of his father's mind, diſmiſſed the attendants as ſoon as he poſſibly could, and then in the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate terms declared his knowledge of his ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury at this ſtarted up in the moſt violent paroxiſm of anguiſh, and vowed he would never ſurvive the diſcovery of his being a villain. With difficulty could Lord Mortimer compoſe him; but it was long ere he could prevail on him to hear what he wiſhed to ſay.</p>
                     <p>Few there were, he ſaid, who at ſome period of their lives, he believed, were not led into actions which upon reflection they had reaſon to regret; he thought not, he meant not to ſpeak ſlightly of human nature, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſhed to prove, that liable as we all are to frailty—a frailty intended no doubt to check the arrogance of pride and preſumption, we ſhould not ſuffer the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of error, when once ſincerely repented of, to plunge us into deſpair, particularly when, as far as in our power, we meant to atone for it."</p>
                     <p>Thus did Lord Mortimer attempt to calm the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conflicts of his father's mind, who ſtill continued to inveigh againſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"The ſale of Tudor Hall," Lord Mortimer proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "and mortgages upon Lord Cherbury's eſtates, would enable his father to diſcharge his debt to Mr. Freelove. He knew," he ſaid, "it was tenderneſs to him which had prevented him ere this from adopting ſuch a plan; but he beſought him to let no farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration on his account make him delay fulfilling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the claims of honour and juſtice. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to believe his tranquillity was more precious to him than any thing in life, that the reſtoration of his peace was far more eſtimable to him than the poſſeſſion of the moſt brilliant fortune; a poſſeſſion which," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Lord Mortimer, deeply ſighing, "I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, will not alone yield happineſs. I have long," ſaid he, "looked with an eye of cool indifference on the pomps

At the poſt of danger I may perhaps have the happineſs of performing ſervices for my country, which while loitering ſupinely in the ſhade of proſperity I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could have done. Thus, my dear father," he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, "you ſee how erroneous we are in opinions we often form of things, ſince what we often conſider as the bittereſt evil leads to the moſt ſupreme good. We will, as ſoon as poſſible, haſten every thing to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Freelove, and thus, I make no doubt, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the little malice of his ſoul.</p>
                     <p>"My aunt, my ſiſter, are unacquainted with your uneaſineſs, nor ſhall an intimation of it from me ever tranſpire to them: of fortune, ſufficient will remain to allow, though not the ſplendours, the comforts and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of life. As for me, the deprivation of what is conſidered and falſely termed my accuſtomed indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, will be the moſt ſalutary and efficacious thing that could poſſibly happen to me. In ſhort, I believe that the realization of my plan will render me happy, ſince, with truth I can aſſure you, its anticipation has already given more pleaſure to my ſoul, than I thought it would ever have again enjoyed."</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury, overcome by the tenderneſs, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his ſon, by the ſacrifice he ſo willingly offered, ſo ſtrenuouſly inſiſted on making, of his paternal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, could not for ſome minutes ſpeak. At length the ſtruggling emotions of his ſoul found utterance.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! virtue," he exclaimed, while tears of love, of gratitude, of contrition, flowed from his eyes, and fell
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:038416_0705_1011E7C280F58390"/>
upon the hand of his ſon, claſped within his, "oh! vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, I cannot ſay, like Brutus, thou art but a ſhade: no, here in this invaluable ſon thou art perſonified—this ſon whom I ſo cruelly deceived, ſo bitterly diſtreſt.—Oh! gracious powers, would not that heroic, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven born diſpoſition, which now le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Oh! had I confided in him, what an act of baſeneſs ſhould I have avoided? what pangs, what tortures, ſhould I have prevented his experiencing? but to ſave my own guilty confuſion, I drew wretchedneſs upon his head, I wrung every fibre of his heart with agony, by making him believe its deareſt, its moſt valued object unworthy of its regards."</p>
                     <p>Mortimer ſtarted—he gaſped—he repeated, in faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering accents, theſe laſt words; his ſoul ſeemed as if it would burſt its mortal bounds, and ſoar to another region, to hear an avowal of his Amanda's purity.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Mortimer," cried the Earl, in the deep deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding tone of anguiſh, "how ſhall I dare to lift my eyes to thine, after the avowal of the injuſtice I have done one of the moſt amiable and lovelieſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! tell me," cried Mortimer, in breathleſs, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling agitation, "tell me if indeed ſhe is all my fond heart once believed her to be? in mercy, in pity, delay not to inform me?"</p>
                     <p>Slowly, in conſequence of his weakneſs, but with all the willingneſs of a contrite ſpirit, anxious to do juſtice to the injured, did Lord Cherbury reveal all that had paſſed between him and Amanda. "Poor Fitzalan," cried he as he finiſhed his relation, "poor, unhappy friend; from thy cold grave couldſt thou have known the tranſactions of this world, how muſt thy good and feeling ſpirit have reproached me for my barbarity to thy orphan, in robbing her of the only ſtipend thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe fortune had power to leave her—a pure and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fame?"</p>
                     <p>

Lord Mortimer groaned with anguiſh; every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful word he had uttered to Amanda darted upon his remembrance, and were like ſo many daggers to his heart. It was his father that oppreſſed her; this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge aggravated his feelings, but ſtifled his reproaches: it was a father, contrite, perhaps at that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtretched upon a death bed—therefore he forgave him.</p>
                     <p>He caſt his eyes around, as if in that moment he had hoped to behold her, have an opportunity of falling proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate at her feet, and imploring her forgiveneſs: he caſt his eyes around, as if imagining he ſhould ſee her, and be allowed to fold her to his beating heart, and aſk her ſoft voice to pronounce his pardon.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! thou lovely mourner," he exclaimed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, while a guſh of ſorrow burſt from his eyes, "oh! thou lovely mourner, when I cenſured, reviled, upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, even at that very period your heart was ſuffering the moſt excruciating anguiſh: Yes, Amanda, he who would willingly have laid down life to yield thee peace, even he was led to aggravate thy woes; with what gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, what unexampled patience didſt thou bear my reproaches! no ſudden ray of indignation for purity ſo inſulted, innocence ſo arraigned, flaſhed from thy eyes; the beams of meekneſs and reſignation alone ſtole from beneath their tearful lids.</p>
                     <p>"No ſweet hope of being able to atone, no delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful idea of being able to make reparation for my injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, now alleviates the poignancy of my feelings; ſince fate interpoſed between us in the hour of proſperity, I cannot, in the bleak and chilling period of adverſity, ſeek to unite your deſtiny with mine, now almoſt the child of want myſelf, a ſoldier of fortune, obliged by the ſword to earn bread, I cannot think of leading you into difficulties and dangers greater than you ever before experienced. Oh! my Amanda, may the calm ſhade of ſecurity be forever thine, thy Mortimer, thy ever faithful, ever adoring Mortimer, will not, from any ſelfiſh conſideration, ſeek to lead thee from it.

poſſeſs, but to ſee thee in danger or diſtreſs; I will go then into new ſcenes of life, with only thy dear, thy ſweet and worſhipped idea to cheer and to ſupport me; an idea I ſhall loſe but with life, and which to know I may cheriſh, indulge, adore, without a reproach from reaſon for weakneſs in ſo doing, is a ſweet and ſoothing conſolation."</p>
                     <p>The indulgence of feelings, ſuch as his language ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, he was obliged to forego, in order to fulfil the wiſh he felt of alleviating the ſituation of his father; but his attention was unable to lighten the anguiſh which oppreſſed the mind of Lord Cherbury; remorſe for his paſt conduct, mortification at being leſſened in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſon, ſorrow for the injury he was compelled to do him, to be extricated from the power of Freelove, all preyed upon his mind, produced the moſt violent agitations, and an alarming repetition of fits.</p>
                     <p>Things remained in this ſituation for a few days, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time no intelligence had been received of Euphraſia, when one morning, when Lord Mortimer was ſitting for a few minutes with the Marquis and Marchioneſs, a ſervant entered the apartment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Lord that a gentleman was juſt arrived at the Caſtle, who requeſted to be introduced to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. The Marquis and Marchioneſs inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded this was ſome perſon ſent as an interceſſor from Lady Euphraſia, and they inſtantly admitted him, in order to have an opportunity of aſſuring her Ladyſhip, through his means, it muſt be ſome time (if indeed at all) ere they could poſſibly forgive her diſreſpect and diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer would have retired, but was requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtay, and complied, prompted indeed by curioſity to hear what kind of apology or meſſage lady Euphraſia had ſent. A man of a moſt pleaſing appearance entered, and was received with the moſt frigid politeneſs. He looked embarraſſed, agitated, even diſtreſſed. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted ſeveral times to ſpeak, but the words ſtill died away undiſtinguiſhed. At length the Marchioneſs, yielding to the natural impetuoſity of her ſoul, haſtily
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:038416_0708_1011E7CAD2C5C940"/>
deſired he would reveal what had procured them the honour of his viſit.</p>
                     <p>"A circumſtance of the moſt unhappy nature, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," he replied, in a heſitating voice, "I came with the hope, the expectation of being able to break it by degrees, ſo as not totally to overpower, but I find myſelf unequal to the diſtreſſing taſk."</p>
                     <p>"I fancy, Sir," cried the Marchioneſs, "both the Marquis and I are already aware of the circumſtance you allude to."</p>
                     <p>"Alas! Madam," ſaid the ſtranger, fixing his eyes with a mournful earneſtneſs on her face, "I cannot think ſo; if you were, it would not be in human, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal nature to appear as you now do." He ſtopped, he turned pale, he trembled, his emotions became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious.</p>
                     <p>"Tell me," ſaid the Marquis, in a voice ſcarcely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate, "I beſeech you, without delay, the meaning of your words."</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger eſſayed to ſpeak, but could not; words indeed were ſcarcely neceſſary to declare that he had ſomething ſhocking to reveal. His auditors, like old Northumberland, might have ſaid, "The paleneſs on thy cheeks is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand."</p>
                     <p>"Something dreadful has happened to my child," ſaid the Marchioneſs, forgetting at that agonizing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! Madam," cried the ſtranger, while a trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tear denoted his ſenſibility for the ſorrows he was about giving riſe to; "alas! Madam, your fears are too well founded; to torture you with longer ſuſpence would be barbarity. Something dreadful has happened indeed—Lady Euphraſia in this world will never more be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your kindneſs." A wild, a piercing, agonizing ſhriek burſt from the lips of the Marchioneſs as ſhe dropped ſenſeleſs from her ſeat. The Marquis was ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his had not Lord Mortimer, who ſat by him, timely ſtarted up, and though trembling himſelf with horror, caught him in his arms.

This was one of the events which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in its infinite wiſdom, makes uſe of to arreſt the thoughtleſs in their career of diſſipation, and check the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance of pride and vanity; when we behold the proud, the wealthy, the illuſtrious, ſuddenly ſurpriſed by calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and ſinking beneat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thus a ſimilar misfortune happening to a perſon in a conſpicuous, and to one in an obſcure ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, would not, in all probability, equally affect or call home the wandering thoughts to ſadneſs and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The humble floweret, trampled to the duſt, is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on with an eye of careleſs indifference; but the proud oak, torn from the earth, and levelled by the ſtorm, is viewed with wonder and affright. The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the blow, which overwhelmed the Marquis and Marchioneſs, were augmented by the ſecret whiſpers of conſcience, that ſeemed to ſay it was a blow of retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from a Being all righteous, and all juſt, whoſe moſt ſacred laws they had violated, in oppreſſing the widow and defrauding the orphan. Oh! what an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of miſery is it to think it merited; remorſe, like the vengeance of Heaven, ſeemed awakened now to ſleep no more; no longer could they palliate their conduct, no

longer avoid retroſpection, a retroſpection which height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the gloomy horrors of the future. In Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia all the hopes, the affections of the Marquis and Marchionſs were centered; ſhe alone had ever made them feel the tenderneſs of humanity, yet ſhe was not leſs the darling of their love, than the idol of their pride; in her they beheld the being who was to ſupport the honours of their houſe, and tranſmit their names to poſterity; in her they beheld the being who gave them an opportunity of gratifying the malevolent, as well as tender and ambitious paſſions of their ſouls; the next heir to the Marquis's title and fortune had irreconcilably diſobliged him, as a means therefore of diſappointing him, if on no other account, Lady Euphraſia would have been regarded by them.</p>
                     <p>Though ſhe had diſappointed and diſpleaſed them by her recent act of diſobedience, and though they had deemed it eſſential to their conſequence to diſplay that diſpleaſure, yet they ſecretly reſolved not long to withhold forgiveneſs from her, and alſo to take imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſteps for ennobling Freelove.</p>
                     <p>For Lady Euphraſia they felt indeed a tenderneſs, her heart for them was totally a ſtranger to; it ſeemed indeed as if cold and indifferent to all mankind, their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were ſtronger for being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Freelove as the ward of Lord Cherbury in honour to him had been invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the nuptials; he accepted the invitation, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of accompanying, promiſed to follow the bridal party to the caſtle. A day or two ere he intended ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, by ſome accidental chance, he got into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the very perſon to whom Lord Cherbury had loſt ſo much, and on whoſe account he had committed an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which had entailed the moſt excruciating remorſe upon him; this perſon was acquainted with the whole tranſaction; he had promiſed to keep his knowledge ſecret but the promiſes of the worthleſs are of little avail.

                        </gap>ancorous deſire of revenge. His unexpectedly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Freelove afforded him an opportunity of gratifying both theſe propenſities, and he ſcrupled not to avail himſelf of it. Freelove was aſtoniſhed, and when the firſt violence of aſtoniſhment was over, delighted.</p>
                     <p>To triumph over the proud ſoul of Lord Cherbury and his ſon, was indeed an idea which afforded rapture; both he had ever diſliked, the latter particularly: he diſliked him from the ſuperiority which he ſaw in every reſpect he poſſeſſed over himſelf. A ſtranger to noble emulation, he ſought not by ſtudy or imitation to aſpire to any of thoſe graces or perfections he beheld in Lord Mortimer, he ſought alone to depreciate them, and when he found that impoſſible, beheld him with greater envy and malignity than ever. To wound Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer through the boſom of his father, to overwhelm him with confuſion, by publicly diſplaying the error of that father, were ideas of the moſt exquiſite delight—ideas which the wealth of worlds would ſcarcely have tempted him to forego; ſo ſweet is any triumph, however acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental or imaginary, over a noble object to an envious mind, which ever hates that excellence it cannot reach. No fear of ſelf intereſt being injured checked his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; the fortune of Lord Cherbury he knew ſufficient to anſwer for his violating truſt; thus had he another ſource of triumph in the proſpect of having thoſe ſo long conſidered as the proud rivals of his wealth and ſplendor, caſt into the ſhade: his pleaſure, however, from this idea was ſhort lived, when he reflected that Lord Mortimer's union with Lady Euphraſia, would to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally exempt him from feeling any inconveniency from his father's conduct: but could not this union be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented? Freelove aſked himſelf; he ſtill wanted a ſhort period of being of age, conſequently had no right at preſent to demand a ſettlement of his affairs from Lord Cherbury; he might, however, privately inform La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Euphraſia of the affair ſo recently communicated to him. No ſooner did he conceive this ſcheme, than he
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:038416_0712_1011E7D59655D5A0"/>
glowed with impatience to put it in execution: he haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to the Marquis's, whither indeed he extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and foppiſh preparations he had made for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected nuptials had before prevented his going, and took the firſt opportunity which offered of revealing to Lady Euphraſia, as if from the pureſt friendſhip, the conduct of Lord Cherbury and the derangement of his affairs.</p>
                     <p>Lady Euphraſia was at once ſurpriſed and incenſed; the reaſon for an union between her and his ſon being ſo ardently deſired by Lord Cherbury, was now fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and ſhe beheld herſelf as an object addreſſed merely from a view of repairing a ruined fortune; but this view ſhe reſolved to diſappoint. Such was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable nature of her diſpoſition, that had this diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment occaſioned the deſtruction of her own peace, it would not have made her relinquiſh it, but this was not the caſe; in ſacrificing all ideas of a union with Lord Mortimer to her offended pride, ſhe ſacrificed no wiſh or inclination of her ſoul. Lord Mortimer, though the object of her admiration, had never been the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her love; ſhe was indeed incapable of feeling that paſſion; her admiration had, however, long ſince given place to reſentment, at the cool indifference with which he regarded her; ſhe would have oppoſed a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with him, but for a fear that he might, thus freed, attach himſelf to Amanda. The moment, however, ſhe knew an union with her was neceſſary for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his fortune, fear, with every conſideration which could oppoſe it, vaniſhed before the idea of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointing his views and retaliating upon him that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs he had, from wounded pride, made her expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience by his cold and unaltered behaviour to her.</p>
                     <p>She at firſt determined to acquaint the Marquis of what ſhe had heard, but a little reflection made her drop this determination. He had always profeſſed a warm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for Lord Cherbury, and ſhe feared that regard would ſtill lead him to inſiſt on the nuptials taking place; ſhe was not long in concerting a ſcheme to render ſuch a meaſure impracticable, and Freelove ſhe reſolved to make
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:038416_0713_1011E7D83340C5F8"/>
an inſtrument for forwarding, or rather executing her revenge. She heſitated not to ſay ſhe had always diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iked Lord Mortimer, that in ſhort there was but one being ſhe could ever think, ever hope to be happy with. Her broken ſentences, her looks, her affected confuſion, all revealed to Freelove that he was that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; the rapture this diſcovery inſpired he could not conceal; the flattering expreſſions of Lady Euphraſia were rapid by the moſt extravagant compliments, the warmeſt profeſſions, the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of never dying love; this ſoon led to what ſhe deſired, and in a ſhort ſpace an elopement was agreed to, and every thing relative to it ſettled.—Freelove's own ſervants and equipage were at the Caſtle, and conſequently but little difficulty attended the arrangement of their plan. In Lady Euphraſia's eyes Freelove had no other value than what he now merely derived from being an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in gratifying the haughty and revengeful paſſions of her nature. She regarded him indeed with ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign contempt; his fortune, however, ſhe knew would give him conſequence in the world, and ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſhe ſhould find him quite that eaſy convenient huſband, which a woman of faſhion finds ſo neceſſary: in ſhort, ſhe looked forward to being the uncontrouled miſtreſs of her own actions, and without a doubt but that ſhe ſhould meet many objects as deſerving her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and infinitely more grateful for it than ever Lord Mortimer had been.</p>
                     <p>Fluſhed with ſuch pleaſing proſpects, ſhe quitted the Caſtle—that Caſtle ſhe was deſtined never more to ſee; at the moment, the very moment ſhe ſmiled with joy and expectation, the ſhaft, the unerring ſhaft was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt her breaſt.</p>
                     <p>The marriage ceremony over, they haſtened to the vicinity of the caſtle, in order to ſend an apologizing letter as uſual on ſuch occaſions. The night was dark and dreary, the road rugged and dangerous, the poſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ventured to ſay, it would be better to halt for the night, but this was oppoſed by Lady Euphraſia. They were within a few miles of the deſtined termination of their journey, and purſuant to her commands they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.

In a few minutes after this the horſes, ſtartled by a ſudden light which gleamed acroſs the path, began plunging in the moſt alarming manner. A frightful precipice lay on one ſide, and the horſes, in ſpite of all the efforts of the poſtillions, continued to approach it. Freelove, in this dreadful moment, loſt all conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but for himſelf—he burſt open the chariot door, and leaped into the road. His companion was unable to follow his example; ſhe had fainted at the firſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of danger. The poſtillions with difficulty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted; the other ſervants came to their aſſiſtance, and endeavoured to reſtrain the horſes: every effort was uſeleſs, they broke from their hold, and plunged down the precipice. The ſervants had heard the chariot door open, they therefore concluded, for it was too dark to ſee, that both their maſter and Lady Euphraſia were ſafe. But who can deſcribe their horror, when a loud ſhriek from him declared her ſituation. Some of them immediately haſtened, as faſt as their trembling limbs could carry them, to the houſe adjoining the road, from whence the fatal light had gleamed, which cauſed the ſad cataſtrophe; they revealed it in a few words, and implored immediate aſſiſtance. The maſter of the houſe was a man of the greateſt humanity, he was inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhocked at what he had heard, and joined himſelf in giving the aſſiſtance that was deſired.</p>
                     <p>With lanthorns they proceeded down a winding path, cut in the precipice, and ſoon diſcovered the objects of their ſearch. The horſes were already dead, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot was ſhattered to pieces; they took up ſome of the fragments and diſcovered beneath them the lifeleſs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the unfortunate Lady Euphraſia.</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger burſt into tears at a ſight of ſo much horror, and in a voice ſcarcely audable, gave orders for her being conveyed to his houſe; but when a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light gave a more perfect view of the mangled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, all acknowledged that, ſince ſo fatal an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent had befallen her, Heaven was merciful in taking a life, whoſe continuance would have made her endure the moſt excruciating tortures.</p>
                     <p>

Freelove was now enquired for; he had fainted on the road, but in a few minutes after he was brought in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his ſenſes, and the firſt uſe he made of them was to enquire whether he was dead or alive; upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the comfortable aſſurance of the latter, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated himſelf in a manner ſo warm, upon his eſcape, as plainly proved ſelf was his whole and ſole conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No great preparations, on account of his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, was requiſite to inform him of the fate of Lady Euphraſia; he ſhook his head on hearing it; ſaid it was what he already gueſſed, from the deviliſh plunge of the horſes; declared it was a moſt unfortunate affair, and expreſſed a kind of terror <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> what the Marquis might ſay to it, as if he could have been accuſed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acceſſary to it.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Murry, the gentleman whoſe houſe had received him, offered to undertake the diſtreſſing taſk of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affair to Lady Euphraſias family, an offer Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love gladly accepted, declaring he felt himſelf too much diſordered in mind and body to be able to give any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections relative to what was neceſſary to be done.</p>
                     <p>How Mr. Murry executed his taſk is already known; but it was long ere the emotions of the Marquis would ſuffer him to ſay, he wiſhed the remains of Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia to be brought to the Caſtle, that all the honours due to her birth ſhould be paid them. This was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done, and the Caſtle, ſo lately ornamented for her nuptials, was hung with black, and all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantries of death.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis and Marchioneſs confined themſelves, in the deepeſt anguiſh, to their apartments: their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics, filled with terror and amazement, glided about like pale ſpectres, and all was a ſcene of ſolemnity and ſadneſs.</p>
                     <p>Every moment Lord Mortimer could ſpare from his father he devoted to the Marquis. Lady Euphraſia had ever been an object of indifference, nay, of diſlike to him; but the manner of her death, notwithſtanding, ſhocked him to the ſoul; his diſlike was forgotten; he thought of her only with pity and compaſſion, and the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:038416_0716_1011E7E14819F1B0"/>
tears he mingled with the Marquis were the tears of unfeigned ſympathy and regret.</p>
                     <p>Lady Martha and Lady Araminta were equally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the Marchioneſs; the time not ſpent with Lord Cherbury was devoted to her. They uſed not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing arguments to conquer a grief which nature as her rightful tribute demands; but they ſoothed that grief by ſhewing they ſincerely mourned its ſource.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury had but ſhort intervals of reaſon; thoſe intervals were employed by Lord Mortimer in trying to compoſe his mind, and by him in bleſſing his ſon for thoſe endeavours, and congratulating himſelf on the proſpect of approaching diſſolution.</p>
                     <p>His words unutterably affected Lord Mortimer, he had reaſon to believe they were dictated by a prophetic ſpirit; and the diſmal peal which rung from morning till night for Lady Euphraſia, ſounded in his ear as the knell of his expiring father.</p>
                     <p>Things were in this ſituation in the Caſtle, when Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car and his friend, Sir Charles Bingley, arrived at it, and without ſending in their names, requeſted immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate permiſſion to the Marquis's preſence, upon buſineſs of importance.</p>
                     <p>Their requeſt was complied with, from an idea that they came from Freelove, to whom the Marquis and Marchioneſs, from reſpect and affection to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their daughter, had determined to pay every attention.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis knew and was perſonally known to Sir Charles; he was infinitely ſurpriſed by his appearance; but how much was that ſurpriſe increaſed, when Sir Charles, taking Oſcar by the hand, preſented him to the Marquis as the ſon of Lady Fitzalan, the rightful heir of the Earl of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The Marquis was confounded—he trembled at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe words: and his confuſion, had ſuch a teſtimony been wanting, would have been ſufficient to prove his guilt.</p>
                     <p>He at laſt, though with a faultering voice, deſired to know by what means Sir Charles could juſtify or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his aſſertion.</p>

Sir Charles, for Oſcar was too much agitated to ſpeak, as briefly as poſſible related all the particulars which had led to the diſcovery of the Earl's will; and his friend, he added, with the generoſity of a noble mind, wiſhed as much as poſſible to ſpare the feelings and ſave the honour of thoſe with whom he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected; with which nothing but a heſitation in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with his juſt, and well ſupported claim, could deſtroy.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis's agitation increaſed; already was he ſtript of happineſs, and he now ſaw himſelf on the point of being ſtripped of honour. An hour before he had imagined his wretchedneſs could not be augmented; he was now convinced human miſery cannot be complete without the loſs of reputation. In the idea of being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, of being thought undeſerving our misfortunes, there is a ſweet, a ſecret balm, which meliorates the greateſt ſorrow. Of riches, in his own right, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ever poſſeſſed more than ſufficient for all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; thoſe expences would now, comparatively ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be reduced within very narrow bounds; for the vain pride-which had led him to delight in pomp and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, died with Lady <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Since therefore of his fortune ſuch a ſuper abundance would remain, it was unneceſſary as well as unjuſt, to detain what he had no pretenſions to: but he feared tamely acquieſcing to this unexpected claim, would be to acknowledge himſelf a villain: 'tis true, indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his newly felt remorſe had inſpired him with a wiſh of making reparation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Irreſolute how to act, he ſat for ſome time ſilent and embarraſſed, till at laſt recollecting his manner was probably betraying what he wiſhed to conceal, namely, his knowledge of the will, he ſaid, with ſome ſternneſs, "that till he inſpected into the affair, ſo recently laid before him, he could not, nor was it to be expected he

ſhould, ſay how he would act: an inſpection which, under the melancholy circumſtances he then laboured, he could not paſſibly make for ſome <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>time Had Mr. Fitzalan," he added, "poſſeſſed in reality that genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity Sir Charles's partiality aſcribed to him, he would not at a period ſo diſtreſſing have appeared to make ſuch a claim. To delicacy and ſenſibility the privileges of grief were ever held ſacred; thoſe privileges they had both violated; they had intruded on his ſorrows; they had even inſulted him, by appearing on ſuch a buſineſs before him, ere the laſt rites were paid to his lamented child."</p>
                     <p>Sir Charles and Oſcar were inexpreſſibly ſhocked; both were totally ignorant of the recent event.</p>
                     <p>Oſcar, as he recovered from the ſurpriſe the Marquis's words had given him, declared, in the impaſſioned lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a noble mind, hurt by being thought deſtitute of ſenſibility, "that the Marquis had arraigned him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly; had he known of his ſorrows," he ſaid, "nothing ſhould have tempted him to intrude upon them: he mourned, he reſpected them: he beſought him to believe him ſincere in what he uttered." A tear, an involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tear, as he ſpoke, ſtarted into his eye, and trickling down his cheek, denoted his ſincerity.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis's heart ſmote him as he beheld this tear; it reproached him more than the keeneſt words could have done, and operated more in Oſcar's favour than any arguments, however eloquent.</p>
                     <p>Had this young man, thought he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been really illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral when I reproached him for want of ſenſibility, how well might he have retaliated upon me my more fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant want of juſtice and humanity; but no, he ſees I am a ſon of ſorrow, and he will not break the reed which Heaven had already ſmitten.</p>
                     <p>Tears guſhed from his eyes: he involuntarily extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand to Oſcar; "I ſee," ſaid he, "I ſee indeed, I have unjuſtly arraigned you, but I will endeavour to atone for my error; at preſent reſt ſatisfied with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that whatever is equitable ſhall be done, and that, let events turn out as they may, I ſhall ever feel

myſelf your friend." Oſcar again expreſſed his regret for having waited on him at ſuch a period, and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he would diſmiſs for the preſent the ſubject they had been talking of from his mind; the Marquis ſtill more pleaſed with his manner, deſired his direction, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him he ſhould hear from him ſooner than he expected.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as they retired his agitation decreaſed, and of courſe he was better qualified to conſider how he ſhould act; that reſtitution his conſcience prompted, but his falſe ideas of ſhame had prevented, he now found he ſhould be compelled to make; how to make it therefore, ſo as to avoid total diſgrace, was what he conſidered. At laſt he adopted a ſcheme, which the ſenſibility of Oſcar, he flattered himſelf, would enable him to accompliſh: this was to declare, that by the Earl of Dunreath's will Mr. Fitzalan was heir to his eſtates, in caſe of the death of Lady Euphraſia; that in conſequence therefore of this event he had come to take poſſeſſion of them; that Lady Dunreath (whoſe reſidence at Dunreath Abbey he could not now hope to conceal) was but lately returned from a convent in France, where for many years ſhe has reſided. To Oſcar he intended ſaying, from her ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct he and the Marchioneſs had been tempted to ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her from the world, in order to ſave her from open ſhame and deriſion; and that her declaration of a will they had always believed the mere fabrication of her brain, in order, as he ſuppoſed, to give them uneaſineſs. This ſcheme once formed, his heart felt a little relieved of the heavy burthen of fear and inquietude. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the Marchioneſs's apartment, and broke the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair gently to her, adding at the ſame time, that ſenſible as they now muſt be of the vanities and purſuits of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, it was time for them to endeavour to make their peace with heaven. Affliction had taught penitence to the Marchioneſs, as well as to her huſband; ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of his ſcheme, and thought with him, that the ſooner their intention of making reſtitution was known, the greater would be the probability of its being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. Oſcar, therefore, the next day received a letter
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038416_0720_1011E7EB835D5018"/>
from the Marquis, ſpecifying at once his intention and his wiſhes. With thoſe wiſhes Oſcar generouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: his noble ſoul was ſuperior to a triumph over a fallen enemy; and he had always wiſhed rather to ſave from, than expoſe the Marquis to diſgrace; he haſtened as ſoon as poſſible to the caſtle, agreeable to a requeſt contained in the letter, to aſſure the Marquis his conduct throughout the whole affair ſhould be regulated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his deſire.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps at this moment public contempt could not have humbled the Marquis more than ſuch generoſity, when he drew a compariſon between himſelf and the perſon the had ſo long injured; the ſtriking contraſt wounded his very ſoul, and he groaned at the degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſuffered in his own eyes. He told Oſcar, as ſoon as the laſt ſad duties were performed to his daughter, he would ſettle every thing with him, and then perhaps be able to introduce him to the Marchioneſs. He deſired he might take up his reſidence in the Caſtle, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a wiſh that he would attend the funeral of Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia as one of the chief mourners. Oſcar declined the former; but promiſed, with a faltering voice, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the latter requeſt. He then retired, and the Marquis, who had been rouſed from the indulgence of his grief by a wiſh of preſerving his character, again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed into its wretchedneſs. He deſired Oſcar to make no ſecret of his now being heir to the Earl of Dunreath, and ſaid he would mention it himſelf in his family; through this medium therefore did this ſurpriſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence reach Lord Mortimer, and his heart dilated with ſudden joy at the idea of his Amanda and her brother at laſt enjoying independence and proſperity.</p>
                     <p>In a few hours after this the ſufferings of Lord Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury were terminated; his laſt faltering accents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced bleſſings on his ſon. Oh! how ſweet were theſe bleſſings—how different were the feelings of Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer from the callous ſons of diſſipation, who ſeem to watch with impatience the laſt ſtruggles of a parent, that they may have more extenſive means of gratifying their inordinate deſires. The feelings of Lord Mortimer
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:038416_0721_1011E7EE9C42BDC0"/>
were ſoothed, by reflecting that he had done every thing in his power for reſtoring the tranquillity of his father, and his regret was leſſened by the conviction that Lord Cherbury, after the diſcovery of his conduct, could never more in this life have experienced happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he therefore, with tender piety, reſigned him to his God, humbly truſting that his penitence had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned for his frailties, and inſured him felicity.</p>
                     <p>He now bid adieu to the caſtle and its wretched own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and accompanied Lady Martha and his ſiſter to Thornbury, at which the burying place of the family lay. Here he continued till the remains of his father arrived, and were interred; he then proceeded to London, to put into execution the plan he had projected for his father: He immediately advertiſed the Tudor eſtate; a ſtep of this kind could not be concealed from Lady Martha; but the mortgages on the other eſtates he reſolved care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to guard from her knowledge, leſt ſuſpicions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the memory of his father would ariſe in her mind; but during this period the idea of Amanda was not abſent from his ſoul: neither grief nor buſineſs could baniſh it a moment, and again a thouſand fond and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering hopes concerning her had revived, when a ſudden blow diſperſed them all, and plunged him, if poſſible, in greater wretchedneſs than he had ever before experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He heard it confidently reported, that the Earl of Dunreath's ſiſter (for Oſcar had by this time claimed, and been allowed to take the title of his grandfather) was to be married to Sir Charles Bingley; the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which he knew ſubſiſted between the Earl and Sir Charles rendered this too probable; but if a doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it ſtill lingered in his mind, it was deſtroyed, when Sir Charles waited on him to treat about the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Tudor Hall, it inſtantly occurring that this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe was made by the deſire of Amanda. Unable to command his feelings, he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed Sir Charles to his agent, and abruptly retired. He called her cruel and ungrateful; after all his ſufferings on her account, did he deſerve ſo ſoon to be baniſhed her remembrance, ſo ſoon ſupplanted in her affections by another, by one too

who never had, who never would have an opportunity of giving ſuch proofs as he had done of conſtancy and love? She is loſt then, he ſighed! ſhe is loſt for ever! Oh! what avails the vindication of her fame? Is it not an augmentation of my miſery? Oh! my father, of what a treaſure did you deſpoil me? but let me not diſturb the ſacred aſhes of the dead—reſt—reſt—in peace—thou venerable author of my being, and may the involuntary expreſſions of heart rending anguiſh be forgiven! Amanda, then, he continued, after a pauſe, will indeed be miſtreſs of Tudor Hall; but never will a ſigh for him who once was its owner heave her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; ſhe will wander beneath thoſe ſhades, where ſo often ſhe has heard my vows of unalterable love—vows, which alas! my heart has too fully obſerved, and liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ſimilar ones from Sir Charles; well, this is the laſt ſtroke fate can level at my peace.</p>
                     <p>Lord Mortimer (or as in future we muſt ſtile him, Lord Cherbury) had indeed imagined that the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Amanda, like his own, were unalterable; he had therefore indulged the rapturous idea, that, by again ſeeking an union with her, he ſhould promote the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of both. It is true, he knew ſhe would poſſeſs a fortune infinitely ſuperior to what he had now a right to expect; but after the proofs he had given of diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted attachment, not only ſhe, but the world, he was convinced, would acquit him of any ſelfiſh motives in the renewal of his addreſſes. His hopes deſtroyed, his proſpects blaſted, by what he heard, he reſolved as ſoon as his affairs were ſettled, to go abroad. The death of his father had rendered his entering the army unneceſſary, and his ſpirits were too much broken, his health too much impaired, for him voluntarily now to embrace that deſtiny.</p>
                     <p>On the purchaſe of Tudor-Hall being completed by Sir Charles, it was neceſſary for Lord Cherbury to ſee his ſteward; he preferred going to ſending for him, prompted indeed by a melancholy wiſh of paying a laſt viſit to Tudor-Hall, endeared to his heart by a thouſand fond remembrances. On his arrival he took up his abode
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:038416_0723_1011E7F45272B3B8"/>
at the ſteward's for a day or two, after a ſtrict injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him of concealing his being there; it was after a ramble through every ſpot about the demeſne, which he had ever trodden with Amanda, that he repaired to the library and diſcovered her; he was ignorant of her being in the country.—Oh! then, how great was his ſurpriſe—how exquiſite his emotions at her unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſight!</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall not attempt to go over the ſcene I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready tried to deſcribe; ſuffice it to ſay, that the deſire ſhe betrayed of haſtening from him he imputed to the alteration of her ſentiments with reſpect to him and Sir Charles; when undeceived in this reſpect, his rapture was as great as ever it had before been at the idea of her love, and like Amanda, he declared his ſufferings were now amply rewarded."</p>

                     <p>BUT, my love, cried Lord Cherbury, as he wiped away the tears which pity and horror at the fate of Lady Euphraſia had cauſed Amanda to ſhed. "Will your brother think you ſanction our happineſs? will he, who might aſpire ſo high for a ſiſter, thus at once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of beauty and fortune, beſtow her on one whoſe title may now almoſt be conſidered as an empty one?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! do not wrong his noble nature by ſuch a doubt," exclaimed Amanda, "Yes, with pride, with pleaſure, with delight, will he beſtow his ſiſter upon the eſteemed, the beloved of her heart; upon him who, unwarped by narrow prejudice or ſelfiſh intereſt, fought her in the low
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:038416_0724_1011E7F852A6A0B0"/>
ſhade of obſcurity, to lay all friendleſs and forlorn as ſhe was, his fortune at her feet.</p>
                     <p>"Could he indeed be ungrateful to ſuch kindneſs; could he attempt to influence me to another choice, my heart would at once repulſe the effort, and avow its fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed determination: but he is incapable of ſuch conduct; my Oſcar is all that is generous and feeling: need I ſay more, than that a ſpirit congenial to your's animates his breaſt."</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury claſped her to his heart; "Deareſt, lovelieſt of human beings," he exclaimed, "ſhall I at length call you mine? After all my ſorrows, my diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, ſhall I indeed receive ſo precious a reward? Oh! wonder not, my Amanda, if I doubt the reality of ſo ſudden a reverſe of ſituation; I feel as if under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a happy dream; but good Heaven! a dream from which I ſhould never wiſh to be awakened."</p>
                     <p>Amanda now recollected, that if ſhe ſtaid much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the cottage ſhe ſhould have ſome one coming in queſt of her; ſhe informed Lord Cherbury of this, and roſe to depart, but he would not ſuffer her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part alone, neither did ſhe deſire it.</p>
                     <p>The nurſe and her daughter Betſy were in the cottage at her return to it: to deſcribe the ſurpriſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer at the appearance of Lord Cherbury is impoſſible—a ſurpriſe mingled with indignation, at the idea of his falſhood to her darling child; but when undeceived in that reſpect, her tranſports were of the moſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant nature.</p>
                     <p>"Well, ſhe thanked Heaven," ſhe ſaid, "ſhe ſhould now ſee her tear chilt hold up her head again, and look as handſome as ever. Aye, ſhe had always doubted," ſhe ſaid, "that his Lordſhip was not one of the falſe-hearted men ſhe had ſo often heard her old grandmother talk of."</p>
                     <p>"My good nurſe," ſaid Lord Cherbury, ſmiling, "you will then give me your dear child with all your heart?"</p>
                     <p>"Aye, that I will, my Lord," ſhe replied, "and this very moment too, if I could."</p>

                        </gap> preſent with getting his dinner from you."</p>
                     <p>She then deſired the things to be brought to the little arbour, already deſcribed in the beginning of this book and proceeded to it with Lord Cherbury.</p>
                     <p>The mention of dinner threw nurſe and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into univerſal commotion.</p>
                     <p>"Goodlack! how unfortunate it was ſhe had nothing hot or nice to lay pefore his Lordſhip; how could ſhe think he could dine upon cold lamb and ſallad. Well, this was all Miſs Amanda's fault, who would never let her do as ſhe wiſhed."</p>
                     <p>With the utmoſt difficulty ſhe was perſuaded he could dine upon theſe things. The cloth was laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the flowery turf, beneath the ſpreading branches of the arbour. The delicacies of the dairy were added to their repaſt, and Betſy provided a deſert of new fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts.</p>
                     <p>Never had Lord Cherbury partaken of ſo delicious a meal; never had he and Amanda experienced ſuch hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs—a happineſs derived from what might be termed the ſober certainty of waking bliſs. The pleaſure, the tenderneſs of their ſouls, beamed in expreſſive glances from their eyes, and they were now more convinced than ever, that the humble ſcenes of life were beſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the promotion of felicity.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury felt more reconciled than he had done before to the diminution of his fortune; he yet retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficient for the comforts and many of the elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of life; the ſplendor he loſt was inſignificant in his eyes; his preſent ſituation proved happineſs could be enjoyed without it, and he knew it equally diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by his Amanda. He aſked himſelf,
<q>
                           <l>What was the world to them,</l>
                           <l>Its pomps, its pleaſures, and its nonſenſe all,</l>

                        </q>
All nature looked gay and ſmiling around him; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled the balmy breath of opening flowers, and through

the verdant canopy he ſat beneath, he ſaw the bright a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure of the heavens, and felt the benignant influence of the ſun, whoſe potent beams heightened to glowing luxuriance the beauties of the ſurrounding landſcape. He expreſſed his feelings to Amanda; he heard her declare the ſimilarity of her's; heard her, with all the ſweet enthuſiaſm of a refined and animated mind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate on the lovely ſcene around them. Oh! what tender remembrances did it awaken, and what delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plans of felicity did they ſketch. Lord Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury would hear from Amanda all ſhe had ſuffered ſince their ſeparation; and could his love and eſteem have been increaſed, her patient endurance of the ſorrows ſhe related would have increaſed them.</p>
                     <p>They did not leave the garden till a duſky hue had overſpread the landſcape. Oh! with what emotions did Amanda watch the ſetting ſun, whoſe riſing beams ſhe had beheld with eyes obſcured by tears of ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>As they ſat at tea in the room, ſhe could not avoid noticing the alteration in the nurse's dreſs, who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhe had put on all her holiday finery, and to evince her wiſh of amuſing her gueſts, had ſent for the blind harper, whom ſhe ſtationed outſide the cottage. His muſic drew a number of the neighbouring cottagers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and they would ſoon have led up a dance in the vale, had not the nurſe prevented them, leſt they ſhould diſturb her gueſts. Lord Cherbury, however, inſiſted on their being gratified, and ſending for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ordered him to provide refreſhments for them, and to reward the harper.</p>
                     <p>He would not leave Amanda till he had her permiſſion to come the next morning, as ſoon as he could hope to ſee her; accordingly the firſt voice ſhe heard on riſing was his chatting to the nurſe. We may believe ſhe did not ſpend many minutes at her toilet: the neat ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of her dreſs, indeed, never required ſhe ſhould do ſo, and in a very ſhort time ſhe joined him. They walked out till breakfaſt was ready.

                           <l>Together trod the morning dews, and gather'd</l>
                           <l>In their prime freſh blooming ſweets.</l>

Amanda, in hourly expectation of her brother's arrival wiſhed ere he came, to inform the inhabitants of the cottage of the alteration in his fortune. This, with the aſſiſtance of Lord Cherbury, ſhe took an opportunity of doing in the courſe of the day to the nurſe. Had ſhe been ſole relator, ſhe feared ſhe ſhould have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with queſtions. Joy and wonder were excited in an extreme degree by this relation, and nothing but the nurse's hurry and impatience to communicate it to her family, could have prevented her from aſking again and again a repetition of it.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury now, as on the foregoing day, dined with Amanda; her expectations relative to the ſpeedy arrival of her brother were not diſappointed. While ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after dinner with Lord Cherbury in the garden, the nurſe, half breathleſs, came running to tell them, that a ſuperb coach and four, which to be ſure muſt be Lort Dunreath's was coming down the road.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury coloured with emotion. Amanda did not wiſh he and her brother ſhould meet till ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained every thing relative to him. By her deſire he retired to the valley, to which a winding path from the garden deſcended, whilſt ſhe hurried to the cottage to receive and welcome her beloved brother: their meeting was at once tender and affecting, the faithful Edwins ſurrounded Oſcar with delight and rapture, pouring forth, in their ſimple ſtile, congratulations on his happy fortune, and their wiſhes for his long enjoying it. He thanked them with a ſtarting tear of ſenſibility; he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them that their attentions to his dear ſiſter, his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented parents, his infant years, entitled them to his laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gratitude. As ſoon as he and Amanda could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage themſelves from the good creatures, without wounding their feelings, they retired to her room, where Oſcar related, as we have already done, all that paſſed between him and the Marquis of Roſline.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the funeral of Lady Euphraſia was over, the Marquis, according to his promiſe, lettled every thing with him, and put him into formal poſſeſſion of Dunreath Abbey. By the Marquis's deſire he then
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:038416_0728_1011E802B57881D0"/>
waited upon Lady Dunreath to inform her ſhe was at liberty, and to requeſt ſhe would not contradict the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of having been abroad: Mrs. Bruce had previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly informed her of the revolution of affairs. "I own," continued Oſcar, "from her cruelty to my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the depravity of her conduct, I was ſtrongly prejudiced againſt her, attributing, I acknowledge, her doing juſtice to us, in ſome degree, to her reſentment againſt the Marquis; but the moment I entered her apartment this prejudice vaniſhed, giving place to the ſofter emotions of pity and tenderneſs, while a thorough conviction of her ſincere repentance broke upon my ſoul; though prepared to ſee a form reduced by affliction and confinement, I was not by any means prepared to ſee a form ſo emaciated, ſo death-like; a faint motion of her head, as I entered, alone proved her exiſtence; had the world been given me to do ſo, I think I could not have broken a ſilence ſo awful. At length ſhe ſpoke, and in language that pierced my heart, implored my forgiveneſs for the ſufferings ſhe had cauſed me to endure. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly I aſſured her of it; but this rather heightened than diminiſhed her agitation, and tears and ſobs ſpoke the anguiſh of her ſoul. "I have lived," ſhe cried, "to juſtify the ways of Providence to men, and prove that, however calamity may oppreſs the virtuous, they or their deſcendants ſhall at laſt flouriſh. I have lived to ſee my contrite wiſh accompliſhed, and the laſt ſummons will now be a welcome releaſe." She expreſſed an ardent deſire to ſee her daughter. "The pitying tears of a mother," ſhe exclaimed, "may be as balm to her woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded heart. Oh! my prophetic words, how often have I prayed that the puniſhment I then denounced againſt her might be averted."</p>
                     <p>"I ſignified her deſire," continued Oſcar, "to the Marquis; he ſound the Marchioneſs at firſt reluctant to it, from a ſecret dread, I ſuppoſe, of ſeeing an object ſo injured; but ſhe at laſt conſented, and I was requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring Lady Dunreath from the Abbey, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her to the Marchioneſs's room. I will not attempt
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:038416_0729_1011E8056390C068"/>
to deſcribe the ſcene which paſſed between affection on one hand, and penitence on the other; the Marchioneſs indeed ſeemed truly penitent—remorſe and horror were viſible in her countenance, as ſhe gazed upon her injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parent. I begged Lady Dunreath, if agreeable to her, ſtill to conſider the Abbey as her reſidence; this, however, ſhe declined, and it was determined ſhe ſhould continue with her daughter. Her laſt moments may, perhaps, be ſoothed by cloſing in the preſence of her child; but till then, I think her wretchedneſs muſt be aggravated by beholding that of the Marquis's and his wife; their's is that ſituation, where comfort can neither be offered nor ſuggeſted, hopeleſs and incurable is their ſorrow: for, to uſe the beautiful and emphatic words of a late celebrated writer, "The gates of death are ſhut upon their proſpects."</p>
                     <p>Amanda now, after a little heſitation, proceeded to inform Oſcar of her real ſituation, and intreated him to believe that ſhe never would have had a concealment from him, but for the fear of giving him uneaſineſs. He folded her to his boſom as ſhe ceaſed ſpeaking, declared he rejoiced and congratulated her on having found an object ſo well qualified to make her happy.</p>
                     <p>"But where is this dear creature?" cried Oſcar with ſome gaiety, "Am I to ſearch for him, like a favourite Sylph in your bouquet, or with more probability of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſeek him amongſt the ſhades of the garden?"</p>
                     <p>"Come," ſaid he, "your looks confeſs our ſearch will not be troubleſome." He led her to the garden.—Lord Mortimer, who had lingered near it, ſaw them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. Amanda motioned to him to meet them. He ſprung forward, and was inſtantly introduced by her to Lord Dunreath. The reception he met from him was perhaps one of the moſt flattering proofs he could receive of his Amanda's affection; for what but the moſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated expreſſions in his favour could have made Lord Dunreath, at the firſt introduction, addreſs, him with all the fervency of friendſhip? Extremes of joy and ſorrow are difficult to deſcribe; I ſhall therefore, as perfectly conſcious of my inability to do juſtice to the ſcene which
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:038416_0730_1011E8083B1FAE60"/>
followed this introduction, paſs it over in ſilence. Lord Dunreath had ordered his equipage and attendants to the village inn, where he himſelf intended to lodge; but this was prevented by Lord Cherbury, who informed him he could be accommodated at his ſteward's: it was here, when they had retired for the night, that Lord Cherbury, having intimated his wiſhes for an immediate union with Amanda, all the neceſſary preliminaries were talked over and adjuſted, and it was agreed the marriage ſhould take place at the cottage, from whence they ſhould immediately proceed to Lady Martha's, and that to procure a licence they ſhould both depart the next morning; at breakfaſt, therefore, Amanda was appriſed of their plan, and though the glow of modeſty over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread her face, ſhe did not with affectation object to it.</p>
                     <p>With greater expedition than Amanda expected, the travellers returned from the journey they had been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take, and at their earneſt and united requeſt, without any affectation of modeſty, though with its real feelings, Amanda conſented that the marriage ſhould take place the day but one after their return.</p>
                     <p>Howell was ſent for, and informed of the hour his ſervices would be required. His mild eyes evinced to Amanda his ſincere joy at the termination of her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</p>
                     <p>On the deſtined morning Lord Dunreath and his friend went over to the cottage, and in a few minutes were joined by their Amanda, the perfect model of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and beauty: ſhe looked indeed the child of ſweet ſimplicity, arrayed with the unſtudied elegance of a village maid; ſhe had no ornaments but thoſe which could never decay, namely, modeſty and meekneſs.</p>
                     <p>Language was inadequate to expreſs the feelings of Lord Cherbury; his fine eyes alone could do them juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, alone reveal what might be termed the ſacred triumph of his ſoul, at gaining ſuch a woman. A ſoft ſhade of melancholy ſtole over the fine features of Lord Dunreath, as he witneſſed the happineſs of Lord Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury: for as his happineſs, ſo might his own have been, but for the blackeſt perfidy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="unknown:038416_0731_1011E80C057310B8"/>
As Lord Cherbury took the trembling hand of Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da to lead her from the cottage ſhe gave a farewell ſigh to a place where it might be ſaid her happineſs had commenced and was completed.</p>
                     <p>They walked to the church, followed by the nurſe and her family. Some kind hand had ſtrewed Lady Malvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's grave with the gayeſt flowers, and when Amanda reached it, ſhe pauſed involuntarily for a moment, to invoke the ſpirits of her parents to bleſs her union.</p>
                     <p>Howell was already in the church waiting to receive them, and the ceremony was begun without delay.—With the trueſt pleaſure did Lord Dunreath give his lovely ſiſter to Lord Cherbury; and with the livelieſt tranſports did he receive her as the choiceſt gift Heaven could beſtow.</p>
                     <p>Tears of ſweet ſenſibility fell from Amanda as Lord Cherbury folded her to his boſom as his own Amanda. Nor was he leſs affected: joy of the moſt rapturous kind agitated his whole ſoul at the completion of an event ſo earneſtly deſired, but ſo long deſpaired of. He wiped away her tears, and when ſhe had received the congratulations of her brother, preſented her to the reſt of the little group. Their delight, particularly the nurſe's was almoſt too great for expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>"Well," ſhe ſaid, ſobbing, "thank Cot her wiſh was fulfilled: it had peen her prayer, night, noon and morn, to ſee the daughter of her tear, tear Captain Fitzalan greatly married."</p>
                     <p>Poor Ellen wept well: "Now ſhe ſhould be happy," ſhe ſaid, "ſince ſhe knew her tear young laty was ſo."</p>
                     <p>Amanda, affected by the artleſs teſtimonies of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe received, could only ſmile upon the faithful creatures.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury, ſeeing her inability to ſpeak, took her hand and ſaid, "Lady Cherbury never will forget the obligations conferred upon Miſs Fitzalan."</p>
                     <p>Bridal favours and preſents had already been diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the Edwins. Howell was handſomely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented on the occaſion, and received ſome valuable preſents from Lord Cherbury, as proofs of his ſincere
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:038416_0732_1011E80D96312ED0"/>
friendſhip, alſo money to diſtribute among the indigent villagers.</p>
                     <p>His Lordſhip then handed Amanda into his coach, already prepared for its journey to Thornbury, and the little bridal party were followed with the moſt ardent bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>After proceeding a quarter of a mile they reached Tudor-Hall.</p>
                     <p>"I wiſh, my Lord," cried Oſcar, as they were driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round the wood, you would permit me to ſtop and view the Hall, and alſo accompany me to it."</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury looked a little embarraſſed: he felt a ſtrong reluctance to viſit it, when no longer his, yet he could not think of refuſing the Earl.</p>
                     <p>Amanda knew his feelings, and wiſhed her brother had not made ſuch a requeſt. No oppoſition, however, being ſhewn to it, they ſtopt at the great gate, which opened into the avenue, and alighted. This was a long beautiful walk cut through the wood, and in a direct line with the houſe. On either ſide were little graſſy banks, now covered with a profuſion of gay flowers, and a thick row of trees, which waving their old fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic branches on high formed a moſt delightful ſhade. Honey-ſuckles twined around many of the trunks, forming in ſome places luxuriant canopies, and with a variety of aromatic ſhrubs quite perfumed the air.</p>
                     <p>It was yet an early hour, the dew therefore ſtill ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the graſs, and every thing looked in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt verdure. Through viſtas in the wood a fine clear ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſeen, along whoſe ſides beautiful green ſlopes were ſtretched, ſcattered over with flocks, that ſpread their ſwelling treaſures to the ſun. The birds ſung ſweetly in the embowering receſſes of the wood, and ſo calm, ſo lovely did the place appear, that Lord Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury could not refrain a ſigh for its loſs.</p>
                     <p>"How delighted," cried he, caſting his fine eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round, "ſhould I have been ſtill to have cheriſhed thoſe old trees, beneath whoſe ſhades ſome of my happieſt hours were paſt."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="unknown:038416_0733_1011E8103B208D08"/>
They entered the hall, whoſe folding door they found open; it was large and Gothic; a row of arched win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were on either ſide, whoſe receſſes were filled with myrtles, roſes, and geraniums, which emitted a delicious perfume, and contraſted with the white walls, gave an appearance of the greateſt gaiety to the place.</p>
                     <p>Oſcar led the way to a ſpacious parlour at the end of the hall; but how impoſſible to deſcribe the ſurpriſe and pleaſure of Lord and Lady Cherbury, on entering it, at beholding Lady Martha and Lady Araminta Dormer.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury ſtood transfixed like a ſtatue; the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes of his aunt and his ſiſter, which were ſhared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his bride, reſtored him to animation; but while they returned them, he caſt his eyes upon Oſcar, and demanded an explanation of the ſcene.</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall give no explanation, my Lord," cried Oſcar, "till you welcome your friends to your houſe."</p>
                     <p>"My houſe," repeated Lord Cherbury, ſtaring at him.</p>
                     <p>Lord Dunreath approached; never had he appeared ſo engaging; the benignant expreſſion his countenance aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed was ſuch as we may ſuppoſe an angel ſent from Heaven, on benevolent purpoſes to man, would wear.</p>
                     <p>"Excuſe me, my dear Cherbury," ſaid he, "for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering you to feel any uneaſineſs which I could remove, I only did ſo from an idea of increaſing your pleaſure hereafter. In Scotland I was informed of your predilec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for my ſiſter, by Lady Greyſtock, who, I fancy, you have both ſome reaſon to remember, in conſequence of which, on ſeeing Tudor Hall advertiſed, I begged Sir Charles Bingley to purchaſe it for me in his own name, from a preſentiment I had that the event I now rejoice at would take place, and from my wiſh of having a nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial preſent for my ſiſter, worthy her acceptance; let me," continued he, taking a hand of each, and joining them together, "let me, in this reſpected manſion, and in the dear preſence of thoſe you love, again wiſh you a continuance of every bleſſing. May this ſeat, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be the ſcene of domeſtic happineſs: may it ever be a pleaſing abode to the proſperous, and an aſylum of comfort to the afflicted."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="unknown:038416_0734_1011E81312E4EDE8"/>
Lord Cherbury's heart was too full for words; he turned aſide to wipe away his ſtarting tears. At laſt, though in a broken voice, he ſaid, "I cannot ſpeak my feelings."</p>
                     <p>"Pain me not," cried Oſcar, "by attempting to do ſo. From this moment forget that Tudor-Hall was ever out of your poſſeſſion, or if you muſt remember it, think it reſtored to you with an incumbrance which half the faſhionable men in England would give an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to get rid of, and this will conquer your too refined feelings."</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury ſmiled as he looked at the lovely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance which Oſcar alluded to.</p>
                     <p>"And what ſhall I ſay to my brother?" cried Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, throwing herſelf into his arms.</p>
                     <p>"Why, that you will compoſe your ſpirits, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give a proper welcome to your friends. He preſented her to Lady Martha and Lady Araminta, who again embraced and congratulated her. He then led her to the head of the breakfaſt table, which was elegantly laid out. The timid bride was aſſiſted in doing the honours by her brother and Lord Cherbury. Lady Martha beheld the youthful pair with the trueſt delight; never before had ſhe ſeen two, from equal merit and lovelineſs, ſo juſtly formed to make each other happy; never had ſhe ſeen either to ſuch advantage; the beautiful colouring of health and modeſty tinged the ſoft cheeks of Amanda, and her eyes, through their long laſhes, emitted mild beams of pleaſure, its brighteſt glow mantled the cheeks of Lord Cherbury, and his eyes were again illumined with all their wonted radiancy.</p>
                     <p>Oſcar was requeſted to tell particularly how he had arranged his plan, which he accordingly did. He had written to the ladies at Thornbury, informing them of his ſcheme, and requeſting their preſence, and on the preceding night they had arrived at the Hall. Lord Dunreath alſo added, that from a certainty of its being agreeable to Lord Cherbury, he had directed the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:038416_0735_1011E815BA132C18"/>
to reinſtate the old ſervants in their former ſtations, and alſo to invite the tenants to a nuptial feaſt.</p>
                     <p>Lord Cherbury aſſured him he had done what was truly grateful to his feelings; a ramble about the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſhrubberies was propoſed, and agreed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter breakfaſt: in the hall and avenue the ſervants and tenants were already aſſembled. Lord Cherbury went among them all, and the grateful joy they expreſſed at having him again for a maſter and landlord deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his feelings. He thanked them for their regard, and received their congratulations on his preſent happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with that ſweetneſs and affability which always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed his manners. The ramble was delightful. When the ſun had attained its meridian, they ſought the cool ſhade, and retired to little romantic arbours, o'er-canopied with woodbines, where, as if by the hand of enchantment, they found refreſhments laid out: they did not return to the houſe till they received a ſummons to dinner, and had then the pleaſure of ſeeing the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants ſeated at long tables in the wood, enjoying with unbounded mirth the profuſion with which they were covered; and lord Cherbury begged Amanda to obſerve her nurſe ſeated at the head of one of theſe tables, with an air of the greateſt ſelf importance. The pride and vanity of this good woman (and ſhe always poſſeſſed a large ſhare of both) had been conſiderably increaſed from the time her cottage was honoured with ſuch noble gueſts. When ſhe received an invitation from the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to accompany the reſt of the tenants to the Hall, to celebrate its reſtoration to Lord Cherbury, her joy and exultation knew no bounds; ſhe took care to walk with the wives of ſome of the moſt reſpectable tenants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to them all that had paſſed at the ceremony, and how the Earl had firſt fallen in love with his bride at her cottag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and what trials they had undergone, no toubt to peove their conſtancy. "Cot pleſs their hearts ſhe ſaid co her eager auditors, "ſhe could them of ſuch tangers, and tifficulties, and tribulations, as would ſurpriſe the very ſouls in their poties. Well, well, it was now her dear chilt's turn to hold up her head with
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:038416_0736_1011E819A83019E8"/>
the higheſt in the land: and to be ſure ſhe might now ſay, without telling a lie, that her tear Ladyſhip would now make ſome poty of herſelf, and, pleaſe Cot, ſhe hoped and pelieved, ſhe ſhould not tiſgrace or tiſparage a petter ſituation" When ſhe came near the counteſs, ſhe took care to preſs forward for a gracious look; but this was not all, ſhe had always envied the conſequence of Mrs. Abergwilly in having ſo great a houſe as the Hall, entirely under her management; and ſhe now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon the ſtrength of her favour with Lady Cherbury, to have ſomething to ſay to it, and of courſe increaſe her conſequence among her neighbours. There was nothing on earth ſhe ſo much delighted in as a buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the preſent ſcene was quite adapted to her taſte, for all within and without the houſe was joyous confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The firſt ſpecimen ſhe gave of her intention was, in helping to diſtribute refreſhments amongſt the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants; ſhe then proceeded to the dinner parlour, to give her opinion and aſſiſtance, and direction about laying out the table. Mrs. Abergwilly, like the generality of thoſe accuſtomed to abſolute power, could not tamely ſubmit to any innovation on it. She curbed her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however, and civillity told Mrs. Edwin ſhe want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no aſſiſtance: "thank Cot," ſhe ſaid, "ſhe was not come to this time of tay without peing able to give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tirections about laying out a table."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Edwin ſaid, "To be ſure Mrs. Abergwilly might have a very pretty taſte, but then another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might have as good a one."</p>
                     <p>The day was intenſely hot; ſhe pinned back her gown, which was a rich ſilk, that had belonged to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Malvina, and without farther ceremony began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the diſhes, and ſaying, "ſhe knew the taſte of her tear Laty the counteſs, petter than any one elſe, and that ſhe would take an early opportunity of going through the apartments and telling Mrs. Abergwilly how to arrange the furniture."</p>
                     <p>The Welſh blood of the houſe-keeper could bear no more, and ſhe began abuſing Mrs. Edwin, though
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:038416_0737_1011E81BA14C75B8"/>
in terms ſcarcely articulate; to which ſhe replied with intereſt.</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of this fracas old Edwin entered. "For the love of Cot," he aſked, "and the mercy of heaven, could they chuſe no other time or day than the preſent to pegin and fight, and ſcold, and abuſe each other like a couple of Welch witches? What would the noble Earl and the Counteſs ſay—Oh Lort! oh Lort! he felt himſelf bluſhing all over for their miſdemeanors."</p>
                     <p>His remonſtrance had an immediate effect; they were both aſhamed of their conduct; their rage abated, they became friends, and Mrs. Edwin reſigned the direction of the dinner table to Mrs. Abergwilly, ſatisfied with being allowed to preſide among the tenants.</p>
                     <p>The bridal party found Howell in the dining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and his company increaſed their pleaſure. After dinner the ruſtics commenced their dancing in the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the ſtrains of the harp, and afforded a delightful ſcene of innocent gaiety to their benevolent entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who ſmiled to ſee
<q>
                           <l>The dancing pair that ſimply ſought renown,</l>
                           <l>By holding out to tire each other down:</l>
                           <l>The baſhful virgin's ſide-long looks of love,</l>
                           <l>The matron's glance that would thoſe looks reprove.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After tea the party went out amongſt them, and the gentlemen for a ſhort time mingled in the dance. Long it could not detain Lord Cherbury from his Amanda. Oh! with what ecſtacy did he liſten to the ſoft accents of her voice, while his fond heart aſſured him ſhe was now his; the remembrance of his paſt difficulties but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his felicity.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of the week all the neighbouring fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies came to pay their congratulations at Tudor Hall; invitations were given and received, and it again became the ſeat of pleaſure and hoſpitality; but Amanda did not ſuffer the poſſeſſion of happineſs to obliterate one grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remembrance from her mind; ſhe was not one of theſe ſelfiſh beings who, on being what is termed ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled for life, immediately contract themſelves within the
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:038416_0738_1011E81E5A45E808"/>
narrow ſphere of their own enjoyments; ſtill was her heart as ſenſible as ever of the glow of friendſhip and compaſſion: ſhe wrote to all the friends ſhe had ever received kindneſſes from, in terms of the warmeſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and her letters were accompanied by preſents ſufficiently valuable to prove her ſincerity. She ſent an invitation to Emily Ruſhbrook, which was immediately accepted; and now a diſcovery took place which infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed and pleaſed Amanda—namely, that Howell was the young clergyman Emily was attached to. He had gone to London on a viſit to the gentleman who had patronized him; her youth, her ſimplicity, above all her diſtreſs, affected his heart, and in the hope of mitigating that diſtreſs (which he was ſhocked to ſee had been aggravated by the ladies ſhe came to) he had followed her; to ſoothe the wretched, to relieve the diſtreſſed, was not conſidered more a duty than a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by Howell; and the little favours he conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ruſhbrooks afforded, if poſſible, more pleaſure to him than they did to them; ſo ſweet are the feelings of benevolence and virtue. But compaſſion was not long the ſole motive of his intereſt in their affairs; the amiable manners, the gentle converſation of Emily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſubdued his unfortunate paſſion for Amanda, and in ſtealing her image from his heart, ſhe implanted her own in its place. He deſcribed in a romantic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the little rural cottage he invited her to ſhare—he anticipated the happy period when it ſhould become an aſylum to her parents—when he, like a ſecond father, ſhould aſſiſt their children through the devious paths of life; theſe fond hopes and expectations vaniſhed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he received Mrs. Connel's letter. He could not think of ſacrificing the intereſt of Ruſhbrook to the conſideration of his own happineſs, and therefore gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, but with the moſt agonizing conflicts, reſigned his Emily to a more proſperous rival; his joy at finding her diſengaged, ſtill his own unaltered Emily, can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be conceived than deſcribed. He pointed out the little ſheltered cottage which again he hoped ſhe would ſhare, and bleſt with her the hand that had opened her
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:038416_0739_1011E82247A3A870"/>
father's priſon gates. Lord and Lady Cherbury delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think they could contribute to the felicity of two ſuch amiable beings; and the latter wrote to Captain and Mrs. Ruſhbrook on the ſubject, who immediately replied to her letter, declaring that their fondeſt wiſh would be gratified in beſtowing their daughter on How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell. They were accordingly invited to the Hall; and in the ſame ſpot where a month before he ratified the vows of Lord Cherbury and Amanda, did Howell plight his own to Emily, who from the hand of Lady Cherbury received a nuptial preſent ſufficient to procure every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment her humble and unaſſuming ſpirit aſpired to.

                     <p>And now did the grateful children of Fitzalan amply reward the Edwins for their paſt kindneſſes to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and themſelves: an annual ſtipend was ſettled on Edwin by Lord Dunreath, and the poſſeſſions of Ellen were enlarged by Amanda. Now was realized every ſcheme of domeſtic happineſs ſhe had ever formed; but even that happineſs could not alleviate her feelings on Oſcar's account, whoſe faded cheek, whoſe languid eye, whoſe total abſtraction in the midſt of company evidently proved the ſtate of his heart; and the tear of regret, which had ſo often fallen for her own ſorrows, was now ſhed for his; he had written to Mrs. Marlowe a particular account of every thing which had befallen him ſince their ſeparation: ſhe anſwered his letter immediately, and after congratulating him in the warmeſt terms on the change in his ſituation, informed him that Adela was then at one of Belgrave's ſeats in England, and that he was gone to the continent; hey ſtyle was melancholy, and ſhe concluded her letter in theſe words: "no longer, my dear Oſcar, is my fire-ſide enlivened by gaiety or friendſhip; ſad and ſolitary I ſit within my cottage till my heart ſickens at the remembrance of paſt ſcenes, and If I wander from it, the objects without, if poſſible, add to the bitterneſs of that remembrance.

the graſs-grown paths, the dejected ſervants of Wood-lawn, all recall to my mind thoſe hours when it was the manſion of hoſpitality and pleaſure. I often linger by the grave of the General, my tears fall upon it, and I think of that period when, like him, I ſhall drop into it; but my laſt hours will not cloſe like his, no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der child will bend over my pillow to catch my laſt ſigh, to ſoothe my laſt pang; in vain my cloſing eyes will look for the pious drops of nature or of friendſhip.—Unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I ſhall die, with the ſad conſciouſneſs of doing ſo through my own means; but I ſhall not be quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourned, you and my Adela, the ſweet daughter of my care, will regret the being whoſe affection, whoſe ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy for you both, can only be obliterated with life."</p>

                     <p>ADELA, on the death of her father, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Belgrave to England, though the only pleaſure he experienced in removing her was derived from the idea of wounding her feelings, by ſeparating her from Mrs. Marlowe, whom he knew ſhe was tenderly attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.

Accuſtomed from her earlieſt youth to the greateſt tenderneſs, this ſeverity plunged her in the deepeſt deſpondency, and life was a burthen ſhe would gladly have reſigned; her melancholy, or rather her patient ſweetneſs, at laſt ſoftened the flinty nature of her governante, and ſhe was permitted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her walks beyond the gardens, to which they had hitherto been confined; but ſhe availed herſelf of this permiſſion only to viſit the church-yard belonging to the hamlet, whoſe old yew-trees ſhe had often ſeen waving from the windows. Beneath their ſolemn gloom ſhe loved to ſit, while evening cloſed around her; and in a ſpot, ſequeſtered from every human eye, weep over the recollection of that father ſhe had loſt, that friend ſhe was ſeparated from.</p>
                     <p>She remained in the church-yard one night beyond her uſual hour. The ſoft beams of the moon alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her from being involved in darkneſs, and the plaintive breathings of a flute from the neighbouring hamlet juſt ſtole upon her ear. Loſt in ſadneſs, her head reſting upon her hand, ſhe forgot the progreſs of time; when ſuddenly ſhe beheld a form riſing from a neighbouring grave. She ſtarted up, ſcreamed, but had no power to move; the form advanced to her; it was the figure of a venerable man, who gently exclaimed, "be not afraid!" His voice diſſipated the involuntary fears of Adela; but ſtill ſhe trembled ſo much ſhe could not move. "I thought," cried he, gazing on her, "this place had been alone the haunt of wretchedneſs and me." "If ſacred to ſorrow," exclaimed Adela, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>well may claim the privilege of entering it." She
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:038416_0742_1011E82AE83A7E10"/>
ſpoke involuntarily, and her words ſeemed to affect the ſtranger deeply. "So young," ſaid he, " tis melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeed; but ſtill the ſorrows of youth are more beara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than thoſe of age; becauſe like age it has not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived the fond ties, the ſweet connexions of life."—"Alas!" cried Adela unable to repreſs her feelings, "I am ſeparated from all I regarded." The ſtranger leaned penſively againſt a tree for a few minutes, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain addreſſed her: "'Tis a late hour," ſaid he, "ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to conduct you home, and alſo permit me to aſk if I may ſee you here to-morrow night. Your youth, your manner, your dejection, all intereſt me deeply; the ſorrows of youth are often increaſed by imagination.—You will ſay nothing can exceed its pains; 'tis true, but it is a weakneſs to yield to them—a weakneſs which from a ſenſible mind will be eradicated the moment it hears of the real calamities of life; ſuch a relation I can give you, if you meet me to-morrow night in this ſad, this ſolitary ſpot; a ſpot I have viſited every cloſing evening, without ever before meeting a being in it.</p>
                     <p>His venerable looks, his gentle, pathetic manner, affected Adela inexpreſſibly; ſhe gazed on him with emotions ſomewhat ſimilar to thoſe with which ſhe uſed to contemplate the mild features of her father. "I will meet you," cried ſhe, "but my ſorrows are not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary." She refuſed to let him attend her home; and in this incident there was ſomething affecting and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic, which ſoothed and engroſſed the mind.</p>
                     <p>She was punctual the next evening to the appointed hour. The ſtranger was already in the church-yard; he ſeated her at the head of the grave from which ſhe had ſeen him riſe the preceding night, and which was only diſtinguiſhed from the others by a few flowering ſhrubs planted around it, and began his promiſed narrative.—He had not proceeded far ere Adela began to tremble with emotion—as it continued it encreaſed. At laſt ſuddenly catching his hand, with wildneſs, ſhe exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—"She lives—the wife ſo bitterly lamented ſtill lives, a ſolitary mourner for your ſake. Oh never! never did ſhe injure you as you ſuppoſe. Oh dear ineſtimable Mrs.
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:038416_0743_1011E82D95DD3E88"/>
Marlowe, what happineſs to the child of your care, to think that through her means you will regain the being you have ſo tenderly regretted; regain him with a heart open to receive you. The deep convulſive ſobs of her companion now pierced her ear; for many minutes he was unable to ſpeak: at laſt, raiſing his eyes, "Oh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence! I thank thee," he exclaimed; "again ſhall my arms fold to my heart its beſt beloved object. Oh, my Fanny, how have I injured thee! Learn from me," he continued, turning to Adela, "Oh learn from me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to yield to raſhneſs; had I allowed myſelf time to inquire into the particulars of my wife's conduct; had I reſiſted, inſtead of obeying the violence of paſſion, what years of lingering miſery ſhould I have ſaved us both. But tell me where I ſhall find my ſolitary mourner, as you call her." Adela gave him the deſired informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo told him her own ſituation. "The wife of Belgrave!" he repeated, "then I wonder not," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, as if involuntarily, "at your ſorrows." It was indeed to Howell, the unfortunate father of Juliana, the regretted huſband of Mrs. Marlowe, that Adela had been addreſſing herſelf. He checked himſelf, however, and told her, that the being by whoſe grave they ſat, had been hurried, through the villainy of Belgrave, to that grave. Adela told him of the prohibition againſt her writing; but at the ſame time aſſured him, ere the following night ſhe would find an opportunity of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a letter, which he ſhould bring to Mrs. Marlowe, who by its contents would be prepared for his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as it was to be ſent in to her. But Adela was prevented from putting her intention into execution by an event as ſolemn as unexpected.</p>
                     <p>The enſuing morning ſhe was diſturbed from ſleep by a violent noiſe in the houſe, as of people running back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards in confuſion and diſtreſs. She was hurrying on her clothes to go and enquire into the cauſe of it, when a ſervant ruſhed into the room, and in a haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty manner told her that Colonel Belgrave was dead.—Struck with horror and amazement, Adela ſtood pertre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, gazing on her; the maid repeated her words, and
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:038416_0744_1011E82F2631AA08"/>
added that he had died abroad and his remains were brought over to Wood houſe for interment, attended by a French gentleman, who looked like a prieſt. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious emotions which aſſailed the heart of Adela at this moment were too much for her weak frame, and ſhe would have fallen to the floor but for the maid, it was ſome time ere ſhe recovered her ſenſibility, and when ſhe did regain it, ſhe was ſtill ſo agitated as to be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give thoſe directions, which the domeſtics, who now looked up to her in a very different light from what they had hitherto done, demanded from her. All ſhe could deſire was, that the ſteward ſhould pay every reſpect and attention to the gentleman who had attended the remains of his maſter, and have every hanour that was due ſhewn to thoſe remains.—To ſuppoſe ſhe regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Belgrave would be unnatural; but ſhe felt horror, mingled with a degree of pity, for his untimely fate, at the idea of his dying abroad, without one connexion, one friend near him.</p>
                     <p>His laſt moments were indeed more wretched than ſhe could conceive. Overwhelmed with terror and grief, he had quitted England: terror at the ſuppoſition of a crime which in reality he had not committed, and grief for the fate of Amanda. He ſought to loſe his horrors in in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>brity, but this, joined to the agitations of the mind, brought on a violent fever, by the time he had landed at Calais, in the paroxiſm of which, had the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants underſtood his language, they would have been ſhocked at the crimes he revealed. His ſenſes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored a ſhort time before he died; but what excrucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting anguiſh, as well as horror did he ſuffer from their reſtoration; he knew from his own feelings, as well as from the looks of his attendants, that his laſt moments were approaching; and the recollection of paſt actions made him ſhudder at thoſe moments. Oh Howell! how were you amply avenged for all the pangs he made you ſuffer. Now did the pale image of your ſhrouded Julia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſeem to ſtand beſide his bed, reproaching his barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Every treacherous action now roſe to view, and trembling he groaned with terror at the ſpectres which
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:038416_0745_1011E831415EBD10"/>
a guilty conſcience raiſed around him. Death would have been a releaſe, could he have conſidered it an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation of all exiſtence; but that future world he had always derided, that world was opening in all its awful horrors to his view. Already he ſaw himſelf before its ſacred judge, ſurrounded by the accuſing ſpirits of thoſe he had injured. He deſired a clergyman to be brought to him; a prieſt was ſent for—their faiths were differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but ſtill, as a man of God. Belgrave applied to him for an alleviation of his tortures; the prieſt was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and ere he tried to comfort he wiſhed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert; but ſcarcely had he commenced the attempt, ere the wretched being before him claſped his hands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a ſtrong convulſion, and expired. The Engliſh ſervant who attended Belgrave informed the people of the hotel of his rank and fortune, and the prieſt offered to accompany his remains to England. He was, by the direction of Adela, who had not reſolution to ſee him, amply rewarded for his attention; and in two days after their arrival at Wood-houſe, the remains of Belgrave were conſigned to their kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed earth. From a ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered corner of the church yard Howell witneſſed his interment; when all had departed he approached the grave of his daughter—"He is gone!" he exclaimed, "my Juliana, your betrayer is gone; at the tribunal of his God he now anſwers for his cruelty to you. But oh! may he find mercy from that God; may he pardon him as in this ſolemn moment I have done—my enmity lives not beyond the grave."</p>
                     <p>Adela now ſent for Howell, and after their firſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had ſubſided, informed him ſhe meant immediately to return to Ireland; the expectation of her doing ſo had alone prevented his going before. They according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commenced their journey the enſuing day, and in leſs than a week reached the dear and deſtined ſpot, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to both; they had previouſly ſettled on the manner in which the diſcovery ſhould be revealed to Mrs. Marlowe, and Adela went alone into her cottage ſad and ſolitary, as Mrs. Marlowe ſaid in her letter to Oſcar, did Adela find her in her in her parlour; but it was a
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:038416_0746_1011E833D3F373D0"/>
ſadneſs which vaniſhed the moment ſhe beheld her.—With all the tenderneſs of a mother ſhe claſped Adela to her breaſt, and in the ſudden tranſports of joy and ſurpriſe, for many minutes did not notice her dreſs; but when ſhe did obſerve it, what powerful emotions did it excite in her breaſt! Adela, ſcarcely leſs agitated than ſhe was, could not for many minutes, relate all that had happened; at laſt the idea of the ſtate in which ſhe had left Howell, made her endeavour to compoſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Mrs. Marlowe wept while ſhe related her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but when ſhe mentioned Howell, ſurpriſe ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her tears; a ſurpriſe, increaſed when ſhe began the ſtory; but when ſhe came to that part where ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had betrayed ſuch emotion, while liſtening to How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, Mrs. Marlowe ſtarted and turned pale. "Your feelings are ſimilar to mine," ſaid Adela, "at this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od I became agitated. Yes," ſhe continued, "it was at this period I laid my trembling hand on his, and exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe lives!" "Merciful heaven!" cried Mrs. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, "what do you mean?" "Oh! let me now," cried Adela, claſping her arms round her, "repeat to you the ſame expreſſion: he lives! that huſband, ſo beloved and regretted, lives!" "Oh bring him to me!" ſaid Mrs. Marlowe, in a faint voice, "let me behold him while I have reaſon myſelf to enjoy the bleſſing." Adela flew from the room; Howell was near the door. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached—he entered the room. He tottered forward, and in one moment was at the feet, and in the arms of his wife, who transfixed to the chair, could only open her arms to receive him. The mingled pain and pleaſure of ſuch a re-union cannot be deſcribed; both with tears of grateful tranſport, bleſt the power which had given ſuch comfort to their cloſing days. "But my children," exclaimed Mrs. Marlowe, ſuddenly, "ah! when ſhall I behold my children! why did they not accompany you? ah! did they deem me then unworthy of beſtowing a mother's bleſſing?" Howell trembled, and turned pale. "I ſee," ſaid Mrs. Marlowe, interpreting his emotion, I am a wife but not a mother." Howell recovering his fortitude, took her hand, and preſſed it to his boſom;
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:038416_0747_1011E838B36E88D0"/>
"yes," he replied, "you are a mother; one dear, one amiable child remains. Heaven be praiſed!" he pauſed and a tear fell to the memory of Juliana.—"But hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven," he reſumed has taken the other to its eternal reſt.—Inquire not concerning her at preſent, I intreat; ſoon will I conduct you to the grave, there will I relate her fate, and together will we mourn it—then ſhall the tears that never yet bedewed the grave, the precious tears of a mother, embalm her ſacred duſt!"</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Marlowe wept but ſhe complied with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's requeſt; ſhe inquired in a broken voice about her ſon, and the knowledge of his happineſs gradually cheered her mind.</p>
                     <p>Adela conſented to ſtay that night in the cottage, but the next day ſhe determined on going to Woodlawn; to think ſhe ſhould again wander through it, again linger in the walks ſhe had trodden with thoſe ſhe loved, gave to her mind a melancholy pleaſure. The next morning, attended by her friend, ſhe repaired to it, and was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly affected by reviewing ſcenes endeared by tender remembrances of happy hours. The houſe, from its cloſed windows, appeared quite neglected and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if pleaſure had forſaken it with the poor departed General. Standard, his favourite horſe, grazed in the lawn, and beſide him, as if a ſecret ſympathy endeared them to each other, ſtood the dog that always attended the General in his walks; it inſtantly recollected Adela, and running to her, licked her hand, and evinced the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt joy. She patted him on the head, while her tears burſt forth at the idea of him who had been his maſter. The tranſports of the old domeſtics, particularly of the grey headed butler, at her unexpected return, increaſed her tears. But when ſhe entered the parlour, in which her father uſually ſat, ſhe was quite overcome, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning with her hand for her friends not to mind her, ſhe retired to the garden. There was a little romantic root-houſe at the termination of it, where ſhe and Oſcar had paſſed many happy hours together; thither ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and his idea, thus revived in her mind, did not leſſen its dejection. While ſhe ſat within it indulging
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:038416_0748_1011E83B5848BC60"/>
her ſorrow, her eye caught ſome lines inſcribed on one of its windows. She haſtily aroſe, and examined them inſtantly recollected the hand of Oſcar. They were as follows:</p>

                     </lg>
                     <p>Oſcar, previous to his going to England, with the expectation of being ſent to the Weſt-Indies, had paid a ſecret viſit to Wood-Lawn, to review and bid adieu to every well-known and beloved ſpot, and had one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at early day inſcribed thoſe lines on a window in the root-houſe, prompted by a tender melancholy he could not reſiſt.</p>
                     <p>"His love is then unfortunate," ſaid Adela, penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaning her head upon her hand; "Oh Oſcar! how ſad a ſimilitude is there between your fate and mine!" She returned to the houſe—Mr. and Mrs. Howell (for ſo we ſhall in future call Mrs. Marlowe, that name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only aſſumed while her huſband had a proſpect of inheriting his uncle's fortune) had conſented to ſtay ſome time with her.

She had been abſent ſome time when Mrs. Howell came out to her: Adela bluſhed and ſtarted at being caught at the window. "'Tis a long time, my dear A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela," ſaid Mrs. Howell, "ſince we had a ramble in this delightful garden together; indulge me in taking one, and let us talk of paſt times." "Paſt times!" cried Adela, with a faint ſmile, "are not always the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to talk about." "There are ſome, at leaſt one friend," cried Mrs. Howell, "whom you have not yet inquired after." Adela's heart ſuddenly palpitated; ſhe gueſſed who that one friend was. "Oſcar Fitzalan, ſurely," continued Mrs. Howell, "merits an inquiry; I have good news to tell you of him, therefore, without chiding you for any ſeeming neglect I will reveal it." She accordingly related his late reverſe of ſituation.—Adela heard her with deep attention. "Since fortune then is propitious at laſt," cried ſhe, "his love will no longer be unfortunate." "'Tis time, indeed," ſaid Mrs. Howell, looking at her with pleaſure, "that love ſo pure, ſo conſtant as his, ſhould be rewarded. Oh! Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la," ſhe continued, ſuddenly taking her hand, "ſweet daughter of my care, how great is my happineſs at this moment, to think of that about to be your portion." "My happineſs!" exclaimed Adela in a dejected voice. "Yes," replied Mrs. Howell, "in your union with a man every way worthy of poſſeſſing you; a man who, from the firſt moment he beheld you, has never ceaſed to love—in ſhort, with Oſcar Fitzalan himſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible!" cried Adela, trembling with emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſhe ſpoke: "Did not—how humiliating is the remembrance! did not Oſcar Fitzalan reject me, when the too generous and romantic ſpirit of my beloved fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offered my hand to his acceptance?"</p>
                     <p>"For once," ſaid Mrs. Howell, "I muſt diſturb the ſacred aſhes of the dead, to prevent the innocent from being unhappy. Oh! Adela, you were cruelly deceived, and the moment which gave you to Belgrave rendered Oſcar the moſt wretched of mankind. My heart was the repoſitory of all his griefs, and how many are the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tears I have ſhed over them. Be compoſed," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

ſhe, ſeeing Adela's agitation, "and a few moments will explain every thing to you." She led her back to the root-houſe, and in the moſt explicit manner informed her of Belgrave's treachery. Adela burſt into tears as ſhe concluded. She wept on Mrs. Howell's boſom, and acknowledged ſhe had removed a weight of uneaſineſs from her mind. "Poor Oſcar," ſhe continued, "how much would the knowledge of his miſery have aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mine!" "He acted nobly," ſaid Mrs. Howell, "in concealing it; and amply will he be rewarded for ſuch conduct." She then proceeded to inform Adela that ſhe ſoon expected a viſit from him. There was ſomething in her look and manner which inſtantly excited the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of Adela, who bluſhing, ſtarting, trembling, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—"He is already come!" Mrs. Howell ſmiled, and a tear fell from her upon the ſoft hand of Adela "He is already come," ſhe repeated, "and he waits, oh how impatiently! to behold his Adela."</p>
                     <p>We may believe his patience was not put to a much longer teſt. But when Adela in reality beheld him as ſhe entered the parlour, where ſhe had left Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, and where he waited for the re-appearance of her friend, ſhe ſunk beneath her emotion, upon that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful boſom which had ſo long ſuffered the moſt excruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating pangs on her account; and it was many minutes ere ſhe was ſenſible of the ſoft voice of Oſcar. Oh! who ſhall paint his tranſports, after all his ſufferings, to be thus rewarded! But in the midſt of his happineſs the idea of the poor General, who had ſo generouſly planned it, ſtruck upon his heart with a pang of ſorrow. "Oh, my Adela!" he cried, claſping her to his heart, as if doubly endeared by the remembrance, "is Oſcar at laſt permitted to pour forth the fulneſs of his ſoul before you, to reveal its tenderneſs, to indulge the hope of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you his, a hope which affords the delightful proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of being able to contribute to your felicity. Yes, moſt generous of friends," he exclaimed, raiſing his eyes to a picture of the General, "I will endeavour to evince my gratitude to you by my conduct to your child." Oh! how did the tear he ſhed to the memory of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:038416_0751_1011E8435FAC6218"/>
intereſt the heart of Adela: her own fell with it, and ſhe felt that the preſence of that being to whom they were conſecrated was alone wanting to complete their happineſs. It was long ere ſhe was ſufficiently compoſed to inquire the reaſon of Oſcar's ſudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and ſtill longer ere he could inform her.—Mrs. Marlowe's melancholy letter, he at laſt ſaid, had brought him over, with the hope of being able to cheer her ſolitude, and alſo (he acknowledged) his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection by mutual ſympathy; from her cottage he had been directed to Wood-lawn, and at Wood-lawn receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particulars not only of her happineſs but his own.—Adela, who had never yet deviated from propriety, would not now infringe it, and reſolutely determined, till the expiration of her mourning, not to beſtow her hand on Oſcar; but permitted him to hope, that in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening ſpace moſt of his time might be devoted to her; it was neceſſary however to ſanction that hope by having proper ſociety. She could not flatter herſelf with much longer retaining Mr. and Mrs. Howell, as the latter particularly was impatient to behold her ſon. Oſcar therefore requeſted and obtained permiſſion from Adela, to write in her name to Lord and Lady Cherbury, and intreat their company at Woodlawn, promiſing ſhe would then accompany them to Caſtle Carberry, and from thence to Dunreath Abbey, a tour which, previous to Oſcar's leaving Wales, had been agreed on. The invitation was accepted, and in a few days Oſcar beheld the two beings moſt valued by him in the world, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to each other; tears of rapture ſtarted to his eyes as he ſaw his Adela folded to the boſom of his love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſiſter, who called her the ſweet reſtorer of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's happineſs! Lord Cherbury was already acquainted with her, and, next to his Amanda, conſidered her the lovelieſt of human beings; and Lady Martha and Lady Araminta, who were alſo invited to Woodlawn, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in the ſame light. A few days after their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, Mrs. Howell prepared for her departure. Adela, who conſidered her as a ſecond mother, could not behold theſe preparations without tears of real regret. "Oh,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:038416_0752_1011E846036F5D30"/>
my Adela!" ſhe exclaimed, "theſe tears flatter, yet diſtreſs me; I am pleaſed to think the child of my care regards me with ſuch affection, but I am hurt to think ſhe ſhould conſider my loſs ſuch an affliction. Oh, my child! may the endearments of the friends who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round you ſteal from you all painful remembrances: nature calls me from you, I ſigh to behold my child; I ſigh," ſhe continued, with eyes ſuffuſed in tears, "to behold the precious earth which holds another."</p>
                     <p>About three weeks after her departure, the whole par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proceeded to Caſtle Carberry. Amanda could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter it without emotions of the moſt painful nature; ſhe recollected the moment in which ſhe had quitted it, oppreſt with ſorrow and ſickneſs, to attend the cloſing period of a father's life. She wept—and ſighed to think that the happineſs he had prayed for, he could not behold—Lord Cherbury ſaw her emotions, and ſoothed them with the ſofteſt tenderneſs; it was due to that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to conquer her dejection, and in future the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her father was only attended with a pleaſing melancholy. She did not delay viſiting the convent; the good natured nuns crowded around her, and cried, laughed and wiſhed her joy almoſt in the ſame moment, particularly Siſter Mary; the prioreſs's pleaſure was of a leſs violent, but more affecting nature: an almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſcene of gaiety was kept up at the Caſtle, a gaiety, however, which did not prevent Lord and Lady Cherbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from inſpecting into the ſituation of their poor tenants, whoſe wants they relieved, whoſe grievances they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, and whoſe hearts they cheared by a promiſe of ſpending ſome months in every year at the Caſtle.

                        </gap>ning at it ſix weeks, they croſſed over to Port-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick, and from thence proceeded to Dunreath Abbey, which had been completely repaired and furniſhed in a ſtyle equally modern and elegant; and here it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined they ſhould remain till the ſolemnization of Lord Dunreath's nuptials. The time which intervened till the period appointed for them, was agreeably diverſified, by parties amongſt the neighbouring families, and extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the country; but no hours were happier than
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:038416_0753_1011E847D9408210"/>
thoſe which the inhabitants of the Abbey paſſed when free from company, ſo truly were they united to each other by affection. Lord Dunreath, ſoon after his return, waited upon the Marquis of Roſline, and by his ſiſter's deſire ſignified to him that if a viſit from her would be agreeable to the Marquis, ſhe would pay it; this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was declined, and about the ſame period Lady Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reath died. Mrs. Bruce, who from long habit ſhe was attached to, then retired to another part of Scotland, aſhamed to remain where her conduct was known, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which deeply affected her niece, whom Amanda vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited immediately after her arrival, and found ſettled in a neat houſe near the town ſhe had lodged in. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Lady Cherbury with every demonſtration of real pleaſure, and both ſhe and her little girls ſpent ſome time with her at the Abbey.</p>
                     <p>The happy period for compleating the felicity of Oſcar at laſt arrived. In the chapel where his parents were united he received from the hand of Lord Cherbury the lovely object of his long tried affections. The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was only witneſſed by his own particular friends; but at dinner all the neighbouring families were aſſembled, and the tenants were entertained in the great hall, where dancing commenced at an early, and was continued to a late hour; now having (to uſe the words of Adam) brought our ſtory to the ſum of earthly bliſs, we ſhall conclude; firſt giving a brief account of the characters connected with it.</p>
                     <p>Lady Greyſtock, was one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed, we ſhall firſt mention. After the death of Lady Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſia, ſhe found her company no longer deſired at the Marquis's and accordingly repaired to Bath; here ſhe had not been long ere ſhe became acquainted with a ſet of female puritans, who ſoon wrought a total change (I will not ſay a reformation) in her ladyſhip's ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and to give a convincing proof of this change, ſhe was prevailed on to give her hand to one of their ſpruce young preachers, who ſhortly taught her what indeed ſhe had long wanted to learn, the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for moſt ſincerely did ſhe repent putting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:038416_0754_1011E84A91853EA8"/>
into his power. Vexation, diſappointment and grief brought on a lingering illneſs, from which ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recovered: when convinced ſhe was dying, ſhe ſent for Ruſhbrook and made a full confeſſion of her treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and injuſtice to him, in conſequence of which he took immediate poſſeſſion of his uncle's fortune; and thus in the evening of his life enjoyed a full recompence for the trials of its early period. Lady Greyſtock died with ſome degree of ſatisfaction at the idea of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing her huſband of the fortune ſhe was convinced he had married her for.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Howell after viſiting her ſon, retired to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's cottage, where their days glide on in a kind of pleaſing melancholy; the happineſs of that ſon and his Emily is as perfect as happineſs can be in this ſublunary ſtate.</p>

                        </gap>fter ſtudiouſly avoiding Lord and Lady Cherbury for above two years, at laſt by chance was thrown in their way, and then had the pleaſure of finding he was not as agitated at the ſight of Amanda as he had dreaded. He did not refuſe the invitation of Lord Cherbury, the domeſtic happineſs he ſaw him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, rendered his own unconnected and wandering life more unpleaſant than ever to him. Lady Araminta Dormer was almoſt conſtantly in his company; no longer faſcinated by Amanda, he could now ſee and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire her perfections; he ſoon made known his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the declaratian was not ungraciouſly received, and he offered his hand and was accepted, an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which put him in poſſeſſion of happineſs equal to Lord Cherbury's.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis and Marchioneſs of Roſline paſs their days in gloomy retirement, regretful of the paſt, and hopleſs of the future. Freelove flutters about every public place, boaſts of having carried off a Scotch heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs; and thinks from that circumſtance he may now lay ſiege to any female heart with a certainty of being ſucceſsful.</p>

of manners which ever diſtinguiſhed them they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; from having been children of ſorrow themſelves, they feel for all who come under that denomination, and their charity is at once beſtowed as a tribute from gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to heaven, and from humanity to want; from gratitude to that being who watched their unſheltered youth, who guarded them through innumerable perils, who placed them on the ſummit of proſperity, from whence, by diſpenſing his gifts around, they truſt to be tranſlated to a ſtill greater height of happineſs.—Lady Dunreath's wiſh is fulfilled; to uſe her own word their paſt ſorrows are only remembered to teach them pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the woes of others; their virtues have added to the renown of their anceſtors, and entailed peace upon their own ſouls; their children, by all connected with them, are conſidered as bleſſings; gratitude has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſecrated their names, and their example inſpired others with emulation to purſue their courſes.</p>
