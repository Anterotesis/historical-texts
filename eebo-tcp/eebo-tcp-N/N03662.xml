            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is a hardy Enterprize, my Fellow Souldiers, to which you appoint us, in your annual Elections of us, to preach upon theſe Occaſions. More than an Hundred Years, have called for as many Military Diſcourſes from the Deſk, to ſanctify your Arms, and add the peculiar Glory of Religion to your Elections, and your Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. In order to gratify your Deſires, and anſwer your Expectations, your Miniſters have at theſe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seaſons, choſen their various Subjects, ſuited to the Sons of Battle, and have in a Manner exhauſted all that can be ſaid, proper for you to hear, and for the

Some have urged our own Danger as an expoſed People in our defenceleſs, careleſs Poſture, <hi>and far from Zidon.</hi> Others have treated on the Nature and Neceſſity of Weapons, and led you into a glittering Magazine of Armory. Some have repreſented the <hi>Lord</hi> as a <hi>Man of War,</hi> to reflect a Glory upon your burniſhed Arms, and inſpire you with religious Fortitude. Some have lifted up JESUS as the <hi>Enſign to the Nations,</hi> and preſt you to Battle under this Triumphant Banner. Some have tranſported you with the Examples of former <hi>Heroes,</hi> who <hi>by Faith ſubdued Kingdoms,</hi> and bore victorious through all the Conflict of human Life, that you might be animated by ſo great a <hi>Cloud of Martyrs.</hi> Some have inſtructed you in the Glories of the <hi>Captain of your Salvation; Gird thy Sword upon thy Thigh, and ride forth O moſt mighty.</hi> Others have drawn out his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

AFTER all the pertinent, and pious, and ſublime Things, which ſo many of my Fathers and Brethren have advanced upon this Occaſion, there ſeems to be nothing new for me to add; nor do I readily think of any one proper Topick which has not been touched upon by others before me. However, it has been ſometimes obſerved that the Art of Writing, among us in theſe latter Days, conſiſts not ſo much in ſtarting new Matter, (for that were almoſt impoſſible after all the Authors and Volumes which have gone before us) as in ſetting old Thoughts in a newer, or ſtronger, or more agreeable, or at ieaſt in <hi>different</hi> Lights; and as every Author has ſomething of his own, a <hi>Specifick Quality</hi> which diſtinguiſhes him from others, this muſt be my Excuſe for yielding to your unanimous Deſire, and irreſiſtible Importunities, and appearing at your Head this Day.</p>

AND if this be a juſt Apology for the <hi>Author,</hi> it is much more ſo for the <hi>Preacher:</hi> For it is a plain Direction to us, <hi>as wiſe Stewards</hi> to <hi>bring out of</hi> our <hi>Treaſury Things new and old.</hi> You will therefore hear with Candor; and though I ſhould <hi>deliver the ſame Things,</hi> to you <hi>they will not be grievous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ATTEND then to the Voice of my Text. The Words are a gallant Speech of young <hi>David,</hi> ruſhing to encounter the tall Giant of <hi>Gath.</hi> Long had the huge Monſter daily ſtrode towards the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and roared his Challenge over the Campaign, to the Ears of the frighted Army. An univerſal Panick run through the Ranks, chilled their Blood, and ſhook their Fabrick. Not a Man, not a Captain bold enough to iſſue from their Ports, and engage the brawny Champion: They all ſhrunk behind their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, and retreated from the thundering Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Then it was that <hi>David,</hi> by Accident in the Hoſt, heard the Menaces of the godleſs Giant, and a generous Indignation fired his Breaſt. Away goes the blooming Hero to the intimidated Monarch, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Combat with <hi>Goliah.</hi> The King is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the daring Genius that glowed in a Heart ſo young, and undiſciplined to the Dangers and Art of War, and hardly conſents to the unequal Fight. "<hi>Thou art but a Youth,</hi> my Son, and he, <hi>a Man of War from his Youth.</hi>" <q>Why, replied the Roſey War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, why may I not venture? Theſe unpromiſing Arms of mine, tender as they ſeem to you, are not unuſed to rugged Encounters. I am the Stripling, that have wreſted a Kid of my Flock from the Paw of a Bear, and from the rubid Jaws of a Lyon; and my God ſhall alike deliver this Philiſtine into my Hand.</q> Aſtoniſhed, <hi>Saul</hi> gives a faint Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and <hi>David</hi> with a Sling, and a few Pebbles, runs out to the glorious Expedition. <hi>Goliah</hi> ſaw; and in a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004482_0006_100D54265E99C168"/>
Tranſport of Diſdain, curſt the little Adventurer by his Gods; "Come hither, Youth, and by Dagon, will I ſcatter thy Limbs a Prey to the Beaſts of the Field, and to the Fowls of the Air." To this boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Period, the Words of my Text are the ardent Reply; <hi>Thou comeſt to me with a Sword, and with a Spear, and with a Shield; but I come to thee in the Name of the LORD of Hoſts, the God of the Armies of Iſrael, whom thou haſt defied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE'S a noble Bravery in th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Expreſſion. The ardent young Champion takes no Notice of the Bulk and Terror of his Rival's Perſon, but ſeems rather to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him with Cowardiſe. Tall and broad, and athletick as you are, ſays he, it ſeems you dare not truſt your<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf againſt your little Enemy, without abundant Arms and Armour. <hi>Thou comeſt to me with a Sword, and with a Spear, and with a Shield; but I come to thee in the Name of the LORD of Hoſts, the God of the Armies of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MORE than this had been unbecoming the manly Genius of a Warriour. Actions and not Words muſt decide the Diſpute. The mighty <hi>Philiſtine</hi> haſted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and <hi>David</hi> ruſhed to meet him with undaunted Eyes, while the Sling in his Hand whirled round, and away ſung the Victor-Stone towards the broad Front of the Enemy.

1. FROM what we have heard, how deſperate their Hazard who are in a State of War with the Lord of Hoſts! So are all who are in a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for we are born Children of Wrath. All Nature is armed againſt you to revenge the Quarrel of its Maker. Not an Element, not a Creature, but ſtands ready to deſtroy you; and with Vehemence urges, <hi>My Father, ſhall I ſmile them? ſhall I ſmite them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW neceſſary is it for us to fling down our Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and ſue for Reconciliation in the Merits of JESUS; for <hi>this Man is THE Peace.</hi> Agree with thine Adverſary quickly, while thou art in the Way with him, leſt he anon tear thee in pieces, and there be none to deliver thee.</p>

            <p>II. THE Lord of Hoſts, is in an eminent Senſe, the <hi>God of the Armies of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE ſtands in a peculiar Relation to his Favourite People. So he deſcended with his drawn Sword in his Hand, and made his Claim to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when the intrepid General ſaw him, and bravely demanded, <hi>Art thou for us, or for our Adverſaries? Nay,</hi> replied the illuſtrious Viſion, <hi>but as Captain of the Hoſt of the LORD am I come.</hi>

                  </gap>.</note>—And the adoring Hero fell proſtrate and kiſt the Ground. This ſeems to be litterally the Glory of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, the Meſſiah who was to come, and by a cloſe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the holy Scriptures will, I believe, be found appropriated to him. Compare <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiii. 20, 21. with <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxiii. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>WHILE <hi>Iſrael</hi> was litterally a People, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately their LORD. He choſe them from among the Nations, led them through the Wilderneſs, and pitched his <hi>Shekinah</hi> among them, his Pavilion of Clouds and Fire. And what People was there ſo great, who had GOD ſo nigh to them? The Ark was a Symbal of his Preſence; and by it he led them in their March, and by it they halted. <hi>Numb.</hi> x. 35, 36. <hi>And it came to paſs when the Ark ſet forward, that Moſes ſaid, Riſe up, LORD, and let thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be ſcattered; and let them that hate thee, flee before thee. And when it reſted, he ſaid, Return, O LORD, unto the many Thouſands of Iſrael.</hi>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:004482_0015_100D5438EB233680"/>
AND this favourite Nation was only a Type of the Church to the End of the World. GOD, in the Incarnate Son, is the Captain of their Salvation. He has choſen them out of the World, they are liſted under his Banners, he marches before them conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and to conquer, and they follow, whitherſoever he goeth, more than Conquerors through him who loveth them. <hi>The Armies of Heaven follow him.</hi> And who is ſhe that looketh forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, and terrible as an Army with Banners. And who is he at their Head, that cometh from <hi>Edom,</hi> in dy'd Garments from <hi>Bozrah,</hi> glorious in his Apparel, travelling in the greatneſs of his Strength; and why are his Garments red, but in the Blood of his Enemies. He propoſes Rewards to the Souldier, and leads the Way through the Labour to the Triumph: <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit down with me upon my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſit down with my Father upon his Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN every Light he is their GOD. They are all <hi>choſen Men.</hi> He preſt them into Service; and they are alſo Voluntiers in his Cauſe; bound by Military Oaths and Sacraments. <hi>He is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Theme this for noble Diſcourſe and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I muſt with Regret leave it, with one or two Reflections.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE learn hence the Immunities of the Church of JESUS CHRIST. No Monarch has any Authority to make new Laws for his Church, or to bind a Burthen on that Conſcience over which he claims an undivided Empire. The Armies of Iſrael, in this Senſe, own no other Lord. Stand faſt therefore in the Liberty wherewith CHRIST hath made you free.</p>

2. How victorious ſhall the Hoſt of GOD be under ſuch a Leader? <hi>David</hi> in the Triumphs of my Context, was but a little Emblem of it. Though a Troop may overcome them, they ſhall overcome at laſt. He that hath clean Hands ſhall wax ſtronger and ſtronger; as did the Houſe of <hi>David.</hi> They ſhall overcome in the Blood of the Lamb, and reign till all Things are put in Subjection under him. <hi>The laſt Enemy to be conquered is Death. But Thanks be to God who hath given us the Victory through our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</hi> The whole Church Mllitant ſhall ſo tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. <hi>He that falleth on it ſhall be brokens but be upon whom it ſhall fall it ſhall grind him to Powder.—All the Fowls that fly in the midſt of Heaven, come, and gather your ſelves together unto the Supper of the great God; that ye may eat the Fleſh of Kings, and the Fleſh of Captains, and the Fleſh of mighty Men, and the Fleſh of Horſes, and of them that ſit on them, and the Fleſh of all Men, both free and bond, both ſmall and great.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>III. To ſpeak of the Doctrine of true Fortitude, as taking hence its Origin, a Regard to the glorious GOD, in every hardy Enterprize.</p>
            <p>COURAGE is a Moral Virtue, and a Thing very different from a fluſh of Animal Spirits, or a firmneſs of Fibres in the Heart and Brain. It muſt have its Foundation in Reaſon, (and, ſhall I add, in Religion; which is the beſt Reaſon) or it ſubſides into Stupidity, or foams up in Frenzy. There are ſome Things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obſervable in the Brutal World, which by way of Analogy we call by Names taken from Moral
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004482_0017_100D543D76912D60"/>
Virtues. But by no Means are they to be ſtrictly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. So we ſpeak of the <hi>Courage</hi> of the <hi>Lyon</hi> and the <hi>War-Horſe,</hi> and even the <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> of the <hi>Stork</hi> feeding its aged Parents. But if we underſtand litterally theſe Virtues, the pure Effects of Nature in Creatures incapable of Moral Government; methinks one had as good finiſh the Scheme at once, applaud the <hi>Patience</hi> of a <hi>Log,</hi> and compliment a <hi>Block</hi> for <hi>Paſſive Obedience and Non Reſiſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No; Courage is that Firmneſs of Mind which will enable a Man, from Principle, to abide by the Dictates of his Rational Nature againſt all Oppoſition. Some Men, indeed, have a natural Conſtitution that is a Mechanical Aid to this Virtue: Others, from the unhappier Fabrick of the Body, and the feebler Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the Fluids are more liable to Temptations from the contrary Vices of Diffidence and Cowardiſe. But ſtill the Virtues and Vices are diſtinct from theſe material Operations: Their Foundation is Principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Subject is the Mind of a Moral Agent.</p>
            <p>How many Actions have been applauded among Men as highly Heroick, which examined to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom will be found really mean; I will venture to add, <hi>the pure Effects of a daſtardly Spirit.</hi> Such I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>the SPIRIT OF A DUEL.</hi> I believe upon impartial Enquiry it will be found that a Duel has been ſeldom undertaken but from the ignominious Power of Fear. Reaſon, and Religion, and the Man's own Inclinations have all conſpired to forbid the Fact, but the poor Paltroon has not had Preſence of Mind, and Bravery of Reſolution, to ſtand by the Dictates of his Underſtanding and Conſcience, only for <hi>Fear</hi> of being laugh'd at. Call you this <hi>Courage,</hi> whoſe Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Spring is all paltry Fear? So many a Coward has kept the Field, purely by being afraid to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004482_0018_100D543F020DECB8"/>
run, or aſhamed of the Hiſs of his Companions. Valour indeed, that can't ſtand the Shock of a little Banter!</p>
            <p>THE Fortitude of the true Hero diſdains to aſk any Queſtions, but,—<hi>What is the preſent Duty?</hi> But 'tis the true Character of a Coward to conſult,—<hi>What Evil can I beſt bear?</hi> And if from a diſtracted Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Death and Divine Vengeance at a diſtance, do not ſo much fright him as the preſent Contempt of Mankind, the Daſtard chuſes <hi>Damnation</hi> rather than <hi>Ridicule.</hi>

THUS, my Brethren of the Field, I have led you up to the Head-Spring of true, manly, and Chriſtian Fortitude. In this, I have not deſerted my Station, but acted as became a Miniſter of CHRIST, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Text I have choſen. Had I treated of Skill in Arms; of Facings, Advances and Retreats, of Evolutions, Counter-marches and Military Figures, I had deſcended from my Rank, and you could eaſily drive me back to my Line, keep the Field, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preach me. But <hi>every Man to his Poſt. Thou comeſt to me with a Sword, and with a Spear; but I come to thee in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts, the God of the Armies of Iſrael.</hi> While <hi>You</hi> are called to the glorious below, <hi>We</hi> appear in the Mount and lift up our Hands, and the Rod of GOD there. Or if need be, we will come down and ſhare your Hazards, and animate you to the Battle in the Name of GOD. Deut. xx. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>When thou goeſt out to Battle againſt thine Enemies, and ſeeſt Horſes and Chariots, and a People more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the Lord thy God is with thee—. And it ſhall be when ye are come nigh unto the Battle, that the Prieſt ſhall approach and ſpeak unto the People, and ſhall ſay unto them, Hear, O Iſrael, you approach this Day unto Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle againſt your Enemies: let not your Hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified becauſe of them. For the Lord your God is he that goeth before you, to fight for you againſt your Enemies, to ſave you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I muſt haſten to a Cloſe. And in the Firſt Place you will allow me to preach to my ſelf, and improve at leaſt ſomething by my own Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>AND from what we have heard, <hi>How becoming is Courage to a Miniſter of CHRIST?</hi> None go forth more immediately in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts than we. None are called to bolder Services, <hi>knowing

we are ſet for the Defence of the Goſpel.</hi> The Prieſts bearing the Ark of GOD muſt be the firſt to ford the Swell of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and upon the deepeſt Sands below muſt they take their gallant Stand till the meaneſt <hi>Iſraelite</hi> be paſſed over. What a poor Figure makes a cowardly Miniſter! Shall he be afraid of the Faces of Men, who comes upon Embaſſeys from the great GOD! Ezek. iii. 8, 9. <hi>Behold, I have made thy Face ſtrong againſt their Faces; and thy Forehead strong against their Foreheads. As an Adamant, harder than a Flint, have I made thy Forehead: Fear them not, neither be diſmayed at their Looks.</hi> This was the brave Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the intrepid Prieſts that withſtood the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in his impious Invaſion upon their ſacred Office. II Chron. xxvi. 16,—20. <hi>But when he was ſtrong, his Heart was lifted up to his Deſtruction: for he tranſgreſſed againſt the LORD his God, and went into the Temple of the LORD, to burn Incenſe upon the Altar of Incenſe. And Azariah <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Prieſt went in after him, and with him Fourſcore Prieſts of the LORD, that were valiant Men: And they withſtood Uzziah the King, and ſaid unto him, It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn Incenſe unto the LORD, but to the Prieſts the Sons of Aaron, that are conſecrated to burn Incenſe: go out of the Sanctuary, for thou haſt treſpaſſed, neither ſhall it be for thine Honour from the LORD God. Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a Cenſer in his Hand, to burn Incenſe: and while he was wroth with the Prieſts, the Leproſie even roſe up in his Forehead before the Prieſts in the Houſe of the LORD, from beſide the Incenſe-Altar. And Azariah the chief Prieſt, and all the Prieſts looked upon him, and behold, he was leprous in his Forehead, and they thruſt him out from thence, yea, himſelf haſted alſo to go out, becauſe the LORD had ſmitten him.</hi> And this was the Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Reſolution of our Apoſtle, Act. xx. 22, 23, 24. <hi>I go bound in the Spirit unto Jeruſalem, not knowing the Things that ſhall befal me there: Save that the holy

Ghoſt witneſſeth in every City, ſaying, that Bonds and Afflictions abide me. But none of theſe Things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my Courſe with Joy, and the Miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the Goſpel of the Grace of God.</hi> So ſings he in inimitable Periods, and with more than mortal Eloquence, <hi>We are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; we are perplexed, but not in deſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed; always bearing about in the Body the Dying of the Lord Jeſus;—alway delivered unto Death for Jeſus ſake.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">II Cor. iv. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> So JESUS himſelf led the Way; and on the Paſchal Night when the Vengeance of Heaven was marching through the Land, and GOD had given Warning, <hi>None of you ſhall go out of the Door of his Houſe until the Morning;</hi> then it was that our Lord went forth as from between the ſprinkled Door-Poſts, to encounter Divine Juſtice upon the March. This was his Work, and he has left us his own Example of Courage upon Duty. My Brethren, let the ſame Mind be in us. <hi>Fight the good Fight of Faith, lay hold on eternal Life.</hi> As <hi>we wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Principalities and Powers, againſt the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World, againſt wicked Spirits in high Places;</hi> ſo <hi>let the Weapons of our Warfare, which is not carnal but ſpiritual, be mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong Holds.</hi> Anon, you ſhall put off the Harneſs, and glory, <hi>I have fought a good Fight, I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith, I go to</hi> the Reward. The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the violent take it by Storm: And theſe ſhall, as Victors through a Breach, have an abundant Entrance into the Joy of their Lord.

Victor; but the Crown of Life that fadeth not away.</p>
            <p>IN the mean Time let our Examples and our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes inſpire Courage into the Breaſts of the Militant Hoſts of GOD below: And while <hi>Iſrael</hi> encounters her Enemies let the Prieſts blow the Trumpets.</p>
            <p>II. LET us all, from what we have heard, liſt our ſelves Volunteers in the Hoſts of GOD. Let us make ſure of our Maker's Friendſhip through JESUS CHRIST; and this be the Foundation of our Courage, <hi>I know whom I have believed.</hi> There's nothing irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or enthuſiaſtick in this. A Man may upon the moſt ſolid Principles be aſſured of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion: And he may be as rationally ſatisfied of his own being a true Chriſtian. And theſe being aſcertained,—<hi>The Lord is my Light and my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, whom ſhall I fear? The Lord is the Strength of my Life, of whom ſhall I be afraid.</hi> Nor Life nor Death can hurt us; all Things ſhall conſpire our Good. <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the Faith, quit you like Men, be ſtrong.</hi> Look with a diſdainful Smile upon all your armed Enemies, you have more numerous and powerful Auxiliaries. There is more with us than with them. The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him; and lo! the Mountain crowded with Chariots and Horſes of Fire.</p>
            <p>III. From what you have heard, you infer, a Man may lawfully engage in War. He may go in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts. This is a Subject that has been often handled upon theſe Occaſions, and to out ſhort the Matter, the Proof may take this direct Courſe. Is there any Man upon Earth, who does not own that a Criminal ought to be puniſhed? But ſuppoſe this Criminal ſtands upon his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004482_0025_100D544C60156100"/>
and is reſolved to attack every one that ſhall attempt to puniſh him: Suppoſe he engages a Number of others to ſtand by him, and to fight for him rather than deliver himſelf up; what ſhall be done in this Caſe? Shall the Officers of Juſtice let him alone, if they cannot perſwade him to Chaſtiſement by Dint of Eloquence? This were to let the moſt egregious Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal go free, and correct only the more modeſt: The harden'd Villain would eſcape, and, in a Senſe which <hi>Solomon</hi> never meant, <hi>The Rod would be only for the Fool's Back.</hi> It muſt then be lawful by Force, to make a Thief, for Inſtance, refund his unjuſt Gains, and by Puniſhment deter him from future Ravages. This is the Caſe of a Nation engaged in a lawful War. It has been pillaged by a Combination of Thieves: Theſe unreaſonable Banditti ought to make Reſtitution, and for many Reaſons, ſubmit to Diſcipline, but the refractory Men ſtand upon their Defence. There's no other Way left then but to march out in the Name of GOD, and overpower them by Force. And as the Laws of particular Kingdoms have appointed ſuch and ſuch particular Men, as the Miniſters of GOD to ex<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te Vengeance; the Law of Nations in general gives to every People Authority to protect themſelves, and to puniſh thoſe who injure them as far as they are able, as their own Executors. So that Fighting may be as neceſſary as Laws themſelves; for what ſignify Laws without Sanctions.</p>
            <p>BUT I have ſtood longer than I intended, and muſt now diſmiſs you.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>You profeſs Skill in Arms, and would be aſhamed of any thing like Cowardiſe. You are a Band of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Men, the Head and the Flower of all our Militia.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004482_0026_100D544E3A9709E8"/>
To honour Arms, and add a Glory to your Order, I have ſet before you the great GOD as the Lord of Hoſts. And at the ſame Time I have recommended to you the ſureſt way to arrive at true Fortitude, that greateſt Glory of a Souldier: A religious Regard to the great GOD the Baſis of rational Courage; without which all Pretences to it are no better than the Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of a Stock, or the Rage of a Brute. Be ambitious of this Title, THE CHRISTIAN HERO.</p>
            <p>YOU may now bear on fearleſs of every Danger, ſhould the GOD of Armies call you to immediate Service. How ſoon this may be GOD knows; for your Muſters are now ſomething more than pretty Amuſements, while the Sword of an injur'd Nation is unſheathed, and Vengeance is thundred from the Mouth of her Cannon. Hark! to the Sound of the Trumpet and Alarm of War! Hear the ruſhing of Nations, that make a Noiſe like the Sea, a ruſhing, like the ruſhing of mighty Waters! Methinks I can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore addreſs you with a better Grace, than when theſe things only appeared at a diſtance, and your Exerciſes looked leſs in earneſt. Sure you will not make a Flouriſh in a Game, and when the Field gleams with hoſtile Terrors bear to be inſulted with the keen Sarcaſm Judg. ix. 38. <hi>Where is now thy Mouth, wherewith thou ſaidſt, who is Abimelech—? Is not this the People that thou haſt deſpiſed? Go out now and fight with them.</hi>

            <p>WE are certainly a moſt expoſed People, and in our unfortified Poſture ſeem to lye an eaſy Prey to the firſt Invader. 'Tis not for me to charge the Fault of this any where: Only to pray GOD that ſome happy Method may open for the Redreſs of this Grievance. <hi>Do good in thy good Pleaſure unto Zion; build thou the Walls of thy Jeruſalem.

all his Courage and Divine Commiſſion, would not encounter his Enemy without ſome Arms; a Sling and a Stone at leaſt, the Weapons which he knew beſt how to manage. To have gone in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts without, had been an unwarrantable Preſumption. While we have been ſitting at Eaſe amidſt the Ruins of our falling Batteries, without ſo much as a Sling-Stone to defend us: Or rather have ſeen our diſjointed Fortifications dropping into ſeperate Stones of no uſe but for the Sling: Inſtead of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks a few looſe Pebbles. My Brethren, theſe Things ought not ſo to be. However, <hi>the Name of the LORD is ſtill our ſtrong Tower, the Righteous fly to it and are ſaved.</hi> So <hi>our Place of Defence ſhall be the Munitions of Rocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT You, Gentlemen, will do what in you lies to diffuſe Skill and Valour through your ſeveral Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Companies; that at leaſt we may keep our Country, ſhould we be obliged to give up our Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers on the Sea. A ſmall Number of diſciplined Troops will over-match a Rout of Thouſands. So a few Men uniting their Strength, ſhall be able with eaſe, to lift a Weight, which Ten times the Number trying ſeperately ſhall not be able to move. This is the Reaſon that all the military Movements and Fires ſhould be exactly together, that the whole Battallion may act as one, with irriſiſtible Forces. The Drum and the Trumpet ſhould be articulate to every Souldier, and he ſhould know at the firſt Notes, the Charge, the Retreat, and the Parley. Every Man ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Duty, and be exact to the Word of Command. The whole Succeſs of an Engagement, and the Fate of a Country, under GOD, depends upon this one Military Maxim.</p>

AND with how much Calm of Mind may you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, in the midſt of the moſt hazardous Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, if you can but aſſure your ſelves you are ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts; and he is engaged for you. Then, to advance will not be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; to retreat will not be ſhameful; for all will be under the ſerene Conduct of Reaſon and Duty. You will not be meanly elated by the compleateſt Victory; nor afraid to fall in the hotteſt Battle; but with an equal Mind hear the Shouts of Triumph and the Groans of Death. <hi>Thou ſhalt not be afraid for the Terror by Night, nor for the Arrow that flyeth by Day. A thouſand ſhall fall at thy Side, and ten thouſand at thy right Hand,</hi> and thou ſhalt not be moved. <hi>Thou ſhalt tread upon the Lyon and Adder; the young Lyon and the Dragon thou ſhalt trample under Feet.—Go up and proſper: The LORD is with thee, thou mighty Man of Valour.</hi>
