            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Author of the following Poems was born in the city of Philadelphia, Iune <hi>8th, 1742;</hi> and was sent to the <hi>Academy</hi> there, soon after it was first opened, and before the <hi>Collegiate</hi> part of the <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was begun. Having spent about six years in Grammar Learning, his parents, who were reputable citizens, designing him for merchandize, put him <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice;</hi> but not finding either his genius or inclination leading him much to that profession, he devoted more of his time to the service of the Muses, than to the business of the <hi>Counting-House.</hi> Soon after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of his apprenticeship, he accordingly returned to the <hi>College,</hi> and applied himself, with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to the study of <hi>Philosophy</hi> and the <hi>Sciences,</hi> till the Commencement, May <hi>30th, 1765;</hi> when, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his great merit and promising genius, he was, by special <hi>Mandate</hi> of the <hi>Trustees,</hi> upon the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the <hi>Provost</hi> and Faculty of Professors, complimented with a <hi>DIPLOMA</hi> for the degree of <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Arts;</hi> although he had not taken the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious degree of <hi>Bachelor</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> on account, of the interruption in his course of studies, during the term of his apprenticeship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012386_0003_0F8944CB68023BB8"/>IMMEDIATELY after the Commencement he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for England, carrying with him recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Society for propagating the Gospel in foreign parts, as a fit person to supply the new Mission, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be opened for Gloucester county, in New-Iersey. Upon the Society's nomination, he was admitted into holy orders by the present Lord Bishop of London, Dr. <hi>TERRICK,</hi> who expressed great satisfaction in his examination, and particularly in the perusal of an elegant English piece which he composed in a few minutes, upon a <hi>Theological</hi> question, which he was desired to give his sentiments upon.</p>
                  <p>HE returned from England, and landed at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, December <hi>26th, 1765;</hi> having had for his fellow-passenger (among others) the worthy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Lady, to whom many of his pieces are addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Upon his arrival, he entered immediately upon the business of his <hi>Mission;</hi> and alas! but just lived long enough to shew, by the goodness of his temper, the purity of his morals, the cheerfulness and affability of his conversation, the sublimity and soundness of his doctrines, and the warmth of his <hi>Pulpit Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> how well he was qualified for the sacred office, to which he had now wholly devoted himself. He died October <hi>29</hi>th, <hi>1767,</hi> lamented by all that knew him; and by none more earnestly and affectionately,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:012386_0003_0F8944CB68023BB8"/>
than by his own Congregations, whom he had not yet served two years!</p>
                  <p>SOON after his death, the papers which compose the following Volume were committed to the care of myself, and the Lady already mentioned, agreeable to some of his own last directions; and so sacred is the trust configned by deceased friend, that I scarce know how to excuse my long delay in offering them to the world; especially after the great encouragement given to the publication, by the numerous and respectable list of Subscribers, prefixed to the work. The true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse will be the best, and I am persuaded, the most acceptable; namely, my want of leisure to select and review the different papers, and the interruption which the work met with, by my being obliged to take a voyage to South-Carolina, during the last winter.</p>
                  <p>WHAT <hi>high</hi> and <hi>rapturous</hi> Ideas our Author had formed of true <hi>POETIC GENIUS,</hi> may be in some measure conceived from the following <hi>Preface,</hi> which seems to have been intended for his <hi>Pieces,</hi> and was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written by him, in the short interval between his last dangerous illness, and that fatal relapse, which put an end to his life—This Preface I shall give literally as he left it; for here the least variation would be criminal.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>POETRY, says he, has been accounted the most <hi>peculiar</hi> of all the liberal arts; and it is the only <hi>One,</hi> in the circle of literature, which a man of common capacity cannot, by <hi>meer</hi> dint of constant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, become master of. The most exalted <hi>prose writers</hi> that ever graced the learned world, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themselves liable to ridicule in their <hi>addresses</hi> to the <hi>MUSES.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>THE great <hi>Cicero,</hi> not less famous for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of his style, than for his universal knowledge, was a remarkable instance of the truth of this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And the wonder ceases, if what a celebrated Critic<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>RAPIN.</hi>
                        </note> says, be true, to wit—
<hi>That to constitute a</hi> POET, <hi>is required</hi> 
                        <q>an elevation of soul, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not only on art and study, but must also BE THE GIFT OF HEAVEN.</q>
I say, if this be the case, the riddle is immediately expounded, and we are at no loss to assign a reason, why some, (comparatively speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>illiterate men,</hi> have been the sublimest poets of the age they lived in.</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:012386_0004_0F8944CC2CE748F8"/>"IT is not strange, therefore, that those whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has thus distinguished, should be looked on as a kind of prodigies in the world. For, according to Horace, it is not a trifling power the man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with—

                  <p>"THERE is a pleasing <hi>Je ne scay quoi</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of <hi>poetic</hi> genius, which is easier felt than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. It is the <hi>voice of nature</hi> in the <hi>POET,</hi> operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a charm on the soul of the reader. It is the <hi>marvellous conception,</hi> the <hi>noble wildness,</hi> the <hi>lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sentiment,</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>enthusiasm</hi> of spirit, the <hi>living imagery,</hi> the <hi>exquisite choice of words,</hi> the <hi>variety,</hi> the <hi>sweetness,</hi> the <hi>majesty</hi> of numbers, and the irresistable <hi>magic</hi> of <hi>expression</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>prose writer,</hi> may indeed warm his Reader with a <hi>serene</hi> and <hi>steady</hi> fire; he may keep up his attention with the <hi>energetic,</hi> the flowing <hi>period.</hi> But the <hi>POET'S</hi> it is, to <hi>wrap him in a flame</hi>— to

                  <p>
                     <q>SUCH is the genuine Poet, when improved by the precepts of <hi>Art;</hi> and the works of such have been the continual delight of mankind, as they afford the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimest intellectual enjoyment. With such, to tread the <hi>flowery fields</hi> of <hi>imagination,</hi> and gather the <hi>rich fruits of knowledge,</hi> is <hi>HAPPINESS</hi> indeed!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>BUT it is rare, that such <hi>Natural Geniuses</hi> are seen to arrive at this envied height. Some <hi>black ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle</hi> still clogs their wings, and retards their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress—Frequently those to whom Nature has been thus bountiful, have not leisure to attend to the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of their talents—frequently, like the rose in the wilderness, they just bloom, and wither away in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity; and sometimes, alas! the <hi>iron-hand</hi> of <hi>DEATH cuts them SUDDENLY off,</hi> as <hi>their beauties are just budding forth into existence,</hi> and <hi>leaves but the FAIR PROMISES of FUTURE EXCELLENCIES</hi>****</q>

                  <p>FURTHER his pen went not—What a dreadful blank closes the foregoing sentence, and how truly <hi>prophetic</hi> of his own fate? <hi>HE DIED in his TWENTY-SIXTH</hi> Year—He was my <hi>PUPIL,</hi> and truly dear and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to me in his whole demeanor—If I had not the original, in his own hand to produce, I should have been afraid to publish this Preface, as his, lest it should be suspected to have been written after his death, and accommodated to that event.</p>
                  <p>HOW far his Poems will answer the idea he had formed of <hi>poetic eminence,</hi> must be left for his readers to judge. Many of them are <hi>fragments,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finished; and but few of them were revised by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with a view of being published. Some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections have, therefore, been made, where there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared any thing materially faulty in respect to Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, the exactness of the rhymes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in these the Publisher has been sparing, and has taken care that the Author's sense should in no case be deviated from—

The task he left to be performed was a mournful one; but it has been executed with that fidelity, which the writer of this would wish might be extended to any perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his own, that may be thought worthy of the public eye, by that true friend into whose hands it may fall, when he himself shall be no more!</p>

                  <head>VERSES FOR THE NEW-YEAR 1762 <note n="*" place="bottom">It is a custom in Philadelphia, for the lads that deliver out the news-papers, to present to the customers, on <hi>New-Year's</hi> Day, a copy of verses, reciting some of the most signal occurrences and transactions of the past year, for which they commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a small gratuity. These verses are generally the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of such young <hi>Bards</hi> as the printers lads can make interest with. Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> was prevailed upon to write for 1762, 1763; but as the principal occurrences of those years were the subject of some of his odes, the repetition of several of the same thoughts became almost unavoidable. And indeed, these New-Years'-Day productions, are to be considered rather as good-natur'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances of the <hi>Muse,</hi> than the true and genuine fruits of her inspiration.</note>.</head>

                  <div type="introduction">
                     <p>THERE is in no collection of devout compositions a greater diversity of matter than in the Psalms of <hi>DAVID.</hi> They appear to have been pen'd while the author was under the immediate impression of those feelings which he so admirably describes; whether of religious pensiveness, devout contemplation, admiration of God's attributes, pious joy, gratitude, and thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, arising from the various state of his mind or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affairs. They are, therefore, wonderfully fitted and adapted to the case of men in general, who, at one time or other, are in some of those situations, and actuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the same sensations: And as they are written with great fervour of spirit, solidity of understanding, strength of fancy, and a soul illuminated by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, it is not to be wondered that they have so often charmed the best and greatest geniuses.—Sundry of our most celebrated English poets have employed their pens in rendering divers of those excellent pieces into verse—and there is not a sublimer and more musical poem in the compositions of <hi>Addison,</hi> than that which is wrought out of the <hi>19</hi>th psalm.</p>
                     <p>I have thus far premised, to induce, if possible, those youths among us, who have enjoyed the advantage of a
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:012386_0047_0F8944EF68BCCD70"/>
liberal education, and have leisure for literary pursuits and a taste and capacity for poetry, which some have lately evinced, to turn their talents towards such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive performances.—The Holy Scriptures are the true fountain from which to extract the richest draughts of poesy, both as to dignity of matter and embellishment of figures; witness the noble use the great <hi>Milton</hi> made of them in his marvellous poems, and though few must expect to reach to such heights as did that prodigy of learning and genius, yet all, according to their ability, may follow his illustrious example; and if we would wish to excel and atchieve any thing great and laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we should always look to a mark superior to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>145</hi>th psalm, in particular, one of those paraphrased below, is a most beautiful picture of the Supreme Being, whom the Psalmist extols for those amiable attributes, which most of all must <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     <l>Life's blooming spring just opens to our eyes,</l>

                  <l>Downward he journey'd, wond'rous gay,</l>
                  <l>And, like a lark, sang all the way;</l>
                  <l>The reason was, or they bely'd him,</l>
                  <l>His yoke-fellow was not beside him.</l>
                  <l>Whole grottoes, as he pass'd along,</l>
                  <l>Danc'd to the music of his song.</l>
                  <l>So have I seen, upon the plains,</l>
                  <l>A <hi>fiddler</hi> captivate the swains,</l>
                  <l>And make them caper to his strains.</l>
                  <l>To Pluto's court at last he came,</l>
                  <l>Where the god sat enthron'd in flame,</l>

                  <l>EURYDICE, his darling fair?</l>
                  <l>The fiends, who list'ning round him stood,</l>

                     <l>The fault'ring voice, the sigh of care,</l>
                     <l>The languid look, the dying air.</l>
                     <l>When abject thus behaves the muse,</l>

                     <salute>My respected FRIENDS,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE partiality you have shewn to the following discourse, in desiring me to furnish you with a Copy of it, to send to the press, merits my sincerest thanks.</p>
                  <p>At the same time, I cannot but observe to you, that the honour you pay me lays me under no small difficulty. For, to argue the unworthiness of the composition against its being printed, would be returning you a poor compliment, and might appear in me like an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of modesty.— On the other hand, my comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your request, may subject me to the charge of vanity, with those who are readier to censure than to judge with candour. I can only say, therefore, that the reason you assign for your desire to have this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course printed, is sufficient for me to wave the above objections, <hi>viz.</hi> That you believe it may be of <hi>service</hi> to some people in my mission, as it sets forth some prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical truths (as you are pleas'd to say) in an agreeable
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012386_0089_0F8944782D18A5B0"/>
point of light. Whether that can be said with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the following Sermon, it becomes me not to decide.</p>
                  <p>Should it please God to bless it to any one of you, should it excite but in one single breast, a <hi>taste</hi> for vital religion and the practice of Christianity, whatever other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise may be its fate, I shall rejoice that it now attends you to your closets.</p>
                  <p>I have only therefore, to add, that it appears the <hi>same</hi> now in print, as when delivered to you from the Pulpit, with no other than a few verbal alterations. And, as it was not compos'd with any design of being sent to the press, I hope no one will be surprised if he finds it to consist only of a few plain arguments and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, counselling plain people, so to use <hi>this world,</hi> that (in some future state of existence) they may be found worthy to inherit the immortal joys of a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Recommending you, therefore, to <hi>God</hi>'s Grace, and the best of Masters and Patterns, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, with true affection and regard,</p>

                        </bibl>
                        <p>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doth the will of God, abideth for ever.</p>
                     </q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>NOTHING can sound more harsh and ungrateful to human nature than precepts of this sort. The load of sense with which we are weighed down, the variety of alluring objects that surround us, the syren-voice of temptation, and the prevalence of numerous example, are too apt, more especially in the spring-tide of life, to give nature the conquest over Grace, passion over rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012386_0090_0F894478E76C1250"/>
and vanity over wisdom. We are too apt to be hurried away into the flowery avenues of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to yield up the will to desire, regardless of the consequences, and impatient of control.</p>
                  <p>The eminent Apostle of the Gentiles, leaves us this account of his conflict with the world; <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. vii.22, 23.</note>
                     <q>I delight</q>
(says he)
<q>in the law of God, after the inward man. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, which is in my members; which a great <note n="†" place="bottom">LOCKE.</note> genius of our nation thus paraphrases;</q>
                     <q>For that which my inward man is delighted with, that which with satisfaction my mind would make its rule, is the law of God. But I see in my members another principle of action equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a law, directly waging war against that law which my mind would follow, leading me captive into an unwilling subjection to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant inclination and impulse of my carnal appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, which, as steadily as if it were a law, carries me to sin.</q>
This then is not a particular case, but what all mankind is liable to, for <hi>the mind would serve the law of God; but the flesh the law of sin.</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012386_0090_0F894478E76C1250"/>
Which law of sin, as the Apostle expresses it, is the inherent propensity of our fallen natures to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the violent calls of animal desire. And what St. John means in the text by loving the world, no doubt, is the delight we take in indulging this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved inclination, so as to make the gross and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleasures of sense the prime object of our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits; instead of endeavouring to subdue our bodies and perfect our minds in the spirit of religion and solid virtue.</p>
                  <p>A person then may be said to love the world, according to the meaning of the text, when his mind is under the influence and guidance of his animal passions; when those passions are so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged as to occasion confusion and uproar in his soul, to breed disorder and irregularity in society, and to alienate his affections from the love of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and <hi>moral excellencies</hi>; when his conduct is swayed by corrupt customs; when he looks upon the enjoyments of <hi>this world</hi> as his <hi>chief good,</hi> and his ideas of happiness are confined within its scanty orb; when, to gain its applause, he barters his conscience, neglects the great duties incumbent on him as a rational agent, and banishes the sacred forms of religion and virtue from his heart. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, he may be said to love the world, when
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012386_0091_0F89447A95559028"/>
he does not prefer Almighty God as the first and grand object of his thoughts; when he does not esteem his favour as the highest felicity, endeavour to live as in his presence, devote himself to his service and strive to imitate, as far as the frailty of human nature will admit, his adorable perfections.</p>
                  <p>Further, by the love of the world we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand making an immoderate use of God's benefits, attaching our minds solely to earthly pleasures, following the errors and evil courses of lawless and abandoned men, giving way to low groveling thoughts, nor wishing to enjoy the more refined and manly pleasure which slows from a virtuous course of action.</p>
                  <p>Such being the love of the world, we cannot wonder at its being condemned by the good Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the text; and it is a very vain thing for those who are connected with the world in the light we have represented, to expect any benefit from our Saviour's sufferings, or hope to be saved, in time of need, by only calling on his name.
For it is written, that <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. ii.19.</note> 
                     <q>every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</q>
And the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Jesus hath solemnly assured us, that <note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. vii.21.</note> 
                     <q>not every one that saith unto him, Lord, Lord, shall
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012386_0091_0F89447A95559028"/>
enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doth the will of his Father which is in heaven.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some there are, who think that not loving the world consists in banishing themselves from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man society, and that turning their backs on their fellow-creatures is turning their backs on the world; and therefore fly to deserts and cloysters in pursuit of virtue and to avoid vice. But far otherwise is the prayer of our divine Master, when he recommended his disciples to the care of his heavenly Father. <note n="*" place="bottom">John xvii.15.</note>
                     <q>I pray not,</q>
says he
<q>that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil.</q>
For the world is the grand theatre on which all virtuous actions must be performed, and the merit of our performance rests in not quitting the stage, and yet avoiding the evil. For what field have we to call forth the duties of Christianity in, if it is not among our brethren? By ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our love and charity among our fellow-creatures, by acts of devotion, justice, mercy, and living up to the dictates of truth and right reason, is the best method of showing our love to God, and the genuine path that the Gospel has
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012386_0092_0F89447B2E85F150"/>
pointed out. But this it is impossible to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mingling with mankind; and although we may meet with some whose behaviour and manners may give us a pain too big to be utter'd, yet we are not to turn our backs on the world for any such reason. Does not the eternal Majesty of heaven, the infinite fountain of all excellence and perfection, bear with our weaknesses and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies from day to day? and shall we lack patience then with one another, when even the best of us are such frail, infirm creatures, as to be unable to enter into heaven without the imputation of a better righteousness than our own? 'Tis our duty to war against vicious habits, to endeavour, with the aids of God's Grace, after an upright and blameless conduct, and to convince the world, by the force of example, that our religion is more than a name, and that we are really in love with the beauty of holiness.</p>
                  <p>By the love of the world, as mentioned by the Apostle in the text, it is very manifest that he means the love of sin; or, suffering our souls to yield (in St. Paul's phrase) to the "law of sin;" that is, debauching our reason, and converting the talents of the mind from their proper office, the perfecting us for heaven, to be the slaves of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012386_0092_0F89447B2E85F150"/>
our appetites, to warp the judgment and blind the understanding, to call corruption pleasure, and madness joy. But it would be very injurious to the sacred text as well as highly absurd in its consequences, to suppose that St. John here means by not loving the world, to treat with contempt the good things of this life. For to what purposes were the mercies of God so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully strew'd over the vast and beautiful theatre of Nature, if they were not for us to use, and sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and thankfully enjoy? Nay, so eminently glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is the frame of this visible world, that it compelled many sensible Heathens, who were led only by natural light, loudly to acknowledge that so wonderful a system could alone be effected by the power, wisdom and goodness of an infinite intelligence; and is therefore fit for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of man, as a reasoning creature, and one of the chief sources to deduce the most exalted ideas of his Almighty Creator. What is condemned and forbidden in the text is our making the blessings of this life the principal object of our pursuits, so as to make us unmindful of the shortness of our duration in this world, and that awful eternity into which we shall soon be translated; so as to injure our bodies and debase the nobler faculties of the soul, to unfit us for the various offices which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012386_0093_0F89447BE7F1E808"/>
our connexions require of us, and give the mind a disrelish for the rational pleasures of religion, and for those high and important meditations, which as men and christians it becomes us fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be engaged in. <note n="*" place="bottom">TILLOTSON, Serm. XXIII.</note>
                     <q>For this world is God's school, where immortal spirits clothed with flesh are trained and bred up for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</q>
And it behoves us to be exceeding thankful to Almighty God that he has cautioned and commanded us against an immoderate desire after worldly enjoyments. For we shall find it our interest if we look no further than this life to make a sober use of its refreshments. For diseases of the body, with loss of reputation, ruin of families, the total destruction of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and above all the horrors of an evil consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, attend our eagerly pursuing the inordinate calls of vice.</p>
                  <p>Were we born for no other purpose than to eat, drink and play, we might indeed strive who should roll foremost in the gay circle of pleasure, and only wish to beat the intoxicating round of licentiousness. But to other ends were we called into this life, and for far higher exercises were the faculties of the soul given to us than to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012386_0093_0F89447BE7F1E808"/>
be the ministers of iniquity. That illustrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage who came down from heaven for our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has set us, and all his followers, an excellent example of all those virtues and amiable qualities which it is our duty to practise during our stay in this world. The love and charity, which, like another celestial glory, shed a lustre around him, the universal philanthropy which he breathed, should kindle in our breasts the warmest benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for all that bear the human shape; and the public-spiritedness of his actions should inspire us with that generous principle which directs every thought and deed to God's glory, and the public good.</p>
                  <p>He whose soul is set upon temporal pleasures and pursuits, will rarely find leisure for any secret communion with the Father of Spirits, or feel any inclination to enjoy so blessed a privilege. For the human mind is so formed as to be inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of following the bent of two differing pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions together.

If we are in love with the world, our thoughts will altogether be engaged in mean, selfish views. Earthly happiness will be the sole mark we shall aim at, and whatever may interfere with, or throw a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012386_0094_0F89447CAB6C12D8"/>
check upon such a career, will be ever disgustful in our eyes. How can those passions, which are absorbed in carnal pursuits, be elevated with the flame of divine love? And how can that heart, which is coiled up in the narrow circle of self-love, distend with the true spirit of christian charity?</p>
                  <p>The pleasure which arises from the enjoyment of the good things of this world, though taken in moderation, is of so fleeting and perishable a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to give but a momentary satisfaction, and yields no matter for comfortable reflection in time of need.— Could we call, from their mansions of clay, the votaries of sensuality, the votaries of wealth, and the votaries of ambition, that have bustled on the stage of this world for these four thousand years past— what account, think ye, would they give of their former favourite pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits?
<q>I imagine, they would tell us, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the time past, on these unprofitable schemes gave them but a poor consolation in the eternal world; that they now reflect with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign contempt and abhorrence on what they once were so greatly enamoured of; that the high debauch, the dissolute frolic, the hoard of yellow dirt, the magnificent edifice, the splendid retinue, the nobility of blood, and the applause
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012386_0094_0F89447CAB6C12D8"/>
of the world, would appear to them unsubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</q> as the Poet happily expresses it, as—<q>the baseless fabrick of a vision.</q>
But far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise are the pleasures of religion and virtue; they are of an undecaying nature; a <hi>fons peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> a perpetual source of genuine comfort flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the breast of every christian. They shall live with him beyond the grave, and shall endure when this earthly globe shall be wrapt in flames, when you heavens shall vanish away, and the sun and moon shall dissolve.

                  <p>The love of the world is a subject no way susceptible of novelty, and what every one can speak largely upon. And yet how rare and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult is it for us to take the matter rightly to heart. We make no scruple of acknowledging that all the enjoyments under the sun are vain and unsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial. And yet vain and empty as they are, how hard do we find it to abstract ourselves from them? In some serious moments, perhaps, our souls, disgusted with some disappointment, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012386_0095_0F89447D69679048"/>
occurrence, assume an air of dignity, and affect to despise the lower pleasures, the glittering gewgaws and the painted baubles of life. But, alas! how soon do we fall from these stout resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and suffer ourselves to be ensnared with the next flattering temptation? Thus do we continue through life, still meeting with some new disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and yet still giving way to the next temptation that comes in our way. That active principle that stirs within our breasts must have some object on which to employ its busy and enlarged powers; and could we but once fix it on its proper aim, how glorious would be its pursuits! Could we but once convince ourselves of the nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all earthly bliss; could we but once see that the pleasures of this life, are like the glories of a painted cloud, beautiful at a distance, but, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a near approach, nothing but a sun-gilt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour; were this the case, I say, our souls would soon begin to search out for some more substantial happiness, and would quickly fix on that high and glorious source of all that is lovely, fair and good; where it would perceive such irresistible excellency, such transcendent glory and divine beauty, as would sweetly surprize and captivate all the powers of the soul. And how greatly are we blessed in having our souls so constituted as to be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012386_0095_0F89447D69679048"/>
able to enjoy so exalted a pleasure! to be capable of discovering, admiring and loving the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and perfections of the invisible God, and of imitating, though in great weakness, all his moral attributes! to be capable of pleasures far superior to those of sense, arising from the pursuit of what is excellent, and the practice of what is right! to be capable of receiving the highest satisfaction from the performance of acts of devotion, justice, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and charity; and, above all, to be capable of the sublimest pleasure from the reflection, that he that doth the will of God in this world, shall abide for ever in uninterrupted bliss in the world to come!</p>
                  <p>Surely, then, the man who seriously reflects on the value of his immortal soul, on the dignity of its nature, and the design of his coming into the world, will never be enslaved to corruptible and sublunary joys. He will use the things of this life as though he did not use them; and though his body may sometimes even wish to rebel against his mind, yet he will never suffer his nobler part to be satisfied with any happiness beneath that everlasting beatitude which the Sovereign of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven alone can bestow. To this end he will be continually endeavouring to wean himself from a too fond attachment to the delights of this life;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012386_0096_0F89447E283F44B8"/>
to subdue those impetuous passions, which like some mighty torrent are apt to bear down all the powers of the mind, if not timely controled; to prepare himself by frequent contemplation on a spiritual life, for that pure etherial kingdom where no corruption can dwell. And happy, thrice happy! the highly favoured christian! who has the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating Grace of the Divine Spirit to aid him in the arduous enterprize of perfecting himself!</p>
                  <p>If we take a brief view of the condition of a person who has been altogether devoted to this world, and one who, having made a just estimate of human life, has given up his mind to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Christ, I imagine we shall make no hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in determining which character we would wish to possess.— Behold the man of the world under the hand of adversity, and he is the image of unhappiness. Trembling and irresolute, he dreads to look for consolation in his own bosom, its proper residence.— The gay ideas of pleasure flit like the vanishing wind before his view. Are the inexorable arrows of death pointed at his heart? alas! ten thousand dreary forms affright his imagination, and stiffen every pore with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror! Despairing to look forward, and dreading to think on what has pass'd, he feels <hi>a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and a <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

already burning in his bosom. A reproaching conscience stares him in the face, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of an ill-spent life is intolerable to his thoughts.— But not so the man who has secured his happiness on the glorious terms of the Gospel, whose salvation is sealed with the <hi>redeeming blood of the Lamb,</hi> and who has endeavoured to practise those graces and virtues which adorned his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Master, while here on earth. Having long inured his soul to the thoughts of a more perfect existence and glorious immortality, when these elementary bodies shall mingle with their conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial dust, he feels no anxiety at the thoughts of leaving this transitory life; and often wishes to cast off the sin-worn tabernacle that detains his soul from mounting to that throne, where my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads of glorified spirits are continually pouring forth their immortal songs to the praise and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Supreme and All-creating Lord!— Is the good man oppressed with affliction and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by adversity, is he pursued by persecution, is he on the torturing rack, or bent beneath the merciless hand of the executioner? is he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the flames, limb by limb, and his whole body tumbling into dissolution? the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good conscience, and an immoveable confidence in the victorious Son of God shall speak peace to his soul, and like a heavenly hand
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012386_0097_0F89447EE80EAB50"/>
stretched forth from the clouds, shall support him through all extremes, shall rob death of its sting, and the grave of its victory.</p>
                  <p>Who would not then strive to possess so heroic and manly a spirit? Who would be enslaved to the paltry pleasures of sense, when the joys of angels are at his acceptance, when the delights of virtue are so superior to all others, and so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fitted for the exalted powers of the soul? Is it so trifling an advantage to disarm death of its awful terrors? to rise triumphant over the grave? to be distinguished in God's courts with a crown of glory, and to enjoy the raptures of the blest through the boundless ages of futurity?
If the thoughts of meeting with some celebrated philosophers and poets in a future state could make a wise heathen anticipate its joys; how great, think ye, must be the christian's exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he reflects, according to St. Paul's sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime description, that he shall be translated from this life into <note n="*" place="bottom">Hebrews xii.22, 23, 24</note> 
                     <q>the city of the living God, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of angels, and to the general assembly and church of the first-born, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:012386_0097_0F89447EE80EAB50"/>Knowing, therefore, that the world passeth away, and the lust thereof, but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever; who would be so far attached to this unstable state as to risk his everlasting happiness on its account?
If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the great and glorious Being we have to answer to; what it is to appear at his awful tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, to give an account of our conduct; that it is he who shall distribute rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the deeds done in the flesh; that, <q>if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his; and that the fruits of the Spirit are <hi>love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, faith, meekness, temperance</hi>;</q>
I say, if we duly consider these things, they are enough to animate us with a becoming sense of religion and virtue, and to disengage us from the fascinating delights of sense.
