            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776. A DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE <hi>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,</hi> IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED.</head>
            <p>WHEN in the cour≈øe of human events, it becomes nece≈ø≈øary for one people to di≈ø≈øolve the political bands which have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected them with another, and to a≈ø≈øume among the powers of the earth, the ≈øeparate and equal ≈øtation to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent re≈øpect to the opinions of mankind requires that they ≈øhould declare the cau≈øes which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to the ≈øeparation.</p>
            <p>We hold the≈øe truths to be ≈øelf-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by their Creator with certain unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rights; that among the≈øe are life, liberty, and the pur≈øuit of happine≈øs; that to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the≈øe rights, governments are in≈øtituted among men, deriving their ju≈øt powers from the con≈øent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes de≈øtructive of the≈øe ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboli≈øh it, and to in≈øtitute new government, laying its foundation on ≈øuch
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033044_0004_0FF62CCFD61FFC78"/>principles, and organizing its powers in ≈øuch form, as to them ≈øhall ≈øeem mo≈øt likely to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their ≈øafety and happine≈øs. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long e≈øtabli≈øhed ≈øhould not be changed for light and tran≈øient cau≈øes; and accordingly all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath ≈øhewn, that mankind are more di≈øpo≈øed to ≈øuffer, while evils are ≈øufferable, than to right them≈øelves by aboli≈øhing the forms to which they are accu≈øtomed. But when a long train of abu≈øes and u≈øurpations, pur≈øuing invariably the ≈øame object, evinces a de≈øign to reduce them under ab≈øolute de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poti≈øm, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off ≈øuch government, and to provide new guards for their future ≈øecurity. Such has been the patient ≈øufferance of the≈øe Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and ≈øuch is now the nece≈ø≈øity which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrains them to alter their former ≈øy≈øtems of government. The hi≈øtory of the pre≈øent King of Great-Britain is a hi≈øtory of repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed injuries and u≈øurpations, all having in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect object the e≈øtabli≈øhment of an ab≈øolute tyranny over the≈øe States. To prove this, let facts be ≈øubmitted to a candid world.</p>
            <p>He has refu≈øed his a≈ø≈øent to laws, the mo≈øt whole≈øome and nece≈ø≈øary for the public good.</p>
            <p>He has forbidden his Governors to pa≈øs laws of immediate and pre≈ø≈øing importance, unle≈øs ≈øu≈øpended in their operation till his a≈ø≈øent ≈øhould be obtained; and when ≈øo ≈øu≈øpended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>
            <p>He has refu≈øed to pa≈øs other laws for the accommodation of large di≈øtricts of people,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033044_0005_0FF62CD204710620"/>unle≈øs tho≈øe people would relinqui≈øh the right of repre≈øentation in the legi≈ølature, a right ine≈øtimable to them, and formidable to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants only.</p>
            <p>He has called together legi≈ølative bodies at places unu≈øual, uncomfortable, and di≈øtant from the depo≈øitory of their public records, for the ≈øole purpo≈øe of fatiguing them into compliance with his mea≈øures.</p>
            <p>He has di≈ø≈øolved Repre≈øentative Hou≈øes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly, for oppo≈øing with manly firmne≈øs his inva≈øions on the rights of the people.</p>
            <p>He has refu≈øed for a long time, after ≈øuch di≈ø≈øolutions, to cau≈øe others to be elected; whereby the legi≈ølative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exerci≈øe; the State remaining in the mean time expo≈øed to all the danger of inva≈øion from without, and convul≈øions within.</p>
            <p>He has endeavoured to prevent the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the≈øe States; for that purpo≈øe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructing the laws for naturalization of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigners; refu≈øing to pa≈øs others to encourage their migrations hither, and rai≈øing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of new appropriations of lands.</p>
            <p>He has ob≈øtructed the admini≈øtration of ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, by refu≈øing his a≈ø≈øent to laws for e≈øtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhing judiciary powers.</p>
            <p>He has made Judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their ≈øalaries.</p>
            <p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and ≈øent hither ≈øwarms of officers to hara≈øs our people, and eat out their ≈øub≈øtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:033044_0006_0FF62CD4196DC018"/>
He has kept among us, in times of peace, ≈øtanding armies, without the con≈øent of our legi≈ølatures.</p>
            <p>He has affected to render the military in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of and ≈øuperior to the civil power.</p>
            <p>He has combined with others to ≈øubject us to a juri≈ødiction foreign to our con≈øtitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his a≈ø≈øent to their acts of pretended legi≈ølation:</p>
            <p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>
            <p>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from puni≈øhment for any murders which they ≈øhould commit on the inhabitants of the≈øe States:</p>
            <p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>
            <p>For impo≈øing taxes on us without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent:</p>
            <p>For depriving us, in many ca≈øes, of the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efits of trial by jury:</p>
            <p>For tran≈øporting us beyond ≈øeas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>
            <p>For aboli≈øhing the free ≈øy≈øtem of Engli≈øh laws in a neighbouring Province, e≈øtabli≈øhing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its boundaries, ≈øo as to render it at once an example and fit in≈øtrument for introducing the ≈øame ab≈øolute rule into the≈øe Colonies:</p>
            <p>For taking away our charters, aboli≈øhing our mo≈øt valuable laws, and altering funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally the forms of our governments:</p>
            <p>For ≈øu≈øpending our own legi≈ølatures, and declaring them≈øelves inve≈øted with power to legi≈ølate for us in all ca≈øes what≈øoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:033044_0007_0FF62CD60704E000"/>
He has abdicated government here, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring us out of his protection, and waging war again≈øt us.</p>
            <p>He has plundered our ≈øeas, ravaged our coa≈øts, burnt our towns, and de≈øtroyed the lives of our people.</p>
            <p>He is at this time, tran≈øporting large ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, de≈øolation and tyranny, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun with circum≈øtances of cruelty and perfidy, ≈øcarcely paralleled in the mo≈øt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>
            <p>He has con≈øtrained our fellow citizens, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captive on the high ≈øeas, to bear arms again≈øt their country, to become the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of their friends and brethren, or to tall them≈øelves by their hands.</p>
            <p>He has excited dome≈øtic in≈øurrections among≈øt us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the mercile≈øs Indian ≈øavages, who≈øe known rule of warfare is an undi≈øtingui≈øhed de≈øtruction of all ages, ≈øexes and conditions.</p>
            <p>In every ≈øtage of the≈øe oppre≈ø≈øions we have petitioned for redre≈øs, in the mo≈øt humble terms: Our repeated petitions have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered only by repeated injury.

            <p>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our Briti≈øh brethren. We have warned them from time to time, of attempts by their
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033044_0008_0FF62CD8C1FE0E38"/>legi≈ølature to extend an unwarrantable juri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over us. We have reminded them of the circum≈øtances of our emigration and ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement here. We have appealed to their native ju≈øtice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred, to di≈øavow the≈øe u≈øurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connexions and corre≈øpondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of ju≈øtice and of con≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity. We mu≈øt, therefore, acquie≈øce in the nece≈ø≈øity which denounces our ≈øeparation, and hold them, as we hold the re≈øt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, enemies in war; in peace, friends.</p>
            <p>We, therefore, the Repre≈øentatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS a≈ø≈øembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, Do, in the name, and by the authority of the good People of the≈øe Colonies, ≈øolemnly publi≈øh and declare, That the≈øe United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, <hi>Free and Independent States;</hi> that they are ab≈øolved from all allegiance to the <hi>Briti≈øh Crown,</hi> and that all political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between them and the State of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is, and ought to be totally di≈ø≈øolved; and that as <hi>Free and Independent States,</hi> they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, e≈øtabli≈øh commerce, and to do all other acts and things which <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent States</hi> may of right do. And for the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033044_0009_0FF62CDACDEB7230"/>≈øupport of this Declaration, with a firm reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our ≈øacred honour.</p>

            <p>WE have now the honour to ≈øubmit to the con≈øid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of the United States in Congre≈øs a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that Con≈øtitution which has appeared to us the mo≈øt advi≈øeable. The friends of our Country have long ≈øeen and de≈øired, that the power of making war, peace and treaties, that of levying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ney and regulating commerce, and the corre≈øpondent Executive and Judicial authorities, ≈øhould be fully and effectually ve≈øted in the general gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of the Union; but the impropriety of delegating ≈øuch exten≈øive tru≈øts to one body of men is evident‚Äî Hence re≈øults the nece≈ø≈øity of a different organization.</p>
            <p>It is obviou≈øly impracticable in the federal government of the≈øe States, to ≈øecure all rights of independent ≈øov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereignty to each, and yet provide for the intere≈øt and ≈øafety of all‚ÄîIndividuals entering into ≈øociety, mu≈øt give up a ≈øhare of liberty to pre≈øerve the re≈øt. The magnitude of the ≈øacrifice mu≈øt depend as well on ≈øituation and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with preci≈øion, the line between tho≈øe rights which mu≈øt be ≈øurrendered, and tho≈øe which may be re≈øerved; and on the pre≈øent occa≈øion, this difficulty was increa≈øed by a difference among the ≈øeveral States as to their ≈øituation, extent, habits, and particular intere≈øts.</p>
            <p>In all our deliberations on this ≈øubject, we kept ≈øteadily in our view, that which appears to us the greate≈øt intere≈øt of every true American, the con≈øolidation of our Union, in which is involved our pro≈øperity, felicity, ≈øafety, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our national exi≈øtence. This important con≈øideration, ≈øeriou≈øly and deeply impre≈ø≈øed on our minds, led each State in the Convention to be le≈øs rigid on points of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior magnitude than might have been otherwi≈øe expected; and thus the Con≈øtitution which we now pre≈øent, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult of a ≈øpirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and conce≈ø≈øion which the peculiarity of our political ≈øituation rendered indi≈øpen≈øable.</p>
            <p>That it will meet the full and entire approbation of every State is not, perhaps, to be expected; but each will

All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, e≈ø≈øential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing, and protecting property; in fine, that of ≈øeeking and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their ≈øafety and happine≈øs.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is the right, as well as the duty, of all men in ≈øociety, publickly, and at ≈øtated ≈øea≈øons, to wor≈øhip the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, the great Creator and Pre≈øerver of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe. And no ≈øubject ≈øhall be hurt, mole≈øted, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained, in his per≈øon, liberty, or e≈øtate, for wor≈øhipping God in the manner and ≈øea≈øon, mo≈øt agreeable to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of his own con≈øcience; or for his religious profe≈ø≈øion or ≈øentiments‚Äîprovided he doth not di≈øturb the public peace, or ob≈øtruct others in their religious wor≈øhip.</p>
               <p n="3">III. As the happine≈øs of a people, and the good order and pre≈øervation of civil government, e≈ø≈øentially depend upon piety, religion, and morality; and as tho≈øe cannot be generally diffu≈øed through a community, but by the in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the public wor≈øhip of God, and of public in≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in piety, religion, and morality:‚ÄîTherefore, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their happine≈øs, and to ≈øecure the good order and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation of their government, the people of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth have a right to inve≈øt their Legi≈ølature with power to authori≈øe and require, and the Legi≈ølature ≈øhall, from time to time, authori≈øe and require, the ≈øeveral towns, pari≈øhes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious ≈øocieties, to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:033044_0079_0FF62D70C0C572E0"/>make ≈øuitable provi≈øion, at their own expen≈øe, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of the public wor≈øhip of God, and for the ≈øupport and maintenance of public Prote≈øtant teachers of piety, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and morality, in all ca≈øes, where ≈øuch provi≈øion ≈øhall not be made voluntarily.</p>
               <p>And the people of this Commonwealth have al≈øo a right to, and do, inve≈øt their Legi≈ølature with authority, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join, upon all the ≈øubjects, an attendance upon the in≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the public teachers, as afore≈øaid, at ≈øtated times and ≈øea≈øons, if there be any, on who≈øe in≈øtructions they can con≈øcientiou≈øly and conveniently attend:‚Äî</p>
               <p>Provided, notwith≈øtanding, that the ≈øeveral towns, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øhes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious ≈øocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ≈øhall, at all times, have the exclu≈øive right of electing their public teachers, and of contracting with them, for their ≈øupport and maintenance.</p>
               <p>And all monies, paid by the ≈øubject, to the ≈øupport of public wor≈øhip, and of the public teachers afore≈øaid, ≈øhall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the ≈øupport of the public teacher, or teachers, of his own religious ≈øect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, provided there be any, on who≈øe in≈øtructions he attends: otherwi≈øe it may be paid towards the ≈øupport of the teacher, or teachers, of the pari≈øh, or precinct, in which the ≈øaid monies are rai≈øed.</p>
               <p>And every denomination of Chri≈øtians, demeaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves peaceably, and as good ≈øubjects of the Commonwealth. ≈øhall be equally under the protection of the law: and no ≈øubordination of any one ≈øect or denomination to another, ≈øhall ever be e≈øtabli≈øhed by law.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The people of this Commonwealth have the ≈øole and exclu≈øive right of governing them≈øelves, as a free, ≈øov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign, and independent State; and do, and forever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ≈øhall, exerci≈øe and enjoy every power, juri≈ødiction, and right, which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øsly delegated to the United States of America, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs a≈ø≈øembled.</p>
               <p n="5">V. All power re≈øiding originally in the people, and being derived from them, the ≈øeveral magi≈øtrates, and officers of government, ve≈øted with authority, whether legi≈ølative, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive, or judicial, are their ≈øub≈øtitutes and agents, and are at all times accountable to them.</p>

                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:033044_0080_0FF62D72716AC1C0"/>
VI. No man, or corporation, or a≈ø≈øociation of men, have any other title, to obtain advantages, or particular and exclu≈øive privileges, di≈øtinct from tho≈øe of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than what ari≈øes from the con≈øideration of ≈øervices, rendered to the public. And this title being, in nature, neither hereditary, nor tran≈ømi≈ø≈øible to children, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcendants, or relations by blood,‚Äîthe idea of a man, born a magi≈øtrate, lawgiver, or judge, is ab≈øurd and unnatural.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Government is in≈øtituted for the common good; for the protection, ≈øafety, pro≈øperity, and happine≈øs of the people; and not for the profit, honour, or private intere≈øt of any one man, family, or cla≈øs of men. Therefore, the people alone have an inconte≈øtable, unalienable, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fea≈øible right, to in≈øtitute government; and to reform, alter, or totally change the ≈øame, when their protection, ≈øafety, pro≈øperity, and happine≈øs, require it.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. In order to prevent tho≈øe, who are ve≈øted with authority, from becoming oppre≈ø≈øors, the people have a right, at ≈øuch periods, and in ≈øuch manner, as they ≈øhall e≈øtabli≈øh by their frame of government, to ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="9">IX. All elections ought to be free; and all the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of this Commonwealth, having ≈øuch qualifications, as they ≈øhall e≈øtabli≈øh by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected for public employments.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Each individual of the ≈øociety has a right to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by it, in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, according to ≈øtanding laws. He is obliged, con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to contribute his ≈øhare to the expen≈øe of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; to give his per≈øonal ≈øervice, or an equivalent, when nece≈ø≈øary. But no part of the property of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual can, with ju≈øtice, be taken from him, or applied to public u≈øes, without his own con≈øent, or that of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentative body of the people. In fine, the people of this Commonwealth are not controllable by any other laws, than tho≈øe, to which their con≈øtitutional repre≈øentative body have given their con≈øent. And whenever the public exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies require, that the property of any individual ≈øhould be appropriated to public u≈øes, he ≈øhall receive a rea≈øonable compen≈øation therefor.</p>

                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:033044_0081_0FF62D745BE1D910"/>
XI. Every ≈øubject of the Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recour≈øe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>e laws, for all injuries or wrongs, which he may receive, in his per≈øon, property, or character. He ought to obtain right and ju≈øtice freely, and without being obliged to purcha≈øe it‚Äîcompletely, and without any denial‚Äîpromptly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay‚Äîconformably to the laws.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. No ≈øubject ≈øhall be held to an≈øwer for any crime or offence, until the ≈øame is fully and plainly, ≈øub≈øtantially and formally, de≈øcribed to him; or be compelled to accu≈øe, or furni≈øh evidence again≈øt him≈øelf. And every ≈øubject ≈øhall have a right to produce all proofs, that may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him; to meet the witne≈ø≈øes again≈øt him, face to face; and to be fully heard in his defence, by him≈øelf, or his coun≈øel, at his election. And no ≈øubject ≈øhall be arre≈øted, impri≈øoned, de≈øpoiled, or deprived of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, immunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or e≈øtate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</p>
               <p>And the Legi≈ølature ≈øhall not make any law, that ≈øhall ≈øubject any per≈øon to a capital or infamous puni≈øhment, (excepting for the government of the army and navy) without trial by jury.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. In criminal pro≈øecutions, the verification of facts, in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greate≈øt ≈øecurities of the life, liberty and property of the citizen.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Every ≈øubject has a right to be ≈øecure from all unrea≈øonable ≈øearches, and ≈øeizures, of his per≈øon, his hou≈øes, his papers, and all his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cau≈øe or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them be not previou≈øly ≈øupported by oath or affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and if the order, in a warrant, to a civil officer, to make ≈øearch in all ≈øu≈øpected places, or to arre≈øt one or more ≈øu≈øpected per≈øons, or to ≈øeize their property, be not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ≈øpecial de≈øignation of the per≈øons or objects of ≈øearch, arre≈øt, or ≈øeizure. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="15">XV. In all controver≈øies concerning property, and in all ≈øuits between two or more per≈øons, (except in ca≈øes, in which it has heretofore been otherwi≈øe u≈øed and practi≈øed)
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:033044_0082_0FF62D75E6DEB2E8"/>the parties have a right to a trial by a jury; and this method of procedure ≈øhall be held ≈øacred; unle≈øs, in cau≈øes ari≈øing on the high ≈øeas, and ≈øuch as relate to mariners' wages, the Legi≈ølature ≈øhall hereafter find it nece≈ø≈øary to alter it.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The liberty of the pre≈øs is e≈ø≈øential to the ≈øecurity of freedom in a State; it ought not, therefore, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained in this Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained, without the con≈øent of the Legi≈ølature; and the military power ≈øhall always be held in exact ≈øubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the civil authority, and be governed by it.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. A frequent recurrence to the fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Con≈øtitution, and a con≈øtant adherence to tho≈øe of piety, ju≈øtice, moderation, temperance, indu≈øtry, and frugality, are ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary, to pre≈øerve the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government. The people ought, con≈øequently, to have a particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to all tho≈øe principles, in the choice of their officers and repre≈øentatives: and they have a right to require of their lawgivers and magi≈øtrates, an exact and con≈øtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervance of them, in the formation and execution of all laws, nece≈ø≈øary for the good admini≈øtration of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. The people have a right, in an orderly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, to a≈ø≈øemble to con≈øult upon the common good; give in≈øtructions to their repre≈øentatives; and to reque≈øt of the legi≈ølative body, by the way of addre≈ø≈øes, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, or remon≈øtrances, redre≈øs of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they ≈øuffer.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. The power of ≈øu≈øpending the laws, or the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laws, ought never to be exerci≈øed, but by the Legi≈ølature; or, by authority derived from it, to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øed in ≈øuch particular ca≈øes only, as the Legi≈ølature ≈øhall expre≈øsly provide for.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. The freedom of deliberation, ≈øpeech, and debate, in either Hou≈øe of the Legi≈ølature, is ≈øo e≈ø≈øential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any accu≈øation or pro≈øecution, action, or complaint, in any other court or place what≈øoever.</p>
               <p n="22">
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:033044_0083_0FF62D78A71C5058"/>
XXII. The Legi≈ølature ought frequently to a≈ø≈øemble, for the redre≈øs of grievances, for correcting, ≈øtrengthening, and confirming the laws, and for making new laws, as the common good may require.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. No ≈øub≈øidy, charge, tax, impo≈øt, or duties, ought to be e≈øtabli≈øhed, fixed, laid, or levied, under any pretext what≈øoever, without the con≈øent of the people, or their Repre≈øentatives in the Legi≈ølature.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. Laws, made to puni≈øh for actions done before the exi≈øtence of ≈øuch laws, and which have not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared crimes by preceding laws, are unju≈øt, oppre≈ø≈øive, and incon≈øi≈øtent with the fundamental principles of a free gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. No ≈øubject ought, in any ca≈øe, or in any time, to be declared guilty of trea≈øon or felony by the Legi≈ølature.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. No magi≈øtrate, or court of law, ≈øhall demand exce≈ø≈øive bail or ≈øureties, impo≈øe exce≈ø≈øive fines, or inflict cruel or unu≈øual puni≈øhments.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. In time of peace, no ≈øoldier ought to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in any hou≈øe, without the con≈øent of the owner; and in time of war, ≈øuch quarters ought not to be made, but by the civil magi≈øtrate, in a manner ordained by the Legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. No per≈øon can, in any ca≈øe, be ≈øubjected to law martial, or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, (except tho≈øe employed in the army or navy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the militia in actual ≈øervice) but by authority of the Legi≈ølature.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. It is e≈ø≈øential to the pre≈øervation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property, and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and admini≈øtration of ju≈øtice. It is the right of every cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen, to be tried by judges, as free, impartial, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, as the lot of humanity will admit. It is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not only the be≈øt policy, but for the ≈øecurity of the rights of the people, and of every citizen, that the Judges of the Supreme Judicial Court ≈øhould hold their offices as long as they behave them≈øelves well; and that they ≈øhould have honourable ≈øalaries, a≈øcertained and e≈øtabli≈øhed by ≈øtanding laws.</p>

XXX. In the government of this Commonwealth, the legi≈ølative department ≈øhall never exerci≈øe the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: the executive ≈øhall never exerci≈øe the legi≈ølative and judicial powers, or either of them: the judicial ≈øhall never exerci≈øe the legi≈ølative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end, it may be a government of laws, and not of men.</p>

The Governor, Deputy-Governor, A≈ø≈øi≈øtants, and Secretary, are annually elected, on the ≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond Thur≈øday in May. The Repre≈øentatives are newly cho≈øen for each ≈øtated ≈øe≈ø≈øion. The Judges and Ju≈øtices are annually appointed by the General Court; the ≈øame per≈øons are commonly re-appointed, from time to time, during their capacity to ≈øerve, unle≈øs guilty of mi≈øbehaviour. The Sheriffs are appointed by the Governor and Council, without limitation of time; but may be ≈øuper≈øeded, by the authority that appoints them. The Governor, for the time being, is captain general of the militia; the Deputy-Governor, lieutenant-general; the other general officers, and the field officers, are appointed by the General Court, and commi≈ø≈øioned by the Governor. The captains and ≈øubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns are cho≈øen by the vote of the Company and hou≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, living within the limits of the Company; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, ≈øo cho≈øen, mu≈øt be approved by the General Court, and commi≈ø≈øioned by the Governor, before they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to execute their offices. All the military officers hold their offices during the plea≈øure of the A≈ø≈øembly; nor can they re≈øign their commi≈ø≈øions without leave of the captain-general, under penalty of doing duty in the ranks, as private ≈øoldiers. The mode of electing the Governor, Deputy-Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, A≈ø≈øi≈øtants, Trea≈øurer and Secretary is, that the freemen in the ≈øeveral towns meet on the Monday next after the fir≈øt Tue≈øday in April, annually (being the day appointed by law, for that purpo≈øe, and choo≈øing Repre≈øentatives) and give in their votes for the per≈øons they choo≈øe for ≈øaid offices re≈øpectively, with their names written on a piece of paper, which votes are received and ≈øealed up by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtable, in the freemen's meeting‚Äîthe votes for each of ≈øaid offices, in a different paper‚Äîwriting on the out≈øide the name of the town, and the office, for which the votes are given in; which are ≈øent by the Repre≈øentatives, to the General Court, to be held on the ≈øecond Thur≈øday of May next en≈øuing; at which time, after the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives have cho≈øen a Speaker and Clerk, a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee is cho≈øen of members of both Hou≈øes, to ≈øort and count the votes, and declare the names of the per≈øons cho≈øen to

In choo≈øing A≈ø≈øi≈øtants, twenty per≈øons are nominated by the votes of the freemen, given in at their meeting for choo≈øing Repre≈øentatives in September annually, and ≈øealed up and ≈øent to the General Court, in October then next; which are cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>WE, the Delegates and Repre≈øentatives of the good people of Virginia, do declare the future form of government of Virginia to be as followeth:</p>
            <p>The legi≈ølative, executive, and judiciary department, ≈øhall be ≈øeparate and di≈øtinct, ≈øo that neither exerci≈øe the powers properly belonging to the other: nor ≈øhall any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon exerci≈øe the powers of more than one of them, at the ≈øame time; except that the Ju≈øtices of the County Courts ≈øhall be eligible to either Hou≈øe of A≈ø≈øembly.</p>

            <p>The other ≈øhall be called <hi>The Senate,</hi> and con≈øi≈øt of twenty-four members, of whom thirteen ≈øhall con≈øtitute a Hou≈øe to proceed on bu≈øine≈øs; for who≈øe election, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent counties ≈øhall be divided into twenty-four di≈øtricts; and each county of the re≈øpective di≈øtrict, at the time of the election of its Delegates, ≈øhall vote for one Senator, who is actually a re≈øident and freeholder within the di≈øtrict, or duly qualified according to law, and is upwards of twenty-five years of age; and the Sheriffs of each county, within five days at farthe≈øt, after the la≈øt county election in the di≈øtrict, ≈øhall meet at ≈øome convenient place, and from the poll, ≈øo taken in their re≈øpective counties, return, as a Senator, the man who ≈øhall have the greate≈øt number of votes in the whole di≈øtrict. To keep up this A≈ø≈øembly by rotation, the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts ≈øhall be equally divided into four cla≈ø≈øes and number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by lot. At the end of one year after the general elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ≈øix members, elected by the fir≈øt divi≈øion, ≈øhall be di≈øplaced, and the vacancies thereby occa≈øioned ≈øupplied from ≈øuch cla≈øs or divi≈øion, by new election, in the manner afore≈øaid. This rotation ≈øhall be applied to each divi≈øion, according to its number, and continued in due order annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
            <p>The right of ≈øuffrage in the election of members for both Hou≈øes ≈øhall remain as exerci≈øed at pre≈øent; and each Hou≈øe ≈øhall choo≈øe its own Speaker, appoint its own offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ≈øettle its own rules of proceeding, and direct writs of election, for the ≈øupplying intermediate vacancies.</p>
            <p>All laws ≈øhall originate in the Hou≈øe of Delegates, to be approved of or rejected by the Senate, or to be amended, with con≈øent of the Hou≈øe of Delegates; except money-bills, which in no in≈øtance ≈øhall be altered by the Senate, but wholly approved or rejected.</p>
            <p>A Governor, or chief magi≈øtrate, ≈øhall be cho≈øen annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by joint ballot of both Hou≈øes (to be taken in each Hou≈øe re≈øpectively) depo≈øited in the conference room; the boxes examined jointly by a committee of each Hou≈øe, and the numbers ≈øeverally reported to them, that the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

An adequate, but mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate ≈øalary ≈øhall be ≈øettled on him, during his continuance in office; and he ≈øhall, with the advice of a Council of State, exxrci≈øe the executive powers of government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws of this Commonwealth; and ≈øhall not, under any pretence, exerci≈øe any power or prerogative, by virtue of any law, ≈øtatute or cu≈øtom of England. But he ≈øhall, with the advice of the Council of State, have the power of granting reprieves or pardons, except where the pro≈øecution ≈øhall have been carried on by the Hou≈øe of Delegates, or the law ≈øhall otherwi≈øe particularly direct; in which ca≈øes, no reprieve or pardon ≈øhall be granted, but by re≈øolve of the Hou≈øe of Delegates.</p>
            <p>Either Hou≈øe of the General A≈ø≈øembly may adjourn them≈øelves re≈øpectively. The Governor ≈øhall not prorogue or adjourn the A≈ø≈øembly, during their ≈øitting, nor di≈ø≈øolve them at any time; but he ≈øhall, if nece≈ø≈øary, either by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Council of State, or on application of a majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Hou≈øe of Delegates, call them before the time to which they ≈øhall ≈øtand prorogued or adjourned.</p>
            <p>A Privy Council, or Council of State, con≈øi≈øting of eight members, ≈øhall be cho≈øen, by joint ballot of both Hou≈øes of A≈ø≈øembly, either from their own members or the people at large, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt in the admini≈øtration of government. They ≈øhall annually choo≈øe, out of their own members, a Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who, in ca≈øe of death, inability, or ab≈øence of the Governor from the government, ≈øhall act as Lieutenant-Governor. Four members ≈øhall be ≈øufficient to act, and their advice and proceedings ≈øhall be entered on record, and ≈øigned by the members pre≈øent, (to any part whereof, any member may enter his di≈ø≈øent) to be laid before the General A≈ø≈øembly, when called for by them. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil may appoint their own Clerk, who ≈øhall have a ≈øalary ≈øettled by law, and take an oath of ≈øecrecy, in ≈øuch matters as he ≈øhall be directed by the board to conceal. A ≈øum of money, appropriated to that purpo≈øe, ≈øhall be divided annually among the members, in proportion to their attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:033044_0210_0FF62E80193FD630"/>and they ≈øhall be incapable, during their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in office, of ≈øitting in either Hou≈øe of A≈ø≈øembly. Two members ≈øhall be removed, by joint ballot of both Hou≈øes of A≈ø≈øembly, at the end of every three years, and be ineli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible for the three next years. The≈øe vacancies, as well as tho≈øe occa≈øioned by death or incapacity, ≈øhall be ≈øupplied by new elections, in the ≈øame manner.</p>
            <p>The Delegates for Virginia to the Continental Congre≈øs ≈øhall be cho≈øen annually, or ≈øuper≈øeded in the mean time, by joint ballot of both Hou≈øes of A≈ø≈øembly.</p>
            <p>The pre≈øent militia officers ≈øhall be continued, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies ≈øupplied by appointment of the Governor, with the advice of the Privy-Council, on recommendations from the re≈øpective County Courts; but the Governor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ≈øhall have a power of ≈øu≈øpending any officer, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Court Martial, on complaint of mi≈øbehaviour or ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or to ≈øupply vacancies of officers, happening when in actual ≈øervice.</p>
            <p>The Governor may embody the militia, with the advice of the Privy Council; and when embodied, ≈øhall alone have the direction of the militia, under the laws of the country.</p>
            <p>The two Hou≈øes of A≈ø≈øembly ≈øhall, by joint ballot, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Judges of the Supreme Court of Appeals, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Court, Judges in Chancery, Judges of Admiralty, Secretary, and the Attorney General, to be commi≈ø≈øioned by the Governor, and continue in office during good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.

            </head>
            <p>WHEREAS all government ought to be in≈øtituted and ≈øupported for the ≈øecurity and protection of the community as ≈øuch, and to enable the individuals, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe it, to enjoy their natural rights, and the other ble≈ø≈øings which the Author of exi≈øtence has be≈øtowed upon man: and whenever tho≈øe great ends of government are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the people have a right, by common con≈øent, to change it, and take ≈øuch mea≈øures as to them may appear nece≈ø≈øary, to promote their ≈øafety and happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>And whereas the inhabitants of this State have (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration of protection only) heretofore acknowledged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the King of Great-Britain: and the ≈øaid King has not only withdrawn that protection, but commenced and ≈øtill continues to carry on, with unabated vengeance, a mo≈øt cruel and unju≈øt war again≈øt them; employing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not only the troops of Great-Britain, but foreign merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, ≈øavages, and ≈ølaves, for the avowed purpo≈øe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to a total and abject ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to the de≈øpotic domination of the Briti≈øh Parliament, with many more acts of tyranny, (more fully ≈øet forth in the Declaration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs) whereby all allegiance and fealty to the ≈øaid King and his Succe≈ø≈øors, are di≈ø≈øolved and at an end; and all power and authority derived from him cea≈øed in the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican Colonies. And whereas the Territory, which now comprehends the State of Vermont, did antecedently of right belong to the government of New-Hamp≈øhire, and the former Governor thereof, viz. his excellency Benning Wentworth, <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> granted many charters of lands and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations within this State to the pre≈øent inhabitants and others. And whereas the late Lieutenant-Governor Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, of New York, with others, did, in violation of the tenth command, covet tho≈øe very lands: and by a fal≈øe
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:033044_0245_0FF62ECE0C143578"/>repre≈øentation, made to the Court of Great-Britain, (in the year 1764, that for the convenience of trade and admini≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of ju≈øtice, the inhabitants were de≈øirous of being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to that government) obtained juri≈ødiction of tho≈øe very identical lands, <hi>ex parte,</hi> which ever was and is di≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the inhabitants. And whereas the Legi≈ølature of New-York ever have, and ≈øtill continue to di≈øown the good people of this State, in their landed property, which will appear in the complaints hereafter in≈øerted, and in the 36th ≈øection of their pre≈øent Con≈øtitution, in which is e≈øtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed the Grants of Land made by that government.</p>
            <p>They have refu≈øed to make re-grants of our lands to the original Proprietors and Occupants, unle≈øs at the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant rate of 2,300 dollars fees for each town≈øhip; and did enhance the quitrent three-fold, and demanded an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate delivery of the title derived from New-Hamp≈øhire.</p>
            <p>The Judges of their Supreme Court have made a ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn declaration, that the charters, conveyances, &amp;c. of the lands included in the before-de≈øcribed premi≈øes, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly null and void, on which ≈øaid title was founded. In con≈øequence of which declaration, writs of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion have been by them i≈ø≈øued, and the Sheriff of the county of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany ≈øent at the head of ≈øix or ≈øeven hundred men, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the execution thereof.</p>

            <p>The Governors Dunmore, Tryon, and Colden, have made re-grants of ≈øeveral tracts of land included in the premi≈øes, to certain favourite land jobbers in the government of New-York, in direct violation of his Britannic Maje≈øty's expre≈øs prohibition, in the year 1767.</p>
            <p>They have i≈ø≈øued proclamations, wherein they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered large ≈øums of money for the purpo≈øe of apprehending tho≈øe very per≈øons, who have dared boldly and publickly to appear in defence of their ju≈øt rights.</p>
            <p>They did pa≈øs twelve acts of outlawry on the ninth day of March, A. D. 1774, empowering the re≈øpective Judges of their Supreme Court to award execution of death again≈øt tho≈øe inhabitants in ≈øaid di≈øtrict, that they ≈øhould judge to be offenders, without trial.</p>

They have and ≈øtill continue an unju≈øt claim to tho≈øe lands, which greatly retards emigration into any ≈øettlement of this State.</p>
            <p>They have hired foreign troops, emigrants from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, at two different times, and armed them to drive us out of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>They have ≈øent the Savages on our frontiers to di≈øtre≈øs us.</p>
            <p>They have proceeded to erect the counties of Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland and Glouce≈øter, and e≈øtabli≈øh courts of ju≈øtice there, after they were di≈øcountenanced by the authority of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>The free Convention of the State of New-York, at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, in the year 1776, unanimou≈øly voted, "That all quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, formerly due to the King of Great-Britain, are now due, and owing to this Convention, or ≈øuch future govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as ≈øhall be hereafter e≈øtabli≈øhed in this State."</p>
            <p>In the ≈øeveral ≈øtages of the afore≈øaid oppre≈ø≈øions, we have petitioned his Britannic Maje≈øty in the mo≈øt humble manner for redre≈øs, and have, at very great expen≈øe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ≈øeveral reports in our favour: and in other in≈øtances, wherein we have petitioned the late legi≈ølative authority of New-York, tho≈øe petitions have been treated with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect.

And previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any law being made to rai≈øe a tax, the purpo≈øe, for which it is to be rai≈øed ought to appear evident to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature to be of more ≈øervice to the community, than the money would be if not collected.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That in all pro≈øecutions for criminal offences, a man hath a right to be heard by him≈øelf and his coun≈øel‚Äî to demand the cau≈øe and nature of his accu≈øation‚Äîto be confronted with the witne≈ø≈øes‚Äîto call for evidence in his favour, and a ≈øpeedy public trial by an impartial jury of the country, without the unanimous con≈øent of which jury he cannot be found guilty‚Äînor can he be compelled to give evidence again≈øt him≈øelf‚Äînor can any man be ju≈øtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his liberty, except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. That the people have a right to hold them≈øelves, their hou≈øes, papers and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, free from ≈øearch or ≈øeizure: and therefore warrants, without oaths or affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

               <p n="15">XV. That the people have a right of fredom of ≈øpeech and of writing and publi≈øhing their ≈øentiments, concerning the tran≈øactions of government‚Äîand therefore the freedom of the pre≈øs ought not to be re≈øtrained.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI.

               <p n="17">XVII. The power of ≈øu≈øpending laws, or the execution of laws, ought never to be exerci≈øed, but by the Legi≈ølature, or by authority derived from it, to be exerci≈øed in ≈øuch particular ca≈øes only as the Legi≈ølature ≈øhall expre≈øsly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII.

               <p n="19">XIX. That no per≈øon in this Commonwealth can, in any ca≈øe, be ≈øubjected to law-martial or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except tho≈øe employed in the army, and the militia in actual ≈øervice.</p>

XX. That frequent recurrence to fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and a firm adherence to ju≈øtice, moderation, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, indu≈øtry, and frugality, are ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the ble≈ø≈øings of liberty, and keep government free; the people ought therefore to pay particular attention to the≈øe points, in the choice of officers and repre≈øentatives; and have a right, in a legal way, to exact a due and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant regard to them, from their legi≈ølators and magi≈øtrates, in the making and executing ≈øuch laws as are nece≈ø≈øary for the good government of the State.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI.
