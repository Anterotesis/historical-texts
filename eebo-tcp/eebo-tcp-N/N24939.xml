            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776. A DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE <hi>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,</hi> IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED.</head>
            <p>WHEN in the courſe of human events, it becomes neceſſary for one people to diſſolve the political bands which have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected them with another, and to aſſume among the powers of the earth, the ſeparate and equal ſtation to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent reſpect to the opinions of mankind requires that they ſhould declare the cauſes which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to the ſeparation.</p>
            <p>We hold theſe truths to be ſelf-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by their Creator with certain unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rights; that among theſe are life, liberty, and the purſuit of happineſs; that to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure theſe rights, governments are inſtituted among men, deriving their juſt powers from the conſent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes deſtructive of theſe ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboliſh it, and to inſtitute new government, laying its foundation on ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033044_0004_0FF62CCFD61FFC78"/>principles, and organizing its powers in ſuch form, as to them ſhall ſeem moſt likely to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their ſafety and happineſs. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long eſtabliſhed ſhould not be changed for light and tranſient cauſes; and accordingly all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath ſhewn, that mankind are more diſpoſed to ſuffer, while evils are ſufferable, than to right themſelves by aboliſhing the forms to which they are accuſtomed. But when a long train of abuſes and uſurpations, purſuing invariably the ſame object, evinces a deſign to reduce them under abſolute deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off ſuch government, and to provide new guards for their future ſecurity. Such has been the patient ſufferance of theſe Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and ſuch is now the neceſſity which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains them to alter their former ſyſtems of government. The hiſtory of the preſent King of Great-Britain is a hiſtory of repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed injuries and uſurpations, all having in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect object the eſtabliſhment of an abſolute tyranny over theſe States. To prove this, let facts be ſubmitted to a candid world.</p>
            <p>He has refuſed his aſſent to laws, the moſt wholeſome and neceſſary for the public good.</p>
            <p>He has forbidden his Governors to paſs laws of immediate and preſſing importance, unleſs ſuſpended in their operation till his aſſent ſhould be obtained; and when ſo ſuſpended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>
            <p>He has refuſed to paſs other laws for the accommodation of large diſtricts of people,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033044_0005_0FF62CD204710620"/>unleſs thoſe people would relinquiſh the right of repreſentation in the legiſlature, a right ineſtimable to them, and formidable to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants only.</p>
            <p>He has called together legiſlative bodies at places unuſual, uncomfortable, and diſtant from the depoſitory of their public records, for the ſole purpoſe of fatiguing them into compliance with his meaſures.</p>
            <p>He has diſſolved Repreſentative Houſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly, for oppoſing with manly firmneſs his invaſions on the rights of the people.</p>
            <p>He has refuſed for a long time, after ſuch diſſolutions, to cauſe others to be elected; whereby the legiſlative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exerciſe; the State remaining in the mean time expoſed to all the danger of invaſion from without, and convulſions within.</p>
            <p>He has endeavoured to prevent the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of theſe States; for that purpoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the laws for naturalization of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigners; refuſing to paſs others to encourage their migrations hither, and raiſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of new appropriations of lands.</p>
            <p>He has obſtructed the adminiſtration of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, by refuſing his aſſent to laws for eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing judiciary powers.</p>
            <p>He has made Judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their ſalaries.</p>
            <p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and ſent hither ſwarms of officers to haraſs our people, and eat out their ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:033044_0006_0FF62CD4196DC018"/>
He has kept among us, in times of peace, ſtanding armies, without the conſent of our legiſlatures.</p>
            <p>He has affected to render the military in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of and ſuperior to the civil power.</p>
            <p>He has combined with others to ſubject us to a juriſdiction foreign to our conſtitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his aſſent to their acts of pretended legiſlation:</p>
            <p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>
            <p>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from puniſhment for any murders which they ſhould commit on the inhabitants of theſe States:</p>
            <p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>
            <p>For impoſing taxes on us without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:</p>
            <p>For depriving us, in many caſes, of the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efits of trial by jury:</p>
            <p>For tranſporting us beyond ſeas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>
            <p>For aboliſhing the free ſyſtem of Engliſh laws in a neighbouring Province, eſtabliſhing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its boundaries, ſo as to render it at once an example and fit inſtrument for introducing the ſame abſolute rule into theſe Colonies:</p>
            <p>For taking away our charters, aboliſhing our moſt valuable laws, and altering funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally the forms of our governments:</p>
            <p>For ſuſpending our own legiſlatures, and declaring themſelves inveſted with power to legiſlate for us in all caſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:033044_0007_0FF62CD60704E000"/>
He has abdicated government here, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring us out of his protection, and waging war againſt us.</p>
            <p>He has plundered our ſeas, ravaged our coaſts, burnt our towns, and deſtroyed the lives of our people.</p>
            <p>He is at this time, tranſporting large ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, deſolation and tyranny, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun with circumſtances of cruelty and perfidy, ſcarcely paralleled in the moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>
            <p>He has conſtrained our fellow citizens, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captive on the high ſeas, to bear arms againſt their country, to become the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of their friends and brethren, or to tall themſelves by their hands.</p>
            <p>He has excited domeſtic inſurrections amongſt us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the mercileſs Indian ſavages, whoſe known rule of warfare is an undiſtinguiſhed deſtruction of all ages, ſexes and conditions.</p>
            <p>In every ſtage of theſe oppreſſions we have petitioned for redreſs, in the moſt humble terms: Our repeated petitions have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered only by repeated injury. A prince, whoſe character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e people.</p>
            <p>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our Britiſh brethren. We have warned them from time to time, of attempts by their
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033044_0008_0FF62CD8C1FE0E38"/>legiſlature to extend an unwarrantable juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over us. We have reminded them of the circumſtances of our emigration and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement here. We have appealed to their native juſtice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred, to diſavow theſe uſurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connexions and correſpondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of juſtice and of conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity. We muſt, therefore, acquieſce in the neceſſity which denounces our ſeparation, and hold them, as we hold the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, enemies in war; in peace, friends.</p>
            <p>We, therefore, the Repreſentatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS aſſembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, Do, in the name, and by the authority of the good People of theſe Colonies, ſolemnly publiſh and declare, That theſe United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, <hi>Free and Independent States;</hi> that they are abſolved from all allegiance to the <hi>Britiſh Crown,</hi> and that all political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between them and the State of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is, and ought to be totally diſſolved; and that as <hi>Free and Independent States,</hi> they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, eſtabliſh commerce, and to do all other acts and things which <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent States</hi> may of right do. And for the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033044_0009_0FF62CDACDEB7230"/>ſupport of this Declaration, with a firm reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our ſacred honour.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have now the honour to ſubmit to the conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of the United States in Congreſs aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that Conſtitution which has appeared to us the moſt adviſeable. The friends of our Country have long ſeen and deſired, that the power of making war, peace and treaties, that of levying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ney and regulating commerce, and the correſpondent Executive and Judicial authorities, ſhould be fully and effectually veſted in the general gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of the Union; but the impropriety of delegating ſuch extenſive truſts to one body of men is evident— Hence reſults the neceſſity of a different organization.</p>
            <p>It is obviouſly impracticable in the federal government of theſe States, to ſecure all rights of independent ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereignty to each, and yet provide for the intereſt and ſafety of all—Individuals entering into ſociety, muſt give up a ſhare of liberty to preſerve the reſt. The magnitude of the ſacrifice muſt depend as well on ſituation and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with preciſion, the line between thoſe rights which muſt be ſurrendered, and thoſe which may be reſerved; and on the preſent occaſion, this difficulty was increaſed by a difference among the ſeveral States as to their ſituation, extent, habits, and particular intereſts.</p>
            <p>In all our deliberations on this ſubject, we kept ſteadily in our view, that which appears to us the greateſt intereſt of every true American, the conſolidation of our Union, in which is involved our proſperity, felicity, ſafety, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our national exiſtence. This important conſideration, ſeriouſly and deeply impreſſed on our minds, led each State in the Convention to be leſs rigid on points of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior magnitude than might have been otherwiſe expected; and thus the Conſtitution which we now preſent, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of a ſpirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and conceſſion which the peculiarity of our political ſituation rendered indiſpenſable.</p>
            <p>That it will meet the full and entire approbation of every State is not, perhaps, to be expected; but each will
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033044_0044_0FF62D26B55F4CB0"/>doubtleſs conſider, that had her intereſts been alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, the conſequences might have been particularly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable or injurious to others; that it is liable to as few exceptions as could reaſonably have been expected, we hope and believe; that it may promote the laſting welfare of that country ſo dear to us all, and ſecure her freedom and happineſs, is our moſt ardent with.</p>
            <p>With great reſpect, we have the honour to be, Sir, your Excellency's moſt obedient, and humble ſervants.</p>

            <p>RESOLVED, by the Senate and Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the United States of America, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs aſſembled, two-thirds of both Houſes concurring, That the following Articles be propoſed to the Legiſlatures of the ſeveral States, as Amendments to the Conſtitution of the United States, all, or any of which articles, when rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified by three-fourths of the ſaid Legiſlatures, to be valid, to all intents and purpoſes, as part of the ſaid Conſtitution; viz.

In all criminal proſecutions, the accuſed ſhall enjoy the right to a ſpeedy and public trial, by an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial jury, of the State and Diſtrict, wherein the crime ſhall have been committed; which Diſtrict ſhall have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly aſcertained by law; and to be informed of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and cauſe of the accuſation; to be confronted with the witneſſes againſt him; to have compulſory proceſs for obtaining witneſſes in his favour; and to have the aſſiſtance of counſel for his defence.</p>
            <p n="9">IX.

               <p>ALL men are born equally free and independent; therefore all government of right originates from the people, is founded in conſent, and inſtituted for the general good.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Among the natural rights, ſome are in their very nature unalienable; becauſe no equivalent can be given or received for them: Of this kind are the <hi>Rights of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>

In criminal proſecutions, the trial of facts, in the vicinity where they happen, is ſo eſſential to the ſecurity of the life, liberty, and eſtate of the citizen, that no crime or offence ought to be tried in any other county than that in which it is committed: except in caſes of general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in any particular county, when it ſhall appear to the Judges of the Superior Court, that an impartial trial cannot be had in the county where the offence may be committed, and upon their report, the Legiſlature ſhall think proper to direct the trial in the neareſt county in which an impartial trial can be obtained.</p>
               <p n="18">18. All penalties ought to be proportioned to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the offence. No wiſe Legiſlature will affix the ſame puniſhment to the crimes of theft, forgery and the like, which they do to thoſe of murder and treaſon; where the ſame undiſtinguiſhing ſeverity is exerted againſt all offences, the people are led to forget the real diſtinction in the crimes themſelves, and to commit the moſt flagrant with as little compunction as they do the lighteſt offences: For the ſame reaſon a multitude of ſanguinary laws is both impolitic and unjuſt; the true deſign of all puniſhments being to reform, not to exterminate mankind</p>

In all controverſies concerning property, and in all ſuits between two or more perſons, except in caſes in which it has been heretofore otherwiſe uſed and practiſed, the parties have a right to a trial by Jury, and this method of procedure ſhall be held ſacred, unleſs in caſes ariſing on the high ſeas and ſuch as relate to mariners' wages, the Legiſlature ſhall think it neceſſary hereafter to alter it.</p>

As the happineſs of a people, and the good order and preſervation of civil government, eſſentially depend upon piety, religion, and morality; and as thoſe cannot be generally diffuſed through a community, but by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the public worſhip of God, and of public inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in piety, religion, and morality:—Therefore, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their happineſs, and to ſecure the good order and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their government, the people of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth have a right to inveſt their Legiſlature with power to authoriſe and require, and the Legiſlature ſhall, from time to time, authoriſe and require, the ſeveral towns, pariſhes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious ſocieties, to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:033044_0079_0FF62D70C0C572E0"/>make ſuitable proviſion, at their own expenſe, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the public worſhip of God, and for the ſupport and maintenance of public Proteſtant teachers of piety, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and morality, in all caſes, where ſuch proviſion ſhall not be made voluntarily.</p>
               <p>And the people of this Commonwealth have alſo a right to, and do, inveſt their Legiſlature with authority, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join, upon all the ſubjects, an attendance upon the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the public teachers, as aforeſaid, at ſtated times and ſeaſons, if there be any, on whoſe inſtructions they can conſcientiouſly and conveniently attend:—</p>
               <p>Provided, notwithſtanding, that the ſeveral towns, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhall, at all times, have the excluſive right of electing their public teachers, and of contracting with them, for their ſupport and maintenance.</p>
               <p>And all monies, paid by the ſubject, to the ſupport of public worſhip, and of the public teachers aforeſaid, ſhall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the ſupport of the public teacher, or teachers, of his own religious ſect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, provided there be any, on whoſe inſtructions he attends: otherwiſe it may be paid towards the ſupport of the teacher, or teachers, of the pariſh, or precinct, in which the ſaid monies are raiſed.</p>
               <p>And every denomination of Chriſtians, demeaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves peaceably, and as good ſubjects of the Commonwealth. ſhall be equally under the protection of the law: and no ſubordination of any one ſect or denomination to another, ſhall ever be eſtabliſhed by law.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The people of this Commonwealth have the ſole and excluſive right of governing themſelves, as a free, ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign, and independent State; and do, and forever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall, exerciſe and enjoy every power, juriſdiction, and right, which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly delegated to the United States of America, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs aſſembled.</p>
               <p n="5">V. All power reſiding originally in the people, and being derived from them, the ſeveral magiſtrates, and officers of government, veſted with authority, whether legiſlative, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive, or judicial, are their ſubſtitutes and agents, and are at all times accountable to them.</p>

                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:033044_0080_0FF62D72716AC1C0"/>
VI. No man, or corporation, or aſſociation of men, have any other title, to obtain advantages, or particular and excluſive privileges, diſtinct from thoſe of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than what ariſes from the conſideration of ſervices, rendered to the public. And this title being, in nature, neither hereditary, nor tranſmiſſible to children, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants, or relations by blood,—the idea of a man, born a magiſtrate, lawgiver, or judge, is abſurd and unnatural.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Government is inſtituted for the common good; for the protection, ſafety, proſperity, and happineſs of the people; and not for the profit, honour, or private intereſt of any one man, family, or claſs of men. Therefore, the people alone have an inconteſtable, unalienable, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſible right, to inſtitute government; and to reform, alter, or totally change the ſame, when their protection, ſafety, proſperity, and happineſs, require it.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. In order to prevent thoſe, who are veſted with authority, from becoming oppreſſors, the people have a right, at ſuch periods, and in ſuch manner, as they ſhall eſtabliſh by their frame of government, to ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> their public officers to return to private life; and to fill up vacant places, by certain and regular elections and appointments.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. All elections ought to be free; and all the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of this Commonwealth, having ſuch qualifications, as they ſhall eſtabliſh by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected for public employments.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Each individual of the ſociety has a right to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by it, in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, according to ſtanding laws. He is obliged, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to contribute his ſhare to the expenſe of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; to give his perſonal ſervice, or an equivalent, when neceſſary. But no part of the property of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual can, with juſtice, be taken from him, or applied to public uſes, without his own conſent, or that of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative body of the people. In fine, the people of this Commonwealth are not controllable by any other laws, than thoſe, to which their conſtitutional repreſentative body have given their conſent. And whenever the public exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies require, that the property of any individual ſhould be appropriated to public uſes, he ſhall receive a reaſonable compenſation therefor.</p>

XI. Every ſubject of the Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recourſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e laws, for all injuries or wrongs, which he may receive, in his perſon, property, or character. He ought to obtain right and juſtice freely, and without being obliged to purchaſe it—completely, and without any denial—promptly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay—conformably to the laws.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. No ſubject ſhall be held to anſwer for any crime or offence, until the ſame is fully and plainly, ſubſtantially and formally, deſcribed to him; or be compelled to accuſe, or furniſh evidence againſt himſelf. And every ſubject ſhall have a right to produce all proofs, that may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him; to meet the witneſſes againſt him, face to face; and to be fully heard in his defence, by himſelf, or his counſel, at his election. And no ſubject ſhall be arreſted, impriſoned, deſpoiled, or deprived of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, immunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or eſtate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</p>
               <p>And the Legiſlature ſhall not make any law, that ſhall ſubject any perſon to a capital or infamous puniſhment, (excepting for the government of the army and navy) without trial by jury.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. In criminal proſecutions, the verification of facts, in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greateſt ſecurities of the life, liberty and property of the citizen.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Every ſubject has a right to be ſecure from all unreaſonable ſearches, and ſeizures, of his perſon, his houſes, his papers, and all his poſſeſſions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cauſe or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them be not previouſly ſupported by oath or affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and if the order, in a warrant, to a civil officer, to make ſearch in all ſuſpected places, or to arreſt one or more ſuſpected perſons, or to ſeize their property, be not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſpecial deſignation of the perſons or objects of ſearch, arreſt, or ſeizure. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o warrant ought to be iſſued, but in caſes, and with the formalities, preſcribed by the laws.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. In all controverſies concerning property, and in all ſuits between two or more perſons, (except in caſes, in which it has heretofore been otherwiſe uſed and practiſed)
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:033044_0082_0FF62D75E6DEB2E8"/>the parties have a right to a trial by a jury; and this method of procedure ſhall be held ſacred; unleſs, in cauſes ariſing on the high ſeas, and ſuch as relate to mariners' wages, the Legiſlature ſhall hereafter find it neceſſary to alter it.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The liberty of the preſs is eſſential to the ſecurity of freedom in a State; it ought not, therefore, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in this Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained, without the conſent of the Legiſlature; and the military power ſhall always be held in exact ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the civil authority, and be governed by it.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. A frequent recurrence to the fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Conſtitution, and a conſtant adherence to thoſe of piety, juſtice, moderation, temperance, induſtry, and frugality, are abſolutely neceſſary, to preſerve the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government. The people ought, conſequently, to have a particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to all thoſe principles, in the choice of their officers and repreſentatives: and they have a right to require of their lawgivers and magiſtrates, an exact and conſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of them, in the formation and execution of all laws, neceſſary for the good adminiſtration of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. The people have a right, in an orderly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, to aſſemble to conſult upon the common good; give inſtructions to their repreſentatives; and to requeſt of the legiſlative body, by the way of addreſſes, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, or remonſtrances, redreſs of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they ſuffer.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. The power of ſuſpending the laws, or the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laws, ought never to be exerciſed, but by the Legiſlature; or, by authority derived from it, to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in ſuch particular caſes only, as the Legiſlature ſhall expreſsly provide for.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. The freedom of deliberation, ſpeech, and debate, in either Houſe of the Legiſlature, is ſo eſſential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any accuſation or proſecution, action, or complaint, in any other court or place whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="22">
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:033044_0083_0FF62D78A71C5058"/>
XXII. The Legiſlature ought frequently to aſſemble, for the redreſs of grievances, for correcting, ſtrengthening, and confirming the laws, and for making new laws, as the common good may require.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. No ſubſidy, charge, tax, impoſt, or duties, ought to be eſtabliſhed, fixed, laid, or levied, under any pretext whatſoever, without the conſent of the people, or their Repreſentatives in the Legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. Laws, made to puniſh for actions done before the exiſtence of ſuch laws, and which have not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared crimes by preceding laws, are unjuſt, oppreſſive, and inconſiſtent with the fundamental principles of a free gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. No ſubject ought, in any caſe, or in any time, to be declared guilty of treaſon or felony by the Legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. No magiſtrate, or court of law, ſhall demand exceſſive bail or ſureties, impoſe exceſſive fines, or inflict cruel or unuſual puniſhments.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. In time of peace, no ſoldier ought to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in any houſe, without the conſent of the owner; and in time of war, ſuch quarters ought not to be made, but by the civil magiſtrate, in a manner ordained by the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. No perſon can, in any caſe, be ſubjected to law martial, or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, (except thoſe employed in the army or navy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the militia in actual ſervice) but by authority of the Legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. It is eſſential to the preſervation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property, and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and adminiſtration of juſtice. It is the right of every cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen, to be tried by judges, as free, impartial, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, as the lot of humanity will admit. It is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not only the beſt policy, but for the ſecurity of the rights of the people, and of every citizen, that the Judges of the Supreme Judicial Court ſhould hold their offices as long as they behave themſelves well; and that they ſhould have honourable ſalaries, aſcertained and eſtabliſhed by ſtanding laws.</p>

XXX. In the government of this Commonwealth, the legiſlative department ſhall never exerciſe the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: the executive ſhall never exerciſe the legiſlative and judicial powers, or either of them: the judicial ſhall never exerciſe the legiſlative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end, it may be a government of laws, and not of men.</p>

            <p>The State of Rhode-Iſland and Providence Plantations has not aſſumed a form of government different from that contained in the foregoing chapter. For in that, the King ceded to the Governor and Company, all powers, legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, executive, and judicial, reſerving to himſelf, as an acknowledgment of his ſovereignty, a render of the fifth part of the gold and ſilver ore that ſhould be found within the territory. The Governor, chief magiſtrates, and legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators are choſen by the freemen as uſual, and all judicial and executive officers are annually elected by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

All proceſſes, original and judicial, formerly iſſued in the King's name, but they now iſſue in the name of the Governor and Company. The oaths of allegiance and of office are made conformable to the principles of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Governor, in his legiſlative capacity, cannot give a negative to any act of the two Houſes; but, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the other magiſtrates, has one voice only.</p>
            <p>The State is divided into five counties, in each of which there is a Court of Common Pleas and General Seſſions of the Peace, held twice every year, for the trial of all cauſes not capital, that ariſe within their limits; from which an appeal lies, to the Superior Court of Judicature, Court of Aſſize and General Jail Delivery, whoſe Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction extends over the whole State, and who alſo ſit twice a year in each county. The Conſtitution admits not of religious eſtabliſhments, any further than depends upon the voluntary choice of individuals. All men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing one Supreme Being, are equally protected by the laws; and no particular ſect can claim pre-eminence.</p>

This Court has power alſo, for reaſons ſatisfactory to them, to grant ſuſpenſion, releaſe, and jail delivery upon reprieve in capital and criminal caſes.

The Governor, or, in his abſence, the Deputy-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, may call the Aſſembly, on ſpecial emergencies, to meet at any other time. The Governor, Deputy-Governor, Aſſiſtants, and Secretary, are annually elected, on the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond Thurſday in May. The Repreſentatives are newly choſen for each ſtated ſeſſion. The Judges and Juſtices are annually appointed by the General Court; the ſame perſons are commonly re-appointed, from time to time, during their capacity to ſerve, unleſs guilty of miſbehaviour. The Sheriffs are appointed by the Governor and Council, without limitation of time; but may be ſuperſeded, by the authority that appoints them. The Governor, for the time being, is captain general of the militia; the Deputy-Governor, lieutenant-general; the other general officers, and the field officers, are appointed by the General Court, and commiſſioned by the Governor. The captains and ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns are choſen by the vote of the Company and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, living within the limits of the Company; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo choſen, muſt be approved by the General Court, and commiſſioned by the Governor, before they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to execute their offices. All the military officers hold their offices during the pleaſure of the Aſſembly; nor can they reſign their commiſſions without leave of the captain-general, under penalty of doing duty in the ranks, as private ſoldiers. The mode of electing the Governor, Deputy-Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, Aſſiſtants, Treaſurer and Secretary is, that the freemen in the ſeveral towns meet on the Monday next after the firſt Tueſday in April, annually (being the day appointed by law, for that purpoſe, and chooſing Repreſentatives) and give in their votes for the perſons they chooſe for ſaid offices reſpectively, with their names written on a piece of paper, which votes are received and ſealed up by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, in the freemen's meeting—the votes for each of ſaid offices, in a different paper—writing on the outſide the name of the town, and the office, for which the votes are given in; which are ſent by the Repreſentatives, to the General Court, to be held on the ſecond Thurſday of May next enſuing; at which time, after the Houſe of Repreſentatives have choſen a Speaker and Clerk, a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee is choſen of members of both Houſes, to ſort and count the votes, and declare the names of the perſons choſen to
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:033044_0130_0FF62DD63A1F8FF8"/>ſaid offices. Any freeman, qualified to vote for Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives, &amp;c. may be elected to any office in the government. In chooſing Aſſiſtants, twenty perſons are nominated by the votes of the freemen, given in at their meeting for chooſing Repreſentatives in September annually, and ſealed up and ſent to the General Court, in October then next; which are cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="2">II. The Repreſentatives ſhall be choſen annually, by the citizens of the city of Philadelphia, and of each county reſpectively, on the ſecond Tueſday of October.</p>
               <p n="3">III. No perſon ſhall be a Repreſentative who ſhall not have attained the age of twenty-one years, and have been a citizen and inhabitant of the State three years next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding his election, and the laſt year thereof an inhabitant of the city or county, in which he ſhall be choſen; unleſs he ſhall have been abſent on the public buſineſs of the United States, or of this State. No perſon, reſiding within any city, town, or borough, which ſhall be entitled to a ſeparate repreſentation, ſhall be elected a member for any county; nor ſhall any perſon, reſiding without the limits of any ſuch city, town, or borough, be elected a member therefor.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Within three years after the firſt meeting of the General Aſſembly, and within every ſubſequent term of ſeven years, an enumeration of the taxable inhabitants ſhall be made, in ſuch manner as ſhall be directed by law. The number of Repreſentatives ſhall, at the ſeveral periods of making ſuch enumeration, be fixed by the Legiſlature, and
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:033044_0154_0FF62E05CB748690"/>apportioned among the city of Philadelphia, and the ſeveral counties, according to the number of taxable inhabitants in each; and ſhall never be leſs than ſixty, nor greater than one hundred. Each county ſhall have, at leaſt, one Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentative: but no county, hereafter erected, ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to a ſeparate repreſentation, until a ſufficient number of taxable inhabitants ſhall be contained within it, to entitle them to one Repreſentative, agreeable to the ratio which ſhall then be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Senators ſhall be choſen for four years, by the citizens of Philadelphia, and of the ſeveral counties, at the ſame time, in the ſame manner, and at the ſame places where they ſhall vote for Repreſentatives.</p>
               <p n="6">VI.

When a diſtrict ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two or more counties, they ſhall be adjoining. Neither the city of Philadelphia, nor any county, ſhall be divided, in forming a diſtrict.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. No perſon ſhall be a Senator who ſhall not have attained the age of twenty-five years, and have been a cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen and inhabitant of the State four years next before his election, and the laſt year thereof an inhabitant of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict for which he ſhall be choſen; unleſs he ſhall have been abſent on the public buſineſs of the United States, or of this State.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Immediately after the Senators ſhall be aſſembled, in conſequence of the firſt election, ſubſequent to the firſt enumeration, they ſhall be divided, by lot, as equally as may be, into four claſſes. The ſeats of the Senators of the firſt claſs ſhall be vacated at the expiration of the firſt year; of the ſecond claſs, at the expiration of the ſecond year; of the third claſs, at the expiration of the third year;

And, in all indictments for libels, the jury ſhall have a right to determine the law and the facts, under the direction of the Court, as in other caſes.</p>

               <p n="10">X. That no perſon ſhall, for any indictable offence, be proceeded againſt criminally by information, except in caſes ariſing in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual ſervice, in time of war or public danger, or, by leave of the Court, for oppreſſion, and miſdemeanor in office. No perſon ſhall, for the ſame offence, be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb: nor ſhall any man's property be taken or applied to public uſe, without the conſent of his Repreſentatives, and without juſt compenſation being made.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That all Courts ſhall be open; and every man, for an injury done him in his lands, goods, perſon, or rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation, ſhall have remedy by the due courſe of law, and right and juſtice adminiſtered without ſale, denial, or delay. Suits may be brought againſt the Commonwealth in ſuch manner, in ſuch Courts, and in ſuch caſes, as the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may, by law, direct.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. That no power of ſuſpending laws ſhall be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, unleſs by the Legiſlature, or its authority.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. That exceſſive bail ſhall not be required, not exceſſive ſines impoſed, nor cruel puniſhments inflicted.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. That all priſoners ſhall be bailable by ſufficient ſureties, unleſs for capital offences, when the proof is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or preſumption great: and the privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus ſhall not be ſuſpended, unleſs when, in caſes of rebellion or invaſion, the public ſafety may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. That no commiſſion of Oyer and Terminer or Jail Delivery ſhall be iſſued.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="168" facs="unknown:033044_0166_0FF62E1FAF720EA0"/>
XVI. That the perſon of a debtor, where there is not ſtrong preſumption of fraud, ſhall not be continued in priſon, after delivering up his eſtate for the benefit of his creditors, in ſuch manner as ſhall be preſcribed by law.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. That no <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> law, nor any law impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contracts, ſhall be made.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. That no perſon ſhall be attainted of treaſon or felony by the Legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX.

               <p n="20">XX. That the citizens have a right, in a peaceable manner, to aſſemble together for their common good, and to apply to thoſe inveſted with the powers of government for redreſs of grievances, or other proper purpoſes, by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, addreſs, or remonſtrance.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. That the right of the citizens to bear arms, in defence of themſelves and the State, ſhall not be queſtioned.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. That no ſtanding army ſhall, in time of peace, be kept up, without the conſent of the Legiſlature; and the military ſhall, in all caſes, and at all times, be in ſtrict ſubordination to the civil power.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. That no ſoldier ſhall, in time of peace, be quartered in any houſe, without the conſent of the owner, nor, in time of war, but in a manner to be preſcribed by law.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. That the Legiſlature ſhall not grant any title of nobility or hereditary diſtinction, nor create any office, the appointment to which ſhall be for a longer term than during good behaviour.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. That emigration from the State ſhall not be prohibited.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. To guard againſt tranſgreſſions of the high powers which we have delegated, WE DECLARE. That every thing in this article is excepted out of the general powers of government, and ſhall forever remain inviolate.</p>

               <p>THE parliament of Great Britain, by a declaratory act, having aſſumed a right to make laws to bind the Colonies in all caſes whatſoever, and, in purſuance of ſuch claim, endeavoured, by force of arms, to ſubjugate the United Colonies to an unconditional ſubmiſſion to their will and power, and having at length conſtrained them to declare themſelves independent States, and to aſſume government under the authority of the people;—Therefore we, the Delegates of Maryland, in free and full Convention aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, taking into our moſt ſerious conſideration the beſt means of eſtabliſhing a good Conſtitution in this State, for the ſure foundation and more permanent ſecurity thereof, declare,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. That all government of right originates from the people, is founded in compact only, and inſtituted ſolely for the good of the whole.</item>
                  <item>II. That the people of this State ought to have the ſole and excluſive right of regulating the internal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and police thereof.</item>
                  <item>III. That the inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the common law of England, and the trial by jury, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe of that law, and to the benefit of ſuch of the Engliſh ſtatutes, as exiſted at the time of their firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igration, and which, by experience, have been found ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to their local and other circumſtances, and of ſuch others as have been ſince made in England, or Great
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:033044_0184_0FF62E45B9BE2E48"/>Britain, and have been introduced, uſed and practiſed by the courts of law or equity; and alſo to all acts of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in force on the firſt of June ſeventeen hundred and ſeventy-four, except ſuch as may have ſince expired, or have been or may be altered by acts of Convention, or this Declaration of Rights—ſubject, nevertheleſs, to the reviſion of, and amendment or repeal by, the Legiſlature of this State: and the inhabitants of Maryland are alſo entitled to all property, derived to them, from or under the Charter, granted by his Majeſty Charles I. to Caecilius Calvert, baron of Baltimore.</item>
                  <item>IV. That all perſons inveſted with the legiſlative or executive powers of government are the truſtees of the public, and, as ſuch, accountable for their conduct; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifeſtly endangered, and all other means of redreſs are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought, to reform the old or eſtabliſh a new government. The doctrine of non-reſiſtance, againſt arbitrary power and oppreſſion, is abſurd, ſlaviſh, and deſtructive of the good and happineſs of mankind.</item>
                  <item>V. That the right in the people to participate in the Legiſlature, is the beſt ſecurity of liberty, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all free government; for this purpoſe, elections ought to be free and frequent, and every man, having prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty in, a common intereſt with, and an attachment to the community, ought to have a right of ſuffrage.</item>
                  <item>VI. That the legiſlative, executive and judicial powers of government, ought to be forever ſeparate and diſtinct from each other.</item>
                  <item>VII. That no power of ſuſpending laws, or the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of laws, unleſs by or derived from the Legiſlature, ought to be exerciſed or allowed.</item>
                  <item>VIII. That freedom of ſpeech and debates, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the Legiſlature, ought not to be impeached in any other court or judicature.</item>
                  <item>IX. That a place for the meeting of the Legiſlature ought to be fixed, the moſt convenient to the members thereof, and to the depoſitory of public records; and the Legiſlature ought not to be convened or held at any other place, but from evident neceſſity.</item>

                     <pb n="187" facs="unknown:033044_0185_0FF62E4749D7AB28"/>
X. That, for redreſs of grievances, and for amending, ſtrengthening and preſerving the laws, the Legiſlature ought to be frequently convened.</item>
                  <item>XI. That every man hath a right to petition the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, for the redreſs of grievances, in a peaceable and orderly manner.</item>
                  <item>XII. That no aid, charge, tax, ſee, or fees, ought to be ſet, rated, or levied, under any pretence, without conſent of the Legiſlature.</item>
                  <item>XIII. That the levying taxes by the poll is grievous and oppreſſive, and ought to be aboliſhed; that paupers ought not to be aſſeſſed for the ſupport of government; but every other perſon in the State ought to contribute his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of public taxes, for the ſupport of government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his actual worth, in real or perſonal property, within the State; yet ſines, duties, or taxes, may properly and juſtly be impoſed or laid, with a political view, for the good government and benefit of the community.</item>
                  <item>XIV. That ſanguinary laws ought to be avoided, as far as is conſiſtent with the ſafety of the State: and no law, to inflict cruel and unuſual pains and penalties, ought to be made in any caſe, or at any time hereafter.</item>
                  <item>XV. That retroſpective laws, puniſhing facts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before the exiſtence of ſuch laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppreſſive, unjuſt, and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> law ought to be made.</item>
                  <item>XVI. That no law, to attaint particular perſons of treaſon or felony, ought to be made in any caſe, or any time hereafter.</item>
                  <item>XVII. That every freeman, for any injury done him in his perſon or property, ought to have remedy, by the courſe of the law of the land, and ought to have juſtice and right freely without ſale, fully without any denial, and ſpeedily without delay, according to the law of the land.</item>
                  <item>XVIII. That the trial of facts where they ariſe, is one of the greateſt ſecurities of the lives, liberties and eſtates of the people.</item>
                  <item>XIX. That, in all criminal proſecutions, every man hath a right to be informed of the accuſation againſt him:
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:033044_0186_0FF62E48E17B0F68"/>to have a copy of the indictment or charge in due time (if required) to prepare for his defence; to be allowed counſel; to be confronted with the witneſſes againſt him; to have proceſs for his witneſſes; to examine the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for and againſt him, on oath; and to a ſpeedy trial by an impartial jury, without whoſe unanimous conſent he ought not to be found guilty.</item>
                  <item>XX. That no man ought to be compelled to give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt himſelf, in a common court of law, or in any other court, but in ſuch caſes as have been uſually practiſed in this State, or may hereafter be directed by the Legiſlature.</item>
                  <item>XXI. That no freeman ought to be taken, or impriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, or diſſeized of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner deſtroyed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.</item>
                  <item>XXII. That exceſſive bail ought not to be required, nor exceſſive ſines impoſed, nor cruel or unuſual puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted, by the courts of law.</item>
                  <item>XXIII. That all warrants, without oath or affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſearch ſuſpected places, or to ſeize any perſon or property, are grievous and oppreſſive; and all general war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants—to ſearch ſuſpected places, or to apprehend ſuſpected perſons, without naming or deſcribing the place, or the perſon in ſpecial—are illegal, and ought not to be granted.</item>
                  <item>XXIV. That there ought to be no forfeiture of any part of the eſtate of any perſon, for any crime except mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or treaſon againſt the State, and then only on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and attainder.</item>
                  <item>XXV. That a well-regulated militia is the proper and natural defence of a free government.</item>
                  <item>XXVI. That ſtanding armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raiſed or kept up, without conſent of the Legiſlature.</item>
                  <item>XXVII. That in all caſes, and at all times, the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ought to be under ſtrict ſubordination to and control of the civil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <item>
                     <pb n="189" facs="unknown:033044_0187_0FF6175419A3DF90"/>
XXIX. That no perſon, except regular ſoldiers, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iners, and marines in the ſervice of this State, or militia when in actual ſervice, ought in any caſe to be ſubject to or puniſhable by martial law.</item>
                  <item>XXX. That the independency and uprightneſs of Judges are eſſential to the impartial adminiſtration of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and a great ſecurity to the rights and liberties of the people; wherefore the Chancellor and Judges ought to hold commiſſions during good behaviour; and the ſaid Chancellor and Judges ſhall be removed for miſbehaviour, on conviction in a court of law, and may be removed by the Governor, upon the addreſs of the General Aſſembly; provided that two thirds of all the members of each Houſe concur in ſuch addreſs. That ſalaries, liberal, but not profuſe, ought to be ſecured to the Chancellor and the Judges, during the continuance of their commiſſions, in ſuch manner, and at ſuch times, as the Legiſlature ſhall hereafter direct, upon conſideration of the circumſtances of this State. No Chancellor or Judge ought to hold any other office, civil or military, or receive fees or perquiſites of any kind.</item>
                  <item>XXXI. That a long continuance, in the firſt execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire departments of power or truſt, is dangerous to liberty; a rotation, therefore, in thoſe departments, is one of the beſt ſecurities of permanent freedom.</item>

Four members ſhall be ſufficient to act, and their advice and proceedings ſhall be entered on record, and ſigned by the members preſent, (to any part whereof, any member may enter his diſſent) to be laid before the General Aſſembly, when called for by them. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil may appoint their own Clerk, who ſhall have a ſalary ſettled by law, and take an oath of ſecrecy, in ſuch matters as he ſhall be directed by the board to conceal.

            <head>THE CONSTITUTION OF <hi>VERMONT.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEREAS all government ought to be inſtituted and ſupported for the ſecurity and protection of the community as ſuch, and to enable the individuals, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, to enjoy their natural rights, and the other bleſſings which the Author of exiſtence has beſtowed upon man: and whenever thoſe great ends of government are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the people have a right, by common conſent, to change it, and take ſuch meaſures as to them may appear neceſſary, to promote their ſafety and happineſs.</p>
            <p>And whereas the inhabitants of this State have (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of protection only) heretofore acknowledged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the King of Great-Britain: and the ſaid King has not only withdrawn that protection, but commenced and ſtill continues to carry on, with unabated vengeance, a moſt cruel and unjuſt war againſt them; employing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not only the troops of Great-Britain, but foreign merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, ſavages, and ſlaves, for the avowed purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to a total and abject ſubmiſſion to the deſpotic domination of the Britiſh Parliament, with many more acts of tyranny, (more fully ſet forth in the Declaration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs) whereby all allegiance and fealty to the ſaid King and his Succeſſors, are diſſolved and at an end; and all power and authority derived from him ceaſed in the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican Colonies. And whereas the Territory, which now comprehends the State of Vermont, did antecedently of right belong to the government of New-Hampſhire, and the former Governor thereof, viz. his excellency Benning Wentworth, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> granted many charters of lands and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations within this State to the preſent inhabitants and others. And whereas the late Lieutenant-Governor Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, of New York, with others, did, in violation of the tenth command, covet thoſe very lands: and by a falſe
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:033044_0245_0FF62ECE0C143578"/>repreſentation, made to the Court of Great-Britain, (in the year 1764, that for the convenience of trade and adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of juſtice, the inhabitants were deſirous of being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to that government) obtained juriſdiction of thoſe very identical lands, <hi>ex parte,</hi> which ever was and is diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the inhabitants. And whereas the Legiſlature of New-York ever have, and ſtill continue to diſown the good people of this State, in their landed property, which will appear in the complaints hereafter inſerted, and in the 36th ſection of their preſent Conſtitution, in which is eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Grants of Land made by that government.</p>
            <p>They have refuſed to make re-grants of our lands to the original Proprietors and Occupants, unleſs at the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant rate of 2,300 dollars fees for each townſhip; and did enhance the quitrent three-fold, and demanded an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate delivery of the title derived from New-Hampſhire.</p>
            <p>The Judges of their Supreme Court have made a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn declaration, that the charters, conveyances, &amp;c. of the lands included in the before-deſcribed premiſes, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly null and void, on which ſaid title was founded. In conſequence of which declaration, writs of poſſeſſion have been by them iſſued, and the Sheriff of the county of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany ſent at the head of ſix or ſeven hundred men, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the execution thereof.</p>
            <p>They have paſſed an act, annexing a penalty thereto, of thirty pounds' fine, and ſix months' impriſonment, on any perſon who ſhould refuſe aſſiſting the Sheriff, after being requeſted, for the purpoſe of executing writs of poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The Governors Dunmore, Tryon, and Colden, have made re-grants of ſeveral tracts of land included in the premiſes, to certain favourite land jobbers in the government of New-York, in direct violation of his Britannic Majeſty's expreſs prohibition, in the year 1767.</p>
            <p>They have iſſued proclamations, wherein they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered large ſums of money for the purpoſe of apprehending thoſe very perſons, who have dared boldly and publickly to appear in defence of their juſt rights.</p>
            <p>They did paſs twelve acts of outlawry on the ninth day of March, A. D. 1774, empowering the reſpective Judges of their Supreme Court to award execution of death againſt thoſe inhabitants in ſaid diſtrict, that they ſhould judge to be offenders, without trial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="unknown:033044_0246_0FF62ECFD021DA30"/>
They have and ſtill continue an unjuſt claim to thoſe lands, which greatly retards emigration into any ſettlement of this State.</p>
            <p>They have hired foreign troops, emigrants from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, at two different times, and armed them to drive us out of poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>They have ſent the Savages on our frontiers to diſtreſs us.</p>
            <p>They have proceeded to erect the counties of Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland and Glouceſter, and eſtabliſh courts of juſtice there, after they were diſcountenanced by the authority of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>The free Convention of the State of New-York, at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, in the year 1776, unanimouſly voted, "That all quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, formerly due to the King of Great-Britain, are now due, and owing to this Convention, or ſuch future govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as ſhall be hereafter eſtabliſhed in this State."</p>
            <p>In the ſeveral ſtages of the aforeſaid oppreſſions, we have petitioned his Britannic Majeſty in the moſt humble manner for redreſs, and have, at very great expenſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral reports in our favour: and in other inſtances, wherein we have petitioned the late legiſlative authority of New-York, thoſe petitions have been treated with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect. And whereas, the local ſituation of this State from New-York, which, at the extreme part, is upward of four hundred and fifty miles from the ſeat of that government, renders it extreme difficult to continue under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of ſaid State;</p>
            <p>Therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary, for the welfare and ſafety of the inhabitants of this State, that it ſhould be henceforth a free and independent State, and that a juſt, permanent, and proper form of government ſhould exiſt in it, derived from and founded on the authority of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only, agreeable to the direction of the honourable American Congreſs.</p>
            <p>We the Repreſentatives of the freemen of Vermont, in General Convention met, for the expreſs purpoſe of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a government—confeſſing the goodneſs of the great Governor of the univerſe (who alone knows to what degree of earthly happineſs mankind may attain by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the arts of government) in permitting the people
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:033044_0247_0FF62ED16B7E1820"/>of this State, by common conſent, and without violence, deliberately to form for themſelves ſuch juſt rules as they ſhall think beſt, for governing their future ſociety; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully convinced, that it is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r indiſpenſable duty to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh ſuch original principles of government as will beſt promote the general happineſs of the people of this State, and their poſterity, and provide for future improvements, without partiality for, or prejudice againſt, any particular claſs, ſect, or denomination of men whatever; do, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of authority veſted in us by our conſtituents, ordain, declare and eſtabliſh the following Declaration of Rights, and Frame of Government, to be the Conſtitution of this Commonwealth, and to remain in force therein forever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered, except in ſuch articles as ſhall hereafter on expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience be found to require improvement, and which ſhall, by the ſame authority of the people, fairly delegated, as this Frame of Government directs, be amended or improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the more effectual obtaining and ſecuring the great end and deſign of all government, herein before mentioned.</p>

                  <hi>CHAPTER I.</hi> A <hi>DECLARATION</hi> of the <hi>RIGHTS</hi> of the <hi>IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HABITANTS</hi> of the <hi>STATE</hi> of <hi>VERMONT.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. THAT all men are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and unalienable rights; amongſt which are, the enjoying and defending life and liberty—acquiring, poſſeſſing and protecting property—and purſuing and obtaining happineſs and ſafety. Therefore, no male perſon, born in this country, or brought from over ſea, ought to be holden by law to ſerve any perſon, as a ſervant, ſlave, or apprentice, after he arrives to the age of twenty-one years; nor female, in like manner, after ſhe arrives to the age of eighteen years; unleſs they are bound by their own conſent after they arrive to ſuch age; or bound by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, coſts, or the like.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That private property ought to be ſubſervient to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic uſes, when neceſſity requires it; nevertheleſs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:033044_0248_0FF62ED489B69668"/>any particular man's property is taken for the uſe of the public, the owner ought to receive an equivalent in money.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That all men have a natural and unalienable right to worſhip Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conſciences and underſtandings, as in their opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ſhall be regulated by the word of God; and that no man ought, or of right can be compelled to attend any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip, or erect or ſupport any place of worſhip, or maintain any miniſter, contrary to the dictates of his conſcience; nor can any man be juſtly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his religious ſentiments, or peculiar mode of religious worſhip; and that no authority can, or ought to be veſted in, or aſſumed by any power whatſoever, that ſhall in any caſe interfere with, or in any manner control the rights of conſcience, in the free exerciſe of religious worſhip: Nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertheleſs, every ſect or denomination of Chriſtians ought to obſerve the Sabbath or Lord's day, and keep up ſome ſort of religious worſhip, which to them ſhall ſeem moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the revealed will of God.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Every perſon within this Commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recourſe to the laws, for all injuries or wrongs which he may receive in his perſon, property, or character: he ought to obtain right and juſtice freely, and without being obliged to purchaſe it—completely, and without any denial—promptly, and without delay; conformably to the laws.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That the people of this State, by their legal repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, have the ſole, excluſive and inherent right of governing and regulating the internal police of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That all power being originally inherent in, and conſequently derived from the people; therefore, all officers of government, whether legiſlative or executive, are their truſtees and ſervants, and at all times, in a legal way, accountable to them.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. That government is, or ought to be, inſtituted for the common benefit, protection and ſecurity of the people, nation, or community, and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any ſingle man, family, or ſet of men, who are a part only of that community: and that the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefeaſible right, to reform or alter government, in ſuch manner as ſhall be,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:033044_0249_0FF62ED6A057DC88"/>by that community, judged to be moſt conducive to the public weal.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That thoſe who are employed in the legiſlative and executive buſineſs of the State may be reſtrained from oppreſſion, the people have a right, by their legal repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, to enact laws for reducing their public officers to a private ſtation, and for ſupplying their vacancies in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional manner, by regular elections, at ſuch periods as they may think proper.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. That all elections ought to be free and without corruption; and that all freemen, having a ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent common intereſt with, and attachment to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, have a right to elect officers, and be elected into office.</p>
               <p n="10">X. That every member of ſociety hath a right to be protected in the enjoyment of life, liberty and property; and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion towards the expenſe of that protection, and yield his perſonal ſervice, when neceſſary, or an equivalent thereto: but no part of a man's property can be juſtly taken from him, or applied to public uſes, without his own conſent, or that of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative body of the freemen; nor can any man, who is conſcientiouſly ſcrupulous of bearing arms, be juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thereto, if he will pay ſuch equivalent; nor are the people bound by any law, but ſuch as they have in like manner aſſented to, for their common good. And previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any law being made to raiſe a tax, the purpoſe, for which it is to be raiſed ought to appear evident to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature to be of more ſervice to the community, than the money would be if not collected.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That in all proſecutions for criminal offences, a man hath a right to be heard by himſelf and his counſel— to demand the cauſe and nature of his accuſation—to be confronted with the witneſſes—to call for evidence in his favour, and a ſpeedy public trial by an impartial jury of the country, without the unanimous conſent of which jury he cannot be found guilty—nor can he be compelled to give evidence againſt himſelf—nor can any man be juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his liberty, except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. That the people have a right to hold themſelves, their houſes, papers and poſſeſſions, free from ſearch or ſeizure: and therefore warrants, without oaths or affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:033044_0250_0FF62ED8599E1EE8"/>firſt made, affording ſufficient foundation for them, and whereby any officer or meſſenger may be commanded or required to ſearch ſuſpected places, or to ſeize any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons, his, her or their property not particularly deſcribed, are contrary to that right, and ought not to be granted.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. That no warrant or writ to attach the perſon or eſtate of any freeholder within this State, ſhall be iſſued in civil action, without the perſon or perſons, who may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſuch warrant or attachment, firſt make oath, or affirm before the authority who may be requeſted to iſſue the ſame, that he or they are in danger of loſing his, her, or their debts.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. That when an iſſue in fact, proper for the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of a jury, is joined in a court of law, the parties have a right to a trial by jury; which ought to be held ſacred.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. That the people have a right of fredom of ſpeech and of writing and publiſhing their ſentiments, concerning the tranſactions of government—and therefore the freedom of the preſs ought not to be reſtrained.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The freedom of deliberation, ſpeech, and debate, in the legiſlature, is ſo eſſential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any accuſation or proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, action or complaint, in any other court or place whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. The power of ſuſpending laws, or the execution of laws, ought never to be exerciſed, but by the Legiſlature, or by authority derived from it, to be exerciſed in ſuch particular caſes only as the Legiſlature ſhall expreſsly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. That the people have a right to bear arms, for the defence of themſelves and the State: and as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armies, in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military ſhould be kept under ſtrict ſubordination to, and governed by the civil power.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. That no perſon in this Commonwealth can, in any caſe, be ſubjected to law-martial or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except thoſe employed in the army, and the militia in actual ſervice.</p>
               <p n="20">
                  <pb n="253" facs="unknown:033044_0251_0FF62EDB42906AF8"/>
XX. That frequent recurrence to fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and a firm adherence to juſtice, moderation, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, induſtry, and frugality, are abſolutely neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the bleſſings of liberty, and keep government free; the people ought therefore to pay particular attention to theſe points, in the choice of officers and repreſentatives; and have a right, in a legal way, to exact a due and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant regard to them, from their legiſlators and magiſtrates, in the making and executing ſuch laws as are neceſſary for the good government of the State.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. That all people have a natural and inherent right to emigrate from one State to another, that will receive them; or to form a new State in vacant countries, or in ſuch countries as they can purchaſe, whenever they think that thereby they can promote their own happineſs.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. That the people have a right to aſſemble togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to conſult for their common good—to inſtruct their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, and to apply to the Legiſlature for redreſs of grievances, by addreſs, petition or remonſtrance.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. That no perſon ſhall be liable to be tranſported out of this State, for trial for any offence committed within the ſame.</p>

               <p>The Lieutenant-Governor and Treaſurer ſhall be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in the manner above directed. And each freeman ſhall give in twelve votes for twelve Counſellors, in the ſame

               <p n="11">XI.

They are to correſpond with other States—tranſact buſineſs with officers of government, civil and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary, and to prepare ſuch buſineſs as may appear to them neceſſary to lay before the General Aſſembly. They ſhall ſit as Judges to hear and determine on impeachments, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their aſſiſtance, for advice only, the Judges of the Supreme Court; and ſhall have power to grant pardons, and remit ſines in all caſes whatſoever, except in treaſon and murder, in which they ſhall have power to grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieves, but not to pardon, until after the end of the next ſeſſion of Aſſembly, and except in caſes of impeachment, in which there ſhall be no remiſſion or mitigation of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, but by act of legiſlation. They are alſo to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. They are to expedite the execution of ſuch meaſures as may be reſolved upon by the General Aſſembly: and they may draw upon the Treaſurer for ſuch ſums as may be appropriated by the Houſe of Repreſentatives. They may alſo lay embargoes, or prohibit the exportation of any commodity, for any time not exceeding thirty days, in the receſs of the Houſe only: they may grant ſuch licenſes as ſhall be directed by law, and ſhall have power to call together the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, when neceſſary, before the day to which they ſhall ſtand adjourned. The Governor ſhall be captain-general and commander in chief of the forces of the State, but ſhall not command in perſon, except adviſed thereto by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and then only as long as they ſhall approve thereof: and the Lieutenant-Governor ſhall, by virtue of his office, be Lieutenant-General of all the forces of the State.

Every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Council ſhall be a Juſtice of the Peace for the whole State, by virtue of his office. The Governor and Council ſhall have a Secretary, and keep fair books of their proceedings, wherein any counſellor may enter his diſſent, with his reaſons to ſupport it.</p>

               <p n="14">XIV. The votes and proceedings of the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſhall be printed (when one third of the members think it neceſſary) as ſoon as conveniently may be, after the end of each ſeſſion, with the yeas and nays on any queſtion, when required by any member, (except where the votes ſhall be taken by ballot) in which caſe every member ſhall have a right to inſert the reaſons of his vote upon the minutes.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The ſtyle of laws of this State, in future to be paſſed, ſhall be, <hi>It is hereby enacted by the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the State of Vermont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">XVI. To the end that laws, before they are enacted, may be more maturely conſidered, and the inconvenience of haſty determinations as much as poſſible prevented, all bills which originate in the Aſſembly ſhall be laid before the Governor and Council for their reviſion and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or propoſals of amendment; who ſhall return the ſame to the Aſſembly, with their propoſals of amendment (if any) in writing: and if the ſame are not agreed to by the Aſſembly, it ſhall be in the power of the Governor and Council to ſuſpend the paſſing of ſuch oills until the next ſeſſion of the Legiſlature. Provided, that if the Governor and Council ſhall neglect or refuſe to return any ſuch bill to the Aſſembly with written propoſals of amendment, within five days, or before the riſing of the Legiſlature, the ſame ſhall become a law.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. No perſon ought, in any caſe, or in any time, to be declared guilty of treaſon or felony by the Legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. Every man, of the full age of twenty-one years, having reſided in this State, for the ſpace of one whole year, next before the election of repreſentatives, and is of a quiet and peaceable behaviour, and will take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oath, (or affirmation) ſhall be entitled to all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of a freeman of this State.</p>
               <p>You ſolemnly ſwear, (or affirm) that whenever you give your vote or ſuffrage, touching any matter that concerns
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:033044_0257_0FF62EEB0FBCEE40"/>the State of Vermont, you will do it ſo as in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience you ſhall judge will moſt conduce to the beſt good of the ſame, as eſtabliſhed by the Conſtitution, without fear or favour of any man.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. The inhabitants of this Commonwealth ſhall be trained and armed for its defence, under ſuch regulations, reſtrictions, and exceptions, as the General Aſſembly ſhall by law direct. The ſeveral companies of militia ſhall, as often as vacancies happen, elect their captains and other inferior officers; and the captains and ſubalterns ſhall nominate and recommend the field officers of their reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive regiments, who ſhall appoint their ſtaff-officers.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. All commiſſions ſhall be in the name of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the State of Vermont, ſealed with the State ſeal, ſigned by the Governor, and in his abſence the Lieutenant-Governor, and atteſted by the Secretary; which ſeal ſhall be kept by the Council.</p>

Every officer of State, whether judicial or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive, ſhall be liable to be impeached by the General Aſſembly, either when in office, or after his reſignation, or removal for mal-adminiſtration.

               <p n="22">XXII. As every freeman, to preſerve his independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (if without a ſufficient eſtate) ought to have ſome profeſſion, calling, trade, or farm, whereby he may hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly ſubſiſt, there can be no neceſſity for, nor uſe in eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing offices of profit, the uſual effects of which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and ſervility, unbecoming freemen, in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors or expectants, faction, contention, corruption and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order among the people. But if any man is called into public ſervice, to the prejudice of his private affairs, he has a right to a reaſonable compenſation: and whenever an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, through increaſe of fees or otherwiſe, becomes ſo prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable as to occaſion many to apply for it, the profits ought to be leſſened by the Legiſlature. And if any officer ſhall take greater or other fees than the laws allow him, either directly or indirectly, it ſhall ever after diſqualify him from holding any office in this State.</p>
               <p n="23">

               <p n="28">XXVIII.

               <p n="29">XXIX. All proſecutions ſhall commence by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Sate of Vermont—all indictments ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with theſe words, <hi>Againſt the peace and dignity of the State.</hi> And all fines ſhall be proportionate to the offences.</p>

XXXIV. To deter more effectually from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of crimes, by continued viſible puniſhment, of long duration, and to make ſanguinary puniſhment leſs neceſſary, means ought to be provided for puniſhing by hard labour, thoſe who ſhall be convicted of crimes not capital, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the criminal ſhall be employed for the benefit of the public, or for reparation of injuries done to private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and all perſons, at proper times, ought to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee them at their labour.</p>

               <p>SECT. III. Any elector who ſhall receive any gift or reward for his vote, in <hi>meat, drink, money,</hi> or otherwiſe, ſhall ſuffer ſuch puniſhment as the laws ſhall direct. And any perſon who ſhall directly or indirectly give, promiſe, or beſtow any ſuch reward to be elected, ſhall thereby be rendered incapable, for two years, to ſerve in the office for which he was elected, and be ſubject to ſuch further pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment as the Legiſlature ſhall direct.</p>

               <p>The powers of government ſhall be divided into three diſtinct Departments, each of them to be conſided to a ſeparate body of Magiſtracy, to wit, thoſe which are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative to one, thoſe which are Executive to another, and thoſe which are Judiciary to another.</p>
               <p>No perſon, or collection of perſons, being of one of theſe departments, ſhall exerciſe any power properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to either of the others, except in the inſtances herein after expreſsly permitted.</p>
               <p>The Legiſlative powers of this Commonwealth ſhall be veſted in a General Aſſembly, which ſhall conſiſt of a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and Houſe of Repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>The Repreſentatives ſhall be choſen annually, by the qualified electors of each county reſpectively, on the firſt Tueſday in May; but the ſeveral elections may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for three days, if, in the opinion of the preſiding officer or officers, it ſhall be neceſſary, and no longer.</p>
               <p>No perſon ſhall be a Repreſentative, who ſhall not have attained the age of twenty-four years, and have been a citizen and inhabitant of the ſtate two years preceding his election, and the laſt ſix mouths thereof an inhabitant of the county in which he may be choſen; unleſs he ſhall have been abſent on the public buſineſs of the United States, or this ſtate.</p>
               <p>Within two years after the firſt meeting of the General Aſſembly, and within every ſubſequent term of four years,
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:033044_0282_0FF62F1C9ACA2398"/>an enumeration of the free male inhabitants above twenty-one years of age, ſhall be made in ſuch manner as may be directed by law. The number of the Repreſentatives ſhall, at the ſeveral periods of making ſuch enumeration, be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Legiſlature, and apportioned among the ſeveral counties, according to the number of free male inhabitants above the age of twenty-one years in each, and ſhall never be leſs than forty, nor greater than one hundred; but no county hereafter erected, ſhall be entitled to a ſeparate rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation, until a ſufficient number of free male inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants above the age of twenty-one years, ſhall be contained within it, to entitle them to one Repreſentative agreeable to the ratio which ſhall then be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>The Senators ſhall be choſen for four years. Until the firſt enumeration be made, the Senate ſhall conſiſt of eleven members, and thereafter for every four members added to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, one member ſhall be added to the Senate.</p>
               <p>In chooſing the Senate, one member at leaſt ſhall be elected from each county, until the number of counties is equal to the number of Senators: after which, when a new county is made, it ſhall, as to the choice of Senators, be conſidered as being a part of the county or counties from which it ſhall have been taken.</p>
               <p>The Senate ſhall be choſen in the following manner: All perſons qualified to vote for Repreſentatives, ſhall, on the firſt Tueſday in May, in the preſent year, and on the ſame day in every fourth year, forever thereafter, at the place appointed by law for chooſing Repreſentatives, elect by ballot, by a majority of votes, as many perſons as they are entitled to have for Repreſentatives for their reſpective counties, to be electors of the Senate.</p>
               <p>No perſon ſhall be choſen an elector, who ſhall not have reſided in the ſtate three years next before his election, and who ſhall not have attained the age of twenty-ſeven years.</p>
               <p>The electors of the Senate ſhall meet at ſuch place as ſhall be appointed for convening the Legiſlature, on the third Tueſday in May, in the preſent year, and on the ſame day in every fourth year forever thereafter; and they, or a majority of them ſo met, ſhall proceed to elect by bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:033044_0283_0FF62F1F5CC5FB68"/>as Senators, men of the moſt wiſdom, experience and virtue, above twenty-ſeven years of age, who ſhall have been reſidents of the ſtate above two whole years next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the election. If on the ballot two or more ſhall have an equal number of ballots in their favour, by which the choice ſhall not be determined by the firſt ballot, then the electors ſhall again ballot before they ſeparate, in which they ſhall be confined to the perſons, who on the firſt bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot ſhall have had an equal number, and they who ſhall have the greateſt number in their favour on the ſecond ballot, ſhall be accordingly declared and returned duly elected; and if on the ſecond ballot an equal number ſhall ſtill be in favour of two or more perſons, then the election ſhall be determined by lot, between thoſe who have equal numbers; which proceedings of the electors ſhall be certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied under their hands, and returned to the Secretary for the time being; to whom ſhall alſo be made by the proper officers, returns of the perſons choſen as electors in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective counties.</p>
