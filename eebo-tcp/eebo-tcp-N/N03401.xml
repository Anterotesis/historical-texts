         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And my Friends, you that have Saves, and do miniſter to others in our Meetings, conſider I intreat and beſeech you concerning this thing in particular.

               <p>What a great Strait theſe tender hearted mourning Souls muſt needs be in, think ye, betwixt Love and Duty; they love you dearly for the Truth ſake, and yet think it their Duty abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in the Fear and Love of God, to teſtifie againſt the Sin, and you for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in it.</p>

                  <hi>W. B.</hi> In his Preface, mentions ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Lord's dealing with him, when he was about about 10 or 12 Years of Age, which I ſuppoſe is about 50 Years ago, then there was much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about many <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> People, being taken into <hi>Turky,</hi> or by the <hi>Turks</hi> into Slavery, and ſold in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, for Term of Life, as Beaſts in the Field. As our brave Chriſtians ſo call'd do, and have done for many Years in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and elſewhere in <hi>America,</hi> by the poor Negroes, which is ten times worſe in us; all things conſider'd; but what crying, wringing of Hands, what Mourning and Lamentations there was then by their Relations, Wives for their Husbands, Parents for their Children, Relations for their Friends, one Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for another! what exclaiming againſt the <hi>Turk</hi> for his Tyranny and oppreſſion, and cruel Dealing and Treatment, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Friends, and may be curſing and calling for Damnation to him and his God too.</p>
               <p>Well my Friends, conſider of it, and make an Application ſuitable to the circumſtance of your own Slaves; for I do not believe in my Soul, the <hi>Turks</hi> are

ſo cruel to their Slaves, as many Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, ſo called, are to theirs, by what I have ſeen and heard of, in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and elſewhere; and I give you a reaſon for it. I was near 18 Months, on board a large Veſſel of 400 Tons in a Voyage to <hi>Scanderoon</hi> in <hi>Turky,</hi> with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>our Men that had been 17 Years Slaves in <hi>Turky,</hi> and I never did underſtand by them, that they were ſo badly uſed as the poor Negroes are by ſome called Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Ezra vi. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which were come again out of Captivity, and all ſuch as had ſeparated themſelves unto them from the filthineſs of the Heathen of the Land, to ſeek the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>did eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they kept the feaſt ſeven Days with joy: For the Lord made them joyful,</hi> that had ſeparated from the filthineſs of the Heathen.</p>
               <p>It is like there was ſome, which came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and out of Captivity in ſome ſort, which nevertheleſs would not ſeparate themſelves from the filthineſs of the Heathen. For long cuſtom had made it ſo familiar, eaſy and ſweet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that they would not leave it,

no not for the Joy of the Lord. And ſome of theſe were Prieſts and Levites, for ought we know; for they loved their Heathen Whores, I believe, and other filthineſs, which the Heathens allow of, almoſt as well as our Spiritual Prieſts and Levites, under the Goſpel of Chriſt, do their Slaves, it is a very plain, parallel caſe, when neither the one or the other will part with them, no not for the Joy of the Lord. Then to be ſure not for the comfort and Joy of their Brethren, and Siſters, who have been in ſore Bondage, and Thraldom or Captivity, on that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Helliſh Account, Slave-keeping, for 50 Years and more; and that by their Brethren and Siſters, which keeps them and will keep them, in ſpite of them, let them beg or pray, or ſay, or do what they can or will.</p>
               <p>And all this while Preach, as their tender Friends do; who cannot touch with that ſinful practice to gain the whole World; profeſs the ſame Pure Truth, Goſpel, Unction, Annoynting, Urim, and Thumim, Meaſure of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, pretend they have received the ſame Manifeſtation and Diſpenſation to preach, as their innocent Friends, Brethren, or Siſters have.</p>

And really to give them their due, they come very near them in Words, for what I and ſome others can ſee; for we have obſerved them ſtrictly as is our duty upon the Truths Account, which ſuffers ſo much by them, and their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful practice, as well as their oppreſſed, and greatly afflicted Brethren and Siſters.</p>
               <p>I ſay theſe Nocents, come very near the Innocents in Words, except here and there, they do ſtretch and ſtrain, reſt, part, pervert, miſconſtrue, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply Scripture to ſerve their covetous Ends, or to juſtifie the Practice, or to extenuate the Crime.

               <p>And as for any Slave-keepers, who are not impartial in the caſe; to ſay that <hi>R. S.</hi> writ in a Spirit of Bitterneſs, or that he did not end his Life well. As to the firſt I have read his Book carefully, with Attention; and I do not remember a Word in it contrary to Truth, or any ſuch ſharp invectives, as may eaſily be found in Holy Scripture, both Old and New Teſtament; altho' I have, it's true, becauſe, I believe in my very Soul the cauſe does require it, for the nature of thoſe Beaſts, is in thoſe Men, which do trade in Slaves; and much worſe.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond objection, that he <hi>R.

But before he died, by reaſon of his ſore Affliction of mind, concerning Slave-keeping, as in his Book largely appear, and Infirmity of Body, he fell into a ſort of Delirium: However I do believe if he had lived he would have overcame it; for I went to ſee him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, a little before he died; I am not aſhamed, nor afraid, to write it, altho' I be cenſured for it, as I have been with ſome others, for going to ſee him, altho' in Affliction, the only time for Viſiting, as I humbly conceive, if we go in a right mind.</p>

               <p>If this practice can be proved to be the greateſt of Sins (as may eaſily be done) conſidering it's Root and Branch, and all the ſad Fruit it brings forth; yet we read Chriſt died for Sinners, and he can forgive the greateſt, as well as the leaſt.</p>
               <p>It is true ſome may ſay, Chriſt in his great Love, hath forgiven Sins, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in time of great Darkneſs and Ignorance; but if we ſhould commit the groſſeſt of evils now, in the clear light of this Goſpel Day, continue in them, and plead for it too, we ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſpiritual <hi>Moſes,</hi> and our Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be juſt.</p>

from the Croſs, and we will believe in him.</hi> It is true the Objection is juſt, and it may be a Parallel Caſe: But what ſhall we do, for People begin to ſee as clearly as when the Sun is in its Meridian Throne, young People as well as old, That this Practice of ours is as directly oppoſite to our holy Principles as Light is to Darkneſs, Chriſt to <hi>Belial,</hi> or God to the Devil.</p>
               <p>If the Caſe be thus, dear Brethren, as to be ſure it is, how ſhall we ſtand our Ground? our Ground, I ſay.

our Practice, or us for continuing in it. And further, as we have the Power of Diſcipline, our Miniſters are forc'd, and muſt of Neceſſity come to us for Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates or Letters to recommend them, which we are very ready to give if they are fit for our Turn and Practice, and very good ones too. If they be but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poorly qualified in Words, and worſe in Conduct and Life, yet they'll ſerve a ſmall Turn. When he or ſhe have got their Paſsport, one or other of us, a truſty Brother without Doors, will give them the Hint before they go forth, that if they ſhould chance to meet, or go on purpoſe where they are to be found or heard of, any of the heavenly Party that is againſt our helliſh Practice (or helliſh Party that is againſt our heavenly Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, for it is heavenly to us, it is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Joy to us, and we delight in it greatly and will keep in it) and may be, <hi>My dear Friend, we will give thee a little Memorandum in thy Pocket of Places and Perſons, which will be a great Help to thee, poor dear Creature, thy dear Mind being ſo much exerciſed about other good Things, that thou mayſt chance to forget ſome other Matters though they be weighty: And wherever thou meets with any ſuch as are
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004149_0026_1003DDE9976D19D0"/>
abovemention'd, when thee comes near their Dwellings, which thee may chance to hear of by ſtrict Inquiry, inform Friends againſt them whatever thee can; tho' the Name of an Informer be odious, yet in ſome Caſes it is thought neceſſary, as in this: But be ſure when thou comes in thy Teſtimony, threſh 'em going, ſpare 'em not; and if any ſpeak to thee after Meeting about it, ſay,</hi> If the Coat fits thee, put it on; I had no Particular in View. This is and has been the Practice of many worthy Friends, ſo they hide themſelves, and ſtrengthen our Party bravely; ſo be it, ſay they.</p>
               <p>Matth. vii. 17. <hi>Every good Tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good Fruit, but a corrupt Tree bringeth evil Fruit.</hi> Is there any eviler Fruit in the World than Slave-keeping? any thing more deviliſh? it is of the very Nature of Hell itſelf, and is the Belly of Hell.</p>
               <p>Verſe 18. <hi>A good Tree cannot bring forth</hi> ſuch curſed <hi>evil Fruit</hi> as Slave-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if this Practice be the worſt, the greateſt Sin in the World (with what goes and grows with it) as it is, to be ſure. But if any ſhould ſay that good Trees, good Men, may be in this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and encourage it, and if they may
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004149_0027_1003DDEDA1C76278"/>
bring forth ſuch Fruit, what Fruit muſt evil Trees bring forth. This will not hold by a Parity of Reaſon; comparing Things with Things by an Equality, it will not hold good in any Caſe, much leſs in a religious Senſe; there it is very odious, to be ſure, and is very foul in Miniſters eſpecially. Let them keep on their Sheeps Cloathing, and preach and pray as long as they may, until their Tongues are weary, and their Hearers Ears too; they'll preach more to Hell, I firmly believe, than they will to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, while they continue in ſaid Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>For Cuſtom in Sin, hides, covers, as it were takes away the Guilt of Sin. Long Cuſtom, the Conveniency of Slaves wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for us, waiting and tending conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on us, beſide the Waſhing, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſcouring, cooking very nicely fine and curious, ſewing, knitting, darning, almoſt ever at hand and Command; and in other Places milking, churning, Cheeſe-making, and all the Drudgery in Dairy and Kitchin, within doors and without. And the proud, dainty, lazy Daughters ſit with their Hands before 'em, like ſome of the worſt idle Sort of Gentlewomen, and if they want a Trifle,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004149_0028_1003B9CB1F1B8040"/>
rather than riſe from their Seats, call the poor Slave from her Drudgery to come and wait upon them. Theſe Things have been the utter Ruin of more than a few; and yet encouraged by their own Parents, for whom my Spirit is grieved, ſome of which were and are Preachers in great Repute, as well as others.</p>
               <p>Now, dear Friends, behold a Myſtery! Theſe Miniſters that be Slave-keepers, and are in ſuch very great Repute, ſuch eminent Preachers, given to Hoſpitality, charitable to the Poor, loving to their Neighbours, juſt in their Dealings, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in their Lives, viſiting of the Sick, ſympathiſing with the Afflicted in Body or Mind, very religious ſeemingly, and extraordinary devout and demure, and in ſhort ſtrictly exact in all their Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums, except Slave-keeping, theſe, theſe be the Men, and the Women too, for the Devil's purpoſe, and are the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Treaſure the Devil can or has to bring out of his Lazaretto, to eſtabliſh Slave-keeping. By theſe Satan works Wonders many ways. Theſe are the very Men, or People of both Sexes, that come the neareſt the Scribes &amp; Phariſees of any People in the whole World, if not ſincere: For the Scribes were exact and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004149_0029_1003DDF99BCF8D78"/>
demure ſeemingly in their Appearance before Men, according to Chriſt's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, and yet the worſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the dear Lamb had, or that the Devil could procure for or againſt him. And I do ſurely believe that one ſuch as theſe, now in this our Day, in this very Country, does more Service for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and Hurt in the Church, in Slave-keeping, than twenty Publicans and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots: For by their extraordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in Hypocriſy, ſmooth and plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance, they draw into the Snare almoſt inſenſibly, and ſo beguile unſtable Souls before they are aware, which is ſorrowful to conſider as well as write, their Example being much more powerful than others.</p>
               <p>And Friends, what I touched at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before, concerning the delicate Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, or fine idle Dames, it may be pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much like it with the young Men, and may be the old ones, that have their Negroes to Plow, ſow, threſh, winnow, ſplit Rails, cut Wood, clear Land, make Ditches and Fences, fodder Cattle, run and fetch up the Horſes, or fine cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pacing Mares, for young Madam and Sir to ride about on, impudently and proudly goſſiping from Houſe to Houſe,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004149_0030_1003DE0498A357B0"/>
ſtuffing their lazy ungodly Bellies. Then old Sir Maſter calls, <hi>Negro, fetch my beſt Gelding quickly, for me to ride to Meeting, to preach the Goſpel of glad Tydings to all Men, and Liberty to the Captives, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the Priſon-Doors to them that are bound; but I'll keep thee in Bondage never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, help thy ſelf if thee can. I charge thee to work very hard when I am gone, and beſure be very ready to wait on me &amp; my Children when we come home, if they come with me, or elſe wait till they do come, and then take their Horſes, and look well after them; and then make haſte in, all of ye, and be ready to wait upon us, and keep good Fires above ſtairs or below, and mind your Buſineſs well, or I'll take a Courſe with you; don't think that I'll give</hi> 70 <hi>or</hi> 80 l. <hi>apiece for you, for nothing but to ly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zying about like Gentlemen, doing nothing, you ſhall work now you are young, for when you are very old, you will not do much, I ſuppoſe, and then you muſt be maintained, you and your Wives and Children and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's Children; and if you dont behave your ſelves well, you'll be but badly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, I believe, when you are paſt your Labour, whatever you are now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dear Friends, theſe Things are true in Fact, and have been the Ruin of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004149_0031_1003DE0B7B847340"/>
Body and Soul, and will be of more I greatly fear; beſide and above all, the foul Stain it brings upon the pure, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, unchangeable TRUTH.</p>
               <p>And my dear, my very dear Friends, I muſt ſay, I muſt ſay, and it is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and certain Knowledge of my own Soul, that except People will be willing to come to a Separation, a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, a Separation,

               <p>I ſay my own Experience when I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> about 18 Years ago, where we had much Buſineſs in Trading, and the poor Blacks would come to our Shop and Store, hunger-ſtarv'd, almoſt ready to periſh with Hunger and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, great Numbers of them would come to trade with us, for they ſeemed to love and admire us, we being pretty much alike in Stature and otherways; and my dear Wife would often be giving them ſomething for the Mouth, which was very engaging you that read this may be ſure, in their deplorable Condition. Oh! my Soul mourns in contemplating their miſerable, forlorn, wretched State
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004149_0032_1003DE109397A3E8"/>
and Condition that mine Eyes beheld them in then, and it is the ſame now, and will remain except the great almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Being, either immediately or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally ſhall be pleaſed to put a Stop to it; for they are yearly by Shiploads poured in upon, and received by the People, many Thouſands in one Year, Year after Year, as is thought, up and down <hi>America,</hi> beſides what vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are encreaſed by Generation daily. O Lord God Almighty, where will this Practice lead us that are called thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Deareſt God, and make ſo great a Profeſſion of being lead and guided by thy eternal Spirit, which is the glorious Truth unchangeable and precious, and without End. But I truſt, deareſt One, thou wilt be pleaſed to ſtop and end this Practice, that is more like Hell than Heaven, to be ſure.</p>
               <p>I having made a little Digreſſion, may reſume the Matter relating to my dear Wife, and the <hi>Negroes.</hi> She was a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted Woman, and, as I ſaid, would be very often giving them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other; ſtinking Biſcuits which ſometimes we had in abundance, bitten by the Cockroaches; or rotten Cheeſe,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004149_0033_1003B9D8422DF7D8"/>
ſtinking Meat, decayed Fiſh which we had plenty of in that hot Country; ſo my dear ſweet <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſhe would hand it to them, here and there to thoſe that ſhe thought wanted it moſt, tho' all wanted enough, God Almighty knows, except here and there a favourite Slave, one of an hundred or thouſand, may be, kept for their Glory and Pride to wait on them, amongſt their proud, lazy, dainty, tyrannical, gluttonous, drunken, debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Viſitors, the Scum of the infernal Pit, a little worſe than the ſame that comes off their Sugar when it is boiling, which is compoſed of Greaſe, Dirt, Dung, and other Filthineſs, as, it may be Limbs, Bowels and Excrements of the poor Slaves, and Beaſts, and other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but this I ſay ſerves exceeding well to make Rum of, and Moloſſes, for that is the Uſe it is put to, with other Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients pretty much like it; and theſe People in the Iſlands may laugh at us for being ridiculouſly infatuated, to ſend away our excellent good Proviſions, and other good Things, to purchaſe ſuch fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Stuff, which tends to the Corruption of Mankind, and may be ſend us ſome of the worſt of their Slaves, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rule them themſelves, along with
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004149_0034_1003DE1C12C06E28"/>
their Rum, to compleat the Tragedy, that is to ſay, to deſtroy the People in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and ruin the Country. Dear Friends, or any of my Fellow-Creatures, I muſt confeſs I am apt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, but when ſuch dangerous Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes in my Way, I think it my Duty to make it appear if poſſible to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for it is ſo to me, exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful above Meaſure, I will aſſure you, more than what I can ſpeak or write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly; if it ſhould be ſo to you, I hope you will endeavour to avoid it, and pray for Heavens Aſſiſtance, without which all is nothing. As to what was touched on before, when my dear <hi>Sarah</hi> had given to them what ſhe thought fit within-doors, we have taken ſome more of the ſame ſort and thrown it into the Street, ſtinking as to be ſure it was, yet the poor Creatures would come running, and tearing, and rending one another, to get a part in the ſcramble of that which I am ſure ſome Dogs would not touch, much leſs eat of, their poor Bellies were ſo empty, and ſo ravenous were they, that I never ſaw a parcel of Hounds more eager about a dead Carcaſe, than they always were. This Scramble was commonly on a Firſt Day, before we went
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004149_0035_1003DE23EE3813B8"/>
to Meeting, which was their Market-day, as well as their Hallowing-Day, when they are exempted from their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they come down to Town, many Hundreds of them, they that could get or ſteal any Thing, a little Sugar, or Cotton, Ginger, Aloes, Rum, Cocoa-Nuts, Pine-Apples, Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons, old Iron, Wood for Firing, ſteal any Thing out of Houſes, Yards, or any where, or any Thing that was not too hot or too heavy, and bring it to Market on a Sunday, as they call it, to get a penny, or ſomething for the Mouth, and they that could not get any thing to bring to Market, they would come to Town if poſſibly they could hold out and keep from falling down and fainting by the Way, being periſhed with Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and hard Labour the Week before; I ſay theſe very miſerable Objects that could get no Truck in the Country to bring to Market, yet they would if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible come to Town, and ſee what they could beg or ſteal there. (Who can blame them if it was ten times worſe, they being under ſuch unmerciful Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.) Theſe Wretches being in Town in this miſerable Condition, with not a Crum of good or bad to put into their
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004149_0036_1003DE2B1928E330"/>
Mouths, ready to drop as they walked or crawled along the Streets, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them hearing of us, for we were very much known amongſt them, they would come to our Door, if they came before we were gone to Meeting, and there they would ſtand as thick as Bees, but much more like <hi>Pharaoh'</hi>s lean Kine, and I may ſay their Appearance was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal enough to move a very hard Heart; ſo we uſed to give them a little of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at Times, as we found ſome Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, conſidering our Circumſtances; But if we gave to ſome, and did not to all, as to be ſure we could not, oh how the poor Creatures would look. I ſay many Hundreds would come and flock about us; and them that receiv'd, O how thankful, with bended Knees; but them that did not, what Words can ſet forth the dejected ſinking Looks that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Countenances. Shall I ever forget them?</p>
               <p>Many of theſe poor Creatures, in Town and Country, were ſent to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket by their Maſters or Miſtreſſes, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Times, and they would come to us to lay out their Money, if we had ſuch Goods as they wanted, and when they came in, ſeem'd to rejoice to ſee us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004149_0037_1003DE3034372060"/>
we were ſo very much alike; and would lift up their Hands with Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſay, <hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ittle backararar man,</hi> for ſo they call white People, <hi>go all over world ſee for that backarar woman for himſelf.</hi> But we, alas! are parted!</p>
               <p>Here Friends you may ſee and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the powerful Influence long Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, Conveniency, Intimacy, and Profit has to inſinuate itſelf into our Affections; for I have often heard my dear Wife ſay in her Life-time, and expreſs the Danger ſhe was in when living in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi> of being leavened into the very Nature of the Inhabitants, Pride and Oppreſſion: So that dear Creature, ſhe ſeeing the Evil and the Danger, ſhe was willing and deſirous to leave the Iſland, and indeed ſo was I.</p>
               <p>But, my Friends, here I muſt come to that that is not very agreeable to Fleſh and Blood, which is Confeſſion of Sins: For although I never was Owner of a Slave myſelf, and all Friends in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi> could never perſuade me to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe one, I humbly bleſs the Lord my good God for that, and this is now my Comfort and dear Joy and ſweet Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: Yet I muſt confeſs, and I have not full Peace without it, yet I may ſay
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004149_0038_1003DE391DFFBBB8"/>
I have been ſorely grieved to ſee and hear the inexpreſſible Cruelty, Torture, and Miſery, theſe poor Wretches were and are put to, Night and Day, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, as I have ſaid, I ſaw and heard of ſuch very great Barbarity uſed toward the Slaves, Night and Day, yet for want of dwelling near enough to the bleſſed Truth, I was leavened too much into the Nature of the People there which are Maſters and Miſtreſſes of Slaves, though I never had nor would have any of my own, but by converſing, trading, and living daily amongſt them, where there is vaſt Numbers, abundance coming daily to buy Goods and to beg, ſome to ſteal, we had abundance ſtolen from us at Times, the worth of ten, fifteen, or near twenty Shillings at a time, come into the Shop whole Droves together, lay the Scheme I ſuppoſe, come by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; when many are come in they ſeem in great haſte, one would ſay, <hi>Serve me,</hi> another, <hi>Serve me, ſerve me;</hi> come ſometimes by twilight and within Night, then was their Time; ſo when we were in a hurry, one would run away with one Thing, another with another, and ſo on. Very much we loſt to be ſure. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I could catch them, and then I
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004149_0039_1003DE3AAD9933D8"/>
would give them Stripes ſometimes, but I have been ſorry for it many times, and it does grieve me to this Day, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extream Cruelty and Miſery they always live under. Oh my Heart has been pained within me many times, to ſee and hear; and now, now, now, it is ſo.</p>
               <p>Shall we fetch and ſteal them out of their own Country, where God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has made them and placed them, and in taking of them murther many, very many, and ſerve them that we take alive ten times worſe; ſteal Husband from Wife, Wife from Husband; ſteal the Children from their Parents, bring them here or elſewhere amongſt our extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Chriſtians, worſe Thieves than the others by far; they work 'em, whip and ſtarve 'em almoſt to death, and if the poor Wretch ſteal a little to ſatisfy Hunger, he is tormented without Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

               <p>WHEN I have mildly reaſoned with ſome Friends concerning their Hoſtility, in carrying a Perſon or Friend, if I may call him ſo, out of Meetings ſo often, and keeping of him out by Conſtable and other ways; as at <hi>Philadelphia, Burlington</hi> and <hi>Concord, &amp;c.</hi> without ſo much as pretending they have uſed any Goſpel Order with him, in any Monthly or Quarterly Meeting, as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Perſon.</p>
               <p>O But ſay ſome, he is a very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Perſon, and has been ſo for many Years; and is too cenſorious about Trading in Slaves, or againſt Traders in, and Keepers of Slavers; And poſitively affirms, that no Man or Woman, Lad or Laſs ought to be ſuffered, to pretend to Preach Truth in our Meetings, while they live in that Practice; which is all a Lie.</p>
               <p>And further, he boldly affirms, that no Perſon whatſoever has any Right, or ought according to Truths Diſcipline,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:004149_0063_1003DECB6E14C4A8"/>
to be ſuffered to have the Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or any Part of it, in the Church of God, which is the Kingdom of God, while he himſelf is in League with the Devil, and is managing the Affairs of his Kingdom, which Slave Trading is, as has been proved.</p>
               <p>But ſome that have not, and will not keep Negroe Slaves of their own, may ſay, we muſt not be too cenſorious, for we are often at their Houſes, and Eat and Drink bravely, and have their Negroes to wait on us, our Horſes, Wives and Children.</p>
               <p>Beſide all theſe Things, we buy, ſell, Trade, get Gain by and with them, we muſt be careful how we offend our Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and Dear Friends. But here is yet a ſtronger Bond than the other, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Profit, we love to Sleep with their Off-ſpring, ſo they be but Rich; for many of us have joyned Affinity with theſe <hi>Ahabs</hi> (O that hard Word) and <hi>Jezabels</hi> for Gains, by marrying with their rich Children, and if we become Prophets, and can propheſy ſuch things as they like, we ſhall be highly favoured, and fed at <hi>Jezabel's</hi> Table, though we ſhould be twice 4500 of us.</p>

the Mouth of all <hi>Ahab'</hi>s Prophets, and cauſe him to go up and fall at <hi>Ramah,</hi> being Damned; what if <hi>Jezebel</hi> be eaten with Dogs, what care we for that.</p>
               <p>What if <hi>Jezebel</hi> be eaten with Dogs, if we can get into their Eſtates and Poſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; what care we? when they are dead and gone, they will not remember our Lying Propheſies. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 40.

               <p>2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 1, 5, 6, 7. We had rather deſtroy all the truly Begotten and Born Heirs of God, and joint or equal Heirs with Chriſt, the Truth, which teſtifie againſt us, and our Slave-Keeping Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 18 to 26. We to be ſure would ſooner deſtroy all the Royal Off-ſpring of Heaven, as our Elder Brethren, them wicked Elders in <hi>Ahab'</hi>s time, <hi>Slew</hi> 70 <hi>Innocent Children,</hi> for fear of their own dear Lives; but <hi>John</hi> anſwered, <hi>and ſerved them accordingly:</hi> It's true <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. and if it ſhould be ſo with us, <hi>its better to die by the Sword than by Famine,</hi> as the Scriptures ſpeak; or eſpecially to be treated as many of our Brethren in this great Iniquity do their Slaves, up

and down in the World, and their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, always repeated and repeating for evermore, with all the Torture and Torments that Devil and Dragon, Death and Hell can invent or deviſe, with all their Accomplices.</p>
               <p>But although ſome of us, that are Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe Maſters and Traders, do allow that the beginning of this Practice was of the Devil, and that he and we his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are now carrying of it on very powerfully, and as it had a beginning there in Hell, ſo it muſt have an End.</p>

Upon a time when I was reaſoning with an eminent Preacher <hi>R. J.</hi> at his Houſe in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> concerning that great <hi>Goliah,</hi> Negroe or Slave-keeping, which hath defied the little Army of the living God ſo many Years, and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſo to do.</p>
               <p>He the ſaid <hi>R. J.</hi> was pleaſed then and there to tell me, that I loved the Negroes better than I did my Friends; and accuſed me at <hi>Stephen Jenkin'</hi>s Houſe, before many Witneſſes, of being the Death of my Dear Wife, and a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of the Church; but before that I charged him with being inſtrumental of ſeparating my Dear Wife from me by Death, in Writing for a ſeparate Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for my Wife, to a Meeting to which we never did belong, as if he and two or three more had a mind to ſeparate us; which is now brought to paſs.</p>
               <p>I ſhall leave them to the great Judge of Heaven and Earth, if he will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forgive them, I hope I ſhall in time. But theſe things muſt be borne with I ſuppoſe, and more; when I have ſaid to ſome Friends, Negroe-Keepers and their Adherents, that it ſeemed a little ſtrange or novel, that a Friend ſhould be hurried out of Meetings ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and roughly, before he be diſowned,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004149_0067_1003DEE705BF9E60"/>
or ſome way dealt with for ſome Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order or other, contrary to the known and acknowledged diſcipline of Friends as a People.</p>
               <p>If thy Brother is overtaken in a Fault, go to him and tell him his fault, between him and thee; if he hears thee thou haſt gained thy Brother; if he will not hear thee, then take two or three with thee; if he will not hear them, then take him to the Church; and if he will not hear the Church, then, not till then, caſt him forth. My Dear Friends, have any of theſe things been done to <hi>B. L.</hi> and yet ſtill continue to caſt him out, caſt him out, caſt him out, he is a troubleſome Fellow, and has been ſo for many Years. Did our dear and well beloved Friends in <hi>Boſton</hi> 60 or 70 Years ago, think this a juſt way of Proceeding, to be taken into Cuſtody, put into <hi>Bridewell,</hi> Whipt ſeverely, and Baniſhed the Town, time after time, without any legal Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, only for being obſtinate Quakers, as they were pleaſed to call them; dare to come again when they had Whipt them out of the Town ſo often. When I have put ſome Friends in mind of this, concerning our Dear Tender Friends great Suffering in <hi>New-England,</hi> in a
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004149_0068_1003DEED3B52C868"/>
Book called <hi>New-England Judged,</hi> ſome Friends have been pleaſed to tell me that <hi>George Keith</hi> uſed to ſay ſo, or talk after that manner. What he ſaid I cannot tell, but by report, which is not always true; but this of Friends Suffering in <hi>Boſton</hi> is true, for I have been upon the Spot or Lot of Ground, where the Dear Lambs were put to Death; for the Word of God and the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, the Truth.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>G. K.</hi> he was an extraordinary Man, while he kept to the Teſtimony of Truth in his own Heart; I do firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, according to the Account of him by Friends; and a great Sufferer for Truth, by Impriſonment, and other ways, and an excellent Writer, and Miniſter in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Truth's Principles for about 30 Years, as I remember; as many of his Books manifeſt, to Judgment of Men that have read them, of right mind and good underſtanding in Things relating to God's Kingdom; as his <hi>Revelation not ceaſed,</hi> his <hi>Way to the City of God,</hi> very excellent indeed, and many more; while he dwelt in the Truth and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Truth, he did well; but when he went from that, he was like the <hi>unſavory Salt, good for neither Land nor Dunghill,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:004149_0069_1003BA48AE88B070"/>
and ſo it is now with ſome, or I am miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. And ſo it hath been with the very beſt of Men and Inſtruments that ever were in the World, though they had been never ſo much inlightened or illuminated from on High; they grow dark again, as they go from the Light, from God, from Truth, which are one in Nature and Eſſence, although three Names, for Men as Men do know that have good Natural Eyes, that the further they go from the Light outwardly, the more they go into Darkneſs until at length they cannot ſee any thing clearly, or at laſt not at all; and this comes upon Men becauſe they love Darkneſs, which is Sin, and they live in Darkneſs, and walk in Darkneſs, and at laſt Darkneſs in Sin ſeems to be Light unto them. This is a dreadful State indeed: O that it may appear ſo before it be too late, to ſome poor Souls, is my true Deſire for their eternal Welfare. Which I deſire, as for my own Soul.</p>

               <p>MY Dear and Well-beloved Friends; my Joy and the Crown of all my ſweet Delights in this World, I can truly ſay, is the true Unity with my true Brethren, which are the true Church in God the Father, and he in them, ever reigning in his own Bleſſed Kingdom, Body, Houſe, Tabernacle, <hi>New-Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> or a Tent, ſynonimous Terms; while <hi>Iſrael</hi> abode here, no Divination

could prevail, or inchantments againſt 'em; but when <hi>Iſrael,</hi> our Dear Friends, went out of their Tent to look at, and long after the Pleaſures, Pride, Profit and Friendſhip of this World, then they came to be ſnared with this curſed Sin, Negroe-Trading, as well as ſome other groſs Sins, of which this is Chief, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Helliſh Train of Filthineſs, which has, does, and ever will attend it, and is inſeparable from it; for it is granted by all ſober wiſe Men that truly fear God, and dearly love the Truth in Sincerity, and are well acquainted with this foul Trade from the beginning, and in all its progreſſions to this Day; I ſay ſuch as have had a true Account, do know that thoſe that are employed in this Trade, are ſome of the worſt of Men, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſome of the worſt of Thieves, Pyrates and Murtherers, from whence our leſſer Pyrates have proceeded. And many of theſe leſſer Pyrates have been puniſhed with Death, and ſome other ways; but the much greater Villains by far, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go free but are encouraged, and have been near 50 Years, if not more, by us as a People, by buying of their curſed Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh-gotten Ware, at a very great Price. And all this Time pretending to the

moſt holy pure Religion in the whole World, to do unto all, as we would they ſhould do unto us, and as <hi>James</hi> writes, <hi>to Viſit the Fatherleſs, and Widow, in their Afflictions, and keep ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted from the World;</hi> but I know no worſe Engine the Devil has to make Widows and Fatherleſs Children, and to bring into Affliction and Bondage, and ſore Captivity indeed, than this Helliſh practice in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> Negroe-Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But theſe Helliſh Miſcreants, theſe Men-Stealers, pretend they fetch away theſe poor Creatures, that they may not kill one the other, when they are the Murtherers which ſets 'em to the Work (a curſed work it is) for as I have had an Account, near 35 Years ago, when 10 or 12 Sail of Veſſels come on the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea,</hi> and they cannot catel Negroes enough to Freight their Veſſel by the Sea ſide, and in Rivers where they ſend their Boats in Search and Purſuit of them, where they are acquainted; for they being us'd to the Buſineſs know where to go; and to find out ſome old Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes that they have been uſed to trade with, which will bring off in Canoes, their Wives or Children, or their Neighbours
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:004149_0076_1003BA1DBB809AE0"/>
Wives, and Children if they can catch 'em in Woods, or any where elſe, ſo bring 'em and ſell them to our brave Chriſtians, which come there with Ships for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.—O brave! give 30<hi>s.</hi> for a Negroe and ſell him for 30<hi>l.</hi> or 40, 50 or 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 <hi>l.</hi> or more: Who would but be a Trader in Slaves and Souls of Men, altho' he goes to Hell for it, and in the mean time intail an Iniquity on his own, and his Neighbour's Poſterity to their Deſtruction and the Ruin of the whole Country beſide.</p>
               <p>Above 30 Years ago, when I was a common Sailor, I had this Account, and likewiſe by ſome Sailors on Board Capt. <hi>Reeves,</hi> coming this Voyage to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> who had been at <hi>Guinea,</hi> and I ſuppoſe had been Pyrates, they did acknowledge they had been taken by them.</p>
               <p>Theſe vile Fellows on Board Capt. <hi>Reeves,</hi> in their Drink uſed to tell what curſed Work their former Captain and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors made with the poor Negroes in their Paſſage, for their Luſts; the Captain 6 or 10 of 'em in the Cabbin, and the Sailors as many as they pleaſed; with much more too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But I pray, I beg, and beſeech you my Friends, in the pure Love and Fear of God; conſider what part have true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers with ſuch Infidels, or Chriſt with ſuch <hi>Belials,</hi> or our Holy pure God with ſuch unholy impure Devils, until we can join theſe together; now we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reconcile Slave-Keeping with our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; we may as well ſay as <hi>Solomon</hi> of an Harlot, <hi>their Steps go down to Death and their Feet take hold on Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now my dear Friends, let us conſider the matter a little further, concerning theſe Men-Stealers, and weigh it in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, which is Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Juſtice. Conſider I ſay, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent circumſtances of times and things; it may be theſe wicked Creatures have been unhappily brought up to the Black Art, moſt of their Life time; my Soul pities them on that Account; had they had that good Education, Converſation, Books and Mutual Love, in Holy Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, ſweet Communion together in our ſolemn Meetings and Gatherings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the Heavenly Showers which many times, yea very often and frequent to my ſure and certain Knowledge, and to the great mutual ſweet and heavenly
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004149_0078_1003DEBBE5D11F30"/>
Comfort of my poor Soul, with many more of my dear Friends; I ſay the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heavenly Showers that have dropped as the Dew, and diſtilled as the ſmall Rain, in our tender Souls immediately, many times, yea innumerable, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, by the Bleſſed Meſſengers of Peace and Salvation, which were ſent by the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth eternity and dwelleth in Light, who had a tender regard Bleſſed by his Holy Name, to thoſe Poor Men and Women too, that were Poor indeed, and truly contrited, and ſat trembling before his Divine and Glorious Majeſty, ready to receive him that was and is the Word that made all Things; and when they had received him, they or we, We were made to rejoice with Joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, being filled with him that was, and is, and ever will be the Glory and true rejoicing of his People, and dear Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, all the World over; that can appeal to him that knows all Things, that they love him more then all things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yea than their natural Lives.</p>
               <p>Shall we I ſay as People who have been Bleſſed with ſo great Priviledges, and high Favours, forſake the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of Loving God the Truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

all, and turn to worſhip for cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ends, the worſt Idol that ever the Devil ſet up in the World.</p>
               <p>Sure thoſe wicked Men above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned will riſe up in Judgment againſt us; for had they been ſo highly favoured in all reſpects, as Friends as a People have been, who knows but they might have been as great Saints as any in the Church of Chriſt at this Day; for had Friends ſtood faithful in their Teſtimony againſt this Practice from the beginning they might have convinced many, and ſtopt 'em in their career; but now they may ſay, and that truly too, we have been a means to encourage and ſtrengthen them in their wicked ways; for when they brought in a Cargo of Blacks, who more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to purchaſe them, and at a great Price, than the Saints, or them that ſeem ſo, and would be thought ſuch. Well my dear and tender Friends, although I touch thus cloſe to eaſe my afflicted mind, which has been toſſed as with a Tempeſt at times, above 17 Years, on this ſad Account Slave-Keeping, yet I write not this of all by no means, I know and be-believe there is many Friends, that dare not touch with it, for any Profit whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. I do hope there is ſome Thouſands

will not bow the Knee to this <hi>Baal,</hi> nor kiſs his Lips for an Eaſe or Gain. It has been ſaid, that all do not ſee it ſo great a Sin as I and ſome others make it; and for that reaſon with others I think it my duty to write and ſpeak the more about it where I come, that Friends and others may be better informed. Some have inſinuated, as if the Primitive Saints kept Captive Slaves; this is helliſh Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure indeed, to accuſe the greateſt of Saints with the greateſt of Sins; whoſe Damnation is juſt, and their reward ſhall be according to their Works; for they were without Spot, then free from the greateſt Spot; holy, as he is holy; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as he is perfect; He that Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and they that are Sanctified, are one-Bleſſing and Honour, Salvation and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our God, for evermore, <hi>Amen,</hi> ſaith my Soul.</p>
               <p>Curſing and Diſhonour, and Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to the Devil and Satan, and his Inſtruments, that Preach ſuch Doctrines; for they that are Born of God Sin not, neither can they, for his Seed remaineth in them; they cannot Sin, becauſe they are Born of God.</p>
               <p>And now my dear Friends and others,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:004149_0081_1003DECF920ED938"/>
you that came in Servants to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Slaves, although for a ſhort time by your own Conſent too, for you to plead for Negroe-Keeping, is almoſt intolerable.</p>
               <p>I ſay, you that came here poor, vile, miſerable wretches, deſtitute and folorn, and here you were kept to hard Labour, which was good for you, and brought you to a ſenſe of your filthy, abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, undone, and woful curſed condition which you, many of ye had been in, then O then many of you came to conſider of your ways, and were wiſe in turning to the Lord, into your own Hearts by the moving and riſing of his own bleſſed Light, Life, Grace and pure Love there in your own Souls, which was as a Light ſhining in a Dark Place, your Hearts dark indeed, by reaſon of Sin, and that filthy Life which you had lived; you came to be burthened with it, and ſeek relief in turning to the Lord in your Hearts, where he was and is to be found, bleſſed be his pure Name which is his Eſſence or divine Nature, manifeſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Men; ſo when you came to this good experience, you came to love the Society and follow the good example of our worthy Elders, very commendable

in you to do, which firſt ſettled in this Country; you came to live ſober lives, and by your induſtry, the Almighty favouring, ſome attained to very large poſſeſſions here, being a large Country and few People, but now more numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo no occaſion for Negro-Slaves; for had this Land been covered with 'em as it is now in ſome Places, and too much here already, how would you have come to this greatneſs; you might have periſhed for want of Buſineſs to purchaſe neceſſaries. Let it never be forgotten by you, I beſeech and pray ye for the Lord's ſake, and for your own and your Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens ſake, that are coming up in vaſt Numbers, as well as them that are, or may become Servants hereafter, with many, yea very many of your own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which is very likely by the wicked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004149_0083_1003DEE46D294B68"/>
                  <hi>Quakers</hi> have writ and bore Teſtimony againſt this Sin at times, near 50 Years, but were reproached for that likewiſe; but ſome are gone to their Graves in Peace; many yet living; as in <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, Jerſey, Long-Iſland, Nantucket, Old England,</hi> which I have been with at their Houſes, and their Writings are extant at this time to my certain knowledge, although many poor ſeeking Souls, that are bewildered by this wicked Helliſh Sin in our Miniſters, Slave-Keeping, will not believe or cannot believe it, but rather believe we approve of it as a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with one conſent unanimouſly. When ſome Friends have been reaſoning with ſome Sober People of other profeſſions in my hearing, concerning the Pride and Covetouſneſs of their hireling Preachers, and concerning Truth's Principles, they have had nothing to ſay for the one, or againſt the other; but whether ſhall we go, ſay they, we do not approve or like keeping Slaves, it is not doing as we would be done by ourſelves; and your People are as greedy as any Body in keeping Negroes for their Gain, (it is too true) but not all ſaid I, no ſay they again, who ſhall we believe, we are ſure and do know, that your Preachers and

Elders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chief Leaders have 'em; anſwer was made, not all, for ſome have teſtified againſt it, as a very henious Sin, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years, Year after Year; and are gone to their ſilent Graves in Peace, and many yet living amongſt us, as above is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. Why then, ſay they, do you not ſeparate. Here it is thus written, <hi>Wherefore come out from amongſt them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 13, 14, <hi>to</hi> 17. read the next verſe with attention, in the fear of the Lord.</p>
               <p>I know no worſe or greater ſtumbling Blocks the Devil has to lay in the way of honeſt Inquirers, than our Miniſters and Elders keeping Slaves; and by ſtraining and perverting Holy Scriptures, Preach more to Hell, than ever they will bring to Heaven, by their feigned Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Hypocriſy.</p>
               <p>Satan put to his laſt Shift, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil working wonders, by a ſeeming Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry of great repute; for by their keeping of Slaves, they carry on his Work, and uphold his Kingdom.

Stars of Heaven, and did caſt them to the Earth with his Tail, the vileſt part of the Beaſt.</hi> Let him that reads underſtand; the Stars were Men that had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and it has been the Judgment of worthy Men, in many Ages of the World, that a falſe and fallen Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry have been the greateſt Inſtruments of Evil, that ever the Devil brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of Chriſt, as may be ſeen in <hi>Euſebius's Church Hiſtory, Francis Howgil's Works, G. Fox's Journal,</hi> and in many more beſide, which I have by me; does largely ſet forth that falſe and fallen Miniſters are the worſt Devils, and Dragons, and Serpents, the Woman or Church has to War with, by reaſon of the Power they have with the beaſtly Nature, in their ignorant Hearers, and fooliſh bigotted Crowd; ſuch as have itching Ears, and ſhallow Crowns, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Minds, and looſer Lives; ſuch being Born after the Fleſh, are very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to join with the Serpent, to perſecute him that is Born after the Spirit; it was ſo, it is ſo, and it will be ſo.

               <p>But as to thoſe Dragon, Slave-Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preachers, that are now making War with the Woman, theſe fallen Stars they ſay they have been inlightened, and received part of the Miniſtry; we will allow it, for God Almighty has been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and kind to them, and is ſtill long ſuffering; So <hi>Judas</hi> their elder Brother was inlightened too, as much and more than they, for ought I know, but he repented, and returned his curſed Gain, and made Confeſſion of his ſoul Sin, which I fear is more than they will do in haſte, ſo much worſe than <hi>Judas</hi> they are, for they Crucifie the Truth daily, and put it to open ſhame.</p>
               <p>I have underſtood lately, that ſome have made their Wills when they were Sick, to ſet their Negroes free at ſuch an Age, 30 or 40, after their Death; that will not ſalve the Sore, it is too deep and rotten, God will not be mocked ſo, nor Wiſe Men neither; they rather think of the old Proverb, it may be.</p>

               <p>So I inquired of the Friend what they did with this or ſuch vaſt Numbers of Slaves; he ſaid, they carried them to <hi>Jamaica</hi> generally, and ſold them to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for the Mines, or any Body elſe, I ſuppoſe, that will give moſt for them, although they keep them and their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, in their curſed Helliſh Iron-Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace for evermore.</p>

O Brave Chriſtians for the Devil, and Proteſtants too! is this the way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>Papiſts, Turks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> of their notorious Wickedneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity, when we encourage them in it all we can, by ſupplying of them with Slaves, for our curſed Gain.</p>
               <p>Several eminent Friends amongſt us of great Note, have boaſted in my hearing of having Servants or Slaves born in their Houſe, alluding to <hi>Abraham,</hi> for keeping Slaves; but I cannot find in all the Scriptures that <hi>Abraham</hi> ever had any Slaves; Servants he might have born in his Houſe, and bought with Money for a time; but I do not believe that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, perfect good Man would keep his fellow Creatures in Bondage, them and their Off-ſpring, for evermore. I have a better Opinion of that tender hearted, good vertuous Man, that was ſtiled the Father of the faithful, by the Lip of Truth, and that rightly too, for ſo he was; but the unfaithful hypocritical <hi>Phariſees,</hi> would, for a Cloak to their Wickedneſs, have him to their Father; but Truth told them, if they were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham'</hi>s Children they would do the Works of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but now ye are of your Father the Devil, and his Works ye
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:004149_0090_1003DF2146399508"/>
will do. May not Truth ſay the ſame thing now, of our Preachers and Elders, Keepers and Traders in Slaves for noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but their ungodly Gain. But what will our wicked Slave-Keepers get by flying beyond Goſpel and Law, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to patroniſe their curſed infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal practice; but what Truth ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> it will ſay to them, <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Friends, you that are Slave-Keepers, I pray and beſeech ye, examine your own Hearts, and ſee and feel too, if you have not the ſame anſwer from Truth now within; while you Preach and exhort others to Equity, and to do Juſtice and love Mercy, and to walk humbly before the Lord and his People, and you yourſelves live and act quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, behave proudly, do unjuſtly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully, and live in and encourage the groſſeſt Iniquity in the whole World. For I ſay, you are got beyond Goſpel, Law, <hi>Abraham,</hi> Prophets, Patriarchs, to <hi>Cain</hi> the Murtherer, and beyond him too, to the Devil himſelf, beyond <hi>Cain,</hi> for he Murthered but one, that we know of but you have many Thouſands, or cauſed 'em to be ſo, and for ought I know many

What do you think of theſe Things, you brave Goſpel Miniſters? that keep poor Slaves to Work for you to maintain you and yours in Pride, Pride and much Idleneſs or Lazineſs, and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Bread, the Sins of <hi>Sodom:</hi> How do theſe Things become your plain Dreſs, Demure Appearance, feigned Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all but Hypocriſy, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Truth's Teſtimony, muſt have the hotteſt Place in Hell; to keep thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creatures at hard Labour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, unto their old Age, in Bondage and ſore Captivity, working out their Blood and Sweat, and Bowels, youthful ſtrength and vigour, then you drop in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Graves, go to your Places or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained or appointed for you; ſo leave theſe poor unhappy Creatures in their worn-out old Age, to your proud, Dainty, Lazy, Scornful, Tyrannical, and often beggerly Children, for them to Domineer and Tyrannize over, curſing them and you in your Graves, for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their youthful Blood and ſtrength for you, and then leave 'em to be a Plague to us; and then of the abuſes, miſeries and Cruelties theſe miſerable old worn out Slaves go through, no Tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs

               <p>There has been that has reflected on me, as if I wanted a Party, and to ſee what Numbers I could get on my ſide; the living Lord God Almighty is Witneſs for me, that I deſire no Party, no Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber but what is on the Lords ſide, and his Party, which hold the Bleſſed Truth in righteouſneſs and holineſs of Life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and in Truth.

Years, almoſt 20 before I ever ſaw <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> cloſely exerciſed, and ſorely oppreſſed with a falſe and forward Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, where Slave-Keeping is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Law, and has been I firmly believe a great means of bringing in and ſpreading the Apoſtacy, and ſo continues to do, by ſome that pretend to preach freely, as well or ill as by the bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Hirelings of our time, who cannot deny but that they make a trade of Preaching for their Bellies, but groſs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy by the way.</p>
               <p>I have had it in my mind for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, to write ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a falſe Anti-Chriſtian Miniſtry, and a true Chriſtian Miniſtry, fitted and ſent forth by the Spirit of Truth itſelf, in this our Day, with the Epiſtles of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy Men, of ſeveral perſuaſions, on that Subject; but fearing it will ſwell this Volume too large, it is thought beſt to be reſerved for another Impreſſion, with ſomething concerning the Kingdom of Heaven, or Heavenly Kingdom, what it is, and where it is to be found, with the moſt ready, ſure and certain way to attain it, plainly deſcribed; for the ſake of the ſincere in Heart, who are tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling toward <hi>Sion,</hi> with their Faces

               <p>As no Man or Men can ſet forth in Words ſpoken or written, the great good, ſervice, comfort, joy, ſtrength &amp; conſolation, a true Miniſtry ſent from God has been, and is of, for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the true Church in God, in their moſt Holy Faith:</p>
               <p>So no Men or Angels, nor all the Men in the World can declare to the full, the great evil, that a falſe Miniſtry, ſent from the Devil, has been, and is of, for the Building up of the falſe Church in their ſinful, and unholy Faith and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>I had it alſo much in my mind to write ſomething concerning the Lives of the Primitive Chriſtians, mentioned by <hi>William Penn,</hi> in his <hi>No Croſs No Crown,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius'</hi>s <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas a Kempis'</hi>s <hi>Chriſtian Pattern, Michael de Molinus'</hi>s <hi>Spiritual Guide,</hi> a Book called <hi>The Apoſtolick Fathers,</hi> and ſome of the beſt of the Philoſophers and others, which I have by me, which might be of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to them that live ſingle Lives eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially;

but it muſt be left till another time.</p>
               <p>O the ſtrict Rules of Temperance that was amongſt thoſe <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Old-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land!</hi> what Perſecution then was by Plundering, Robbing and ruining of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies?

               <p>Then about the ſame in <hi>N.

is not like Slave-Keeping; for thoſe were diſpatched or ſet at Liberty, and ſome crime or cauſe pretended; but theſe for no fault, ſo much as pretended, but only Deviliſh Covetouſneſs in the Stealers and Receivers, and then by a lingering Martyrdom from one twenty Years to another, ſome above Ground and ſome under Ground in Caves &amp; Dens or Mines, are Murthered by Working hard, and Starving, Whipping, Racking, Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Burning, Scalding, Roaſting, and other Helliſh Torments, very ſorrowful to conſider. O when will there be an end of theſe Things, ſeeing it now going on with main ſtrength by almoſt all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as well as by ſome of thoſe that pretend to the moſt ſtrict ſelf-denying Doctrine in the World, that is ſo full of Mercy, Compaſſion, Forgiveneſs to the very worſt of Enemies, Tenderneſs, Meekneſs, Mildneſs, Sweetneſs of Love, and Pity to all Creatures of all Kinds; <hi>the merciful Man is merciful to his Beaſt,</hi> and yet ſome of theſe Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to this Purity can join with theſe Men-Killers and Stealers for Gain, which is hard to write, but it is True.</p>

And I think there is as much need now to keep ſuch as are of the ſame Spirit out of the Church, or it is in great Danger in the Opinion of ſome ſeeing worthy Friends, who can ſee beyond Profeſſion, Formality or worldly Intereſt.</p>
               <p>That Spirit has ſomething in view; the good of the Belly, a rich Wife or Husband, carrying on a good Trade, or to be exalted, and to get or keep up a ſtrong Party for ſome Deſign, baſe enough; and under this Cloak of Deceit, accuſe others of ſeeking a Party.

               <p>But if the Words be never ſo ſound and orthodox, without Life they are but as Chaff; and what is the Chaff to the Wheat? why truly, Friends, you know the Chaff is for the Beaſts; but the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Wheat, with which our heavenly Father feeds his Babes, is for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom, New Jeruſalem, the Church of the living God, his Houſe.</p>

Life of the Sheep) and if this Dog fell a barking yawling or howling, among the Sheep and the pretty pretty dear Lambs, immediately they leave their Feeding, and run for their dear Lives; ſo they would be ſcatter'd, and ſcatter'd, altho' there was or might be a great Flock of them together. Sometimes, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I have been a little careleſs and ſleepy like ſome other Shepherds, and then the Sheep would go wandring about over Hedge and Ditch, and get into my Neighbour's Corn, and do Miſchief; and then it was very hard for me to get them out of the Corn and into order again. Sometimes it would coſt me many Tears before I could get them into order again. Sometimes if the Sheep and Lambs were not gathered together before Night, in the Night in the Dark the Dog would come and bite many of them, and ſuck their Blood, and ſome he would kill; ſo then that would be a Grief to the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a Reproach to the Shepherd.</p>
               <p>So, my very dear Friends, you that are the right true Shepherds, that love the Sheep more than all things in this World, you can very eaſily make an Application, for it is your Life and Delight to take Care of your Father's Sheep, and his
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:004149_0132_1003E0959F62A718"/>
Lambs eſpecially, and are grieved when the Dog, the Dog, the Bloodſucker, does but bark, and hinder them from Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I know what I write, bleſſed be the Name of the good and great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, for evermore, who laid down his Life for his Sheep and Lambs.</p>
               <p>My dear faithful Friends, you are much eſteemed by me, and your Unity in the Father in his Kingdom, which is his Church, is much more deſired by me than all things in this World, I can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay. It has been much in my Mind for a conſiderable time, to lay before you my Concern for having ſome of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient worthy Friends Epiſtles of Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reproof, Caution, and Advice to Miniſters, collected and reprinted; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending it may be of ſome Service to have a Collection of ſuch as I have mentioned, or ſuch as you ſhall think will be of moſt Service; I earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and entreat to have your Advice and Counſel; for I know right well that in the multitude of Counſel there is Safety, eſpecially with them dear Friends that know the Truth and are faithful; theſe are the beſt Counſellors in the whole World. I am your Brother and Friend in the bleſſed Truth.</p>

               <p>EArly this Morning it was given me to ſee, that all Slave-keepers and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with them for Gain, were Apoſtates which pretended to be Chriſtians; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Miniſters it is a double Crime, becauſe of their bad Example to to their Flock; for all ſuch have the Mark of the Beaſt, Whore and Falſe Prophet on them, <hi>Myſtery Babylon Mother of Harlots,</hi> let them preach as long as they will or may.</p>
               <p>Oh Iſrael! thy Leaders cauſe thee to err, by their Lyes and their Lightneſs! Oh how mine Eyes have ſeen ſome of the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:004149_0136_1003E0B489AF62A8"/>
firſt Rank, ſit and ſtand and laugh, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and others, when I have been ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Bondage and miſerable Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of their poor Slaves, in as light and airy a manner as any Boy in the Town need to do: Perſons Male and Female, eminent in the Church, Friends of Renown in their Generation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; long Cuſtom and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs having made the Sin, altho' ſo very groſs, ſo eaſy and familiar to them. Some of which I do verily believe have known the pure Preſence of the divine Lord of Life and Glory, his holy Light and bleſſed Truth in their Souls; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards become vain in their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to think Slave-Keeping was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſo their fooliſh Hearts became dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and hardned again worſe than ever. Oh that is a ſorrowful Condition, to have the greateſt Mark of the Apoſtacy in the World, upon them, and not to know or believe it!</p>
               <p>When I ſay <hi>All Slave-Keepers Apoſtates,</hi> I mean them that keep innocent Men, Women and Children in everlaſting Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. As to petty Criminals, that will not or cannot make Reſtitution, I think, as well as many other tender Friends and

People fearing God and loving his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their Fellow-Creatures, although very wicked, that they had better be kept in Bondage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 3. that by hard Labour they might be brought to Repentance and Amendment of Life, in order to a happy Death, than to put them to Death in their Sins; for in the Grave there is no Repentance; but hard Labour and mean Living is an Antidote to Luxury and Idleneſs, and Captivity the Reverſe of Nature might prevent a great deal of Wickedneſs in the World, and bring many unthinking Creatures to remember and prepare for their latter End before it be too late, which I ſhould rejoice to ſee. There is an excellent Paſſage quoted by <hi>R. S. page</hi> 104. from <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> High Chancellor of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> much to the purpoſe.

                  <hi>I am moved to write unto you, to take heed of putting Men to death for ſtealing Cattle or Money,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the Thieves in old time were to make Reſtitution, and if they had not wherewith, they were to be ſold for their Theft. Mind the Laws of God in the Scriptures and Spirit that gave them forth, and let them be your Rule in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Judgment, and ſhew Mercy that you may receive Mercy from God the Judge of all. And take heed of Gifts and Rewards, and of Pride, for God doth forbid them, and they do blind the Eyes of the Wiſe. I do not write to give Liberty to Sin, God hath forbidden it; but that you ſhould judge according to his Laws, and ſhew mercy, for he delighteth in true Judgment and in mercy.

               <p>THE Thing appeared very clearly as at other Times, that <hi>Slave-keeping,</hi> with all its Concomitants, was the worſt Idol, and one of the greateſt Marks of the Apoſtacy, in the whole World, and the very worſt Part of the great Whore's Merchandiſe, Myſtery Babylon, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Whores.</p>
               <p>At this Time alſo it is brought to my Remembrance, with great Thankfulneſs to my deareſt God and Father, Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Preſerver, the great Liberty that I with many Thouſands more enjoy in this good Land, which to many wiſe &amp; right conſiderate People, is much more valuable than natural Life; eſpecially our religious Liberty; with the Plenty of all good Things needful for the Body, which many hundreds of Thouſands have been and are deprived of, by the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named vileſt, groſſeſt and blackeſt of all Abominations. And for this black Scene

to be acted by them that pretend to the moſt pure, holy, meek, ſweet and loving Principle (to all People) in the World, is to ſome, yea many tender hearted People beyond compare with any thing in the World; I ſay, for theſe People that pretend not to preach or to pray without the ſweet holy Motion or Moving of the pure ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in their Hearts, the Unction from the Holy One, the ſweet anointing Oil, the Feeling of which doth unite the Brethren, and was and is compared to the Oil that was poured upon the Head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> God's High-Prieſt, and ran down his Beard, ſo to the nethermoſt Skirts of his Garment, before he was to offer an Offering on the holy Altar in the Temple of the Lord; which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Oil and Anointing, Prieſthood, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, Offerings, and Temple, were but Types and Shadows of much better Things to come, of a much greater and more glorious heavenly and ſpiritual Temple, or Houſe; for the Glory of this latter Houſe doth far exceed the Glory of the former, as far as Day exceeds the Night, or Heaven exceeds the Earth, as many have come to the Experience of, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who rules and reigns in his Temple, in ſanctified Hearts, prepared

by himſelf, to do his Will and dwell in; Praiſes, Praiſes be given to his pure Name, for his holy glorious and pure Preſence in his holy Temple! For ſuch Bodies and Souls are the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, the holy living God; but he or ſhe that defiles this Temple by <hi>Slave-keeping,</hi> him may God deſtroy, if not repented of and forſaken. Can thoſe Favourites of Heaven, ſo anointed and array'd, beyond that of <hi>Aaron</hi> more than Words can expreſs; can theſe ſanctified and waſhed ones, that have been array'd with the fine Linnen clean and white, clean and white indeed, which is the Righteouſneſs of Saints; can theſe, with the Sow that was waſhed, turn again to wallow in the Mire of that Heathen Practice, <hi>Slave-Keeping,</hi> and worſe, all things well conſidered; or like the Dog, a ravenous Beaſt, to lick up his Vomit, the filthieſt and moſt unnatural Part or Sort of Excrement; and ſo is the Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping Practice, I am very certain.</p>
               <p>I verily believe there are ſome now in the Practice of Slave-keeping, that in the Time of their firſt Love and tender ſweet Eſpouſal to Chriſt, would have been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to have anſwered if they had been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as the Man did the Prophet, <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog, that he ſhould do ſuch

               <p>THis Morning very early it ſprung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain afreſh and very lively in my Mind, concerning Marriages made in the ſweet Love, Fear, Wiſdom and Counſel of the almighty living Lord God and eternal Father in Heaven, if we want Riches and Honour, Pleaſure and Joy: What is comparable to thoſe Marriages made only in the Lord, in the Church, in Heaven, in the Temple; but few ſuch Marriages I fear are to be found now a Days, that are made by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven, which is the Truth. But abundance of Marriages are made by the Father in Hell, the Devil, which is out of the Truth: Made by the Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and Pride of Life, and for Covetouſneſs to maintain them, which is all of him that is an Enemy to all Mankind, the Devil
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:004149_0143_1003E0E129CEC628"/>
or Satan, if we did but know it there is no worſe Devil or unclean Spirit than Self, that dwells and Rules in poor Mankind, to their Deſtruction Soul and Body. Self or Covetouſneſs, ſays the Apoſtle, is the root of all Evil; tell me my Friends and Mortals, can there be a worſe Devil, or more unclean Spirit or Root from which all Evil grows, or a worſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than that from which all our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery flows?</p>
               <p>Can there, my dear and well beloved Friends, be a better God or Holy Spirit than that, or he that leads into all Truth, which is Heaven itſelf, and ſo into all Peace and Joy; or a worſe Devil or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Spirit than that which leads into all untruth, and ſo into all Sorrow, Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Miſery, which is Hell enough in my opinion, where the Worm never dies, and the Fire goes not out, and Torment enough for the wickedeſt of Men, and greater than I wiſh for the worſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but rather would pray for them, that they would ſo live as to eſcape that Place or State of Torment. </p>

and if he would follow his inward true and ſpiritual Guide, which would never lead him wrong if he would ſtrictly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low its Counſel. I ſay I had many things in my Mind to write, but am a little ſtraitned at preſent, and muſt wait to ſee whether this that is done may be of any Service, or in any meaſure well received by my Brethren, which are begotten and born again of the immortal Seed and Word of God, which lives and abides forever, and is God himſelf: Thoſe thus born are his Sons and Daughters, God is their own Father, and they his own dear Children, and his Heirs, and joined or equal Heirs with Chriſt, in his and their Fathers Kingdom, which is and ever will remain an eternal Kingdom of GLORY or GLORIOUS GOVERNMENT where he the Holy One doth rule and govern, which is his Church, in his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in his Houſe or his Temple, in new Jeruſalem, in his Sanctuary, in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in himſelf, all one and the ſame eternal SANCTUM SANCTORUM. Chriſt was not aſhamed to call ſuch ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Souls his Brethren, which worſhip God in Spirit, and in his Church which is his Kingdom, ſaying, <hi>I will declare thy Name unto my Brethren;</hi> and after
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:004149_0145_1003E0EBC9763DC0"/>
his bleſſed Reſurrection ſent forth a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Preacher the very firſt, to declare of it, and I believe to preach freely as ſhe had freely receiv'd of him; <hi>Go tell my Brethren I am riſen, and that I aſcend to my Father and your Father, to my God &amp; your God.</hi> O glorious Meſſage! one of the beſt that ever was, and yet ſent by a Woman! the glad Tidings of great Joy, that their Lord was alive that they thought was dead. They did not reject the Teſtimony becauſe it came by a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; no more than the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> the Woman that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſent from <hi>Jacob'</hi>s Well, as I can find; but they went or ran to ſee for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Although I have writ thus much for Womens Preaching, yet I would have none go before they are ſent of the Lord, no more than Men; for it is alike hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me, and many worthy Friends, to my certain Knowledge. I could willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray to the Lord with all my Soul and Spirit, that he would be pleaſed to ſtop the Mouths of all thoſe Lyars, who ſay <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> when he never ſpake by them.

               <p>THis Morning early, after five Days and Nights Faſting, I was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many Calumnies which the World or People of the World, has caſt upon the Saints and Servants of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, my very dear true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends in Chriſt, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as if they kept Slaves, or encouraged and connived at it for their Intereſt, Favour or Affection, or ſome baſe ſiniſter Ends. But it is a meer Slander, for they abhor the Practice, and dare not touch with it, as verily believing it to be one of the groſſeſt Sins and Iniquities (with all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants) in the whole World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> But ſome may and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in my Hearing, that ſome, yea many called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Elders and chief Leaders &amp; Rulers, <hi>Men of Renown in the Congregation, Num.</hi> 16. 1, 2, 3. and of great Repute in the World, <hi>John</hi> 15. 18, 19. yea verily the World loves its own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But I anſwer, they were not all Iſrael who were called Iſrael, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. but ſome were Apoſtates, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds

and Impoſtors, and they were ſome of the worſt Enemies, the very worſt the Hebrews had, and procured their Ruin, Overthrow and utter Deſtruction, as is largely ſet forth in the Hiſtory of the Wars of the Jews by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> beſide what is mentioned in holy Scripture plentifully by the holy Prophets.</p>
               <p>And ſo it was amongſt the Primitive Chriſtians, about the Time of the Ten Perſecutions, when they gat a little Eaſe from the Heathen Tyrants, the apoſtate Chriſtians went to the ſame deviliſh Work, of murthering and butchering the true Chriſtians, about their Creeds, keeping of Eaſter, and other Idols, and about the Clauſe of one Subſtance and two Subſtances, as if the eternal Being could be divided; But eſpecially after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Roman Emperor was converted to the Chriſtian Faith, in his Zeal he gave ſuch large Donations and Revenues to the Church, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, the ſame Day there was a Voice heard from Heaven, crying aloud, <hi>This Day is Poiſon poured into the Church!</hi> which the Event ſoon after verified. By an ancient Obſervation, <hi>Religion brought forth Wealth, and the Daughter devoured the Mother;</hi> it is the very ſame now. So
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:004149_0148_1003E0FE613D0880"/>
when the Biſhops, Preachers and Rulers grew rich and high, they centred in Pride, Idleneſs, and Fulneſs of Bread; then they went together by the Ears with might and main, ſtriving who ſhould be greateſt; then to inventing and ſetting forth the old, naſty, fulſome, ſtinking Whore's Trumpery or Merchandiſe to Sale, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 13. 17. 5. and they that would not buy it, or could not receive it, might expect to be ſent out of the World by all the Tortures that Wrath and Hell could invent, as they could prevail with Kings, Rulers and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to aſſiſt them, by unrighteous Laws and Edicts. And when the Magiſtrates were ſuch Fools as to dance after their Call, they embrued whole Nations and Kingdoms in Blood. Theſe Things are largely ſet forth in <hi>Euſebius'</hi>s Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, an excellent ſweet Book it is, and I could heartily wiſh all right thinking ſolid ſober Men had one of them, eſpecially all Magiſtrates and Rulers of all Perſuaſions. I think I ſhould rejoice to ſee it reprinted in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> altho' I were out ſome Pounds toward the Charge of it, for the good of Mankind, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I have one by me.

It's the Ignorance and Idleneſs of the People, that gives the Clergy an opportunity to effect their Deſigns, for ſo mean-ſpirited are the People as to take all upon truſt for their Souls, that would not truſt or take a Braſs Shilling from an Arch-Biſhop; 'tis prodigious to think what Veneration the Prieſthood has raiſed to themſelves, by their uſurpt Commiſſion, and their Clink-Clank of extraordinary Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; did the People examine their Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, the Grounds of their Religion and Faith, it would not be in the Power of

their Leaders to cauſe them to err. What, doubt my Miniſter! arraign his Doctrine! put him to proof! by no means: but the conſequence of not doing of it, has been the Introduction of much falſe Doctrine, Superſtition and Formality, (amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as well as others) which gave juſt occaſion for Schiſm; for the Word has no hurt in itſelf, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies only a Separation, which may as well be right as wrong.</p>

And they that ſhall judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly read it and rightly underſtand it, may well be excuſed from reading of many Books, the Authors of which pretend ſo much to the Knowledge of the Creator and Creation. If ever God appeared in any Man, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in him, as appears by this Book; that a Man that had not the Benefit of his Anceſtors Knowledge, being, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the firſt Inventor of the Art of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating Knowledge to Poſterity by Writing, ſhould be ſo high a Divine, and ſo deep a Philoſopher, ſeems to be a Thing more of God than of Man, and therefore it was the Opinion of ſome, that he came from Heaven, not born upon Earth.

Conſcience will be kept clean unto the Lord, in diſcharging thy Duty, and ſo will thy captivated Brother or Siſter be reſtored again forth out of the Hand of the Deſtroyer, and then thou wilt have Union together, in that which is pure forever in the Lord, and the eternal God of Power, keep you all his dear Children in his pure Wiſdom, to walk faithfully with him and one with another, and the Bleſſing of the Lord God Almighty be with you forever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

and taſte what Spirits they are on that come amongſt you, or in at this Day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many come forth to the owning of the <hi>TRUTH</hi> in their Judgments, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the outward Man in ſome outward Geſtures, like to the Children of the <hi>TRUTH,</hi> But though they pretend zeal and obedience to God in what they do, they being gone from the Light, they neither regard the Glory of God, nor the Good of his People, for all that they now do is wrought in a ſelf-ſerving Spirit, where they enter in a Myſterious Working of the Deceit of their Hearts, to ſet up and cover themſelves with a voluntary Humility and feigned Love, gathering all the eloquent and inticing Words of Man's Wiſdom as they can, with which they make, they make a flouriſh in a diſcourſative Spirit, ſpeaking high Words of that they never did know, to get entrance upon the Affections of the tender-hearted ones, that are afraid to judge any but themſelves, with others that look more at high Words, than to feel from whence they come, or to know the end for which they are ſpoken, and they ſeek to overcome, with their ſubtil inticing Words, to carry on their own Intereſt, intrude into the Miniſtry

and runs when God never ſent them, therefore they do not profit the People.</p>
               <p>So are the Children born of the Royal Seed burthened now; all dear Children of the Lord, Watch and Pray that you may be guided by the Power of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in all your Ways, and be careful that none be haſty to utter Words before the Lord, neither ſuffer any Sighs or Groans, or any thing to be heard to paſs through you, but you have the Seal of the Spirit of the Lord, he requires it of you, this I am commanded to lay as a charge upon you.</p>

                  <hi>DEAR and Well-beloved Friend, it came in my mind early this Morning, once more to write a few Lines, to thee, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cloſe exerciſe of Mind, that is now on me, and have been many Years, long before I ever ſaw</hi> Pennſylvania; <hi>concerning that pernicious deſtructive Spirit, that deſtroyer of much good in our Meetings, I ſay, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Spirit, that appears in a falſe, as well as a forward Miniſtry in our Meetings, to their great diſturbance and annoyance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the faithful, both Miniſters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Oh! this mighty Monſter (falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry) with his many Heads, Horns and Crowns, this Monſtrous, Beaſtly Spirit in Men and Women, riſing up out of the Sea, or People, this Beaſt that had a Wound by a Sword, but does live, but it is the Life of a Beaſt, altho' it was wounded by the Sword of the Spirit, by ſome Convictions for groſs Sins, but the deadly Wound being falſly heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Beaſt doth live and is alive, and reigns in full ſtrength in them, and have got the Dragons Power and Seat, and great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the whole World wonders after the Beaſt, the Worldly mind, and dark earthly Spirit amongſt us; then again there is ſeen

a little Beaſt with two Horns like a Lamb, riſing up out of the Earth, and it exerciſes all the Power of the firſt Beaſt, that went or came before it, being of the ſame Eſſence, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; Subſtance, formed in the ſame Womb, Born of the ſame Mother, Myſtery of</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>the Mother of Harlots, or of Baſtards, illegitimate, baſe-born Children, full of all, all, all Iniquity, the very depth of the Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> Dear Friend, <hi>is this little Beaſt with his two Horns like a Lamb, very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure in the outward appearance, ſeemingly Zealous for right Diſcipline and good order in the Church, very loving to Friends of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, Miniſters eſpecially, good and bad, &amp; get to their Houſes and Tables, the richeſt ſort of Friends, and thoſe of the greateſt Note to be ſure, and moſt Account in the World, that they may ſpread their Name, and their Fame wherever they come or go, that they may be more ſecurely, covertly, cunningly and hidden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry on their Deſign in the Church, in making of Parties to ſtrengthen their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Church and their Families, by Trading and great Dealing, either in Land or Goods, Executorſhip, or by whatever way or means Wealth may be obtained, to ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and furniſh their Poſterity with rich Wives and Huſbands, that they may be great in the Earth: And this to be contrived, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

on, acted and done with the face and ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pearance of Religion and Sanctity, and under pretence of Preaching the Goſpel too, this is the very Secret of Secrets, of the Myſtery of Iniquity and the depth of Satan, which many Thouſands amongſt us I believe doth not ſee, and here Satan doth work ſafely, and will work until he is diſcovered by the ſingle Eye, the cleanſed Eye of the mind, that is opened and cleanſed by the very Light and Power of Truth itſelf, and kept open too, and clean in and by the Eternal Light and Life of Truth, or elſe the Dirt or Duſt of the Earth, may and will get in again, and ſtop the Eye up again, and make it more dark and blind than ever, never, never more to be opened, and this is a ſad diſmal State indeed for any to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, deplorable, never, never, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>They that are not right lye down in ſorrow, tho' they hide it from others for a time; they feel it themſelves, but having once began to Preach for ſame baſe End, they are aſhamed to, and afraid to leave off, altho' they are convicted and condemned in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, clearly and heavily, to be ſure, and ſo it follows,</hi> he that doubts is Damned, <hi>as it is Written.</hi>

                  <hi>Dear</hi> John, <hi>this Morning I was in my Garden pulling up ſome Weeds, it came in my mind what was objected againſt me lately, by one that miniſters amongſt us</hi> N. A. <hi>and hath done near</hi> 20 <hi>Years; that I was for ſetting up ſome Miniſters, and pulling down others, Now,</hi> Dear Friend, <hi>I muſt confeſs I do not approve of a falſe Miniſter, much leſs to ſet him up, neither would I pull down the True by no means, nor touch the truely anointed to do them any harm, for they are very near to my Life I can truely ſay without any reſerve, and I hope ever will be while I have a Being, But if one ſhould aſk any Friend, even a falſe Miniſter himſelf, if we might at any Time receive, ſhould or ought to encourage a falſe Miniſter, or approve, join and unite with him in Prayer or in his Teſtimony, he would anſwer in the Negative, no, no, if not for
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:004149_0262_1003E18F2B659A98"/>
Conſcience yet for fear of ſhame or blame, but then, ſays he,</hi> who ſhall be Judge, <hi>why truely I may ſay if we have no Judgment in our goings and doings, we are in a very poor dark Condition, as well as other People, as falſe Miniſters and Prodigals would have us, that we might receive ſuch Huſks as they have to feed Swine withal, but the True Children in our the True Kingdom cannot feed on ſuch Chaff, if they offer to receive it by conniving at or ſeemingly approving of or joining with ſuch Swine-Herds, in Prayer or Teſtimony they will be in danger of being Choaked, for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have not true Peace, their Maſter Satan cannot give it them; now if any one offer to prove or make manifeſt their pretentions to Preaching is all Deceit and Cheat, and their ſeeming ſeed Corn, nothing but Chaff and Huſk, their Peace flys away at once, like Chaff before a ſtrong Wind; this I have often ſeen in</hi> England, <hi>here and elſe-where. This Chaff,</hi> Dear Friend, <hi>will not do for Children, the Beaſt, the Beaſts, Beaſts can feed on it, for it is agreeable to their Natures as Bread is to Children, like loves its like.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>This little or leſſer Beaſt, with his two Horns like a Lamb, but ſpake like a Dragon, like the Dragon that gave his Power to the firſt Beaſt and his Seat, and great Authority to rule and govern in the Church with an high

Hand in a lordly manner, and they that would or could not ſubmit to his Commands, although never ſo unjuſt and unreaſonable, he ſpake as a Dragon, eſpecially if any found it their Duty to contradict and oppoſe his uſurped Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and his unjuſt Commands, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Proceedings, ſuch muſt expect no Mercy from him, and yet have all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and outward appearance of a meek follower of the dear Lamb, who ſuffered the contradictions of ſinners, for our ſakes, that we might follow his Example; ſo the Beaſt, I ſay the Beaſt had two Horns like a Lamb, got into the outward Form as much as poſſible, the more craftily to deceive, and thus the Beaſt is a Beaſt ſtill, being a little outwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Speech and Habit; he then gets to Preaching, and that is his Maſter-Piece, and here Satan is exalted, and ſhows himſelf that he is God, chief Ruler, and here Satan's Chieftains thinks they reign in Glory or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and may be others think ſo too, that ſee 'em and hear 'em hold forth, ſuch I mean that knows not any thing, but what they know naturally, as Brute Beaſts; ſo e'en let thoſe Swine-Herds, with their Herds of Swine go down into the Sea, and be choaked together, if they pleaſe; that the true Sheep and Lambs might never more be troubled with them, would be joyful News to a many afflicted

               <p>
                  <hi>There is likewiſe ſome others, amongſt us, I am well ſatisfied, that have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with a Part, and a Portion, and a good Portion too, of the miniſtry, with the Saints and faithful ones, and have reigned with them in the Firmament of God's Power, and I would to God, that they did reign ſo ſtill; but alas, alas, ſome of theſe are fallen, not from Words, but from Life, and that is all in all. The Dragon's Tail hath prevailed, drawn 'em down to the Earth, they ſmell and favour of it, that were once freſh and lively, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the green Paſtures, loved to ſit in Silence in Meetings; as ſilent as a Flock of Sheep and Lambs in a Field, ſweetly feeding, without Noiſe of Words; but, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, ſome of theſe are grown reſtleſs and uneaſy in ſitting in Silence; but muſt and will be hammering and tampering, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if they feel but a little tickling of ſome former or old Experience, or a Drop of Wine in their old Bottle, undigeſted and unrefined, thick and muddy, the Bottle not being very clean: However having a ſtrong Opinion of their own Performances, and a rich Conceit of the great good they do, and have done; to Work they go, with
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:004149_0265_1003E199A5C7A568"/>
Noiſe of Words, and oftentimes no Senſe. Then comes forth the Tongue of</hi> Egyptian <hi>Sea, and the Language of</hi> Aſhdod <hi>is heard, and the linſey-woolſey Garment is ſeen, and the plowing is managed with the Ox and the Aſs joined together; poor plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Beaſts ſo ill matched, ſo unequal in their Nature and Stature, one drawing one way, and another another way; and then the Field is ſown with two Sorts of Seed, may-be a little good and a great deal of bad. Dear Friend, I wiſh theſe Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Sowers would ſtand ſtill a little, and look over the Field they have plowed, and ſown, and behold the Produce of their Labours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe that go forth with Sparks of their own kindling, ſhall lye down in Sorrow. I think, Oh that theſe would wait for the ſtill, ſtill Voice, that would direct them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, when and what to ſpeak to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and when to be ſilent; and not go forth in the hurry and bluſter of their own Spirits, in their own Time, but wait the Lord's Time: Nor in the Fire, nor the Wind, nor the Earthquake, where the pure</hi> TRUTH <hi>is not known, nor his Voice heard.</hi>

of Creatures, and ſowing the Field with divers Kinds of Seeds, would, or could be prevailed upon, to ſtand ſtill a little and be quieted, and look back and round about the Field, and ſee what ſort of Plowing they have made, and what Sort of Seed they have ſown, and what Sort of Grain is grown up; whether there is not</hi> 30, 60 <hi>or an Hundred Fold more bad than good, and if ſo, ſure there have been a great deal of bad Seed ſown in the Field, or it would not have been ſo (I firmly believe.) I do not believe it is all owing to the Badneſs of the Ground, but for want of honeſt Labour performed, by Faithful and True Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and then to have good, weighty, ſound, clean, pure ſubſtantial Seed ſown, without Mixture, in it, by ſuch Seed Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſuch I love as my own Soul, much more that which dwells and grows in them or in us, the pure eternal Truth.
