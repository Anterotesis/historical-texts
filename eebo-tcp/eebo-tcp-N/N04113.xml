            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>And Jesus, when he came out, saw much People and was moved with Compassion towards them, because they were as Sheep not having a Shepherd.</hi>

            <p>AS a faithful Ministry is a great Ornament, Blessing and Comfort, to the Church of GOD; even the Feet of such Messengers are beautiful: so on the contrary, an ungodly Ministry is a great Curse and Judgment: These Caterpillars labour to devour every green Thing.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that may more justly call forth our saddest Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and make all our Powers and Passions mourn, in the most doleful Accents, the most incessant, insatiable, and deploring A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies; than the melancholly Case of such, who have no faithful Ministry! This Truth is set before our Minds in a strong Light, in the Words that I have chosen now to insist upon! in which we have an Account of our LORD's Grief with the Causes of it.</p>
            <p>We are informed, That our dear Redeemer was moved with Compassion towards them. The Original Word signifies the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most vehement Pity, issuing from the innermost Bowels.</p>
            <p>But what was the Cause of this great and compassionate Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Heart of Christ? It was because he saw much People as Sheep, having no Shepherd. Why, had the People then no Teachers? O yes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But notwithstanding of the great Crowds of these Orthodox, Letter-learned and regular Pharisee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, had no better Guides: Because that those were as good as n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne (in many Respects) in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Judgment. For all the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, the People were as Sheep without a Shepherd.</p>
            <p>From the Words of our Text, the following Proposition offers itself to our Consideration, <abbr>

            </p>

            <p>I. <hi>Enquire into the Characters of the Old Pharisee-Teachers.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>And</p>
            <p>First I am to enquire into the <hi>Characters of the Old Pharisee-Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</hi> Now, I think the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>The old Pharisees were very proud and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ity; they loved the uppermost Seats in the Synagogues, and to be called Rabbi, Rabbi; they were masterly and positive in their Assertions, as if forsooth Knowledge must die with them; they look'd upon others that differed from them, and the common People with an Air of Disdain; and especially any who had a Respect for JESUS and his Doctrine, and dislik'd them; they judged such accursed.</p>
            <p>The old Pharisee-Shepherds were as crafty as Foxes; they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all Means to ensnare our Lord by their captious Questions, and to expose him to the Displeasure of the State; while in the mean Time, by sly and sneaking Methods, they tried to secure for themselves the Favour of the Grandees, and the People's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause; and this they obtained to their Satisfaction. <hi>John</hi> 7. 48.</p>
            <p>But while they exerted the Craft of Foxes, they did not forget to breathe forth the Cruelty of Wolves, in a malicious Aspersing the Person of Christ, and in a violent Opposing of the Truths, People and Power of his Religion. Yea, the most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and strict of them were the Ring-leaders of the Party: Witness <hi>Saul's</hi> Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Damascus,</hi> with Letters from the Chief-Priest, to bring bound to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> all that he could find of that Way. It's true the Pharisees did not proceed to violent Measures with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his Disciples just at first; but that was not owing to their good Nature, but their Policy; for they feared the People. They must keep the People in their Interests; Ay, that was the main Chance, the Compass that directed all their Proceedings; and therefore such fly cautious Methods must be pursued as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist herewith. They wanted to root vital Religion out of the World; but they found it beyond their Thumb.</p>
            <p>Although some of the old Pharisee-Shepherds had a very fair and strict Out-side; yet were they ignorant of the New-Birth: Witness Rabbi Nicodemus, who talk'd like a Fool about it. Hear, how our LORD cursed those plaister'd Hypocrites, Mat. 23. 27,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005070_0004_0F5F95DFE0EADD58"/>
28. <hi>Wo unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites; for ye are like whited Sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in full of dead Bones, and of all Uncleanness. Even so ye also appear righteous unto Men, but within ye are full of Hypocrisy and Iniquity.</hi> Ay, if they had but a little of the Learning then in Fashion, and a fair Out-side, they were presently put into the Priest's Office, though they had no Experience of the New-Birth. O sad!</p>
            <p>The old Pharisees, for all their long Prayers and other pious Pretences, had their Eyes, with <hi>Judas,</hi> fixed upon the Bag. Why, they came into the Priest's Office for a Piece of Bread; they took it up as a Trade, and therefore endeavoured to make the best Market of it they could. O Shame!</p>
            <p>It may be further observed, That the Pharisee-Teachers in Christ's Time, were great Bigots to small Matters in Religion. Mat. 23. 23. <hi>Wo unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites; for ye pay Tythe of Mint, and Anise, and Cummin, and have omitted the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and Faith.</hi> The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees were fired with a Party-Zeal; they compassed Sea and Land to make a Proselyte; and yet when he was made, they made him twofold more the Child of Hell than themselves. They were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so bigotted to human Inventions in religious Matters: <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, while he was a natural Man, was wonderful zealous for the Traditions of the Fathers: Ay, those poor blind Guides, as our LORD testifies, strained at a Gnat, and swallowed a Camel.</p>
            <p>And what a mighty Respect had they for the Sabbath-Day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth! insomuch that Christ and his Disciples must be charged with the Breach thereof, for doing Work; of Mercy and Necessity. Ah the Rottenness of these Hypocrites! It was not so much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Sabbath, as Malice against Christ, that was the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Charge: they wanted some plausible Pretence to offer against him in order to blacken his Character.</p>
            <p>And what a great Love had they in Pretence to those pious Prophets, who were dead before they were born? while in the mean Time they were persecuting the Prince of Prophets! Hear how the King of the Church speaks to them, upon this Head: Matth. 23. 29—33. <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites; because ye build the Tombs of the Prophets, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Isn't it a principal Part of the ordinary Call of GOD to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Work, to aim at the Glory of GOD, and, in Subordination thereto, the Good of Souls, as their chief Marks in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking that Work? And can any natural Man on Earth do this? No! no! Every Skin of them has an evil Eye; for no Cause can produce Effects above its own Power. Are not wicked Men forbid to meddle in Things sacred? Ps. 50. 16. <hi>But unto the Wicked, GOD saith, What hast thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou shouldst take my Covenant in thy Mouth?</hi> Now, are not all unconverted Men wicked Men? Does not the Lord JESUS inform us, <hi>John</hi> 10. 1. That <hi>he who entreth not by the Door into the Sheep-fold, but climbeth up some other Way, the same is a Thief and a Robber?</hi> In the 9<hi>th V.</hi> Christ tells us, That <hi>He is the Door;</hi> and that <hi>if any Man enter in by him, he shall be saved, by him,</hi> i.e. By Faith in him, (says <hi>Henry.</hi>) Hence we read of a <hi>

                  </gap> of Faith,</hi> being opened to the Gentiles. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. It confirms this Gloss, that Salvation is annexed to the Entrance before-mentioned. Remarkable is that Saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Follow me, and I will make you fishers of Men.</hi> See, our LORD will not make Men Ministers, 'till they follow him.

Our LORD repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Nicodemus</hi> for taking upon him the Office of instructing others, while he himself was a Stranger to the New Birth, <hi>John</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Art thou a Master of Israel, and knowest not these Things?</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> (in I <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12.) thanks GOD for counting him faithful, and putting him into the Ministry; which plainly supposes, That GOD Almighty does not send Pharisees and natural Men into the Ministry: For how can these Men be faithful, that have no Faith? It's true Men may put them into the Ministry, thro' Unfaithfulness, or Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; or Credit and Money may draw them, and the Devil may drive them into it, knowing by long Experience, of what special Service they may be to his Kingdom in that Office: But GOD sends no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Enmity that is put between the Seed of the Women &amp; the Seed of the Serpent, will now and then be creating Jarrs: And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for as it was of old, so it is now, <hi>He that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, and gilded with the specious Names of Zeal, Fidelity, Peace, good Order, and Unity.</p>
            <p>Natural Men, not having true Love to Christ and the Souls of their Fellow-Creatures, hence their Discourses are cold and sapless, and as it were freeze between their Lips. And not being sent of GOD, they want that divine Authority, with which the faithful Ambassadors of CHRIST are clothed, who herein resemble their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Master, of whom it is said, That <hi>He taught as one having Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not as the Scribes.</hi> Matth. 7. 29.</p>
            <p>And Pharisee-Teachers, having no Experience of a special Work of the Holy Ghost, upon their own Souls, are therefore neither inclined to, nor fitted for, Discoursing, frequently, clearly, and pathetically, upon such important Subjects. The Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Discourses, is either short, or indistinct and general. They difference not the Precious from the Vile, and divide not to every Man his Portion, according to the Apostolical Direction to <hi>Timothy.</hi> No! they carelesly offer a common Mess to their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and leave it to them, to divide it among themselves, as they see fit. This is indeed their general Practice, which is bad enough: But sometimes they do worse, by misapplying the Word, through Ignorance, or Anger. They often strengthen the Hands of the Wicked, by promising him Life. They comfort People, before they convince them; sow before they plow; and are busy in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Fabrick, before they lay a Foundation. These fooling Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders do but strengthen Men's carnal Security, by their soft, selfish, cowardly Discourses. They have not the Courage, or Honesty, to thrust the Nail of Terror into sleeping Souls; nay, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they strive with all their Might, to fasten Terror into the Hearts of the Righteous, and so to make those sad, whom GOD would not have made sad! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> this happens, when pious People

begin to suspect their Hypocrisy, for which they have good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. I may add, That inasmuch as Pharisee-Teachers seek after Righteousness as it were by the Works of the Law themselves, they therefore do not distinguish, as they ought, between <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> in their Discourses to others. They keep Driving, Driving, to Duty, Duty, under this Notion, That it will recommend natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men to the Favour of GOD, or entitle them to the Promises of Grace and Salvation: And thus those blind Guides fix a deluded World upon the false Foundation of their Own Righteousness; and so exclude them from the dear Redeemer. All the Doings of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Men, not proceeding from the Principles of Faith, Love, and a new Nature, nor being directed to the divine Glory as their highest End, but flowing from, and tending to Self, as their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and End; are doubtless damnably Wicked in their Manner of Performance, and do deserve the Wrath and Curse of a Sin-a-venging GOD; neither can any other Encouragement be justly given them, but this, That in the Way of Duty, there is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure or Probability of obtaining Mercy.</p>
            <p>And natural Men, wanting the Experience of those spiritual Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, which pious Souls are exposed to, in this Vale of Tears; they know not how to speak a Word to the Weary in Season. Their Prayers are also cold; little Child-like Love to God or Pity to poor perishing Souls, runs thro' their Veins. Their Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath nothing of the Savour of Christ, neither is it persum'd with the Spices of Heaven. They seem to make as little Distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Practice as Preaching. They love those Unbelievers that are kind to them, better than many Christians, and chuse them for Companions; contrary to <hi>Ps.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. 115. &amp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. Poor Christians are stunted and starv'd, who are put to seed on such bare Pastures, and such dry Nurses; as the Rev. Mr. <hi>Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi> justly calls them. It's only when the wise Virgins sleep, that they can bear with those dead Dogs, that can't bark; but when the LORD revives his People, they can't but abhor them.

                  </gap> are not called and sent of GOD into the Ministry.'</hi> And right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will inform us, how unfit Instruments they are to negotiate that Work they pretend to. Is a blind Man fit to be a Guide in a very dangerous Way? Is a dead Man fit to bring others to Life? a mad Man fit to give Counsel in a Matter of Life and Death? Is a possessed Man fit to cast out Devils? a Rebel, an Enemy to GOD, fit to be sent on an Embassy of Peace, to bring Rebels into a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Is'nt an unconverted Minister like a Man who would learn others to swim, before he has learned it himself, and so is drowned in the Act, and dies like a Fool?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I may add, That sad Experience verifies what has been now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, concerning the Unprofitableness of the Ministry of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Men. Look into the Congregations of unconverted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and see what a sad Security reigns there; not a Soul Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that can be heard of, for many Years together; and yet the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are easy; for they say they do their Duty! Ay, a small Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will satisfy us in the Want of that, which we have no great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire after. But when Persons have their Eyes opened, and their Hearts set upon the Work of God; they are not so soon satisfied with their Doings, and with Want of Success for a Time.

                  <hi>That those who speak about their Doings in the aforesaid Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, are like to do little Good to the Church of God.</hi>

                  <hi> But many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters (as Mr.</hi> Bracel <hi>observes) thinks the Gospel flourishes among them when the People are in Peace, and many come to hear the Word, and to the Sacrament.</hi>
               </q> If with the other they get the Salaries well paid; O then it is fine Times indeed! in their Opinion. O sad! And they are full of Hopes, that they do good, tho they know nothing about it. But what Comfort can a consciencious Man, who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in Birth, that Christ may be form'd in his Hearers Hearts, take from what he knows not?

Temptations. Indeed its a kind of Chance-medly, both in Respect of the Father, and his Children; when any such Event happens. And is'nt this the Reason, why a Work of Conviction and Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been so rarely heard of, for a long Time, in the Churches, till of late, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That the Bulk of her spiritual Guides, were stone-blind, and stone-dead?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Ministry of natural Men is dangerous, both in respect of the Doctrines, and Practice of Piety. The Doctrines of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, Justification by Faith alone,</hi> and the other Points of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinism,</hi> are very cross to the Grain of unrenew'd Nature. And tho' Men, by the Influence of a good Education, and Hopes of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may have the Edge of their natural <hi>Enmity</hi> against them blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet it's far from being broken or removed: It's only the saving Grace of GOD, that can give us a true Relish for those Nature-hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Doctrines; and so effectually secure us from being infected by the contrary. Is not the <hi>Carnality</hi> of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> one great Cause of the general Spread of <hi>Arminianism, Socinianism, Arianism,</hi> and <hi>Deism,</hi> at this Day through the World?</p>
            <p>And alas! what poor Guides are natural Ministers to those, who are under spiritual Trouble? they either slight such Distress altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and call it <hi>Melancholy,</hi> or <hi>Madness,</hi> or dawb those that are under it, with untemper'd Mortar. Our LORD assures us, That the Salt which hath lost its Savour, is good for nothing; some say, "<hi>It genders Worms and Vermine.</hi>" Now, what Savour have Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee-Ministers? In Truth, a very stinking One, both in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils of God and good Men. "<hi>Be these Moral Negroes never so white in the Mouth, (as One expresseth it) yet will they hinder, instead of helping others in at the strait Gate.</hi>" Hence is that Threatning of our LORD against them, Mat. 23. 13. <hi>Wo unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; for ye shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against Men; for ye nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go in yourselves, nor suffer those that are entering to go in.</hi> Pharisee Teachers will with the utmost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ate oppose the very Work of GOD's Spirit, upon the Souls of Men; and labour by all Means to blacken it, as well as the Instruments, which the ALMIGHTY improves to promote the same; if it comes near their Borders, and interferes with their Credit or Interest. Thus did the Pharisees deal with our Saviour.</p>
            <p>If it be objected against what has been offered, under this General Head of Discourse, That <hi>Judas</hi> was sent by Christ; I answer, (1) <hi>That</hi> Judas'<hi>s Ministry was partly Legal,</hi> inasmuch as during that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, the Disciples were subject to Jewish Observances, and sent <hi>

(2) Judas'<hi>s Ministry was extraordinary necessary,</hi> in order to fulfil some ancient Prophesies concerning him. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.16,17,18,20. <hi>John</hi> 13.18. I fear that the Abuse of this Instance, has bro't many <hi>Judases</hi> into the <hi>Ministry,</hi> whose chief Desire, like their great Grandfather, is to finger the Pence, and carry the Bag. But let such hireling mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Hypocrites take Care, that they don't feel the Force of a Halter in this World, and an aggravated Damnation in the next.</p>
            <p>Again, If it be objected, That <hi>Paul</hi> rejoiced, that the Gospel was preached, tho' of Contention, and not <hi>sincerely;</hi> I answer, The Expression signifies the Apostle's great Self-Denial. Some laboured to eclipse his Fame and Character, by contentious Preaching, thinking thereby to afflict him; but they were mistaken; as to that, he was easy: For he had long before learned, to die to his own Reputation. The Apostle's Rejoicing was comparative only: He would rather that CHRIST should be preached out of <hi>Envy,</hi> than not at all. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering the gross Ignorance of the Doctrinal Knowledge of the the Gospel, which prevailed almost <hi>universally</hi> in that Age of the World. Besides the Apostle knew that that Trial should be sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to him, to promote his spiritual Progress in Goodness, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps prove a Mean of procuring his temporal Freedom; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would rejoice. It is certain, we may both rejoice and mourn, in relation to the same Thing, upon different Accounts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Contradiction. But the</p>
            <p>Third general Head was to shew, <hi>How Pity should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed upon this mournful Occasion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Brethren,</hi> We should mourn over those, that are destitute of faithful Ministers, and sympathize with them. Our Bowels should be moved with the most compassionate Tenderness, over those dear fainting Souls, that are <hi>as Sheep having no Shepherd;</hi> and that after the Example of our blessed LORD.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir! we should also most <hi>earnestly pray</hi> for them, that the compassionate Saviour may preserve them, by his <hi>mighty</hi> Power, thro' Faith unto Salvation; support their sinking Spirits, under the <hi>melancholy Uneasinesses of a dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And more especially, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> we should pray to the LORD of the Harvest, to send forth faithful Labourers into his Harvest; seeing that the Harvest truly is plenteous, but the Labourers are few. And O Sirs! how humble, believing, and importunate should we be in this Petition! O! let us follow the LORD, Day and Night, with Cries, Tears, Pleadings and Groanings upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count! For GOD knows there is great <hi>Necessity</hi> of it. <hi>O! thou Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Mercy, and Father of Pity, pour forth upon thy poor Children a

Spirit of Prayer, for the Obtaining this important Mercy! Help, help, O Eternal GOD and Father, for Christ's sake!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> we should join our Endeavours to our <hi>Prayers.</hi> The most likely Method to stock the Church with a faithful <hi>Ministry,</hi>in the present Situation of Things, the publick Academies being so much corrupted and abused generally, is, To encourage private Schools, or Seminaries of Learning, which are under the Care of skilful and experienced Christians; in which those only should be admitted, who upon strict Examination, have in the Judgment of a reasonable <hi>Charity,</hi> the plain Evidences of experimental Religion. Pious and experienced Youths, who have a good natural Capacity, and great Desires after the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Work, from good Motives, might be sought for, and sound up and down in the <hi>Country,</hi> and put to Private Schools of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; especially in such Places, where the Publick ones are not. This Method, in my Opinion, has a <hi>noble Tendency,</hi> to build up the Church of God. And those who have any Love to Christ, or Desire after the Coming of his Kingdom, should be <hi>ready,</hi> according to their Ability, to give somewhat, from time to time, for the Support of such poor Youths, who have nothing of their own. And truly, Brethren, this <hi>Charity</hi> to the Souls of Men, is the most noble kind of <hi>Charity.</hi> O! if the Love of God be in you, it will constrain you to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to promote so noble and necessary a Work. It looks Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite-like to go no further, when other Things are required, than <hi>cheap Prayer.</hi> Don't think it much, if the Pharisees should be offended at such a Proposal; these subtle selfish Hypocrites are wont to be sear'd about their Credit, and their Kingdom; and truly they are both little worth, for all the Bustle they make about them. If they could help it, they wo'dn't let one faithful Man come into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry; and therefore their Opposition is an encouraging Sign.

            <p>THE IMPROVEMENT of this Subject remains. And</p>
            <p>I. If it be so, That the Case of those, who have no other, or no better than Pharisee-Teachers, is to be pitied: Then what a Scrole &amp; Scene of Mourning, and Lamentation, and Wo, is opened! because of the Swarms of Locusts, the Crowds of Pharisees, that have as <hi>covetously</hi> as <hi>cruelly,</hi> crept into the Ministry, in this adulterous Generation! who as nearly resemble the Character given of the old Pharisees, in the Doctrinal Part of this Discourse, as one Crow's Egg does another. It is true some of the modern Pharisees have learned to prate a little more <hi>orthodoxly</hi> about the New Birth, than their Predecessor <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> who are, in the mean Time, as great Strangers to the feeling Experience of it, as he. They are blind who see not this to be the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005070_0012_0F5F95E6B035CFE8"/>
Case of the Body of the Clergy, of this Generation. And O! that our Heads were Waters, and our Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that we could <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> lament, with the utmost Bitterness, the doleful Case of the poor Church of God, upon this account.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From what has been said, we may learn, That such who are contented under a <hi>dead Ministry,</hi> have not in them the Temper of that Saviour they profess. It's an awful Sign, that they are as blind as Moles, and as dead as Stones, without any spiritual Taste and Relish. And alas! isn't this the Case of Multitudes? If they can get one, that has the Name of a Minister, with a Band, and a black Coat or Gown to carry on a <hi>Sabbath-days</hi> among them, although never so coldly, and <hi>insuccessfully;</hi> if he is free from gross Crimes in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and takes good Care to keep at a due Distance from their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and is never troubled about his Insuccessfulness; O! think the poor Fools, that is a fine Man indeed; our Minister is a prudent charitable Man, he is not always harping upon Terror, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Ay, our Minister, honest Man, gives us good Caution against it. Poor silly Souls! consider <hi>seriously</hi> these Passages, of the Prophet, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 5.30,31.</p>

            <p n="4">4. If the Ministry of natural Men be as it has been represented; Then it is both lawful and expedient to go from them to hear Godly Persons; yea, it's so far from being sinful to do this, that one who lives under a pious Minister of lesser Gifts, after having honestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to get Benefit by his Ministry, and yet gets little or none, but doth find real Benefit and more Benefit elsewhere; I say, he may <hi>lawfully</hi> go, and that <hi>frequently,</hi> where he gets most Good to his precious Soul, after regular Application to the Pastor where he lives, for his Consent, and proposing the Reasons thereof; when this is done in the Spirit of Love and Meekness, without Contempt of any, as also without rash <hi>Anger</hi> or vain <hi>Curiosity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Natural Reason will inform us, that Good is desireable for its own sake. Now, as Dr. <hi>Voetius</hi> observes, Good added to Good, makes it a greater Good, and so more desireable; and therefore Evil as Evil, or a lesser Good, which is comparatively Evil, cannot be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Desire.</p>
            <p>There is a natural Instinct put even into the irrational Creature, by the Author of their Being, to seek after the greater natural Good, as
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005070_0013_0F5F95E7B1C09280"/>
far as they know it. Hence the Birds of the Air fly to the warmer Climates, in order to shun the Winter-Cold, and also doubtless to get better Food; <hi>For where the Carcass is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> The Beasts of the Field seek the best Pastures, and the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>hes of the Ocean seek after the Food they like best.</p>
            <p>But the written Word of God confirms the aforesaid Proposition, while God by it enjoins us, <hi>to covet earnestly the best Gifts;</hi> as also <hi>to prove all Things, and hold fast that which is good.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 31. 1 Thess. 5. 2. And is it not the Command of God, that we should <hi>grow in Grace?</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. and 1 Pet. 2. 2. Now, does not every positive Command enjoin the Use of such Means, as have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectest Tendency to answer the End designed? namely, <hi>The Duty commanded.</hi> If there be a Variety of Means, is not the best to be chosen? else how can the Choice be called rational, and becoming an intelligent Creature? To ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the common Practice of all the rational Creation, about Things of far less Moment and Consequence?</p>
            <p>That there is a Difference and Variety in Preachers Gifts and Graces, is <hi>undeniably</hi> evident, from the united Testimony of Scripture and Reason.</p>
            <p>And that there is a great Difference in the Degrees of Hearers Edification, under the Hearing of these different Gifts, is as evident to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of experienced Christians, as any Thing can be to Sight.</p>
            <p>It is also an unquestionable Truth, that <hi>ordinarily</hi> GOD blesses most the best Gifts, for the Hearers Edification, as by the best Food he gives the best Nourishment. Otherwise the best Gifts would not be desireable, and GOD <hi>Almighty</hi> in the ordinary Course of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by not acting according to the Nature of Things, would be carrying on a Series of unnecessary Miracles; which to suppose, is unreasonable. The following Places of holy Scripture, confirm what hath been last observed. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14, 15, 16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. &amp; <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 24.</p>
            <p>If God's People have a Right to the Gifts of all God's Ministers, <hi>pray, why mayn't they use them, as they have Opportunity?</hi> And if they should go a few Miles farther than ordinary, to enjoy those, which they profit most by; who do they wrong? Now, our LORD does inform his People, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. That <hi>whether Paul, or Apollos, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Besides it is an unscriptural Infringment on Christian Liberty; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. It's a Yoke worse than that of <hi>Rome</hi> itself. Dr. <hi>Voetius</hi> asserts, <q>
                  <hi>That even among the</hi> Papists, <hi>as to hearing of Sermons, the People are not depriv'd of the Liberty of Choice.</hi>
               </q> It's a Yoke like that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which cruel <hi>Pharaoh</hi> formed for the Necks of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed <hi>Israelites,</hi> when he obliged them to make up their stated Task of Brick, but allowed them no Straw. So we must grow in Grace and Knowledge; but in the mean Time, according to the Notion of some, we are confined from using the likeliest Means, to attain that End.</p>
            <p>If the great Ends of Hearing may be attained as well, and better, by Hearing of another Minister than our own; then I see not, why we should be under a fatal Necessity of hearing him, I mean our Parish-Minister, perpetually, or generally. Now, what are, or ought to be, the Ends of Hearing, but the Getting of Grace, and Growing in it? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>As Babes desire the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ere Milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> (Poor Babes like not dry Breasts, and living Men like not dead Pools.) Well then, and may not these Ends be obtained out of our Parish-line? <hi>Faith</hi> is said to come by <hi>Hearing,</hi> Rom. 10. But the Apostle doesn't add, <hi>Your Parish-Minister.</hi> Isn't the same Word preach'd out of our Parish? and is there any Restriction in the Promises of blessing the Word to those only, who keep within their Parish-line ordinarily? If there be, I have not yet met with it; yea, I can affirm, that so far as Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge can be had in such Cases, I have known Persons to get saving Good to their Souls, by Hearing over their Parish-line; and this makes me earnest in Defence of it.</p>
            <p>That which ought to be the main Motive of Hearing any, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> our Souls Good, or greater Good, will excite us, if we regard our own eternal Interest, to hear there, where we attain it; and he that hears with less Views, acts like a Fool, and a Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>Now, if it be lawful to withdraw from the Ministry of a pious Man, in the Case aforesaid; how much more, from the Ministry of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man? Surely, it is both lawful and expedient, for the Reasons offered in the Doctrinal Part of this Discourse: To which let me add a few Words more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005070_0015_0F5F95E8DD1897D8"/>To trust the Care of our Souls to those who have little or no Care for their own, to those who are both unskilful and unfaithful, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common Practice of considerate Mankind, relating to the Affairs of their Bodies and Estates; and would signify, that we set light by our Souls, and did not care what became of them. For if the Blind lead the Blind, will they not both fall into the Ditch?</p>
            <p>Is it a strange Thing to think, that GOD does not ordinarily use the Ministry of his Enemies, to turn others to be his Friends, seeing he works by suitable Means?</p>
            <p>I cannot think, that GOD has given any Promise, that he will be with, and bless the Labours of natural Ministers: For if he had, he would be surely as good as his Word. But I can neither see, nor hear of any Blessing upon these Men's Labours; unless it be a rare wonderful Instance of Chancemedly! whereas the Ministry of faithful Men blossoms and bears Fruit, as the Rod of <hi>Aaron.</hi> Jer. 23. 22. <hi>But if they had stood in my Counsel, and had caused my People to hear my Words, then they should have turned them from their evil Way, and from the Evil of their Doings.</hi>

               <q>
                  <hi>That sitting in</hi> Moses' <hi>Chair, signifies a Succeeding of</hi> Moses <hi>in the ordinary Part of his Office and Authority; so did</hi> Joshua, <hi>and the 70 Elders,</hi> Exod. 18.21—26. <hi>Now,</hi> Moses <hi>was no Priest, (say they) tho' of</hi> Levi's <hi>Tribe, but king in</hi> Jeshurun, <hi>a civil Ruler and Judge, chosen by God.</hi> Exod. 18.13.</q> Therefore no more is meant by the Scripture in the Objection, but that it is the Duty of People to hear and obey the lawful Commands of the Civil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>

Meekness, and Humility, is not the proper <hi>Cause</hi> of those Divisions, but the <hi>Occasion</hi> only, or the Cause by Accident, and not by itself. If a Person exercising Modesty and Love in his Carriage to his Minister and Neighbours, thro' Uprightness of Heart, designing nothing but his own greater Good, repairs there frequently where he attains it; is this any reasonable Cause of Anger? will any be offended with him because he loves his soul, and seeks the greater Good thereof, and is not like a senseless Stone, without Choice, Sense, and Taste? Pray must we leave off every Duty, that is the Occasion of Contention or Division? Then we must quit powerful Religion altogether. For <hi>he that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer Persecution.</hi> And parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly we must carefully avoid faithful Preaching: For that is won't to occasion Disturbances and Divisions, especially when accompanied with divine Power. 1 Thess. 1.5,6. <hi>Our Gospel came not unto you in Word only, but in Power:</hi> And then it is added, That they <hi>received the Word in much Affliction.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 9. That a great Door and effectual was open'd unto him, and that their were many Adversaries. Blessed <hi>Paul</hi> was accounted a common Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turber of the Peace, as well as <hi>Elijah</hi> long before him: And yet he left not off Preaching for all that. Yea, our blessed LORD informs us, That he came not to send Peace on Earth, but rather a Sword, Var<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Fire, and Division, and that even among Relations. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34,35,36. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.49,51,52,53. As also, That while the strong Men armed keeps the House, all the Goods are in Peace. It is true the Power of the Gospel is not the proper Cause of those Divisions, but the innocent Occasion only: No; the proper Cause of sinful Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is that Enmity against GOD, and Holiness, which is in the Hearts of natural Men, of every Order; being stirred up by the Devil, and their own proud and selfish Lusts. And very often natural Men, who are the proper Causes of the Divisions aforesaid, are won't to deal with God's Servants, as <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Wife did by <hi>Joseph;</hi> they lay all the Blame of their own Wickedness at their Doors, and make a loud Cry!</p>
            <p>Such as confine Opposition and Division, as following upon liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Godliness and successful Preaching, to the first Ages of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; it is much to be fear'd neither know themselves, nor the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Christ. For surely the nature of true Religion, as well as of Men and Devils, is the same in every Age.</p>
            <p>Is not the visible Church composed of Persons of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Characters? While some are sincere Servants of God, are not many Servants of Satan, under a religious Mask? and have not these a fixed Enmity against the other? How is it then possible, that a Harmony should subsist between such, till their Nature be changed? Can Light dwell with Darkness?</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly it is a great Duty, to avoid giving just Cause of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005070_0017_0F5F95EC078F5938"/>
to any; and it is also highly necessary, that pious Souls should maintain Union and Harmony among themselves; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their different Opinions in lesser Things. And no doubt this is the Drift of the many Exhortations which we have to Peace and Unity in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Surely, it cannot be reasonably suppos'd, that we are exhorted, to a Unity in any Thing that is wicked, or inconsistent with the Good, or greater Good of our poor Souls: For that would be like the Unity of the Devils, a Legion of which dwelt peaceably in one Man: Or like the Unity of <hi>Ahab's</hi> false Prophets; all these four Hundred Daubers were very peaceable and much united, and all harped on the pleasing String: Ay, they were moderate Men, and had the Majority on their Side.</p>
            <p>But possibly some may again object against Persons going to hear others, besides their own Ministers; the Scripture about <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 12. and say, that it is carnal. Dr. <hi>Voetius</hi> answers the aforesaid Objection, as follows: <q>The Apostle reproves (<hi>says he</hi>) such as made Sects, saying, <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollos</hi>—and we with him reprove them. But this is far from being against the Choice, which one hath of Sermons and Preachers; seeing at one time we cannot hear all, neither doth the Explication and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, equally suit such a Person, in such a Time, or Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or equally quicken, and subserve the Encrease of Knowledge.</q> Thus far he.</p>
            <p>Because that the Apostle, in the aforesaid Place, reproves an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Love to, or Admiration of particular Ministers, accompanied with a sinful Contention, Slighting and Disdaining of others, who are truly godly, and with Sect-making: To say that from hence it necessarily follows, That we must make no Difference in our Choice, or in the Degrees of our Esteem of different Ministers, according to their Different Gifts and Graces; is an Argument of as great Force, as to say, Because Gluttony &amp; Drunkenness are forbidden, therefore we must neither eat nor drink, or make any Choice in Drinks or Victuals, let our Constitution be what it will.</p>
            <p>Surely the very Nature of Christian Love inclines those that are possessed of it, to love others chiefly for their Goodness, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Proportion thereto. Now, seeing the Inference in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is secretly built upon this Supposition, That we should love all good Men alike; it strikes at the Foundation of that Love to the Brethren, which is laid down in Scripture, as a Mark of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. and so is carnal, with a Witness.</p>
            <p>Again it may be objected, That the aforesaid Practice tends to grieve our Parish-Minister, and to break Congregations in Pieces.</p>
            <p>I answer, If our Parish-Minister be grieved at our greater Good,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005070_0018_0F5F95ECB8AF5A40"/>
or prefers his Credit before it; then he has good Cause to grieve over his own Rottenness, and Hypocrisie. And as for Breaking of Congregations to Pieces, upon the Account of People's Going from Place to Place, to hear the Word, with a View to get greater Good; that spiritual Blindness and Death, that so generally prevails, will put this out of Danger. It is but a very few, that have got any spiritual Relish; the most will venture their Souls with any Formalist, and be well satisfied with the sapless Discourses of such dead Drones.</p>
            <p>Well, does'nt the Apostle assert, That <hi>Paul and Apollos are nothing?</hi> Yes, it is true, they &amp; all others are nothing as Efficient Causes; they could not change Men's Hearts. But were they nothing as Instruments? The Objection insinuates one of these two Things, either that there is no Difference in Means, as to their suitableness; or that there is no Reason to expect a greater Blessing upon the most suitable Means: Both which are equally absurd, and before confuted.</p>
            <p>But it may be further objected, with great Appearance of Zeal, That what has been said about People's Getting of Good, or greater Good, over their Parish-line, is a meer Fiction; for they are out of God's Way.</p>
            <p>I answer, That there are Three monstrous ingredients in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, namely, A Begging of the Question in Debate, rash Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Limiting of God.</p>
            <p>It is a mean Thing in Reasoning, to beg or suppose that, which should be prov'd and then to reason from it. Let it be prov'd, that they are out of God's Way; and then I will freely yield: But till this be done, bold Saysoes will not have much Weight with any but Dupes or Dunces. And for such who cry out against others for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness, to be guilty of it themselves in the mean time in a very great Degree, is very inconsistent. Isn't it rash to judge of Things they have never heard? But those that have received Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and are sensible of their own Uprightness, they will think it a light Thing, to be judged of Man's judgment. Let <hi>Tertullus</hi> ascend the Theatre, and gild the Octjection with the most mellifluous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceronean Eloquence; it will no more perswade them, that what they have felt is but a Fancy (unless they be under strong Temptations of Satan, or scared out of their Wits by frightful Expressions) than to tell a Man, in proper Language, that sees, That it is but a Notion, he does not see: Or to tell a Man that feels Pleasure or Pain, That it's but a deluded Fancy; they are quite mistaken.</p>

            <p>I would conclude my present Meditations upon this Subject, by Exhorting.</p>
            <p>All those who enjoy a faithful Ministry, to a speedy and sincere Improvement of so rare and valuable a Privilege; left by their foolish Ingratitude the Righteous GOD be provok'd, to remove the Means they enjoy, or his Blessing from them, and so at last to expose them in another State to Enduring and greater Miseries. For surely, these Sins which are committed against greater Light and Mercy, are more presumptuous, ungrateful, and inexcusable; there is in them a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Contempt of GOD's Authority, and Slight of his Mercy; those Evils do awfully violate the Conscience, and declare a Love to Sin as Sin; such Transgressors do rush upon the Bosses of GOD's Buckler, they court Destruction without a Covering, and embrace their own Ruin with open Arms. And therefore according to the Nature of Justice, which proportions Sinners Pains, according to the Number and Heinousness of their Crimes, and the Declaration of Divine Truth, you must expect an enflamed Damnation: Surely, it shall be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> in the Day of the LORD, than for you, except ye repent.</p>
            <p>And let gracious Souls be exhorted, to express the most tender Pity over such as have none but Pharisee-Teachers; and that in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before described: To which let the Example of our LORD in the Text before us, be an inducing and effectual Incitement; as well as the gracious and immense Rewards, which follow upon so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and noble a Charity, in this and the next State.</p>
            <p>And let those who live under the Ministry of dead Men, whether they have got the Form of Religion or not, repair to the Living, where they may be edified. Let who will, oppose it. What famous Mr. <hi>Jenner</hi> observes upon this Head, is most just, <q>
                  <hi>That if there be any godly Soul, or any that desires the Salvation of his Soul, and lives under a blind Guide, he cannot go out (of his Parish) without giving very great Offence; it will be tho't a Giddiness, and a Slighting of his own Minister at home.—When People came out of every Parish round about, to</hi> John, <hi>no Question but this bred Heart burning against</hi> John, <hi>ay, and Ill-will against those People, that would not be satisfied with that Teaching they had in their own Synagogues.</hi>
