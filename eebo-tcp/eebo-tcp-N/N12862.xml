            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTUTE and TREATMENT OF JOHN DODGE, By the ENGLISH at DETROIT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Some time ſince left the place of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in Connecticut, and, in the year 1770, ſettled in Sanduſky, an Indian village, about half way between Pitſburg and Detroit, where I carried on a very beneficial trade with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, till the unhappy Diſpute between Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and America reached thoſe pathleſs wilds, and rouſed to war Savages no ways intereſted in it.</p>
            <p>In July, 1775, Captain James Woods called at my houſe in his way to the different Indian towns, where he was going to invite them, in the name of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, to a treaty to be held at Fort Pitt the enſuing fall; I attended him to their villages, and the Savages promiſed him they would be there. Capt Woods alſo invited me to go with the Indians to the treaty, as they were in want of an interpreter, which I readily agreed to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:016262_0003_0F9BD0FBC489C610"/>Soon after the departure of Capt. Woods, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of Fort Detroit ſent for the Savages in and about Sanduſky, and told them that he heard they were invited by the Americans to a treaty at Pittſburg, which they told him was true; on which he delivered them a talk to the following purport: "That he was their father, and as ſuch he would adviſe them as his own children; that the Coloniſts who were to meet them at Pittſburgh were a bad people, that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of their Protector, they had grown a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſaucy people; that the great King nor think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would have the aſſurance to oppoſe his ju<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> laws, had kept but few troops in America for ſome years paſt; that thoſe men being ignorant of their in capacity to go through with what they intend, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to cut off the few regulars in this country, and then you indians, and have all America to themſelves; and all they want is, under the ſhew of friendſhip, to get you into their hands as hoſtages, and there hold you, till your nations ſhall comply with their terms, which if they refuſe, you will be all maſſacred. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not go by any means; but if you will join me, and keep them at bay a little while, the King, our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will ſend large fleets and armies to our aſſiſtance, and we will ſoon ſubdue them, and have their planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>This talk ſo diſmayed the Indians, that they came to me and ſaid they would not go to the treaty, at the ſame time telling me what the Governor of Detroit had ſaid to them On this Mr. James Heron and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, having the cauſe of our country at heart, aſſerted that what the Governor had ſaid was falſe, and told them that the Coloniſts would not hurt a hair of their heads, and if they would go to the treaty, that I, with Mr. Heron, would be ſecurity, and pledge our proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the amount of 4000 l. for their ſafe return. This,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016262_0004_0F9BD0FBDE251250"/>
with the arrival of Mr. Richard Butler with freſh invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, induced ſome of them to go with me to the treaty.</p>
            <p>In the fall I attended a number of them to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where we were politely received by the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſent by Congreſs. The council commenced; the Indians, who are always fond of fiſhing in troubled water, offered their aſſiſtance, which was refuſed, with a requeſt that they would remain in peace, and not take up the hatchet on either ſide. On the whole, theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were well pleaſed with the talk from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and promiſed to remain quiet.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners thinking it proper, ſent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental belt and talk by ſome of the Chiefs to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages who reſided about the lakes. Theſe Chiefs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to paſs Sanduſky in their rout, Mr. John Gibſon, Agent for Indian affairs, requeſted me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them, and furniſh them with what they ſtood in need of; on which I took them home.</p>
            <p>On my arrival at the village I found the ſavages in confuſion, and preparing for war, on which I called a council and rehearſed the Continental talk, which, with a preſent of goods to the amount of twenty-five pounds, quieted them. This I informed Congreſs of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their requeſt, by expreſs, and that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Detroit was ſtill urging the Indians to war.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, a party of Savages from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the lakes, came to my houſe on their way to the frontiers to ſtrike a blow; I aſked them the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they took up the hatchet; they replied, that the Governor of Detroit had told them, that the Americans were going to murder them all and take their lands; but if they would join him, they would be able to drive them off, and that he would give them twenty dollars a ſcalp. On this I rehearſed the Continental talk, and making them a ſmall preſent they returned home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016262_0005_0F9BD0FCF9F2C720"/>
as I had told them, that the Governor was a liar and meant to deceive them.</p>
            <p>On this I thought proper to write the Governor of Detroit, what he was to expect ſhould he continue to perſuade the Indians to take up the hatchet. He was ſo enraged at the receipt of this letter, that he offered 100l. for my ſcalp or body; he ſent out ſeveral parties to take me without effect, till having ſpread an evil report of me among the Indians, on the 15th of Jan. 1776, my houſe was ſurrounded by about 20 ſoldiers and ſavages, who broke into the houſe, made me a priſoner, and then marched me for Detroit.</p>
            <p>It was about the duſk of the evening when, after a fatiguing march, I arrived at Detroit, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before Henry Hamilton, late a captain in the 15th regt. but now Governor and Commandant of Detroit; he ordered me to cloſe confinement, telling me to ſpend that night in making my peace with God, as it was the laſt night I ſhould live; I was then hurried to a loathſome dungeon, ironed and thrown in with three cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, being allowed neither bedding, ſtraw, or fire, although it was in the depth of Winter, and ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, that my toes were froze before morning.</p>
            <p>About 10 o'clock the next morning, I was taken out and carried before the Governor, who produced a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of letters with my name ſigned to them, and aſked me if they were my hand writing? to which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, they were not; he then ſaid, it was a matter of indifference to him whether I owned it or not, as he underſtood that I had been carrying on a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with Congreſs, taking the Savages to their treaties, and preventing their taking up the hatchet in favour of his majeſty, to defend his crown and dignity; that I was a rebel and traitor, and he would hang me. I aſked him whether he intended to try me by the civil or military law, or give me any trial at all? to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016262_0006_0F9BD0FD4B2F9A08"/>
which he replied, that he was not obliged to give any damn'd a rebel trial unleſs he thought proper, that he would hang every one he caught, and that he would begin with me firſt. I told him if he took my life, to beware of the conſequence, as he might depend on it that it would be looked into. What, ſays he, do you threaten me you damn'd rebel, I will ſoon alter your tone, here take the damn'd rebel to the dungeon again, and let him pray to God to have mercy on his ſoul, for I will ſoon fix his body between heaven and earth, and every ſcoundrel like him.</p>
            <p>I was then re-delivered to the hands of Philip De Jeane, who acted in the capacity of judge, ſheriff, and jailor, and carried back to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> dungeon, where I was ſoon waited on by the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to read prayers with me; but it was ſo extreem<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, he could not ſtand it but a few minutes at a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. In converſation with him, I told him I thought it was very hard to looſe my life without a trial, as I was innocent of the charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt me; he ſaid it was very true, but that the Governor had charged him not to give me the leaſt hopes of life, as he would abſolutely hang me.</p>
            <p>I remained in this diſmal ſituation three days, when De Jeane came and took out one of the criminals who were in the dungeon with me, and held a ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him, then came and told me, the govenor had ſent him to tell me to prepare for another world, as I had not long to live, and then withdrew. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the criminal, who was a Frenchman, what De Jeane wanted with him, but he would not tell me.</p>
            <p>The evening following he told his brother in diſtreſs, that De Jeane had offered him 20l. to hang Mr. Dodge (meaning me) but that he had refuſed unleſs he had his liberty; De Jeane then ſaid, that we ſhould both be ſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot under the gallows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:016262_0007_0F9BD0FE0BF5AD10"/>Being at laſt drove almoſt to deſpair, I told De Jeane to inform the Governor I was readier to die at that time than I ſhould ever be, and that I would much rather undergo his ſentence, than be tortured in the dreadful manner I then was; he returned for anſwer, that I need not hurry them, but prepare myſelf, as I ſhould not know my time till half an hour before I was turned off.</p>
            <p>Thus did I languiſh on in my dungeon, without a friend being allowed to viſit me, denied the neceſſaries of life, and muſt have periſhed with the cold, it being in the depth of Winter, had not my fellow priſoners ſpared me a blanket from their ſcanty ſtock. Thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the leaſt comfort in life, together with the unjuſt and ſavage threatning I received every day, brought me ſo very low, that my inability to anſwer De Jeane's unreaſonable queſtions, with which he daily tormented me reſpecting innocent men, obliged him to notice my ſituation, and no doubt thinking I ſhould die in their hands, they thought proper to remove me to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks, and ordered a Doctor to attend me. The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been ſo extreem cold, and my legs had been bolted in ſuch a manner, that they were ſo benumbed and the ſinews contracted, that I had not the leaſt uſe of them; and the ſeverity of my uſage had brought on a fever, which had nigh ſaved them any further troubel.</p>
            <p>After I had lain ſome time ill, and my recovery was diſpaired of, De Jeane called and told me that the Governor had altered his mind with reſpect to executing me, and bid me be of good cheer, as he believed the Governor would give me my liberty when I got better; I replied, that it was a matter of indifference to me whether he gave me my liberty or not, as I had much rather die than remain at their mercy; on which, he ſaid, 'You may die and be damn'd', and bounced out of the room.</p>
            <p>

               </gap> being afraid I ſhould inform her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of her tricks in his abſence, told the Govenor that I was going <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>On this information, De Jeane came and told me to get up and walk to the dungeon, from whence I came; I told him I was unable, <q>Crawl then, you damn'd rebel, or I will make you</q>; I told him he might do as he pleaſed, but I could not ſtand, much more walks on this he called a party of ſoldiers, who toſſed me into a cart and carried me to the Dungeon: here, by the perſuation of the Doctor, who was very kind and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, I was allowed a bed and not ironed. By his care and the weather growing milder, I got rid of my fever and began to walk about my dungeon, which was only eight feet ſquare; but even this was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure too great for me to enjoy long, for in a few days was put into irons. The weather now growing warm and the place offenſive, from the filth of the poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows I had left there, and who were afterwards exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, I relapſed. By perſuation of the Doctor, who told them unleſs I had air I ſhould die, a hole, about ſeven inches ſquare, was cut to let in ſome air.</p>
            <p>I remained ill till June, altho' the Doctor had done all that lay in his power; he then let the Governor know, that it was impoſſible for me to recover unleſs I was removed from the dungeon, on which he ſent De Jeane to inform me, if I would give ſecurity for my good behaviour, that he would let me out of priſon. Being, by my uſage and fever, reduced to a ſtate of deſpondence, I told him that it was a matter of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence what he did with me, and that his abſence was bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter

            <p>ON my going abroad, I learned that all the property I left in the woods, to the amount of 15 or 1600 l. was taken in the King's name, and divided among the Indians. As I had but little to attend to but the recovery of my health, I mended apace. As ſoon as I could walk abroad, Gov. Hamilton ſent for me and ſaid, he was ſorry for my misfortunes, and hoped I would think as little as poſſible of them; that as I was in a low ſtate, he thought I had beſt not think of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or think of what I had left, as he would lend me a hand to recover my loſſes. This ſmooth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe gave me but little ſatisfaction for the ill uſage I had received at his hands; however, I was determined to reſt as eaſy as I could, till I had an opportunity of obtaining redreſs.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I found myſelf ſo far recovered as to be able to do buſineſs, which was in September, I applied to the Governor to go down the country, but he put me off with fine words, a permiſſion to do buſineſs there, and a promiſe of his aſſiſtance. I now ſettled my accounts with the perſons with whom I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected in trade, and found myſelf 700 l. in debt. My credit being pretty good, I ſet up a retail ſtore, and as many of the inhabitants pitied my caſe, they all ſeemed willing to ſpend their money with me. My being maſter of the different Indian languges, about De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit was alſo of ſervice to me, ſo that in a ſhort time I paid off all my debts, and began to add to my ſtock.</p>
            <p>In the ſpring of 1777, I heard there was like to be a good trade at Machilimakanac, on which I applied
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016262_0010_0F9BD100696555F8"/>
to the Governor, and, with a great deal of trouble, got a paſs, went, and met with good trade. On my return Gov. Hamilton, by ſeveral low arts, attempted to <hi>pick</hi> my cargo, which as it would ſpoil the ſale of the remainder, I could not allow. As he had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for taking them from me by force, it once more provoked him to wrath againſt me; he greatly retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſales by denying me a permit to draw my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of the magazine; alſo ordered myſelf and two ſervants to be ready at a moment's warning to march under Capt. Le Mote on a ſcouting party with Savages: I told him it was againſt my inclination to take up arms againſt my own fleſh and blood, and much more ſo to go with Savages to butcher and ſcalp defenceleſs women and children, that were not intereſted in the preſent diſpute: He ſaid it was not any of my buſineſs whether they were intereſted in the diſpute or not; and added if you are not ready when called for, I will fix you. Lucky for me he was ſoon after called down the country, and ſucceeded by Capt. Mount-preſent as commander, who ordered Le Mote to ſtrike my name out of his books; but my ſervants with their pay, I loſt entirely.</p>
            <p>The party of Savages under Le Mote went out with orders not to ſpare man, woman, or child. To this cruel mandate even ſome of the Savages made an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, reſpecting the butchering the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but they were told the children would make ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and the women would keep up the ſtock.— Thoſe ſons of Britain offered no reward for Priſoners, but they gave the Indians twenty dollars a ſcalp, by which means they induced the Savages to make the poor inhabitants, who they had torn from their peaceable homes, carry their baggage till within a ſhort diſtance of the fort, where, in cold blood, they murdered them, and delivered their green ſcalps in a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016262_0011_0F9BD102DBB4F4E0"/>
few hours after to thoſe Britiſh barbarians, who, on the firſt yell of the Savages, flew to meet and hug them to their breaſts reeking with the blood of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and ſhewed them every mark of joy and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, by firing of cannon, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>One of theſe parties returning with a number of women and children's ſcalps, and three priſoners, they were met by the Commander of the fort, and after the uſual demonſtrations of joy, delivered their ſcalps, for which they were paid; the Indians then made the Commandant a preſent of two of the priſoners, reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the third as a ſacrifice to the manes of one of them that had fell in the expedition. Being ſhocked at the idea of one of my fellow creatures being tortured and burnt alive by thoſe inhuman Savages, I ſought out the Indian who had loſt his relative, and to whom, according to the Indian cuſtom, this unhappy man belonged; I found him, took him home with me, and by the aſſiſtance of ſome of my friends, and twenty-five pounds worth of goods, I perſuaded the inhuman wretch to ſell his life to me. As the reſt of the gang had taken the priſoner about two leagues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and were making merry over him, we were obliged to lay a ſcheme to deliver him from their hands, which we did in the following manner,—It being midnight and very dark, the Indian, myſelf, and two ſervants, croſſed the river in a batteaux to where they were carouſing around this unhappy vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim. The Indian then went to his companions, and under pretence of taking the priſoner out to anſwer a call of nature, he delivered him to me who lay at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and I carried him to the batteaux. As ſoon as he found himſelf in the hands of his deliverer, his tranſport was too great for his tender frame; three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times he ſunk lifeleſs in my arms, and as often, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> joy. None but thoſe who have experienced it, can have an idea of the thoughts that muſt have agitated the breaſt of a man, who but a few minutes before ſaw himſelf ſurrounded by Savages, whoſe diſmal yell, and frightful figures, heightened by the glare of a large fire in a diſmal wood, which muſt have harrowed up the ſoul of an unintereſted byſtander, much more of one who knew that very fire was prepared for his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that every moment the executioner was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to arrive.—The executioner arrives; he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards him; he looſens this unhappy victim from the tree to which he was bound, no doubt, as this young man imagined, to be led to the ſtake; but as it were in an inſtant, he finds himſelf in the hands of his deliverer and fellow-countryman. This, as I ſaid before, was too much for him to bear; however I got his almoſt lifeleſs corpſe to my houſe, where I kept him hid. The Indian, according to our agreement, in an hour or two after I was gone, returned ſeemingly much fatigued, and told his fellow Savages, who were impatiently waiting to begin their brutal ſacrifice, that the priſoner had eſcaped, and that he had in vain purſued him.</p>
            <p>Some time after this I found an opportunity, and made an agreement with the Captain of a veſſel going to Michilimakanac, to take my unhappy inmate with him, but one of my ſervants being tempted, by a large reward that was offered for retaking the above pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, informed De Jeane that he was hid in my houſe, on which my habitation was ſoon ſurrounded by a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſoldiers under the command of ſaid De Jeane, and myſelf, the young man and four ſervants were made priſoners, and having demanded my keys, which I delivered, we were hurried to goal and confined in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent rooms. Here this unhappy young fellow, in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016262_0013_0F9BD108F36A3F28"/>
high expectations of ſeeing his friends, was once more plunged into the horrors of impriſonment.</p>
            <p>I was ſent for and carried before the Commandant, where, on being examined who was the perſon in my houſe, I frankly told him it was a young man whom I had bought of the Indians when they were going to burn him, and that I meant to ſend him to Canada to be out of the way of the Savages, but De Jeane, like other men of bad principles, thinking no man could do a good action without ſiniſter views, ſaid that he believed I had purchaſed him to ſerve my own ends, and that he would find them out, which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant ordered him to do as ſoon as poſſible, and I was ordered to priſon.</p>
            <p>De Jeane then took my ſervant, who was his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant, ironed him, put him in the dungeon, and, after keeping him three days on bread and water, the lad almoſt frightened out of his ſenſes, ſent for De Jeane, and told him that the day before I was taken up I had wrote ſeveral letters, and, on his bringing a candle to ſeal them, that I ſaid, if he told any one that I was writing to Pitſburg, that I would blow his brains out. This ſuiting De Jeane's purpoſe, he made the lad ſwear to it, and then ſet him, with the reſt of my ſervants, at liberty.</p>
            <p>I was now once more called before the Commandant, who told me he underſtood that I was going to ſend an expreſs to his Majeſty's enemies, in conſequence o which he had taken an inventory of my effects, and meant to ſend me to Canada. I told him he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly miſinformed, he then taxed me with what De Jean had forced from my ſervant; aſked me where I was writing the day before I was taken. I told him to my correſpondents in Montreal; and luckily for me a neighbour of mine, having been at my houſe, was produced, who declared the truth of what I ſaid, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016262_0014_0F9BD10A08FFECB0"/>
that, I being hurried, had given him the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> accuſations, being cleared up, I was once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed on giving freſh ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Though myſelf and ſervants were, for want of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for detailing us, ſet at liberty, it was not ſo with the unfortunate young man whom I had purchaſed from the Indian; he ſtill remained in priſon, daily tormented with the threats of De Jeane, that he would deliver him to the Indians, which ſo preyed on his ſpirits, that in a ſhort time it threw him into a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. I then applied to Captain Montpreſent, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, who gave me permiſſion, and I removed him to ſick Quarters, where I hired Jacob Pue, of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, his fellow priſoner, to attend him: I alſo, when leiſure would permit, attended him myſelf; but De Jeane, who ſtill haunted him, had ſo great an effect on him, that one day when I viſited him, he called me to his bed ſide and ſaid to me, that De Jeane had juſt left him, that he told him to make haſt and get well, as the Indians were waiting for him.—Pray, Sir, (ſaid the young man to De Jeane) for God's ſake try to keep me from the Indians, for if they get me they will burn me. Keep you from them, ſaid De Jeane, you damn'd Rebel you deſerve to be burned, and all your damned countrymen with you, ſo you need not think Dodge can ſave you; General Hamilton is now come up, and he will fix you all. I tried to comfort him, and told him to be of good courage;— Oh! replied he, I am almoſt diſtracted with the idea of being burnt by the Savages; I had much rather die where I am, than be delivered into the hands of thoſe horrid wretches, from whom I ſo lately, by your hands, eſcaped, the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of which, makes me ſhudder with horror. He could ſay no more; he ſank under it, and in a few hours after death, more kind than his cruel tormenters,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016262_0015_0F9BD10AC8CB4C08"/>
releaſed him from his troubles. I paid the laſt tribute to this my unhappy countryman, and had his corpſe decently interred, attended by the Miſſionary and moſt of the principal Merchants of the town.</p>
            <p>As Hamilton was arrived, I had every thing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that his malice could invent, more eſpecially as De Jeane, to whom his ear was always open, had told him (as I was informed) all and more than what had happened during his abſence. About a month after the death of the unhappy young man above related, I had occaſion for ſome of my powder out of the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine; I wrote an order to the conductor, according to cuſtom, and waited on the Governor to have it ſigned; on preſenting it to him, he looked at it, and then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at me with a ſarcaſtic ſmile, ſaid. It is powder you want, you damn'd raſcal, is it? at the ſame time tearing my order and throwing it in my face; you have behaved yourſelf very well, have you not? after my granting you your life, you would not go with La Mote, would you not? ſays he, and ſtarting up in a great paſſion, as though he would ſtrike me, put himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and the door. What, ſays he, you have a damn'd deal of influence with the Indians; you can purchaſe priſoners without my approbation, can you? you damned raſcal. Sir, ſays I, I am no raſcal; not a word out of your mouth, ſays Hamilton, go about your buſineſs and take care of me or I will fix you: I replied, it had always been my ſtudy to take care of him; not a word, ſays he, go about your buſineſs, and bleſs your ſtars I was not here inſtead of Captain Montpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for I would have fixed you, you damned ſcound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. Here I took my leave, went home, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to think as little of Mr. Hamilton and his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage as poſſible, till I had an opportunity of getting redreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:016262_0016_0F9BD10B86672900"/>Notwithſtanding the hatred of Hamilton and De Jeane, I ſpent the forepart of the Winter very happily, till the 25th of January, 1778, when ſeveral of the Merchants of the town, got permiſſion to go to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſky to trade, and as they propoſed encamping about two leagues from the town, myſelf and ſeveral others, in a friendly manner, propoſed and did accompany them in our ſleighs to their firſt ſtage; but on our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, I being a head, was challenged by De Jeane, at the head of thirty or forty ſoldiers, by aſking who came there? to which I replied, John Dodge; he then ordered the ſoldiers to ſeize me and the two Gentlemen in the ſleigh with me, and forced us to return to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment we had juſt left, where he ſeized the whole of the Gentlemen, who were going, by permiſſion, to Sanduſky, with their goods, ſleighs, &amp;c. and carried the whole of us, the next morning, back to the Fort, and charged us with ſending out goods to ſupply (as he politely termed it) the Rebels.</p>
            <p>After being detained three days in priſon, I was taken to De Jeane's houſe, to ſee my papers, books, deſks, &amp;c. examined. They broke open my deſk, pretending to have loſt the key. On ſearching, they could not find any thing worth their notice, or what they expected to find. De Jeane then gave me my keys, and told me to ſend for my deſk and take care of myſelf, as he would watch me; I told him, as he had taken it from my houſe and broke it, he ſhould mend it and ſend it home, before I would receive it: Stop a a little, ſaid he, I will ſpeak to the Governor, and fix you yet if I can; he then gave me into the care of the guard, and ordered me to goal. About the fifth day after this, not hearing any thing from him, I ſent for my violin, and was diverting myſelf, when Governor Hamilton paſſed by, and enquired who was playing on the violin, to which the Corporal of the guard an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016262_0017_0F9BD10C441ECB58"/>
it was me. The next day, De Jeane waited me with a Blackſmith, who ſoon clapped on a pair of hand-bolts; and now, ſays De Jeane, I have fixed you, you may play the violin till you are tired; I aſked him what I had done to be treated thus; for that you muſt apply to the Governor, replied he, for it is his pleaſure that you are ſo: He then threatened to put on leg-bolts; on which I told him, I did not value his irons, but if he kept me priſoner, I ſhould look to him for my property, (about 3000l.) Yes, ſays he, we will fix you and your property too, and then left me. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix days after, I was taken to my own houſe, where two Engliſh and two Frenchmen, by order of the Governor, took an inventory of my goods, and ſoon after ſold the whole at vendue, for about 1900l. New-York currency. Thus being a ſecond time rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of my property, I lay a priſoner as contented as poſſible, without any thing material happening, until the firſt of May.</p>
            <p>On the firſt of May, 1778, I was put on board a veſſel to go down to Quebec, and by ſome of my friends furniſhed with proviſion and neceſſaries for the voyage; but of theſe I was robbed by De Jeane, and had it not been for ſome Gentlemen, paſſengers in the ſame veſſel, I muſt have ſuffered with hunger. On the firſt of June I arrived at Quebec, where I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to Mr. Printices, the Provoſt Marſhal: Ha, ha, ſays he, Mr. Dodge, Are you here? I have often been told you were a damn'd raſcal, doing all you could againſt government; it is a pity Gov. Hamilton did not hang you when he was about it, as he would have ſaved government a great deal of trouble. From hence I was conducted on board the priſon ſhip, Meriah with a number of farmers, taken off their plantations by the Savages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:016262_0018_0F9BD10E6C5BBE50"/>Two days after I was put on board the priſon ſhip, we were viſited by Mr. Murray, Commiſſary of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, to whom I gave an account of my capture and ill uſage; he told me, he would ſpeak to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and give me an anſwer. Two days after, he again came on board, and told me, as it was very difficult times, I could not have a hearing at preſent; I told him I wanted nothing but what the Engliſh conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion allowed, and if I could not get that in Quebec, I would apply to England; to which he replied, I had better be eaſy, for if I did not, he would put me in irons again.</p>
            <p>I remained on board the priſon ſhip till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Auguſt, when Mr. Murray came on board, and informed me that I was not to go with the priſoners; but if I would give my parole, I ſhould be allowed the liberty of Quebec. I aſked him the occaſion I could not be ſent with the other priſoners; he replied, it was the Governor's orders: I aſked him if I was to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any ſupport; he ſaid, not any. I told him it was very hard to be dragged from my houſe, robbed of my property, deprived of my liberty, ſent 1200 miles in irons, and ſtill be held a priſoner in the town of Quebec, without any allowance for ſupport: All my applications were in vain, I was ſet on ſhore under pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role the fourth of Auguſt, and the ſhip ſailed with the other priſoners ſoon after.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of my detention, as I was afterwards told by Mr. Murray, was, that Governor Hamilton, of Detroit, had wrote the General not to ſend me round with the other priſoners; for if I got into the United States, he knew I would come immediately upon him, and as I knew the country, was well acquainted with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of the different Indians about the lakes, and had great influence among them, ſhould be the means of their loſing the fort, which would be much againſt the crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:016262_0019_0F9BD10E825E75E8"/>On my enlargement, I ſoon got acquainted with a number of gentlemen, who were friends to the United States, and the cauſe in which they were engaged. Some days after, going on ſhore, I fell in company with a Mr. Jones, who happened at that time to be reading a letter ſent by General Montgomery, while he lay before Quebec, to Gov. Carlton, and on conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſaid he hoped General Montgomery was in hell, and that all the rebels would ſoon be with him; to this I made a reply, words enſued, and then blows; he drew on me, but I parried his thruſt with my cane, ſo that I only got a ſmall wound in my knee: He then made a complaint, and I was ſent for by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who threatened to put me in confinement if I did not find ſecurity; this I ſoon found, and bonds were given for me for two months; at the end of which, as they neglected renewing them, and left me without parole or ſecurity, I hired an Indian guide, and on the ninth of October, quitted Quebec. After a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing march through the woods, on the 20th of November, I arrived at Boſton, where I was kindly received, and politely treated by General Gates, who ſupplied my wants and forwarded me to his Excellency General Waſhington; I waited on him, was politely received, and ſent on to Congreſs, having ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to Canada worthy their hearing.</p>
            <p>Had the love of my country no ways prompted me to act againſt the tyranny of Britain, I leave it to the world to judge, whether I have not a right to revolt from under the dominion of ſuch tyrants, and exert e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very faculty God has given me to ſeek ſatisfaction for the ill uſage I received; that if I had ten thouſand lives, and was ſure to loſe them all, I think, ſhould I not attempt to gain ſatisfaction, I ſhould deſerve to be a ſlave the remainer of my life.</p>
