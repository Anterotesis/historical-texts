            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Meaſles</hi> are a Diſtemper which in <hi>Europe</hi> ordinarily proves a Light Malady: but in theſe parts of <hi>America</hi> it proves a very heavy Calamity; A Malady <hi>Grievous</hi> to moſt, <hi>Mortal</hi> to many, &amp; leaving pernicious Relicks behind it in All. Becauſe the Sickneſs is now ſpreading in all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>You will by no means forget the firſt and main Care, which is, To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

One of the moſt Learned and Famous Phyſicians that ever was in the World, the Great <hi>Kirstenius,</hi> has this reported of him; He would <hi>ordinarily do nothing for his Patients, till he ſaw them firſt hopefully Reconciled unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſhould be Remembred, That multitudes of Lives have been Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in the <hi>Meaſles</hi> as well as in the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> by peoples being at laſt perſwaded out of the pernicious Methods of <hi>Over-doing,</hi> and <hi>Over-heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and giving Things to <hi>force Nature</hi> out of its own orderly way of proceeding. Before we go any further, Let this Advice for the <hi>Sick,</hi> be principally attended to; <hi>Don't kill 'em!</hi> That is to ſay, With miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Kindneſs. Indeed, if we ſtopt here, and ſaid no more, this were enough to ſave more <hi>Lives,</hi> than our <hi>Wars</hi> have deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>The Uſual Symptoms of an <hi>Arreſt</hi> from the <hi>Meaſles</hi> are, An <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake;</hi> Troubles in the <hi>Eyes;</hi> a Dry <hi>Cough;</hi> an Oppreſſion on the <hi>Breaſt</hi> or <hi>Stomach;</hi> or a pain there, and in the <hi>Back</hi> and Limbs; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Faintneſs,</hi> with <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> perhaps <hi>Vomiting,</hi> or <hi>Griping</hi> and <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging;</hi> A <hi>Thirſt,</hi> with a conſtant <hi>Fever,</hi> which is mild at firſt, but grows high enough before it has done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:039577_0002_10147BC75AE43B48"/>
When ſuch Symptoms of the Sickneſs, bid your Friend look about him, let him not throw away his Life by not being <hi>Sick ſoon enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Symptoms are <hi>Gentle,</hi> and the perſon can yet claim his place at the Table, or can bear to Sit up, Let him do ſo, till the <hi>Red Specks</hi> begin to ſhow themſelves. But let him keep <hi>houſe,</hi> and keep <hi>warm;</hi> not dare to expoſe himſelf. Let him <hi>feed ſparingly</hi> and on a very <hi>Eaſy Food.</hi> Tho' an Hourly Appearance of the Enemy may be Expected, yet be not in an Hurry. No Haſte of your <hi>Hot Things:</hi> Wait with a little patience. A little <hi>Brimſtone</hi> finely powdered, as much as may lie on a <hi>Six-pence,</hi> twice or thrice a day, may do more than Twelve penniworth of Service.</p>
            <p>If there be any Shocking <hi>Violence</hi> in the Symptoms, or the Red Specks begin to make their Appearance, let the perſon take his <hi>Bed,</hi> and be ſure to Lie very <hi>warm,</hi> till all be over. In the Winter, <hi>Infants</hi> are beſt kept in the <hi>Arms.</hi>

            <p>Ordinarily, <hi>Sweating</hi> muſt not be indulged, much leſs provok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But a comfortable <hi>warmth,</hi> I ſay, a convenient <hi>warmth,</hi> cannot be too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated. As many <hi>Coverings,</hi> as the Times that the word, <hi>Warmth,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in our now ſpeaking of it, may be little enough.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Gentle Vomit</hi> in the beginning, has had much Benefit expected from it. Be ſure, if there be an <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> by a Body of Phlegm, or an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd Stomach, or any thing of a <hi>Nauſeous</hi> Inclination, a <hi>Gentle Vomit</hi> is loudly called for.</p>
            <p>If there be none of this, but only a <hi>pain</hi> in the Head, and Breaſt, Back, and Limbs, a moderate <hi>Sweat</hi> may do. It may be procured, by the well-known preparation which is become every bodies Firſt Reſort, <hi>Syrup of Saffron and Treacle Water.</hi> A <hi>Tea</hi> of <hi>Sage,</hi> or of <hi>Roſemary,</hi> or a little Mull'd <hi>Cider,</hi> or <hi>Wine</hi> with thoſe Plants infuſed, will do well. Some can diſpenſe, with an Infuſion of the <hi>Snakeweed.</hi> But others are for waving it, as too fiery and enraging in a Diſtemper which is allow'd by all to be an <hi>Inflammatory Fever.</hi> A <hi>Scabious</hi> Tea will do. There is alſo a Compoſition of Hot <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Rum</hi> (for which they that are Learned in ſuch potions, do not want a Name,) this <hi>coarſe Compoſition,</hi> has been of Good Conſequence. But it muſt be very <hi>weak;</hi> and it muſt not be uſed <hi>often,</hi> if <hi>at all</hi> after the <hi>Meaſles</hi> appear in the Skin. The uſe of ſuch Things muſt be very Temperate; It may be continued until the full Eruption. But I repeat the Admonition againſt, <hi>Over-doing</hi> and <hi>Over-heating.</hi> It will ſpoil all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Coarſe Compoſition</hi> aforeſaid, will beſt ſuit the <hi>pained</hi> Patient. But it will hardly do ſo well, in <hi>Costive</hi> Bodies; or where the <hi>Breaſt</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; or where the <hi>Fever</hi> is high, or in too <hi>hot Constitutions.</hi> That
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039577_0003_10147BC996878C30"/>
               <hi>Coarſe Compoſition,</hi> 'tis a very ſtrange thing, that if it happen to Do a <hi>Little Good now and then,</hi> people muſt preſently be <hi>Bewitched</hi> with it!</p>
            <p>Where the Patient is moſt prone to be <hi>faint,</hi> a <hi>Balm Tea,</hi> or a Glaſs of <hi>Wine</hi> a little <hi>Saffronized,</hi> may do very well. Twenty or Thirty Drops of good <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> have been ſometimes very ſerviceable to them that could be Maſters of it, in this as well as many other Caſes; But, <hi>this does not happen to every man!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Patient is by this time full of the <hi>Meaſles.</hi> He'll be <hi>Thirsty.</hi> And what ſhall he do?</p>
            <p>If he will venture to drink any thing that is <hi>Cold,</hi> it will be well, if he don't find, <hi>There is Death in the Pot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let him Drink a <hi>Tea</hi> of <hi>Balm,</hi> and <hi>Scabious.</hi> If he be <hi>Faint,</hi> or <hi>Sick,</hi> add a little <hi>Saffron.</hi> If he be <hi>Looſe,</hi> Let the <hi>Tea</hi> be of <hi>Sage,</hi> or of <hi>Roſe-mary.</hi> If he be <hi>Grip't,</hi> it may have <hi>Penny-royal</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>But what is to be done, if a <hi>Cough</hi> annoy him? Then a <hi>Pectoral</hi> of Maiden-hair, Anniſeed, Liquorice, Raiſins, and Figs. <hi>Liquorice</hi> alone, in a Tea, may do. Or, if that can't be had, a Syrup of Maiden-hair, of <hi>Hyſſop,</hi> and of <hi>Colts foot.</hi> The <hi>Cough</hi> muſt not be ſtopt; you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it with <hi>Sugar-Candied,</hi> and with <hi>Buttered Pills;</hi> and the <hi>Pectorals</hi> now preſcribed. Or, <hi>Hot Honey</hi> alone will do admirably well.</p>
            <p>In hot Conſtitutions eſpecially, a proper <hi>Drink</hi> would be, <hi>Water with Roaſted Apples</hi> in it. Some would add a little <hi>Ginger</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>Hot <hi>Cyder,</hi> if it be not <hi>hard,</hi> is an allowable <hi>Drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards the Heighth of the Diſtemper, <hi>Hyſſop</hi> Tea may be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to <hi>Scabious.</hi> Let the <hi>Diet</hi> (thro' the whole courſe) be <hi>Thin</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; Gruels, Caudles, Water-pottage, and the like; and given <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> enough.</p>
            <p>About the Third or Fourth Day, from the Eruption, will come the <hi>Criſis,</hi> which you call, the <hi>Turning.</hi> And this will be often attended with <hi>Frightful Circumſtances;</hi> Grievous Oppreſſion, Fainting, Vomiting, Purging, and the <hi>Vapours,</hi> which is to ſay in one word, <hi>All that is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> But all will be preſently and eaſily relieved, if Heaven afford a Bleſſing to a proper Management. Sometimes the ſudden Diſappea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Meaſles</hi> give a <hi>Needleſs Fright.</hi> They have perform'd their courſe; but the frighted Patient flies to <hi>hot Expellers,</hi> which endanger the raiſing of a putrefactive Heat, that had better have been ſpared. Some have obſerved, That theſe <hi>Frightful Circumstances</hi> have come with their greateſt Fury, where the praevious uſe of <hi>Hot Things,</hi> which you have been ſo warn'd about, has been Immoderate.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> take <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Oil,</hi> (or if the Patient be Looſe, let him take, <hi>Rum</hi> and <hi>Oil:</hi>) Give it pretty hot; The Doſe two or three
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039577_0004_10160EDD51BF7118"/>
Spoonfuls every Hour, as there may be Occaſion; Or, take almoſt any thing, that will cauſe a <hi>Vomit</hi> or two. A <hi>Gentle Vomit</hi> at this Time, has Reprieved many a Life, that was juſt Expiring: Eſpecially when there is a Collection of a wretched <hi>Phlegm,</hi> to be Encountred. The <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Oil</hi> is preferrible to the <hi>Rum</hi> and <hi>Oil.</hi> And when a <hi>Vomit</hi> would not relieve the Oppreſſion, the <hi>Wine</hi> &amp; <hi>Oil,</hi> with a Decoction of the <hi>Cooling Seeds,</hi> has preſently done it.</p>
            <p>You have been taught already what you ſhall do for <hi>Faintneſs</hi> in your Patient. Or, Give him a few Drops of the <hi>Spirit of Hartſhorn</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his <hi>Vomiting</hi> and <hi>Purging,</hi> you need not go far for a Remedy. Give ſcalding <hi>Hot water;</hi> Do this, even to nine or ten times, if it be needful, &amp; as he can bear it. Then give a little <hi>Hot Wine</hi> with a bit of toaſted <hi>Bread.</hi> Or a little of the <hi>Coarſe Compoſition,</hi> you were formerly told of; Or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is <hi>akin</hi> to that, and as <hi>well-known</hi> as that. In twenty four hours, more or leſs, it may be hoped, the Storm will be over.</p>
            <p>For a <hi>conſiderable while</hi> after this, the Patient muſt be mighty careful of taking any <hi>Cold,</hi> and Eating too ſoon of any <hi>Fleſh-meat.</hi> Let him not be <hi>well too ſoon,</hi> and throw himſelf into a <hi>Fever,</hi> and throw away his <hi>Life,</hi> as many have inconſiderately and preſumptuouſly done. Let him <hi>take Time,</hi> and ſpend his Time, in <hi>Studying to be Thankful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a <hi>Cough</hi> continue, let him fly to the uſual Remedies. To take a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of ſhavings of <hi>Caſtile Soap</hi> in a Glaſs of Wine or Beer, for a few Nights following, has been very ſucceſsful for the cure or that inconvenience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The ſame <hi>Tea</hi> will alſo carry off the <hi>Worms,</hi> that ſo often follow the <hi>Meaſles;</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Purge</hi> will be neceſſary for all, that would not have the Venome of the <hi>Meaſles</hi> remaining in them, and follow'd with many Evil Conſequences.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fever</hi> (perhaps that which they call, The <hi>Pleuretick</hi>) too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten follows the <hi>Meaſles.</hi> But for this, I do not now offer any Directions: A Skilful <hi>Phyſician</hi> muſt be conſulted withal.</p>
            <p>All that is propoſed in this Letter, is to direct in the plaineſt manner that is poſſible, without any <hi>Terms of Art,</hi> &amp; ſo that any <hi>Child</hi> may underſtand, &amp; any <hi>Nurſe</hi> may adminiſter, what is to be done, in the ſingle Caſe of the <hi>Meaſles:</hi> Which Malady, tho' it be not ſo <hi>Dangerous</hi> in it ſelf perhaps, as many others are, yet upon the <hi>Leaſt Error</hi> in treating of it, proves as <hi>Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as moſt that the poor <hi>Children of Death</hi> fall before. I <hi>know</hi> not (and for ſome Reaſons I have read in a very Ancient Book, I may add, I <hi>care</hi> not,) what <hi>Cenſures</hi> this Action may meet withal. I am ſure, nothing but a pure <hi>Act of Charity to the Poor,</hi> where <hi>Phyſicians</hi> are wanting, is now intended; nor any thing offered, but what a Number of our moſt Eminent <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have approved of, with their Charitable Wiſhes to have it Communicated; and the helping, tho' of but one or two Miſerables, weighs down, againſt all that may be ſaid, againſt the Freedom which this Letter has taken. I am ſatisfied, The Angel of <hi>Betheſda</hi> would Eſteem it ſo. I take Leave;</p>
