            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is to be lamented that there are ſo many <hi>Impoſters</hi> in the world, which ſay, <hi>I have dreamed, I have dreamed,</hi> and perhaps have deceived ſome; but we ſhall do well to attend to the Scriptures of Truth, which are a ſufficient rule of faith and practice, and able to make us wiſe unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Apoſtle tells us to believe no other doctrine but what we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received; for faith he, <hi>Though we or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed;</hi> Gal. i. 8.</p>
            <p>IT appears by the life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Author of this piece, that his mind has been exerciſed in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner; for whereas he lately delighted in vice and folly, he is now quite the reverſe, and has given us reaſon to believe his words, partly by a meſſage done by him to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, telling him that his time was
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:028509_0004_0FD92C62111E3F78"/>ſhort on earth, and that he muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death, and in a very few days appear before GOD in the eternal world of ſpirits. Acoordingly ſoon after, it being in the month of March following, by an unhappy accident, he was drowned in <hi>Suſquehanna-Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> which the people of <hi>Newtown</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to be true; and the VISION is moſt ſurely believed by thoſe who at firſt were regardleſs of it, not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be true, nor him to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their approbation, rudely mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the topic of their diſcourſe: <hi>But</hi> GOD <hi>hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe; and</hi> GOD <hi>hath choſen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hath</hi> GOD <hi>choſen; yea and things which are not to bring to naught things that are, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence;</hi> 1 Cor. i. 27.</p>

FOR near two years before this uncommon thing happened to me, I was inclining to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there was neither Heaven or Hell, and grew ſo hardened in my heart as to hate the <hi>Holy Bible,</hi> and was in a ſtrange temptation to caſt away all thoughts of GOD, and give my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to all evil, concluding I ſhould die like the beaſts; but ſtill had ſome fear at times, which put me in great trouble, tho' I did not tell my tho'ts and feelings to any perſon for near two years; and I think I may ſay I was on the brink of ruin: But O the wonderful mercy of GOD, who ſaw me in my doleful and lamentable ſtate! And as my caſe was ſingular, the merciful GOD dealt with me in a ſingular manner, to convince me of my folly. I think I may ſay as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of old, <hi>Come unto me all you that fear the</hi> LORD, <hi>and I will tell you what great things he hath done for my ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>JAN. 10th, 1791, at night I went to bed as uſual, but ſlept none 'till late, for trouble of mind; but ſometime late in the night, when the people were all aſleep, I was riſen up in the bed, and was praying to GOD that if there was any Heaven or Hell I might inſtantly know it. As the words were in my mouth, I was ſmitten with a heavy blow on my breaſt, which laid me backward on my
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028509_0007_0FD92C68CE997510"/>bed: The ſame inſtant I ſaw a man in the room with a bright ſhining light around him, which appeared brighter than the ſun, ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his full ſtrength; and he ſpake to me and ſaid he knew all my vain thoughts before I told them to him, and bid me fear not and follow him; and in a moment my ſpirit left my body and followed my Guide, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed me beyond the moon and ſtarry regions: Then inſtantly I was carried to the moſt-glorious City, which ſhone with ſuch bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that it dazzled my eyes to behold it: Then I was brought to the bar of GOD's awful juſtice, and CHRIST took his ſeat on the right-hand of power; and I was called as a criminal to anſwer for my ſins. It appeared to me that the awful <hi>Judge</hi> opened a very great book, which contained the names of the righteous and the wicked; the former was on the right-hand, the latter on the left: Some of the names of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous were brighter than others; ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be dull: Thoſe of the wicked were all black. The <hi>Judge</hi> then pointed to my name, which was on the left hand, and bid me look and ſee it; and there I ſaw my name, which was very black: I alſo ſaw my ſins recorded in the book, and that I had been to very wicked frolicks; but the moſt heinous ſin was, that I hated the <hi>Holy Bible,</hi> and did
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028509_0008_0FD92C6A07EB9680"/>not believe in CHRIST, or that there was a Heaven or Hell.</p>
            <p>THEN I heard the awful <hi>Judge</hi> pronounce his glorious name JEHOVAH! which cauſed the Heavens to rejoice and Hell to tremble; and he likewiſe ſaid, if ever I made game of that <hi>Holy Name,</hi> I ſhould never have a right there, and the gates ſhould be forever ſhut againſt me. All this time I ſtood trembling to hear my doom, and I ſaw all that was laid to my charge to be true, and GOD was juſt in condemning me; my conſcience alſo bearing witneſs againſt me: But O the terrors that filled my ſoul, none can tell, unleſs they were in my ſoul's ſtead!—It appeared to me that the <hi>Judge</hi> held over my head a great ſword of juſtice, ready to take vengeance on me: But in the midſt of my fears, unexpected to me JESUS CHRIST came and kneeled down between me and the bar of GOD, and like a <hi>Mediator</hi> plead my cauſe in a moſt affecting manner, and ſaid, O <hi>Father,</hi> I have died for this ſinner! And now, O <hi>Father,</hi> ſpare this ſinner! O <hi>Father,</hi> I ſtand between him and the ſtroke of thy wrath!—O <hi>Father,</hi> why ſhould he die!—And at theſe words of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> the juſtice of GOD ſeemed to be ſilent; and GOD was well pleaſed with what CHRIST had ſaid on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028509_0009_0FD92C6B1226B2B0"/>and CHRIST turned to me with a ſmiling face, and ſaid, Your ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and your tranſgreſſions I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber no more. Then he ſhewed me, and bid me look and ſee the prints of the nails in his hands; this, ſaid he, I bore for you: And at thoſe words of his, the heavenly hoſt ſung for joy, and CHRIST ſaid, I was welcome as any to all the joys and pleaſures of the <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> and I could not forbear to ſing among the reſt. I think I can ſay, <hi>There is more joy in Heaven over one ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth, than over ninety and nine juſt perſons that needeth no repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CHRIST ſaid unto me you muſt go back to the world again, and gave me a great charge to my Father and Family, that they ſhould put away all ſin, and live a praying life to GOD, or they ſhould never come to that place. CHRIST ſaid, that the Bible was his book, and it was all his, and it ſhould remain to ages yet to come; and if any ſhould add unto, or diminiſh from that book, he never ſhould come to that glorious place. The people ſung after the manner of the chriſtian churches on earth; CHRIST <hi>died,</hi> ſeemed to lead their ſong. I ſaw there, men, women and children, and heard them ſing together; the little children ſung a verſe of the Goſpel ſonnet, which was as follows;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028509_0010_0FD92C6E777C0E48"/>
               <q>
                  <l>Babes rather caught from womb and breaſt,</l>
                  <l>Claim a right to ſing above the reſt,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe they found the happy ſhore</l>
                  <l>They never ſaw nor ſought before.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>CHRIST ſaid he had ſuffer'd for me in the world, and I muſt be willing to ſuffer for him: Then CHRIST took me by the hand, and walked ſome diſtance from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; all which ſhewed great reverence to him, for as he came toward them they ceaſed from their muſic, and aroſe and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their heads, and gave glory to him, that another ſinner was ſuffered to come. I ſaw alſo that they gave glory to him, that they had obtained ſalvation, and praiſed him as their <hi>Savior</hi> and procurer of all they enjoyed in Heaven. When CHRIST came to the end of his walk, he let go my hand, and pointed toward a man that was yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſat on his ſeat, and ſaid, that was the man that made the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> I aſked, if it was King <hi>David?</hi> He ſaid, yea. He alſo ſhewed me a man near the King, which was <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, and this, ſaid he, was my name, and when I ſhould come here to ſtay I ſhould ſing with him: He walked back to the bar again, and I followed him. He aſked me, if I were now ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied there was a Heaven? I ſaid I was. Then the <hi>Father</hi> ſpake to the Son, and ſaid
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028509_0011_0FD92C73A4C35C98"/>he muſt know that there is a Hell of woe. CHRIST put forth his hand, and hid me ſtand thereon, and I did ſo: Then he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me ſwift as lightning to Hell, and ſat me down in the midſt of the blaſpheming crew; and indeed as there is nothing on earth that can reſemble Heaven, ſo there is nothing that can reſemble Hell: It is a place of woe, and the wretched creatures appeared to be in the greateſt diſtreſs and torment: I heard them ſcream, and cry, and lament, and curſe the day they were born. I heard them blaſpheme againſt the GOD of Heaven, and it appeared very frightful, for they ſeemed to be in full deſpair; which they ſaid was never to be at an end, and they never expected to have any reſt: When thouſands of years were paſt, it was ſtill a begining. Some have thought that Hell was a place of fire and brimſtones altho' that is the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

I SAW that old Serpent the Devil; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſomething in human ſhape, but black; his countenance appeared very fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and full of malice againſt CHRIST, and in appearance he had a chain about his neck, which ſo bound him down that he could not riſe up before CHRIST, but lay and growled in the greateſt miſery and torment.</p>
            <p>I SAW that the damned crew were in fear of the day of judgment; for they ſaid their puniſhment would then be increaſed; and when I was in Hell I looked to ſee if there were any infants in that place, but ſaw none: Then I aſked CHRIST if there were any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants there? He ſaid no; for I ſaid I have heard ſome ſay, they believed there were. He ſaid, I muſt read his Bible where it ſays, <hi>Suffer little children to came unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Then CHRIST aſked me if I were now ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that there was. Hell? I ſaid I was: He put forth his hand, and I ſeemed to ſit thereon, and he brought me ſwift as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to my home, and I ſaw it no more.</p>
            <p>I WOULD ſay a few words to the candid and honeſt <hi>Reader;</hi> whether it may be a benefit to others I know not, but it is a reality to me, and is what I have ſeen and heard: If any ſcruple the truth of it, it is all one to me, for I have had no thoughts of the praiſe of men in relating this ſtrange and uncommon <hi>Fact</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:028509_0013_0FD92C7953E89E60"/>and indeed I have been ſo far from writing any thing that is not true, I have not wrote all that is true; nor is it poſſible for me to point out to your view all that I ſaw while I was there. But I ſhall proceed to write a few words more: I ſaw there faces of men which did ſo much reſemble their faces when on earth, that they could eaſily be known; I knew ſome of them. One man came and ſpoke to me and ſaid he once lived near my Father's houſe on earth: He ſaid his name was <hi>Simeon Dunn.</hi> Alſo I ſaw <hi>Dunn</hi>'s Mother at ſome diſtance from me; and <hi>Jonathan Hopkins, Barnabas Sweaſey</hi> and my Wife's Mother, in the realms of bliſs. When CHRIST led me on the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground he aſked me if <hi>I</hi> had ever a child or earth? I told him I had. He pointed to a ſmall child and ſaid, there it is; and <hi>I</hi> heard it ſing the verſe which <hi>I</hi> mentioned before. When CHRIST led me on, he ſaid, all the laws of nature are diſſolved.—Where <hi>I</hi> ſtood at the bar of GOD, his awful juſtice appeared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>rible <hi>I</hi> could not endure his face and words. He appeared with terrible majeſty and glory, and had <hi>I</hi> ten thouſand times the gift to ſet it forth, and all the gifts of earth to help me, <hi>I</hi> could not diſplay the glory and majeſty which <hi>I</hi> ſaw in him; for GOD is a <hi>Spirit</hi> infinite, eternal and unchangeable.</p>
