            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Sometime in the Month of <hi>June</hi> laſt Nine of your Brethren came up to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and they made propoſals of Peace in the Name of all the Tribes to Governour <hi>Shirley,</hi> in a Conference had with him. They alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd a Meeting of their Tribes in this Part of the Province, to treat and agree
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006336_0005_1028A33FF4D94C00"/>
upon the particular Articles or Terms of Peace; declaring they were not then fully authorized for that Purpoſe. The Governour promis'd to meet them by himſelf, or by his Commiſſioners at this Place the 27th of <hi>September</hi> laſt. Soon after this, His Excellency's Affairs obliged him to go to <hi>Great-Britain</hi>: And ſome Affairs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence requiring the Preſence of the Lieutenant-Governour at <hi>Boſton,</hi> He has appointed Commiſſioners with as full Power as He would have had if He had been perſonally preſent.</p>
                     <p>We have been waiting here fourteen Days: The two Gentlemen from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> waited here alſo ſome Time; but being obliged to return, they have impowered us to act in their Behalf; and have authorized <hi>Roland Cotton,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to Sign in their Name and in behalf of their Government, ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as we ſhall agree to.</p>
                     <p>Sundry Gentlemen of both Governments have been likewiſe waiting here ſome Time upon this Occaſion, but were obliged to return Home.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Norridgowocks</hi> have alſo waited as long as we have; but we have defer'd treating with them till the <hi>Penobſcots</hi> ſhould arrive.</p>
                     <p>We have now taken the firſt Opportunity to confer with you all together.</p>
                     <p>We have brought the Conference from <hi>Boſton</hi> of <hi>June</hi> laſt; and hope you have brought what was delivered you.</p>
                     <p>We are pleas'd you have brought the Captive agreable to your Engagement.</p>
                     <p>We deſire to know what Tribes you appear for, and how far your Power extends.</p>

                     <p>I have thought of this Matter a great while, and am now come.</p>
                     <p>It has been foul Weather; I have ſtay'd till fair Weather.</p>
                     <p>Ever ſince Governour <hi>Dummer</hi> treated with us, all the Indians lik'd it well, and have reckon'd it well ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>But yet there has been a dark Cloud for a Time, and a great deal of Blood ſpilt: But now let us try to cover it over and forget it; and then when that is done, Love will encreaſe.</p>
                     <p>For my Part I am come here for Good. Time has been when your young Men terrified ours and ours have terrify'd yours: But now the Time will come when they may ſee one another without Fright.</p>

                     <p>I went to <hi>Boſton</hi> for Peace; and you now ſee me for the ſame End here.</p>
                     <p>There were three Indians retarded our coming here in Time, viz. <hi>Loron, Sabouſit</hi> and <hi>Wombamando</hi>; who would break up any Thing that is doing for Good. Notwithſtanding I am now come to propoſe what can be done in Peace; for God is willing that we ſhould both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> live in Peace.
