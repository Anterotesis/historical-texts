            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>JOHN HAMMETT</hi> of the Town of <hi>Newport</hi> on <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> having furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the World with an undoubted Inſtance in his own Perſon, of a Man abundantly given to Change, hath penn'd and ſent to a certain Church Member, a few Days ago, a Paper, containing a Declaration or Confeſſion of his Faith concerning our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; and having been ſince waited upon, hath owned it to be his Faith, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he hath not ſubſcribed it with his Name: And the ſame being in direct Oppoſition to Twelve Arguments of his in a Manuſcript, now in Poſſeſſion of another of the Church Members, it is thought fit, for the Benefit of himſelf and others, to preſent the Contents of the ſaid Papers to the Public; together with an Argument of his againſt the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, taken from another of his own Manuſcripts. Only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing the Reader, That his aſſerting or ſuggeſting, that the Confeſſion of his Faith, contained in his ſaid Paper, <q>always was
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040687_0003_101680536C76B0C0"/>and is the Confeſſion of Faith which is made and accepted by all our Churches to this Day,</q> is certainly a very great Evil, falſe in Fact, and diſhonourable to the ſaid Churches: Witneſs thoſe very Confeſſions of Faith which have been reprinted here in <hi>Newport,</hi> and which any Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> compare with this of <hi>John Hammett,</hi> at Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>However, for the Satisfaction of many Readers, and ſaving them ſome Trouble, it is thought covenient to inſert ſome Paſſages in this Place,</p>
            <p>There is a Public Confeſſion of Faith hanging up in a Frame in the Meeting Houſe where <hi>J. Hammett</hi> uſed to aſſemble, and which hath been there many Years, and hath been lately reprinted in <hi>Newport,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Franklin.</hi> The third Article whereof, ſpeaks thus: "That there is one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all Things, who is the only begotten Son of God, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> being the true Lord and <hi>Root of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and alſo his Son and Offspring, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fleſh; whom God freely ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, becauſe of his great Love to the World; who as freely gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, taſting Death for every Man,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040687_0004_101680566C009A48"/>a Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the Sins of the whole World."</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Article of the ſaid Confeſſion, ſpeaks thus: "That there is one Holy Spirit, the <hi>precious</hi> Gift of God, freely given to ſuch as obey him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.32. that thereby they may be throughly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and made able (without which they are altogether unable) to abide ſtedfaſt in the Faith, and to honour the Father and his Son Chriſt, the Author and Finiſher of their Faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and theſe Three are One, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7."—</p>
            <p>There is alſo a Public Confeſſion of Faith ſet forth by many of thoſe Baptiſts who own the Doctrine of Univerſal Redemption; ſubſcribed by certain Meſſengers, Paſtors, Deacons, and Brethren, met at <hi>London,</hi> in Behalf of themſelves, and many others, unto whom they did belong, in <hi>London,</hi> and in ſeveral Counties of the Nation, of the ſame Faith with them. Which Confeſſion hath alſo been reprinted ſome Years ago in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> by Mr. <hi>J. Franklin.</hi> The firſt Article
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040687_0005_10168058940C2420"/>whereof, ſpeaks thus: "We believe, and are very confident, that there is One, and but One living and true God, who is from everlaſting to everlaſting, and changeth not; without Body, Parts, or Paſſions, eſſentially preſent in all Places, of infinite Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs; the Maker and Preſerver of all Things in Heaven and Earth, Viſible and Inviſible; and in this Divine and Infinite Being or Unity of the Godhead, there are Three Perſons, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, of one Subſtance, Power, and Eternity: But as for all other Doctrines that are contrary and oppoſite to this aboveſaid Article, we abhor and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly proteſt againſt them."</p>
            <p>The third Article of the ſaid Confeſſion is thus: "That the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, is the only begotten Son of God, who did in the Fulneſs of Time, take to himſelf of our Nature and Subſtance, in the Womb of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of whom (in Reſpect of the Fleſh) he was made, and ſo is true God, and true Man, our <hi>Emanuel,</hi> Chriſt, whom God the Father freely ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, becauſe of his great Love to the World; who as freely gave himſelf a Ranſom for All"—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:040687_0006_1016805E730B0828"/>
This Confeſſion of Faith being reduced to a ſhort Compaſs, for the Benefit of weak Memories, and ignorant Perſons: In that Form, the firſt Article is thus. "There is one God, an Almighty, Eternal, Infinite, Good, Merciful, Righteous, and Holy Spirit, who made the World, and all Things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, out of Nothing; and is ſupream Ruler and Governor thereof."</p>
            <p>The ſecond Article is thus. "This one God is diſtinguiſhed into Three Perſons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; the Father is the Creator, the Son the Redeemer, and the Holy Ghoſt the Sanctifier."</p>
            <p>To this, let it be added: There is another Confeſſion of Faith publiſhed by a very great Number of Baptiſt Churches, that held the the Doctrine of Perſonal Election and Final Perſeverance, cited by Mr. <hi>Joſ. Stennet</hi> in his Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Ruſſen;</hi> which, as to the Matter in Hand, ſaith, as cited by Mr. <hi>Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> p. 112, 113. "The Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in the Holy Trinity, being very and eternal God, the Brightneſs of the Father's Glory, of one Subſtance, and equal with him; who made the World, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth and governeth all Things he hath
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040687_0007_1016806284B0AB18"/>made; did, when the Fulneſs of Time was come, take upon him Man's Nature, with all the eſſential Properties, and common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities thereof, yet without Sin, being conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi>—and ſo was made of a Woman of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> according to the Scriptures. So that two whole, perfect, and diſtinct Natures were inſeparably join'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Perſon, without Converſion, Compoſition, or Confuſion; which Perſon is very God and very Man, yet one Chriſt, the only Mediator between God and Man."</p>

               <hi>"FOraſmuch as there having been of late, certain Opinions, which both by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing, have been induſtriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated among us, which hath cauſed ſome Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and hath put us upon diligently ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and carefully examining, the plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the New-Teſtament; and from thence we have collected the following Declaration of our Faith, which having Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040687_0008_1016806647D62A20"/>for its Foundation, we therefore hope it will ſufficiently protect us from the Imputation of Error; and alſo it may, by the Bleſſing of God, be Serviceable to others: We thought our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſcientiouſly oblig'd to make it public.</hi>

            <p>THAT in Reſpect of the real Subſtance, Nature, and Eſſence, of the true and only Chriſt, the only begotten Son of God, in whom God the Father dwelt, and to whom the Father gave the Spirit without Meaſure, in whom the Godhead dwelt bodily, and in whom God was manifeſt, and that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World to himſelf, ſo as there never was ſuch a Union between God and any other Man.</p>
            <p>Him the Scriptures declare to be the Seed of the Virgin, miraculouſly conceiv'd in her Womb, by the Overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, and born of her Body, made of a Woman, and was the Son of Man, made like his Brethren in all Things, Sin only excepted; and was in all Points tempted like as we are, yet without Sin, liable to the Bodily Frailties of Human Nature, he being a Mortal Man, and for our Sins died on the Croſs, whom God raiſed from the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:040687_0009_10168068D3495508"/>Dead, and exalted and dignified him far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, whether in Heaven or in Earth, the Father only excepted: For God hath given him a Name, which is above every Name, that at the Name of Jeſus, every Knee ſhould bow, whether of Things in Heaven or Things on Earth; and to him God committed all Power in Heaven and in Earth; and alſo God hath appointed and ordained this extraordinary Perſon to execute thoſe two great Offices of a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man; and alſo that of a Judge of the final and everlaſting State of all Men: And this glorious and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſon, the Scriptures thus deſcribes and ſets forth, to be the compleat and only Object of Faith, God the Father only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; for Chriſt himſelf ſaid, <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me:</hi> So that there is not any other Object of Faith recommended to us; for as to the Holy Ghoſt, or Power of the Higheſt, 'tis evident, that the Higheſt was his Father, by whoſe overſhadowing Power (to whom Nothing is impoſſible) the Virgin conceived and brought forth her Son, and thus this Seed of the Woman, who was to bruiſe the Serpent's Head, became the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:040687_0010_1016806E66F51948"/>only begotten Son of God, according as the Angel ſaid to <hi>Mary; That Holy Thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God; and alſo he ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the Son of the Higheſt.</hi> And that we might not be miſtaken, by going farther back to find out his Original, or when he began to have a Being or Exiſtence, and thereby overlook him, and have our Eye on ſome other Object inſtead of him, the Holy Ghoſt hath carefully provided againſt this Uncertainty, by informing us, That when he was diſputing the Doctors in the Temple, he was then about Twelve Years of Age; and when he was baptized of <hi>John</hi> in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Jordan,</hi> he then began to be about Thirty Years of Age; ſo that Chriſt the Son of God could not pre-exiſt, or exiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Time, ſaving in the Ordination or Pre-determination of God, who calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were; and in this Senſe and Way of ſpeaking, he is ſaid to be a <hi>Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> tho' 'tis evident, he was not really then in Being, much leſs to be then ſlain or crucified. And alſo <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee:</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:040687_0011_1016806FF6A0A268"/>But both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> explains this to be prophetically ſpoken, and to refer to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begotten or raiſed from the Dead. So Chriſt alſo queſtioning with the <hi>Jews,</hi> he asked them, <hi>If</hi> David <hi>in Spirit call him Lord, how is he then his Son?</hi> Had theſe <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood, that <hi>David</hi> ſpake this in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic Stile; that is, That he was in Proceſs of Time to be his Lord, and alſo his Son, tho' then he was really neither his Son nor his Lord, they need not to have been ſo puzzled about this ſo plain a Queſtion. And thus abundance of ſeeming Difficulties may be eaſily reconciled and underſtood; for we are not under the ignorant Uncertainty, that the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> were, when they asked Chriſt, <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look for another?</hi> but thanks be to God, we can ſay with <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>Nathanael, We have found him, of whom</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Law and the Prophets did write, Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth. And this mean and low Character, tho' de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd by <hi>Nathanael</hi> as well as others, yet Chriſt was pleas'd particularly to chuſe above all others, to deſcribe himſelf by, when he appeared to <hi>Paul,</hi> tho' then in his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and reſplendant Glory; <hi>I am Jeſus of</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:040687_0012_10168073076C2580"/>Nazareth! So that we are not aſhamed to own him, as being our great Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and in him therefore, we profeſs to believe, and with him we are fully ſatisfied and contented; and therefore, we are not amuſing and puzzling ourſelves, by looking out for another Chriſt, or Son of God, whom we never expect to find; for on this very Faith of Chriſt's Human Perſonality and Sufferings, he hath expreſsly founded and eſtabliſhed the commemorative Communion, and as ſuch, we all receive it. And alſo, that the Man Chriſt Jeſus, whom the <hi>Jews</hi> crucified, and whom God raiſed from the Dead, the Apoſtles went every where preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> That he was the Son of God, and the only Saviour; and for this they ſuffered abundance of Perſecution: So that this was their chief and principal Doctrine of Faith, and accordingly this was the Profeſſion of Faith which the primitive Converts made, and which was accepted by the Apoſtles on their Admiſſion to Baptiſm; and ſo this always was, and is the Confeſſion of Faith which is made and accepted by all our Churches to this Day. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.22, 23. <hi>Bleſſed are ye, when Men ſhall hate you, and when they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:040687_0013_1016807515BFEEA0"/>ſhall ſeparate you from their Company, and ſhall reproach you, and caſt out your Name as evil, for the</hi> Son of Man's <hi>Sake: Rejoice ye in that Day, and leap for Joy, for behold your Reward is great in Heaven."</hi>
