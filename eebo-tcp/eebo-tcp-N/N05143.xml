            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The moſt critical Conjuncture, that ever happened in Favour of this Scheme was, the great Expedition againſt <hi>Louiſbourg</hi>—the Covetous and Ambitious Sharpers had two Whip Rows in this Game! <hi>Firſt,</hi> they knew that a great Sum of Money muſt be Emitted to Negotiate this important Affair; Money is the Sinews of War, the Blood in the Body of Trade, the Merchants Tools; in a Word, <hi>it anſwers all Things;</hi> Money muſt be paid for all the Baggage, Cloathing, Tranſportation, and the like—Theſe material Articles were all in theſe Mens Hands, and theſe Men knew the Committee of War muſt purchaſe theſe Stores of them; and for fear the Expedition ſhould <hi>not</hi> ſucceed, and the Parliament at home in ſuch Caſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſe the Government, and ſo theſe Men put to ſome <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

Expence they had been at in carrying on ſo prodigious an Affair, and as theſe Men had the Government's Bills chiefly in their Hands, conſequently the <hi>Sterling Money</hi> would moſtly center with them: and juſt ſo it has moſt fatally happened. They divided the Skin before they had caught the Beaſt, ſo that as bad as Old Tenor was in their <hi>Mouths,</hi> it is the beſt Money that ever was made for them; and we wiſh they themſelves were one half as good as the worſt of our Currency. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhall now ſhew how theſe Men <hi>improv'd</hi> this Paper-ſtuff. They immediately bought up all the Silver, Gold, Bills of Exchange, and every kind of Article that would poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſell in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c, to lodge Money there, to pay their Sterling Debts, in order to Enhance and Eſtabliſh their Credit; ſo that they might the more freely import larger Quantities of Goods, to Intice and Cajole the more vain and ſilly part of the People, (which generally are the greateſt part of all Communities,) out of their Old Tenor, which would be ſomewhat plenty for a little while—this they Effected, by Importing prodigious Quantities of Engliſh Goods, ſo that you ſaw no Body now, but what was topingly dreſs'd in Velvet, rich Race, Scarlet, Crimſon, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>—Strange! that they ſhould part with ſuch things for Paper that was of ſuch little Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. But it muſt be ſo.—Now, they had collected vaſt Sums of this Old Tenor, (as it was called through very great Cunning and Subtilty,) what ſhould they do with it? I'll tell you—they let it be well known, that as they had a pretty deal of Money, they would lend it out to any Body, that would hire it, giving Security for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; away come the <hi>Borrowers,</hi> take up many Score thouſand Pounds of the <hi>New Tenor</hi> Money, which was Emitted, upon a better <hi>Promiſe</hi> than Old Ten, becauſe they promiſed ſo many Ounces of Silver, wherefore they took Bonds for as many <hi>Ounces of real Coin'd Silver ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,</hi> full Security, and Intereſt enough—What is next to be done? why the next thing was, to ſettle all Accounts—they did ſo; and all thoſe that were not

immediately able to pay—them their Ballances, gave them their Bonds, for ſo many Ounces of real Silver Sterling Alloy, &amp;c.—And what is next: Why, the next thing was all of a ſudden, they ſtopt all CREDIT. As Bad, as Old, or Middle Tenor, or New Tenor, (or what Tenor you pleaſe,) as bad as theſe <hi>Tenors</hi> were, theſe SHARPERS, would not part with their Commodities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Money down in hand ******* <hi>that it was not very long, before they Scrabled, Graſpt, and Collected this D—d Paper Money into their own Poſſeſſion.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They had ſold their Goods for two or three Hundred per Ct.

And then, the Go—nt, by an Act of Ge—ral Aſ—bly, to allow, and pay to each Poſſeſſor of the <hi>ſaid Maſſachuſetts Bills,</hi> lawful Intereſt for the DELAY of PAYMENT, and <hi>then</hi> lay a <hi>Tax upon the whole Pro—ce,</hi> for this very <hi>Intereſt.</hi>—This is juſt and right; it is Equity, and Judgment.</p>

            <p>Another moſt celebrated and eminent Author, in the moſt pointed and nervous Language, ſays—<q>It indeed is amazing, who thinks at all of the PUBLIC, ſhould be indifferent about it; it is more amazing, that any Man who has a <hi>Stake</hi> in it, can avoid thinking of it, or be without <hi>Zeal</hi> for it: But it is <hi>moſt</hi> amazing, that great Men, Men of Dignity and Fortune, of Splendor and Title, <hi>all which</hi> can only be ſecure while the PUBLIC is ſo—that <hi>they</hi> ſhould <hi>not always,</hi> in <hi>all Countries,</hi> be upon perpetual Guard againſt <hi>their own Ruin</hi> and Debaſement, and continually ſtudying to ſupport public <hi>Liberty,</hi> which <hi>only</hi> muſt ſupport them.</q>

            <p>If it is our Duty to ſerve God, and our Country, and if we know this to be our Duty, and know that thoſe who <hi>do not</hi> their Duty, when they know it, and are called to it, ought to be beaten with many Stripes—then the Conſequence is clear—If in the <hi>Multitude</hi> of Co—ſ—rs there is <hi>Safety;</hi> what Condition muſt thoſe be in who cannot get the Co—ſ—rs together!—<hi>Ita Stulti, ſunt</hi>
