            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SEVERAL years residence in the Province of West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Florida, during which I entered into a minute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of its coasts, harbours, lakes, and rivers, having made me perfectly acquainted with their sit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bearings, soundings, d every particular requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to be known by Navigators, for their benefit I am induced to make my observations public. The expence and trouble at which this knowledge has been acquired, are far from inconsiderable; however, if the accurate surveys and descriptions I am thereby enabled to give, prove instructive and beneficial to my country, I shall esteem myself amply repaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It may be proper to observe that I have had the assistance of the remarks and surveys, so far as relates to the mouths of the Mississippi and the coast and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of West-Florida, of the late ingenious Mr. George Gauld, a Gentleman who was employed by the Lords of the British Admiralty for the express purpose of making an accurate chart of the abovementioned places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have also had recourse, in describing some parts of the Mississippi, to the publication of Captain</hi> Pitman, <hi>who resided many years on that river, and was well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the country through which it flows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

would not make an improper addition to the following work; but as the more immediate purpose of it is to point out the dangers of its coasts to the approaching mariner, I shall confine the cursory remarks I make on those heads, to such particulars only as are most deserving of notice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before I enter on the prosecution of my design, I would just observe, that I shall be more solicitous to make the result of my investigations useful than amusing, I shall endeavour rather to be clear and intelligible than study to deliver myself in florid language.</hi>

            <head>AN HISTORICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>A DESCRIPTION of the river Mississippi and the country through which it flows, called Louisiana, would have been the first objects submitted to the reader's attention; were it not humbly presumed that a short account of the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the river Mississippi, and a view of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent States to which its banks have been subjected are judged necessary, before their description is attempted.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Discovery of the Mississippi.</note> The merit of first discovering the river Mississippi, (or in the language of the natives, Meschasipi, for the general appellation of the former is a corruption of the latter) according to Lewis Hennepin's account published in London 1698, is due to the Sieur la Salle, who discovered that river in 1682. It seems that father Hennepin forgot that this river was previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously discovered by Ferdinand de Soto in 1541, also by Col. Wood in 1654, and by Captain Bolt in 1670. Monsieur de la Salle was the first who traversed that river. <note place="margin">Arrival and murder of la Salle.</note> In the spring of the same year 1682, he passed down to the mouths of the Mississippi; he afterwards remounted that river, and returned to Canada in the month of October following, from whence he took his passage to France, where he gave so flattering an account of the advantages that would certainly accrue from the settling a colony in those parts, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was formed for carrying those designs into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, with a squadron consisting of four vessels;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018532_0005_0FA7B3F31D4AE6C0"/>
having on board a sufficient number of persons, and all kinds of goods and provisions, necessary for the service of the new colony, which he proposed to fix at or near the mouth of the Mississippi. But having sailed beyond the mouth of the river, he attempted to fix a colony at the bay of St. Bernard, where he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the 18th of February 1684, about 100 leagues westward of the Mississippi. There his men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went such hardships that most of them perished mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. The leader, animated with an ardent desire of extending his discoveries, made various excursions with such of them who were able to travel; but on the 19th of March 1687, two of his men villainously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him, when exploring the interior parts of the country, in search of mines, and of the tract which led to those of St. Barbe in New Mexico.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ibberville's Arrival.</note> About seven years after, Mons. Ibberville, a respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able officer in the French navy, undertook to execute whatever La Salle had promised; and his reputation being established already, the court intrusted him with the conduct of the project. He carried his people very safely to the mouth of the great river, and there laid the foundation of the first colony the French ever had in the Mississippi. He took care to provide them with every thing necessary for their subsistance, and obliged them to erect a fort, for their defence against the Indians. This being done, he returned to France in order to obtain supplies.</p>
            <p>The success of his voyage made him extremely welcome at court, and he was soon in a condition to put to sea again. His second voyage was as fortunate as the first; but very unluckily for his colony, he died whilst he was preparing for the third. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign might have been abandoned, had not Crozat, a private man of an immense fortune, undertaken its support at his own expence. <note place="margin">Louisiana granted to Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zat.</note> In 1712, the King gave him Louisiana. Thus Lewis imitated the Pope,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018532_0006_0FA7B3F3294C0198"/>
who divided between the kings of Spain and Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal the territories of America, where the holy see had not one inch of ground.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Bounds of Louisiana.</note> In this grant the bounds are fixed by the Illinois river and the lake of that name on the North; by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina on the East, the gulph of Mexico on the South, and New Mexico on the West. As to Canada, or New France, the French court would scarcely admit it had any other northern boundary than the Pole. The avidity of Great Britain was equal, but France having been unfortunate in the war of 1710, the northern boundary of <note place="margin">Limits of Louisiana and Canada by the treaty of Utrecht.</note> Canada was fixed by the treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It assigns New Britain and Hudson's Bay, on the North of Canada, to Great Britain; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners afterwards on both sides ascertained the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits by an imaginary line, running from a cape or promontory in New Britain to the Atlantic ocean, in 58 degrees 30 minutes North latitude, thence South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west to the lake Misgosink or Mistasim; from thence farther South-west directly to the latitude of 49 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. All the lands to the North of the imaginary line, being assigned to Great Britain; and all southward of that line, as far as the river of St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to the French. These were at that time, the true limits of Louisiana and Canada, Crozat's grant not subsisting long after the death of Lewis XIV.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Crozat's grant vacated.</note> In order to have some plausible pretence for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on foot a project for changing the face of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs in France, this settlement was thought the most convenient; and therefore all imaginable pains were taken to represent it as a paradise, and place from whence inexhaustible riches might be derived, provided due encouragement could be obtained from government. For this purpose it was thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that a new company should be erected, to make way for which Mr. Crozat was to resign his grant; which he did accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:018532_0007_0FA7B3F3F703DCC0"/>
This occasioned the noise that was made about the Mississippi, not in France only, but throughout all Europe, which was filled with romantic stories of the vast fruitfulness of the banks of this great river, and the incredible wealth that was likely to flow from thence; and those accounts, though true in part, in the end proved ruinous to many.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Bounds of Louisiana before the peace of 1762.</note> Before the treaty of peace in 1762, Louisiana, or the southern part of New France, extended in the French maps from the gulph of Mexico, in about 29 degrees, to near 45 degrees of North latitude, on the West of the Mississippi, and to near 39 degrees on its eastern bank. Its boundaries were Canada on the North; New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, and the North-west part of the easternmost peninsula of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida, on the East; the Gulf of Mexico on the South; and lastly the kingdom of New Mexico on the West.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Absurd claims.</note> The European states having observed that kings and republicks claimed the sovereignty of every tract which had been seen, and were pretended to have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by navigators sailing under their flags, their geographers were not permitted to publish maps which might have contradicted such wild claims. This was the absurdity of former days. But political circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances often emboldened pretenders to urge their chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical rights; and their no less chimerical opponents then yielded what the had no better right to cede. But the absurd reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ion of such absurd pretensions is but a temporary compliance. It ever did and ever will sow the seeds of implacable animosities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, until pre-occupancy and cultivation, the true rests of lawful possession, shall have remedied the former invalidity of the claim.</p>
            <p>Both sides of the Mississippi continued under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of his most Christian Majesty till the peace of 1762, when the eastern side was ceded to the king of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018532_0008_0FA7B3F4B20757B0"/>
Great Britain by the 7th article of the definitive treaty, in the following words. "In order to re-establish peace on solid and durable foundations, <note place="margin">Division line between the French and English in 1762.</note> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move for ever all subject of dispute with regard to the limits of the British and French territories on the continent of America, it is agreed, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the confines between the dominions of his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic Majesty, in that part of the world, shall be fixed irrevocably by a line drawn along the middle of the river Mississippi, from its source to the river Ib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berville, and from thence, by a line drawn along the middle of this river, and the Lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain, to the sea; and for this purpose the most Christian King cedes in full right, and guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to his Britannic Majesty, the river and port of the Mobille, and every thing which he possesses, or ought to possess, on the left side of the river Mississip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi, except the town of New Orleans, and the island in which it is situated, which shall remain to France; provided that the navigation of the river Mississippi shall be equally free, as well to the subjects of Great Britain, as to those of France, in its whole length, from its source to the sea, and expresly that part which is between the said island of New Orleans, and the right bank of that river, as well as the passage both in and out of its mouth: it is further stipulated that the vessels belonging to the subjects of either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shall not be stopped, visited, or subjected to the payment of any duty whatsoever. The stipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inserted in the 4th article, in favour of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Canada, shall also take place with regard to the inhabitants of the countries ceded by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle."</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The cession of his Christian Majesty to Spain.</note> In the year 1762, and the day before the preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary articles to the peace were signed, his Christian Majesty ceded to Spain all his territories on the west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern side of the Mississippi, together with the town of

               <note place="margin">Arrival of Don Ulloa at New Orleans with soldiers.</note> Don Antonio Ulloa arrived at New Orleans about the middle of the year 1766, but deferred to take possession of the government of the colony in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Majesty's name, until he had received special orders to that effect.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the year 1767, two thousand Spanish soldiers were sent from the Havanna, but he did not then take possession of the country. He sent however about sixty of these troops to erect two forts, one opposite to the British fort, named Bute, on the mouth of the Ibberville, and the other on the west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern side of the Mississippi, a little below the Natchez, where a detachment of British troops had taken post; another party was sent in the autumn of 1767 to build a fort at the mouth of the river Missouri; but the commandant had positive orders not to interfere with the civil government of the Illinois country, where Mons. de Saint Ange the French command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant continued to command with about twenty French soldiers. Don Antonio Ulloa, without taking pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session in his Catholic Majesty's name, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently without authority from France or Spain, established monopolies, restricted commerce, and committed several abuses, which rendered him odious
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018532_0012_0FA7B3FAD64DA010"/>
to the colonists. <note place="margin">Spaniards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Louisiana.</note> At last, on the 29th of October 1768, the council issued a decree to oblige him and the principal Spanish officers to leave the province in November following, notwithstanding M. Aubry's remonstrances, and the protest he made against the edict of the council.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Don Ulloa obnoxions to the people.</note> Don Ulloa's conduct had rendered him the more obnoxious, as, from the letter written by the king of France, acquainting Mr. D'Abbadie with the cession he had made to Spain, it appeared that the two kings had agreed, that Louisiana should retain her laws, privileges and customs. The French, nay the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards themselves, all blamed Mr. Aubry's acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for every one was sensible that the king of France never would have directed him to treat Don Ulloa with an obsequiousness which degraded royal authority and the French nation; and that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions could, at most, authorise Mr. Aubry to follow that officer's advice, until the government of Louisiana should be delivered to Spain. Whatever entreaties had been used to persuade Don Ulloa to take possession, and by that measure render the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his authority lawful, he evaded, but did not cease to oppress; so that he lost the esteem which he had acquired by the publication of his voyages; and the colonists having been informed of the severity with which he had governed the city of Quito in Peru, he was only considered as a tyrant, whose sole merit was to be learned in the mathematics.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Threatened with a prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> The superior council, guided by the Intendant and the Attorney General, having threatened him with a prosecution, he declared that, at the Balize, Mr. Aubry had privately delivered to him the command of the colony. As none could conceive that a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine possession ought to authorise the public exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of sovereign power, Ulloa's declaration was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an artifice of the grossest texture; and Mr. Aubry,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018532_0013_0FA7B3FC089DB810"/>
who affirmed the declaration to be true, was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. It made him fall into contempt, and embolden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leaders of the party which opposed him. <note place="margin">Doubts of the public respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</note> These increased the doubts of the public relative to the ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and served to convince every one, that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards did not seriously intend taking possession:—"The cession," said they, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>"was made in 1762, the day before the preliminary articles of peace were signed: near two years elapsed before it was first known by the king's letter to Mr. D'Abbadie: more than another year passed before the arrival of Don Ulloa, who has been above two years in the country and did not yet take possession."<g ref="char:endq">”</g> If the reflections occasioned by these circumstances put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; if the conjectures scattered in the English news-papers, or by the English who came into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, led the inhabitants to think that the cession was fictitious, and a state manaeuvre, their fears were at the same time quieted, since they did not apprehend those evils which the change of sovereignty makes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most unavoidable, even when the new government is milder and more favourable. On the other hand, their indignation was the greater against Don Ulloa, who abused the reasons of state that were supposed to be the cause of his having been sent to Louisiana; who availed himself of Mr. Aubry's imbecility, to establish a species of despotism, the more intolerant, as it shocked the manners of the French nation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Their want of circumspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> To put a stop to this tyranny, it would have been sufficient to commence, with circumspection, a juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical prosecution against him, and inform the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the proceedings. But the council began by issuing a decree for expelling him and the Spaniards. To reduce the people to the necessity of supporting that violence, the leaders excited them to offend the king of Spain, from whom they had received no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and who doubtless would have punished his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018532_0014_0FA7B3FC312BE7E8"/>
had the council proceeded with respect, and used lawful means to transmit to him their grievances. <note place="margin">Indignities, &amp;c. offered.</note> But, indignities were offered to the Spanish flag; a step which rendered the insult personal to the king of Spain, and made him overlook his envoy's misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors. This is not all: the council and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants sent deputies to France, <note place="margin">Deputies sent to France—</note> charged them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the grievances of the colony to their sovereign, and supplicate him to retain the province. Their prayers were accompanied with protestations of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and loyalty. But before the departure of these deputies, the leaders of the faction seduced some members of the council, secretly sent another depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Pensacola; and, without the people's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, offered Louisiana to Great Britain!</p>
            <p>The dread of being called to account, with which the crafty Don Ulloa had often threatened the Intendant and the Attorney General, that he might obstruct their prosecutions, and silence them, relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his own conduct, was doubtless the sole cause of that desperate step, the authors of which might have foreseen the unsuccessful issue, had they not been bereft of their senses. It is true that there has been no public inquiry on that head; and therefore, the public has no juridical proof of this fact; but the characteristics of such inquiry as was made, its terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying apparatus, its result, and the concerted silence of those by whom it was directed, sufficiently confirm not only what is openly said among the English, but what the inhabitants of Louisiana whisper to each other, when complaining of their miseries with which the perfidiousness of their leaders had loaded them, though not accomplices of their crimes. It is also said, that the governor of West-Florida was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to countenance the treason and revolt of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a prince then in peace with Great Britain: it is affirmed that he sent to Mr. Aubry the original
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018532_0015_0FA7B3FCEFB902B0"/>
offers he had received, and that Don Ulloa, who had not yet sailed, carried them with him to Europe for his justification. Why then did not Mr. Aubry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that paper to confound the conspirators? They would have been looked upon with execration by the people whom they had betrayed, and the disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances would have immediately subsided. Can it be believed, that the governor of Florida insisted on se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, as it is intimated by some persons who would be glad to apologize for Mr. Aubry's conduct respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter? Had the intestine divisions, which then rent the British colonies of North-America, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the British governor to discover the conspiracy in order to prevent the fatal consequences of so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an example, would not secrecy have deprived him of the only fruit he could expect from his policy?</p>

               <note place="margin">—Never heard of.</note> Monsieur de Sacier, one of the council, with two other Gentlemen of the colony, who were sent to France with the edict of the superior council, and to implore the protection of the king, as before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were imprisoned on their arrival, and have never been heard of since.</p>
            <p>During six months, which elapsed before news could be received from Europe, the unhappy colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists vainly flattered themselves with hopes of being justified for the steps they had taken by the court of France. <note place="margin">Gen. O'Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's arrival at the Balize.</note> On the 23rd of July 1769, news was brought to New Orleans of the arrival of General O'Riley at the Balize, with eighteen transports, followed by ten more from the Havanna, having four thousand five hundred troops on board, and loaded with stores and ammunition. This intelligence threw the town into the greatest consternation and perp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018532_0016_0FA7B3FDB540DFA0"/>
determined to oppose the landing of the Spaniards, and sent couriers requiring the Germans and Acadian Neutrals to join them. On the 24th an express ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from General O'Riley, which was read by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Aubry to the people in church, by this they were informed that he was sent by his Catholic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to take possession of the colony, but not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress the inhabitants; and that when he should be in possession, he would publish the remaining part of the orders he had in charge from the king his master; and should any attempt be made to oppose his landing, he was resolved not to depart until he could put his majesty's commands in execution.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Deputies sent to meet him.</note> The people, dissatisfied with this ambiguous message, came to a resolution of sending three deputies to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral O'Riley, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Messieurs Grandmaison town-major, La Friniere attorney-general, and De Mazant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly captain in the colony's troops, and a man of very considerable property; these gentlemen acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that the inhabitants had come to a resolution of abandoning the province, and demanded no other favour than that he would grant them two years to remove themselves and effects. The general received the deputies with great politeness, but did not enter into the merits of their embassy, farther than assuring them, that he would comply with every reasonable request of the colonists; that he had the interest of their country much at heart, and nothing on his part should be wanting to promote it; that all part tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should be buried in oblivion, and all who had offended should be forgiven: to this he added every thing that he imagined could flatter the expectations of the people. On the first of August the deputies returned, and made public the kind reception the general had given them, and the fair promises he had made. The minds of the people were now greatly tranquilized, and those who had before determined
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018532_0017_0FA7B3FE6CD8FCD0"/>
suddenly to quit their plantations now resolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main until their crops were off the ground.</p>

               <note place="margin">His arrival &amp; disembarking of the troops at New orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> On the 16th of August 1769, General O'Riley with the frigate, transports and troops on board ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived opposite to New Orleans. On the 18th the troops disembarked, and the general took possession in form, of New Orleans and the province of Louisiana, in the name of his Catholic Majesty, as quietly as a French governor would have done in the happiest times; and on the 25th, <note place="margin">Attorney-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers arrested.</note> ordered the attorney gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and twelve others amongst the principal inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to be arrested.</p>
            <p>Of these thirteen, no more than one was released: this was the printer, who produced the positive orders which the intendant had given him, for printing the decree issued against Don Ulloa, and several other writings. A few days before the proceedings began, a young gentleman nearly related to the attorney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and one of the prisoners, feigned a design of forcibly rescuing himself from the soldiers who guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. He received several wounds, which give him that death which he sought. The proceedings against the eleven others, were conducted in a military manner by Gen. O'Riley, and the members of the court were mostly Spanish officers. <note place="margin">Sentence of the Council War.</note> The council of war pronounced their sentence on those proceedings. In vain did the attorney general and the other prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers demand to be tried by the French laws. These would not have proved favourable to their accusers.

Had they really deserved that fate, their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the less criminal, in the eyes of those who are not stupid enough to reverence authority when trampling upon the laws. The sentence of the court martial dishonours the authors and tools of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice; it dishonours no others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:018532_0018_0FA7B3FF8A71E3A0"/>
The six other state prisoners were sent to fort Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro in the island of Cuba, whence they were released after one year's confinement. The estates of the eleven persons, who were condemned by the court martial, were confiscated, according to the practice of most countries; a practice as impolitic as it is unjust. It reflects disgrace on princes, occasions the impunity of the greatest crimes, and often multiplies the number of criminals. Many might be virtuous enough not to skreen a guilty kinsman from justice; but few have sufficient magnanimity to see with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference the estate of that kinsman pass into the prince's coffers, or those of his ministers. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny has not this sole reason seduced to engage in conspiracies or rebellions, which they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have wished to destroy: in such cases it frequently happens that the prince, whom consiscations cause to behold as an enemy, is deservedly opposed for his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paciousness or inattention to his own interest.</p>

The indignity offered to Spain was the ostensible cause of their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but whatever their crime might have been, France alone ought to have had cognizance of it. If the accused were guilty of nothing else; or if, for state reasons, it was thought proper to mention that offence only, the king of Spain would have caused his name to be for ever blessed in the colony, had he, a judge in his own cause, generously forgiven. The measures that have been adopted, have produced a very different effect. They are nearly the same as those of the Portuguese government, which contrived Father Malagrida's being burnt by the inquisition, on the pretence of his having boasted that he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conversed with the Holy Virgin; but whose
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018532_0019_0FA7B40048E82AA8"/>
real crime was an attempt against his sovereign's life, in order to make another family ascend the throne. Crimes like these, openly perpetrated by the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration against the laws, common sense and public safety; can no where be palliated with the pretence of necessity. Whatever those who advise them may think on the subject, they betray their country and their sovereign himself. In free states, where the personal safety of the meanest individual is as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresting to the whole nation as that of the greatest, crimes of this kind are never seen. They can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in such countries only, where despotism is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished; where a few, favoured slaves, reduce the rest secretly to wish for the annihilation of those whom they seemingly adore.</p>
            <p>The same disordered brains which projected the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal prosecutions carried on against the factious lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Louisiana, have doubtless fancied, that they would deserve immortality for a masterly stroke of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, <note place="margin">Abolition of the laws of Louisiana.</note> when they procured the abolition of the laws, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and superior council of Louisiana, under the pretence of a decree issued against Don Ulloa.

The shadow of a tribunal was established under the name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bildo government, that is civil government, but the governor and his assessor are in fact the only judges. Since the judgments given by them jointly have the same virtue as those of that Cabildo government, few are so unskilful as to apply to this tribunal. Nay, who would dare to do it except in trifling matters? Was it likewise believed that, for the governor and his assessor's conveniency, the substituting of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish language to the French, in all the juridical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Louisiana, where the inhabitants under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the French language only; the impartial dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

This was solemnly approving the seditious nomination of the members of Mr. Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault's and the Attorney-General's making; it was therefore arrogantly annulling the protest which Mr. Aubry had entered in behalf of the king of France and the public, against that nomination, and all the decrees issued out of that tribunal during the anarchy; it was depriving those who had been oppressed from the hopes of obtaining redress in the colony. For, the council being abolished; how could any one take the benefit of the French laws, (since trials by peers or juries are disused) or think despotic rulers would allow of applying to sovereign courts for obtaining new trials of the causes, which they themselves may have tried il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legally, or against evidence?

disturbed in the least about the means which can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their grand design. Their eyes being fixed on all those who have a share in the dispensation of wealth and honours, they see them only. Their mercenary zeal prompts them to wish for their being entrusted with iniquitous and inhuman orders, which they alone are fit to execute. Strangers to nature, they are deaf to the voice of justice and the cries of humanity; and, unable to rise by noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous actions, they glory in displaying their zeal for the prince, by wholly loading themselves with that public execration which attends the execution of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary orders. It is not from such abject souls that a prince, inebriated with power, can ever learn that there are moments, not numerous indeed, but yet frequent enough to comfort the oppressed and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise the oppressor—moments, when, after having made himself odious to his subjects; after having weakened and degraded them, he may regret their attachment, the courage which despotism has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to enervate, and the patriotism which it has attempted to destroy.</p>

Is it not amazing, true as it is, that few amongst us know this to be the key to the northern part of the western continent? <note place="margin">Account of the Mississippi.</note> It is the only channel through which that extensive region, bathed by its waters, and enriched by the many streams it receives, communicates with the sea. And here let us further observe, that the Mississippi river may truly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as the great passage made by the hand of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a variety of valuable purposes, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to promote the happiness and benefit of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; amongst which, the conveyance of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of that immense and fertile country, lying west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the United States, down its stream to the Gulf of Mexico, is not the least. To expect the free navigation of the Mississippi is absurd, whilst the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards are in possession of New Orleans, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the entrance to the western country above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; this is an idea calculated to impose only upon the weak. The Spaniards have forts on the Mississippi, and whenever they may think it consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with their interest, they will make use of them to prevent our navigating on it. Treaties are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be depended on; the most solemn have been broken<note n="*" place="bottom">Notwithstanding the free navigation of the Mississippi allowed by the treaty of 1762, General O'Riley, in the year 1769, sent a party of soldiers to cut the hawsers of a British vessel called the Sea Flower, that had made fast to the bank of the river above the town of New Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans; the order was obeyed, and the vessel narrowly escaped being lost.</note>: therefore we learn that no one should put much faith in the princes of any country: for he that trusts to any thing but the operation of their interest, is a poor politician; and he that complains of deceit, where there is an interest to deceived, will ever be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as deficient in understanding.</p>
            <p>The great length and uncommon depth of that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018532_0023_0FA7B406ADC81F90"/>
river, and the excessive muddiness and salubrious quality of its waters, after its junction with the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>souri, are very singular<note n="*" place="bottom">In a half pint tumbler of this water has been found a sediment of two inches of slime. It is, notwithstanding, extremely wholesome and well tasted, and very cool in the hottest seasons of the year; the row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who are then employed drink of it when they are in the strongest perspiration, and never receive any bad effects from it. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of New Orleans use no other water than that of the river, which by keeping in jars becomes perfectly clear.</note>. The direction of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is so crooked, that from New Orleans to the mouth of the Ohio, a distance which does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed 460 miles in a straight line, is about 856 by water. It may be shortened at least 250 miles, by cutting across eight or ten necks of land, some of which are not 30 yards wide. Charlevoix relates that in the year 1722, at Point Coupeé or Cut Point, the river made a great turn, and some Canadians, by deepening the channel of a small brook, diverted the waters of the river into it. The impetuosity of the stream was so violent and the soil of so rich and loose a quality that, in a short time, the point was entirely cut through, and travellers saved 14 leagues of their voyage. The old bed has no water in it, the times of the periodical overflowings only excepted. The new channel has been since sounded with a line of thirty fathoms, without finding bottom.</p>
            <p>In the spring floods the Mississippi is very high, and the current so strong that with difficulty it can be ascended; but that disadvantage is compensated by eddies or counter-currents, which always run in the bends close to the banks of the river with nearly equal velocity against the stream, and assist the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending boats. The current at this season descends at the rate of about five miles an hour. In autumn, when the waters are low, it does not run faster than two miles, but it is rapid in such parts of the river, which have clusters of islands, shoals and sand-banks. The circumference of many of these shoals being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018532_0024_0FA7B4076CBBA130"/>
miles, the voyage is longer and in some parts more dangerous than in the spring. The merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize necessary for the commerce of the upper settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on or near the Mississippi, is conveyed in the spring and autumn in batteaux rowed by 18 or 20 men, and carrying about 40 tons. From New Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans to the Illinois, the voyage is commonly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in eight or ten weeks. A prodigious number of islands, some of which are of great' extent, intersperse that mighty river. Its depth increases as you ascend it. Its waters, after overflowing its banks below the river Ibberville, never return within them again. These singularities distinguish it from every other known river in the world. Below New Orleans the land begins to be very low on both sides of the river across the country, and gradually declines as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches nearer to the sea. This point of land which in the treaty of peace in 1762, is mistaken for an island, is to all appearance of no long date; for in digging ever so little below the surface, you find water and great quantities of trees. The many beaches and breakers, as well as inlets, which arose out of the channel within the last half century, at the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mouths of the river, are convincing proofs that this peninsula was wholly formed in the same manner. And it is certain that when La Salle sailed down the Mississippi to the sea, the opening of that river was very different from what it is at present.</p>
            <p>The nearer you approach to the sea, this truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more striking. The bars that cross most of these small channels, opened by the current, have been multiplied by means of the trees carried down with the streams; one of which stopped by its roots or branches, in a shallow part, is sufficient to obstruct the passage of thousands more, and to fix them at the same place. Such collections of trees are daily seen between the Balize and the Missouri, which singly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018532_0025_0FA7B4086C605230"/>
would supply the largest city in Europe, with fuel for several years. No human force being sufficient for removing them, the mud carried down by the river serves to bind and cement them together. They are gradually covered, and every inundation not only extends their length and breadth, but adds another layer to their height. In less than ten years time, canes and shrubs grow on them, and form points and islands, which forcibly shift the bed of the river.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be asserted, with certainty, respecting its length. Its source is not known, but supposed to be upwards of 3000 miles from the sea as the river runs. We only know that, from St. Anthony's falls, it glides with a pleasant clear stream, and becomes compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively narrow before its junction with the Missouri, the muddy waters of which immediately discolour the lower part of the river to the sea. Its rapidity, breadth, and other peculiarities then begin to give it the majestic appearance of the Missouri which affords a more extensive navigation, and is a longer, broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and deeper river than the Mississippi. It has been ascended by French traders about twelve or thirteen hundred miles, and from the depth of water, and breadth of the river at that distance, it appeared to be navigable many miles further.</p>
            <p>From the Missouri river to nearly opposite the Ohio, the western bank of the Mississippi is (some few places excepted) higher than the eastern. From Mine au fer to the Ibberville, the eastern bank is higher than the western, on which there is not a single discernable rising or eminence, the distance of 750 miles. From the Ibberville to the sea, there are no eminences on either side, though the eastern bank appears rather the higher of the two, as far as the English turn. Thence the banks gradually diminish in height to the mouths of the river, where they are not two or three feet higher than the common surface of the water.</p>

               <note place="margin">Comparison with the Nile.</note> The slime which the annual floods of the river Mississippi leaves on the surface of the adjacent shores, may be compared with that of the Nile, which depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits a similar manure, and for many centuries past has insured the fertility of Egypt. When its banks shall have been cultivated as the excellency of its soil and temperature of the climate deserve, its population will equal that, or any other part of the world. The trade, wealth and power of America will at some future period, depend and perhaps center upon the Mississippi. This also resembles the Nile in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of its mouths, all issuing into a sea that may be compared to the Mediterranean, which is bounded on the North and South by the two continents of Europe and Africa, as the Mexican bay is by North and South America. The smaller mouths of this river might be easily stopped up, by means of those floating trees with which the river during the floods is always covered. <note place="margin">Probability of deepening the channel.</note> The whole force of the channel being united, the only opening then left would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably grow deep as well as the bar.</p>

               <note place="margin">Produce of Louisiana.</note> To judge of the produce to be expected from the soil of Louisiana, let us turn our eyes to Egypt, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia Felix, Persia, India, China, and Japan, all lying in correspondent latitudes. Of these China alone has a tolerable government; and yet it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged they all are, or have been, famous for their riches and fertility. When our wandering imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soars to regions of wealth and terrestrial bliss, it delights in resting on those countries we have just mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Its pleasant climate.</note> Louisiana is agreeably situated between the extremes of heat and cold. Its climate varies as it extends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North. The southern parts, lying within the reach of the refreshing breezes from the sea, are not scorched like those under the same latitudes in Africa; and its northern regions are colder than
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018532_0027_0FA7B40BE4518BE0"/>
those of Europe under the same parallels, with a wholesome serene air, very similar to the South of France and Lisbon. New Orleans, situated in 30d. 2 m. which nearly answers to the northern coasts of Barbary and Egypt, enjoys the same temperature of climate with Marseilles. Not quite two degrees high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the country of the Natchez, the climate is much more uniform and temperate than at New Orleans. And in the country of the Illinois, which lies about 37 degrees, the summer season is nearly the same as at Paris in France.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin"> Objections to the navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mississippi removed.</note> An objection has been often made by misinformed men, otherwise of great abilities, who too credulously believed that the navigation of the Mississippi river, on account of its rapid current, was more difficult than it is in reality. It appears from the calculation made by several skilful and experienced travellers, that in the autumn when the waters are low, the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent descends at the rate of about one and a half or two miles in an hour; and that the waters are in this state more than one half of the year. In the spring when the freshes are up, or at their greatest height, the current runs at the rate of five or six miles. It is true that the navigation would be difficult at that season, to those who sail or row up against the stream; but there is no example of such folly. When the waters of this river are high, the commodities and produce of the interior country are gathered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for exportation with the descending current. And when the waters are low, the produce of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior country is growing to maturity. This is the time for the navigator's importation. Great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages are likewise taken then from eddy currents. At present there are few builders skilful enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct vessels better calculated for that navigation, than those already mentioned. Time and experience will doubtless produce improvements, and render the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation

of this river nearly as cheap as any other. But that the Mississippi can answer every purpose of trade and commerce, <note place="margin">Its advantages for trade and commerce.</note> is proved to a demonstration, by the rapid progress the French, German, and Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian inhabitants on that river, have made. They have attained a state of opulence never before so soon acquired in any new country. And this was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under all the discouragements of an indolent and rapacious government. It may be further asserted, that no country in North-America, <note place="margin">Equal to any country in North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</note> or perhaps in the universe, exceeds the neighbourhood of the Mississippi in fertility of soil and temperature of climate. Both sides of this river are truly remarkable for the very great diversity and luxur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But this value is not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Mississippi, besides, furnishes the richest fruits in great variety, particularly grapes, oranges, and lemons in the highest perfection. It produces silk, cotton, sassafrass, saffron and rhubarb; is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly adapted for hemp and flax, and in goodness of tobacco equals the Brazils; and indigo is at this present a staple commodity, which commonly yields the planter from three to four cuttings. In a word, whatever is rich or rare in the most desirable climates in Europe, seems natural to such a degree on the Mississippi; that France, though the sent few or no emigrants into Louisiana but decayed soldiers, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in indigent circumstances, (and these very poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supplied with the implements of husbandry) soon

               <note place="margin">River missis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippi furnishes fish.</note> The Mississippi furnishes in great plenty several sorts of fish, particularly perch, pike, sturgeon, eel, and calts of a monstrous size. Craw-fish abound in this country; they are in every part of the earth, and when the inhabitants chuse a dish of them, they send to their gardens where they have a small pond dug for that purpose, and are sure of getting as many as they have occasion for. A dish of shrimps is as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily procured: by hanging a small canvas bag with a bit of meat in it to the bank of the river, and letting it drop a little below the surface of the water, in a few hours a sufficient quantity will have got into the bag. Shrimps are found in the Mississippi as far as the Natchez, 348 miles from the sea.</p>

               <note place="margin">Description of the coast and islands about the mouths of the Mississippi.</note> Having glanced at the many andvantages that will result from the cultivation and improvement of the lands in the neighbourhood of the Mississippi, we now proceed with a description of the coasts and islands about the mouths of that river with directions to mariners.</p>
            <p>The coast here is very low and marshy, and it would be difficult to find the entrances of that river, were it not for the houses at the old and new Balize, and the flag staff at the former, which appear some distance at sea. The white clayey colour of the river water remaining unmixed on the surface, is another indication that the Mississippi is not far distant; and though it may be alarming to strangers, as it was to myself when I first beheld it, as it has the appearance of a shoal, yet the soundings are much deeper off the Mississippi than any where else on the coast.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:018532_0030_0FA7B40EF4DF6680"/>
It is an observation said to be founded onexperience, that where the water of the Mississippi incorporates with, and apparently loses itself in the bay of Mexico, the current divides, and generally sets north-easterly and south-westerly, but out of soundings the currents are in a great measure governed by the winds; and if they are not attended to, vessels may be driven south-westward beyond the Balize into the bay of St. Bernard, which is reported to be full of shoals, and consequently a very dangerous navigation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Directions to Mariners.</note> To come to an anchor off the Balize, vessels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the land ought to bring the old Balize to bear about W by S, and the new Balize nearly W N W; they will then be about two miles distant from, and opposite to the East pass, or mouth, in 13 or 14 fathom wather: and the strong N E and S E winds always occasion great swells off the Balize, yet when anchored as above directed they may ride in safety; except a S E wind, which is the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as it blows directly on shore, should come on so violent as to part them from their anchors, and prevent their carrying sail; in which case, if care has not been taken to obtain a good offing, they will drift either on the mud banks into the pass ala Loutre, which has only eight feet water, or into the bay Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where they will be in a critical situation, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the shoal water for which that bay is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Precautions.</note> The best precaution against the consequences of a south-east wind will be to get under way before the strength of the gale comes on, and to steer about N by W half W for the island called Grand Gosier distant 7 leagues. In sailing round the south westermost part of which, care should be taken to steer clear of a shoal that runs out from it W S W about two miles, which being passed, vessels should luff up, until the S W end of the island bears nearly S E two miles;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018532_0031_0FA7B40FB2D3B030"/>
there is then good anchoring in three and an half fathoms soft bottom.</p>
            <p>There is another safe anchoring place in 2 fathom water, just within the S W point of the Isle au Briton; from the S W end of which a shoal runs out nearly half a mile. This island is about a league to the west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Grand Gosier, and there is good anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them in 3 and 4 fathoms.</p>
            <p>If a south-east gale should happen at night, it would be impossible to see the way between the above islands. In that case, a N N E course from the mouths of the Mississippi will clear the chandelures, situated about 3 leagues to the north-ward of the Isle au Grand Gosier, which are better than 9 leagues in length. As all the above islands are low and have no trees growing on them, they cannot be seen at any distance. On that account it will be necessary when sailing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, to keep a good look out. There is drift wood on these islands, and fresh water may be got by digging. The water between the chandelures and the peninsula of Orleans is full of shoals, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation fit only for small craft.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Mouths of the Mississippi how formed.</note> The river Mississippi discharges itself into the gulph of Mexico by several mouths of different depths of water: in the year 1772, that called the south-east in latitude 29 d 10 m North, and longitude 89 d 10 m West from London afforded 12 feet; the East mouth, which before the above period furnished 15 feet, had then no more than 10 and an half feet; and the north-east only 9 and an half feet on the bar of it. The latter now affords 12 feet, and S W has sixteen feet. The bars are subject to shift; but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after entering the river, there is from 3 to 7, 8 and 10 fathoms as far as the south-west pass, and from thence 12, 15, 20 and 30 fathoms is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral depth for 1142 computed miles to the Missouri river.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:018532_0032_0FA7B4106B7B87E0"/>
The shoals about the Mississippi are formed from the trees, mud, leaves, and a variety of other matter continually brought down by the waters of the river, which being forced along by the current, until repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the tides, then subside, and occasion what are commonly called the bars: their distance from the entrances of the river, which is generally about 2 miles, depend much on the winds being accidentally with or against the tides: when these bars accumulate sufficiently to resist the tides and the current of the river, they form numerous small islands, which by constantly increasing, join to each other and at last reach the continent.</p>
            <p>All the land bordering the mouths of the Missis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippi has been made in this manner. It is more than probable that the whole of the country on both sides of the river as far as the Ibberville, a distance of 204 miles, has been produced in a succession of ages by the vast quantities of mud, trees, leaves &amp;c. brought down by the annual floods which overflow the banks of the Mississippi; the large trunks or bodies of trees which have been frequently found in digging in the above distance, seems to confirm this opinion; and it may reasonably be supposed, that the lakes on each side of this river are parts of the sea not yet filled up: thus the land is annually raised and constantly gains on the sea. The old Balize, a small port erected by the French on a little island, was in the year 1734, at the mouth of the river, it is now two miles above it. In the year 1766, Don Antonio D'Ulloa erected some barracks on a small island, the new Balize, (to which he gave the name of St. Carlos) for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of pilots, and other purposes, being near the south-east entrance of the river, and a more dry a higher situation than any there abouts. There was not the least appearance of this island 30 years ago<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Whatever doubts may arise respecting the above account, there are not instances wanting to prove that some other parts of the earth have been formed in a similar manner, as will appear by the following facts.</p>
                  <p>Havre de Grace is situated in the Pays de Caux, about 18 leagues from Rouen, and as much from Dicppe, on the point of a large valley at the mouth of the river Seine, in the latitude of 49 degrees 30 minutes North. It stands upon a plain spot of ground, full of water, which contribute not a little to its security. This ground was originally gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the sea, and formed from the large quantities of sand, gravel, and mud, which the force of the tide and the river conveyed to that place in a long course of time and by insensible degrees. And as it was formed, so it seems to be daily increased by the same means: for we are assured by a late author<note n="*" place="bottom">Piganiol de la Force, Nouvelle description de la France, tom. ix. page 593.</note> that about 70 or 80 years ago, the sea, at high water, came very near that gate of the city which is next the harbour; whereas now the high water mark is nearly half a mile distant from it. So that it appears, the sea has gradually given way, and, as it were, retired to leave the earth at liberty to enlarge and extend itsels. Nor ought we to be surprised at this. The ground on which the city of Tyre is built, though now united to the continent, being formerly part of an island. Venice would have had the same fate long ago, had it not been for the great pains the inhabitants have taken to prevent it: the sea formerly washed the walls of Ravenna, which is now a league distant from it; nor are other instances of this kind wanting, even in the same kingdown of France, particularly Frejus and Narbonne, a few centuries ago, were on the shore of the Mediterranean; but now the one is a league, and the other almost two, distant from it.—Description de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The water is every where deep enough (except at the Willow Points) to admit vessels close to either shore, where instead of letting go an anchor, which would probably be lost among the logs sunk in the bottom of the river, vessels may safely make fast to the trees on the bank; which are generally tall and in such abundance, in some parts, that they prevent the winds from being of that service to vessels in ascending the Mississippi, that might be expected. It will be therefore necessary for expedition sake, to rigg as many topsails as possible, which commonly reach above the trees and are of more use than all the other sails together; however, care must be taken to stand by the halliards to prevent the wind, which frequently comes in very strong puffs, from carrying away the top-masts, sails, &amp;c.</p>

Their entry into this part of the colony was very easy, as they went up a small creek, Tigahoe, in canoes.

There they make refts of the timber they cut, and float down to New Orleans. Many of the planters have saw-mills, which are work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the waters of the Mississippi, in the time of the floods, and then they are kept going night and day till the waters fall.

               <note place="margin">Villages of the Humas and Alibamas.</note> About 60 miles from New Orleans are the villages of the Humas and Alibamas.

            <p>It is truly surprising, that the nations who have successively possessed Louisiana, never endeavoured to obtain an exact knowledge of the sea coast west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the mouths of the Mississippi. The many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and dangers to which vessels are exposed in making, and getting over the shallow and shifting bars of that river, as well as in a long and tedious naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upwards of thirty leagues to New Orleans, would render a harbour to the westward of the Balize, and a water communication with the upper parts of the Mississippi of vast importance. The nature of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018532_0039_0FA7B4196DABD178"/>
slip of land extending upwards of 60 leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that river and the sea, in a westerly course, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates very strongly the probability of a better and more easy communication from that quarter, than that by the river Ibberville through the lakes Ponchartrain and Maurepas. This opinion is fully confirmed by the information received from Natchiabe, an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent chief of the Humas tribe, who inhabit the banks of a creek known by the name of the Chetimachas fork, already mentioned, and which I am now to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe. The Chetimachas forms one of the outlets of the Mississippi about 30 leagues above New Orleans, and after running in a southerly direction about 8 leagues from the river, divides into two branches, one of which runs south-westerly and the other south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easterly, to the distance of 7 leagues, when they both empty their waters into the Mexican Gulph.</p>
            <p>On the Chetimachas, 6 leagues from the Mississippi, is a small settlement of a tribe of Indians of the same name. To this settlement the Chetimachas is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly about 100 yards in width, the depth from 2 to 4 fathoms, when the water is lowest. The courses southerly, without any material winding or shoal, except at its rise from the Mississippi, where there are large collections of drifted logs, which have probably occasioned the sand bank formed at the same place. This bank however extends no farther than 60 yards, and through which a passage might easily be cleared for batteaux. The appear part of this outlet is also obstructed, in several places, by heaps of drifted logs similar to those just mentioned, but as the water, at all times, runs deep under them, they could easily be cleared off. It would be as easy to prevent any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther collection of logs, or sands, at the entrance of this creek, by erecting a spar, with piles or cassoons, a little above it, in an oblique direction with the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Mississippi. That difficulty once overcome,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018532_0040_0FA7B41A6467F9C8"/>
there is no other that can impede navigation from the river to the above mentioned settlement of the Chetimachas village; nor, as these Indians inform, to the Gulph. The banks on both sides of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timachas, are generally higher than those of the Mississippi, and so elevated in some places as never to be overflowed. The ground rises gradually from its banks about 200 yards, and then gently descends to extensive cypress swamps. The natural producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the same as on the Mississippi, but the soil from the extraordinary size and compactness of the canes growing on it, is something superior. If mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures were adopted and pursued with a view to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that communication, there would soon be, on its banks, the most prosperous and important settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that colony.</p>
            <p>Nine miles above the Chetimachas is the <hi>concession</hi> of Monsieur Paris, a pleasant situation and good land. Large herds of cattle are generally kept here, belonging to the inhabitants of Point Coupeé.</p>

            <p>In 1765 a post was established here, and the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, which was a detachment of the 34th regiment, withdrawn in the month of July in the same year.

These forts were situated near the place which, in the treaty of peace in 1762, is described as the mouth of Ibberville river to the North of New Orleans island, and the then boundary-line of the possessions of the two crowns in those parts; but the plenipotentiaries of the two powers were misinformed; for, as we have already observed, the city of New Orleans is not in an island, but on the continent. Or if the tract of land on which that city is situated, can be termed an island, that name can with propriety be applied to it during only two, or at most three months every year, when the Mississippi overflows; an accidental communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with lake Ponchartrain is then opened through the Gut of Ibberville. It may be dignified, during that short period, with the title of river, but dries up as soon as the Mississippi ceases to overflow. At any other time the walking from English to French, now Spanish Manchac, is perfectly dry.</p>
            <p>This place, if attended to, might be of consequence to the commerce of West-Florida; for it may with reason be supposed, that the inhabitants and traders who reside at Point Coupeé, at Natchitoches, Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cappa, the Natchez, on the East side of the Mississippi above and below the Natchez, at the Illinois, and St. Vincents on the Ouabashe, would rather trade at this place than at New Orleans, if they could have as good returns for their peltry and the Produce of their country; for it makes a difference of ten days in their voyage, which is no inconsiderable saving of labour, money, and time. The only difficulty which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses itself to this necessary establishment, is the want of a navigation through the river Ibberville, so that vessels might carry on a constant intercourse betwixt this place and Pensacola without going up the Missis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippi,

which is a more tedious navigation.

The famous Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand Soto ended his discoveries and his life at the entrance of this river, and was buried there. Near 70 leagues up this river the French had a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable post, Natchitoches. It was a frontier on the Spanish settlements, being 20 miles from the fort of Adaies. The French fort was garrisoned by a captain's command. There were forty families settled here, consisting mostly of discharged soldiers and some mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who traded with the Spaniards. A great quantity of tobacco was cultivated at this post, and sold for a good price at New Orleans, being held in great esteem.

Its situation being higher, affords a greater variety of soil, and is in a more favourable climate for the growth of wheat, rye, barley, oats, &amp;c. than the country lower down, and nearer to the sea. The soil also produces, in equal abundance, Indian corn, rice, hemp, flax, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo, cotton, pot-herbs, pulse of every kind, and pasturage; and the tobacco made here is esteemed preferable to any cultivated in other parts of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Hops grow wild; all kinds of European fruits ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to great perfection, and no part of the known world is more favourable for the raising of every kind of stock. The climate is healthy and temperate; the country delightful and well watered; and the prospect is beautiful and extensive, variegated by many inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and fine meadows, separated by innumerable copses, the trees of which are of different kinds, but mostly of walnut and oak. The rising grounds, which are clothed with grass and other herbs of the finest verdure, are properly disposed for the culture of vines; the mulberry trees are very numerous, and the winters sufficiently moderate for the breed of silk worms. Clay of different colours, fit for glass works and pottery, is found here in great abundance; and also a variety of stately timber fit for house and ship building, &amp;c. The elevated, open, and airy situation of this country renders it less liable to fevers and agues (the only disorders ever known in its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood) than some other parts bordering on the Mississippi, where the want of sufficient descent to convey the waters off occasions numbers of stagnant ponds, whose exhalations infect the air.</p>
            <p>This country was once famous for its inhabitants, who from their great numbers, and the state of society they lived in, were considered as the most civilized Indians on the continent of America.

they rendered every service in their power. Their hospitality, it seems, was repaid in such a manner, that they determined to get rid of their guests; for on the eve of St. Andrew 1729, <note place="margin">Massacre of the French in 1729.</note> they surprised the fort, and put the whole garrison to death. At the same time they made a massacre of the inhabitants, in which upwards of 500 were killed; some of the women and children they made prisoners; and very few of either sex escaped. The whole colony armed to revenge their slaughtered countrymen, and they had several skirmishes with the Natchez, in which the success was various. <note place="margin">Destruction of Natchez In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in 1730.</note> In 1730, Monsieur De Perrier de Salvert, brother to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, arrived from France, with the rank of lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-general in Louisiana, and 500 regular troops, who joined the troops and militia of the colony.

The French having brought two or three mortars, threw some shells into the fort, which making a havoc amongst their women and children, so terrified the Indians, unused to this sort of war, that they surrendered at discretion, and were conducted to New Orleans; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few who had escaped to the Chickasaws, with their hunters who were providing provisions for their garrison. Nothing now remains of this nation but their name, by which their country continues to be called.

About a mile and a half up this river, the high lands are close on the right and are much broken.

The country round is very fit for settlements. For four or five miles above this place, on both sides of the river, the land is rich, and not so much drowned, nor so uneven, as some parts lower down. About six miles and a half further, there is a rapid water, stones and gravel bottom 160 yards in length; and in one place a firm rock almost across the river, and as much of it bare, when the water is at a moderate height, as confines the stream to nearly 20 feet; and the channel is about 4 feet deep.</p>

The water of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sissippi, when the river is high, runs up the Yazou several miles, and empties itself again by a number of channels, which direct their course across the country, and fall in above the Walnut hills.

and pleasant country, greatly resembling that about the Natchez, particularly, in the luxuriancy and diversity of its soil, variety of timber, temperature of climate and delightful situation. It is remarkably well watered by springs and brooks; many of the latter afford convenient seats for mills. Further up this river the canes are less frequent and smaller in size, and at the distance of 20 miles there are scarcely any. Here the country is clear of underwood and well watered, and the soil very rich, which continues to the Chac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taw and Chickasaw towns. The former is situated on the eastern branch of the Yazou, an hundred miles from the mouth of that river, and consists nearly of 140 warriors: the towns of the latter are about 15 miles West of the north-west branch 150 miles from the Mississippi. They can raise upwards of 500 warriors. The above branches unite 50 miles from the Missis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippi, following the course of the river; the naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their junction, commonly called the fork, is practicable with very large boats in the spring season, and with smaller ones a considerable way further, with the interruption of but one fall, where they are obliged to make a short portage, 20 miles up the north-west branch, and 70 miles from the Mississippi. The country in which the Chactaw and Chickasaw towns are situated, is said to be as healthy as any part of this continent, the natives scarcely ever being sick. Such of them as frequent the Mississippi, leave its banks as the summer approaches, lest they might partake of the fevers that sometimes visit the low swampy lands bordering upon that river. Wheat, it is said, yields better at the Yazou that at the Natchez, owing probably to its more northern situation. One very considerable advantage will attend the settlers on the rivér Yazou, which those at the Natchez will be deprived of, without going to a great expence; I mean the building with stone, there being great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this place and the Balize there is not a stone to be seen any where near the river. Though the quantity of good land on the Mississippi and its branches, from the bay of Mexico to the river Ohio, a distance of nearly one thousand miles, is vastly great, and the conveniences attending it; so likewise we may esteem that in the neighbourhood of the Natchez, and of the river Yazou the flower of it all.</p>
            <p>About a mile and a half up the Yazou river, on the North side, there is a large creek, which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with the Mississippi above the river St. Francis, about 100 leagues higher up, by the course of the river. It passes through several lakes by the way. At the distance of twelve miles from the mouth of the river Yazou, on the South side, are the Yazou hills.

It runs through an immensely rich and fertile country. About ten or twelve miles up this river from the Mississippi there was formerly a fort, garrisoned generally by a company of Spanish soldiers, for the purpose of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the trade carried on between New Orleans and the several villages of St. Genevieve, &amp;c. and particularly for defending the commerce with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kansaw

No settlements were made here, except one or two for the immediate accommodation of the garrison. The inundation of the Mississippi, about three years ago, occasioned the evacuation of the above post, and the establishment of another on the northern bank of the river 36 miles higher up. This post, consisting of a subaltern's command, six pieces of cannon and eight swivels, was attacked about eighteen months since by a party of Chickasaws, who killed ten soldiers of the garrison, and soon after concluded a peace with the Spaniards. There is a hamlet close to the fort, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited only by merchants and traders. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kansaw river discharges itself into the Mississippi by two channels, about 15 miles from each other; the uppermost is called Riviere Blanche, from its receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a river of that name, reported to be navigable 600 miles, and the soil through which it runs equal in quality to any on the Mississippi.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Bounds of West-Florida.</note> The province of West-Florida is situated on the North side of the Gulph of Mexico, and extends from the river Appalachicola, which is the boundary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and East-Florida, to the Regolets at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

into lake Ponchartrain, thence through the lakes Ponchartrain, and Maurepas, and along the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Ibberville to the Mississippi, thence along the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sissippi to the northernmost part of the 31st deg. of North latitude, thence by a line drawn due East along the South boundary of the state of Georgia to the river Appalachicola, including all the islands within six leagues of the coast, between the Appalachicola and lake Ponchartrain.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">General ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the coast of Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note> I now proceed to make some general observations, which may be of service in making the land when you arrive on the coast of Florida. This is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able many different ways; as by the latitudes, the trenching and direction of the shore, and the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and quality of the bottom, to each of which particular attention must be paid.</p>
            <p>From cape Blaise in 29 d 41 m North latitude, to the Balize at the mouth of the Mississippi, the coast forms a curve, inclining to the northward, for 28 leagues, as far as the East end of Rose island in 30 d 28 m North; from thence the land gradually declines to the southward, as far as Mobille Point in 30d 17 m North about 30 leagues. Dauphin island, and the other islands, including Ship island, stretch nearly West for the space of 20 leagues, and from the North end of the Chandeleurs, which lies near 5 leagues to the South-east of Ship island, the coast runs chiefly to the southward till you arrive at the entrance of the river Mississippi.</p>
            <p>It is likewise to be observed, that in several places there is double land to be seen over the different bays and lagoons: as at St. Andrew's bay; which may be known by a high white s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

the mast head, and at the bay of Pensacola, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of which is remarkable on account of the red cliff opposite to the West end of Role island. There is a large lagoon, a little more than a league to the westward of this cliff, about 3 leagues in length, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a narrow peninsula, over which the double land may easily be seen, with a high red bank on the North side about half way; this seems to distinguish it from any other part of the coast. There is a double land at the entrance of the river Perdido; but it is not easily observed at any considerable distance. The same may also be seen over some parts of Dauphin island, and those to the westward of it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Massacre, Horn and Ship islands, as well as between them; but it appears at so great a distance, that it cannot be mistaken for any part of the coast to the eastward of Mobille Point.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Chande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleur islands.</note> The Chandeleurs, which were 5 in number, when I visited them in the year 1772, extend nearly S by W 9 or 10 leagues.

Care must however be taken, not to go within three quarters of a mile of the inside of the island, it being shoal near that distance from the shore.</p>
            <p>Vessels may go round the North end of it from the sea, in 5 and a half and 6 fathoms, at half a mile from the shore; and afterwards must keep in 4 and a half and 5 fathoms, till the North point <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>It would be necessary for vessels to be well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this road, as easterly winds are frequent on the coast of Florida. There is fresh water to be got any where on the Chandeleurs by digging; besides which it might be met with in a kind of well, at an old hut near the North end. No wood is to be found here but drift wood, of which there is great plenty along shore.</p>
            <p>Nassau Road was first discovered by Dr. Daniel Cox of New Jersey, about the time of King William the 3d, who gave it the name of Nassau, in honour of that prince. Doctor Cox had likewise given the name of the Myrtle islands to those which are still so denominated, before the French called them the Chandeleurs; and they were so named by both, from the candles made of the myrtle wax with which these islands abound.</p>

The banks in general are high, yet in some parts they are subject to be overflowed. There were a number of inhabitants settled on the Amit and Comit, who had slaves, and who raised indigo, cotton, rice, hemp, tobacco, and Indian corn, in great abundance, and all excellent in their kind.

               <note place="margin">Cat Island, and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent parts.</note> Cat island lies about 8 miles eastward of the bay of St. Louis, and 7 miles from the coast: it is 6 miles in length, very narrow, and of an irregular shape, with a large shoal from the East end of it, extending within two miles of Ship island. The soil is poor, producing nothing but pine, some live oak and grass,

and its shore is almost every where covered, or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with an immensity of shells.</p>
            <p>The marshy islands near the peninsula of Orleans, are distant about 3 miles South of Cat island; and between them there is a channel of 9 feet, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to the Regolets through a number of shoals.</p>

               <note place="margin">Ship island.</note> Ship island is situated between 7 and 8 miles East of Cat island, and about 10 miles South of the bay of Biloxi. This island is 9 miles in length and 2 miles in width where broadest. It produces pine trees and grass, and there is a well of tolerable water on it. The western part of this island is very narrow, and for better than three miles there is not a tree on it. A shoal runs out due South, about a mile from the West end. The channel is better than a mile wide with from 4 to 5 and 6 fathoms, but the bar has only 21 feet. In going over it from the sea the course to be steered is due North, keeping the above shoal near half a mile to the eastward, and after fairly passing the end of the island, from the inner part of which lies a shoal, the course proceeds N E until the broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the point of the island bears due South about one mile and a half, where there is between 4 and 5 fathoms. <note place="margin">Directions for anchoring.</note> This is a good place to anchor in the summer time; but is very much exposed in winter, when the northerly winds prevail; and is a very convenient place for shipping the produce of the rivers Pearl, Ibberville and Amit, and the lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain.</p>

            <p>Massacre is nearly 9 miles long and very narrow, it is remarkable for a grove of trees in the middle, which is the more particular as there is not a tree any where else on the island.</p>
            <p>The distance between Massacre island and the main, is about 10 miles, from 2 to 3 fathoms all the way across; except one large shoal called la Grand Bature, which stretches out from the main land about a league, with 2 or 3 feet water on it, and in some places not so much.

The West end for between 3 and 4 miles, is a narrow slip of land with some dead trees; the rest is covered with thick pines, which come close to the waters edge on the East side, forming a large bluff. There is the remains of an old French post on the South side of the island; about two miles from that bluff are a few old houses on the North side opposite to it, near which are large hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks of oyster shells, now covered with dwarf cedar and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

It has a small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fort, built with brick, and a neat square of barracks for the officers and soldiers. The town is
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:018532_0069_0FA7B43BEA0435D8"/>
pretty regular of an oblong figure, on the West bank of the river, where it enters the bay.</p>
            <p>There is a considerable Indian trade carried on here. Mobille, when in possession of his Britannic Majesty, sent yearly to London, skins and furs amounting from 12 to 15,000 pounds sterling: it was then the only staple commodity in this part of the province. The British garrison at Mobille surrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the arms of his Catholic Majesty in the year 1780.</p>
            <p>The bay of Mobille terminates a little to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eastward of the town, in a number of marshes, and lagoons: which subject the people to fevers and agues in the hot season.</p>

               <note place="margin">Mobille River.</note> The river of Mobille is divided into two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal branches about 40 miles above the town: one of which is called the Tansa, falls into the East part of the bay; the other empties itself close by the town, where it has a bar of 7 feet; but there is a branch a little to the eastward of this, called Spanish river, where there is a channel of 9 or 10 feet, when the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is high, but this joins Mobille river about two leagues above the town.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Alibama River.</note> Two or three leagues above the Tansa branch, the Alibama river falls into Mobille river, after running from the N E a course of about 130 miles; that is from Alibama fort, situated at the confluence of the Coussa, and Talpouse, both very considerable rivers; on which and their branches are the chief settlements of the upper Creek Indians.</p>
            <p>The French fort at Alibama was evacuated 1763, and has not since been garrisoned. Above the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Alibama and Mobille, the latter is called the Tombecbe river, <note place="margin">Tombecbe River.</note> from the fort of Tombecbe situated on the West side of it, about 96 leagues above the town of Mobille. The source of this river, is reckoned to be about 40 leagues higher up, in the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:018532_0070_0FA7B43CAF5AB9F8"/>
country of the Chickasaws. The fort of Tombecbe was taken possession of the English, but abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again in 1767, by order of the commandant of Pensacola. The river is navigable for sloops and schooners about 35 leagues above the town of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bille. The banks, where low, are partly overflowed in the rainy seasons, which adds greatly to the soil, and adapts it particularly to the cultivation of rice. The sides of the river are covered in many places with large canes, so thick that they are almost impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable; there is also plenty of remarkable large red and white cedar, cypress, elm, ash, hickory and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds of oak. Several people have settled on this river, who find the soil to answer beyond expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The lands near the mouth of the Mobille river are generally low: as you proceed upwards, the land grows higher, and may with great propriety be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three stages. First, low rice lands on or near the banks of the river, of a most excellent quality. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what are called by the people of the country second low grounds, or level flat cane lands about 4 or 5 feet higher than the low ricelands. And, thirdly the high upland or open country. The first or low lands extend about an half or 3 quarters of a mile from the river, and may almost every where be easily drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and turned into most excellent rice fields, and are capable of being laid under water at almost all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the year. They are a deep black mud or slime, which have in a succession of time been accumulated, or formed by the overflowing of the river.</p>
            <p>The second low grounds being, in general, formed by a regular rising of about 4 or 5 feet higher than the low lands, appears to have been originally the edge of the river. This second class or kind of land is in general extremely rich and covered with large timber and thick strong canes, extending in width
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:018532_0071_0FA7B43D6967BF28"/>
upon an average three quarters of a mile, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a perfect level. It is excellent for all kinds of grain, and well calculated for the culture of indigo, hemp, flax or tobacco.</p>
            <p>At the extremity of these second grounds, you come to what is called the high or upland, which is covered with pine, oak, and hickory, and other kinds of large timber. The soil is of a good quality, but much inferior to the second or low land. It answers well for raising Indian corn, potatoes, and every thing else that delights in a dry light soil. Further out in the country again, on the West side of this river, you come to a pine barren, with extensive reed swamps and natural meadows or savannahs which afford excellent ranges of innumerable herds of cattle.</p>
            <p>On the East of the river Mobille, towards the river Alabama, is one entire extended rich cane country, not inferior perhaps to any in America.</p>
            <p>Whenever portages are made between the Mobille and Cherokee river, or their branches, which are probably but a few miles apart, the Mobille will be the first river for commerce, (the Mississippi excepted) in this part of the world, as it affords the shortest and most direct communication to the sea.</p>

The soundings between the bars of Mobille and Pensacola are pretty regular, except near the bars, where there is deep water along shore, as they stretch out. It is necessary in nearing them, to keep a good offing till their respective marks are on for going over in the deepest channel. Immediately without them there is very deep water, from 7 to 12 and 13 fathoms, oozy bottom, and good holding ground. At the same distance from the shore between them, there is only six or eight fathoms; the bottom in general is fine white sand with black specks and broken shells: in some places a coarser bottom, and in others oozy sand.</p>

distance from the land, occasioned, no doubt, by the conflict between the sea and the bay. The bar runs in a curve from the West breakers all the way to the eastward of the fort, or Signal House on Rose island, the outer end of it extending about a mile without the breakers; it is a flat, hard sand, but the bottom on both sides is soft, oozy ground. After entering on the bar in the deepest channel, the old fort on Rose island bears N E 1-4 N two and a half miles; the middle or highest red cliff, N 1-2 W three and a half miles. In coming from the eastward or westward it is best to keep in six or seven fathoms, till the West declivity of the highest part of the red cliff bears about N 1-2 W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Directions for passing thro' the Bay.</note> When over the bar in five or six fathoms, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to incline a little towards the western reef, which has deep water close to it, in order to avoid the 10 feet bank that there extends about half a mile S W from the point of Rose island. As the line of direction for the deepest water over the bar leads just over the West point of this bank, therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to keep within one and a half or two cables length of the breakers (on the North end of which there are two dry sandy keys) till the West point of Rose island is open with the straggling trees to the southward of Deer Point, at the entrance of St. Rosa channel, when one must haul up to the eastward between them clear of the 10 feet bank. There is a narrow chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of 13 feet between this bank and the point of Rose island. There is also a shoal stretching in a

sweep from the red cliff towards the above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sandy key, therefore care must be taken not to shut in Tartar Point with Deer Point; but as the soundings are regular, there is no fear, unless there be little wind, with the tide of ebb, which sets directly on this shoal, and in that case it is necessary to anchor in time.</p>
            <p>Within Tartar Point the bay is about five or six miles broad, stretching to the North-east towards the town; which is situated on the main land, about eight miles from Rose island. From thence the bay turns more to the eastward, and is divided into two large branches or arms; one of which continues to the eastward about 18 miles from Pensacola, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the northward nearly the same distance, from three to five mile broad.</p>
            <p>Between Tartar Point and Pensacola there are two large lagoons, the southermost of which runs behind the red cliff.</p>
            <p>All the West side of the bay, which forms a sweep towards the town, is shoal for upwards of half a mile off shore, but the soundings are regular to it. There is no danger in the bay between Pensacola and Rose island, except a shoal that runs from Deer Point, which ought to be attended to in working up or down the harbour. It is the more dangerous, as there is no warning given by the soundings; for from six fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, in a few casts of the lead, you have but as many feet. It runs more than half a mile to the westward from the point. The governor's house in the fort bears from the extremity of it N 1-2 E three and a half miles, and English Point N N E 1-4 E five miles. The best anchorage for large vessels is just a-breast of the town, in four fathoms, about one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>third of a mile off shore; taking care not to bring the governor's house more to the westward than N W 1-4 W, on account of a shoal that runs off from

After him, several other Spanish adventurers visited it, who gave it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent names; as Porta da Anchuse, Bahia de St. Maria, &amp;c. But Pensacola was the proper name of it among the Indians, which it will henceforth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably retain. The first establishment the Spaniards made here was in 1696; when Don Andrea de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivola was appointed governor of this province, which then comprehended a very large tract of land, on the gulph of Mexico. He built a small stocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, which he called fort St. Charles, with a church, &amp;c. just by the red cliff at the entrance of the harbour.</p>
            <p>This place was taken in the year 1719, by the French from Mobille. Pensacola fell at that time an easy prey, having only about 150 men to defend it. Shortly afterwards it was retaken by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, who were again dispossessed by the French in the same year.</p>
            <p>The second time the French made themselves mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, they kept possession till the year 1722, when it was restored to the crown of Spain by treaty. The Spaniards in the interim removed to St. Joseph's bay. About the year 1726, they built a small town on the West side of Rose island, near the present fort, or signal house, which was originally constructed by them, but greatly improved by General Haldimand. The settlement remained there till about the year 1754; but being then partly overflowed in a gale of wind, the town was removed to the place where it now stands. After this country was ceded to the English by the peace of 1762, many places were pointed out as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently

               <note place="margin">Description of the Town of Pensacola.</note> The town of Pensacola is of an oblong form, and lies almost parallel to the beach. It is about a mile in length, and a quarter of a mile in breadth, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts at both ends. At the West end is a fine rivulet, from which vessels are supplied with water. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent fort was built by the writer of this narrative in 1775, with cedar pickets, with 4 block houses at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It takes up a large space of ground just in the middle of the town, which it divides in a manner into two separate towns, and can be of no great service towards the defence of the place, in case an attack be made on it, either by the natives or a civilized enemy.</p>
            <p>The town of Pensacola is surrounded by two pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large brooks of water, which take their rise under Gage hill, a small mount behind the town, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves into the bay, one at each extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the town.</p>
            <p>The town and fort of Pensacola, surrendered to the arms of his Catholic Majesty, in the year 1781, and with them the whole province of West Florida became subject to the king of Spain, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>
            <p>The hopes of a Spanish trade induced many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to settle here, at a great expence, but it did not answer their expectation. The principal objects ought to be the Indian trade, indigo, cotton, rice, hemp, tobacco and lumber, these being the natural produce of the country. Tho' Pensacola stands in a very san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy situation, yet with pains the gardens produce great plenty of vegetables.

About a mile to the eastward of Pensacola, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the English ponit, is the East lagoon, which after turning to the N W 4 or 5 miles, receives the Six Mile Brook.

The spot on which it stands is high, and a very light soil; but its situation being near to the marshes, it is thereby rendered unhealthy, and has been the means of carrying off many of the inhabitants who were sent out in 1766, and were for sometime supported by government, in order to manufacture silk; but either for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per management, or other reasons, nothing of that kind was attempted, and the place is since abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the town destroyed.</p>

There is a shoal near the entrance, and vessels that draw more than 5 or 6 feet cannot be carried into it, even through the deepest channel; but there is from 2 to 4 fathoms afterwards, I ascended it with a boat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The lands in general on each side of the river, <note place="margin">Remarks on the lands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Escambia, and near Pensaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la in West Florida.</note> are rich low or swamp, admirably adapted for the culture of rice or corn, as may suit the planter best; and what give these low lands of superiority over many others, is the great number of rivulets that fall into this river from the high circumjacent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which may easily be led over any part of, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the rice lands, at any season of the year what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Near the mouth of this river are a great number of islands, some of very considerable extent, and not inferior for rice to any in America. The settlements made by Messieurs Tait and Mitchell, Captain Johnson, Mr. M'Kinnon and some others, are very evident proofs of this assertion, who, in the course of two years from their first settlement, had nearly cleared all the expences they had been at in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very considerable establishments; and I am well assured would entirely have done it in another year had not the Spaniards taken possession of the country.</p>
            <p>Further up the river, we meet with other islands, having much higher banks than those below, very fit for raising Indian corn, or pulse of all kinds, with a sufficient proportion of rice land on them also. The large island on which Mr. Marshall made his settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nearly opposite the old stockaded fort, about 28 miles from Pensacola by land and 40 by water, is the uppermost island of any note in the river Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cambia, and is, without doubt, in point of fertility of soil, equal to any thing to be met with in the country. The westerly part of this last mentioned island is high, and not subject to be overflown, unless in remarkable high freshes, and then only some particular low parts of it, the rest is high and well secured against floods; the eastern part of it is low and liable to be overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at some times of the year; the high land extends from about a mile, to a mile and a half from the westermost branch of the river that surrounds i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The country on each side of the river above this island is higher, and as the water is confined in one channel, forms a most beautiful river, with great plenty of good low lands on each side of it for many miles up. The low lands generally extend from a mile and a half to two miles from the banks of the river, and some places more, when we come to a fine high pine country, intermixed with oak and hickory land. There are, on both sides of this river, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of rising grounds or bluffs, which afford delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prospects on the river, and would be elegant situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations for gentlemens seats. The low lands and islands abound with great quantities of white and red oak for staves, which answer well for the West-India market, and an inexhaustible quantity of cypress for lumber and shingles, together with plenty of red and white cedar for building. The open country, or high lands bordering on these low rich lands are generally pine, but of a quality superior to most other pine countries, having generally a good soil for five or six inches deep, and well adapted for raising corn, beans, peas, turnips, potatoes, &amp;c.</p>

But what, in a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, recommends this part of West-Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, is the fine and extensive ranges for cattle which are so frequently to be met with here; it being very common for an ordinary planter to have 200 heads and some 1000 heads, within the vicinity of Pensaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. There is scarcely a stream in these parts but what has water sufficient for saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills, and the country abounds with excellent timber for planks or lumber of all kinds.</p>

The air is pure and healthy, and the planters and negroes enjoy a good state of health the year round. The Indians emphatically call it, on account of the fine streams of water every where to be met with, <hi>the sweet water country.</hi> Great plenty of fish is to be found in this river, and all kinds of wild game are to be met with in great abundance.</p>
            <p>With regard to the face of the country between the Escambia and Pensacola, it is varied with vallies and rising grounds. At about 20 miles from Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacola the soil grows better than it is at the town; the vallies are covered with grass or canes, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed with thickets of laurel, myrtle, and casina. There is generally a rivulet running through each of them, either towards the Perdido or Escambia. The rising grounds are chiefly covered with pines, oak, and hickory.</p>
            <p>The North branch of the bay of Pensacola is only navigable for small vessels. It was formerly well set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on each side. The middle land between the North bay and the Ouyavalana, or Yellow Water, a branch of the East bay, abounds with large tall pines sit for masts, yards, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Middle River.</note> The Yellow Water, or Middle river, enters the East branch of the bay at the N E corner, and after going about five or six leagues up the country, the eastern branch ends in a bason or lake at the bottom of a rising ground, but the western branch I have ascended some leagues further. There are several small islands near the entrance of this river, which produce cypress and small cedars, but the soil is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</p>

            <p>The peninsula between the bay of Pensacola and St. Roses channel, which is from 1 to 3 or 4 miles broad, is in general very poor sandy soil. It produces, in some places, large pines and live oak.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rose Island.</note> Rose island extends along the coast, for the space of near 50 miles, and is no where above half a mile broad. It is very remarkable for its white sandy hummocks, and straggling trees here and there. There is a clump of 4 tall trees close together, which, at a distance, appears like one, about 18 miles from the West end, and another of the same kind about a league further to the east<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The peculiarity of the appearance of Rose island from the sea, and the deep soundings all along it, are of great service to know the coast: there are 9 or 10 fathoms in some places, within a mile or two of the shore; and, when a frigate is within 16 or 17 fathoms, the tops of the trees on the main land may be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried from the quarter deck. The bottom is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fine white sand, with broken shells, and black specks, but in one place off the East end of Rose island, out of sight of land, the bottom is of a coarse gravel, mixed with coral. This ought particularly to be attended to, as it is the only spot with that kind of soundings on the coast: it is of a considerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and there are from 20 to 30 and 40 fathoms on it, or more. There is indeed a coral bottom off the bay of Esperito Sancto, and some other parts on the coast o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Bay of St. Rosa.</note> This is a very extensive bay, stretching about 30 miles to the north-east, and is from 4 to 6 miles broad. There is a bar before it with only 7 or 8 feet where deepest. But afterwards there is 16 or 17 feet, as far as the red bluff on the main land. The channel between this bluff and the East part of Rose island is but narrow, and a little further on, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bay, it is choaked up with a large shoal in some places dry, the deepest water on it is only 4 or 5 feet; so that nothing but very small vessels can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this bay from the sea, and the channel between Rose island and the main, is just sufficient for boats or pettiaugers.</p>
            <p>On the North side of St. Rose's bay, almost oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the entrance from the sea, there are three pretty large branches, which stretch several miles: the westermost, which is the largest, is again subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into smaller branches, all which have deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The other two receive each a considerable rivulet of clear water with a rapid stream. On the banks there is plenty of cedar, &amp;c.</p>

I ascended this river about 25 leagues, where there is settled a small party of the Coussac Indians. The banks of this river, in point of soil and timber, resembles very much those of the river Escambia.</p>

There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise some red hummocks as well as white, which with the trenching of the land may be of service to know that part of the coast.</p>

               <note place="margin">St. Andrew's Bay.</note> The entrance of St. Andrew's bay is between a small island on the right hand, and a narrow penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sula on the left. There is a high white sand hill, which is a remarkable object from the sea: it lies in latitude 30d 06m North, and about 10 leagues to the North-west of Cape Blaise. From the point of the peninsula, there is a large shoal extending for more than two thirds of the way towards the island; which is 2 miles distant, leaving a channel of 17 or 18 feet, but it has a small bar of 13 feet.</p>
            <p>There is anchorage just within St. Andrew's island in 3 fathoms and an half, but it is more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous within the point of the peninsula in 5 fathoms, with the advantage of fresh water, which is easily got by digging.</p>
            <p>St. Andrew's bay runs first to the N W, nearly parallel to the sea shore, for 3 leagues; then it turns to the eastward for about a league, when a large branch breaks off to the S E. The main body conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to the northward for 2 leagues, when it is divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into two large branches, one going to the N E, and the other to the westward. This last, which is the least, reaches within a few miles of St. Rosa's bay. The country between them is low and marshy, and full of fresh water ponds.</p>
            <p>St. Andrew's bay is navigable for any vessels that can go over the bar. There is a large shoal with only 3 or 4 feet, about half way up the first reach, but there is a deep channel on the West side of it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards there is from 3 to 7 fathoms all over the bay. There are no rivers of any consequence, nor can the soil immediately on the bay be much commended; there is however great plenty of large pines, live oak, and cedar.</p>

them near the shore, which easily appears, it being of a whiteish colour. There is from 12 to 18 feet on the greatest part of it, except towards the mouth of St. Joseph's bay, where there is a bank near the middle, between St. Joseph's point and the main land, with only 7 or 8 feet, and 4 fathoms just within; but there is a very good channel with 3 fathoms on the bar, between that bank and St. Joseph's point, on the right hand going in.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">St. Joseph's Bay.</note> In going into St. Joseph's bay it is requisite to keep within a cable and a half or two cables length of the peninsula, in five or four and a half fathoms, as it shoals regularly towards the point, from which a spit of sand runs out a little way; and when in three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms to haul round gradually, still keeping near two cables length off shore. The bar is narrow, and immediately within it there is from four to six and a half fathoms soft ground. The end of the peninsula forms two or three points, from each of which a small spit runs off for a little distance, which may be known by the discoloured water on them. This is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent harbour; in which the best place for anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is just within the peninsula, opposite to some ruins that still remain of the village of St. Joseph. There the Spaniards had a post, which they abandoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1700, but they took possession of it again in 1719. There is very good water to the got here by digging, and on the North side of the bay are two or three small fresh water brooks, opposite to which are three or four fathoms close to the shore. In the year 1717, the French erected a fort which they called Croevcoeur, a mile to the northward of a brook in St. Joseph's bay, opposite to the point of the peninsula, but abandoned in the next year, on the representation of the governor of Pensacola that it belonged to his Catholic Majesty. The bay is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the figure of a horse-shoe, being about twelve
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:018532_0085_0FA7B44DE99E0D80"/>
miles in length, and seven across where broadest. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bottom of it are a few small islands, and the water is so shoal that a boat can hardly go near the shore.</p>
            <p>The soil on the North side of the bay is very sandy, but there are some spots near the ruins of St. Joseph's that are covered with a kind of verdure, and produce plenty of grapes, some of which are large, of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple colour, and pretty good to the taste: they were probably planted there by the Spaniards. There are here likewise some small cabbage trees, of which there are great numbers on St. George's islands beyond Cape Blaise, and on all the coast to the eastward. These cabbage trees do not grow above the height of 20 feet; the bud, or unformed leaves in the heart being boiled has somewhat the taste of cabbage, but is more delicious.</p>
            <p>A very good establishment might be made here for a fishery, as the settlers might make salt on the spot to cure the bass, rock, cod, grouper, red mullet, and other kinds of fish, which are here in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and, when well cured, are little if at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to those brought from the northward.</p>

The gaps here and there upon it, and the water in the bay appearing through them from the mast-head, together with the trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the land about NNW, and SSE, for near four leagues, make it easily known. The trees about Cape Blaise are very thick, and there is a remarkable single tree, like a bush, that stands without the others to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the point. In case of an easterly wind, there is safe anchorage opposite the thickest trees in six or seven fathoms, about one or two miles off shore; and there is a large pond of fresh water near the beach, about three or four miles to the eastward of Cape

               <note place="margin">Cape Blaise.</note> Cape Blaise, where it ends in a low point near two miles from the trees, in latitude 29d 40m N, is not only remarkable from the aforesaid circumstances, but likewise on account of the irregular soundings that are found a great way out at sea from it. There is a spit of land that runs about two miles from the point in a SSE direction; and there are several banks of three or four fathoms, at the distance of six or seven miles, with deep water from seven to ten fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms between them. There are even some banks of five and six fathoms almost out of sight of land from the mast-head; but though they may alarm a stranger, there is no danger in going near enough to make the land plain.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Cape St. George's.</note> There is another cape or point of land about six leagues to the eastward of Cape Blaise, being an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow of the largest of St. George's islands, nearly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the river Apalachicola. This point lies in 29d 38m N. There is a large shoal running out from it a considerable way, but how far has not yet been ascertained. The coast between it and Cape Blaise forms a kind of hollow bay, with deep sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and a soft bottom. There are two islands to the North-west of St. George's cape; that nearest to it is small, and remarkable for a clump of straggling trees on the middle of it; the other is a pretty large island of a triangular form, and reaches within three leagues of Cape Blaise, having a passage at each end of it for small craft into the bay, between these islands and the river Apalachicola: but this bay is full of shoals and oyster banks, and not above two or three feet water at most in any of the branches of that river.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="unknown:018532_0087_0FA7B44F6CAEFED0"/>
West-Florida, I shall conclude with a few general observations on the seasons, winds, tides, &amp;c. As most of the bars lie a considerable way without the entrance of the bays and rivers, the water seldom rises or falls on them above a foot; but in the bays or channels it rises two or three feet. The tides are irregular, and seem to be governed in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by the winds; but not always by that wind which blows directly on the spot. Though there is generally about 12 hours flood and 12 hours ebb, yet it often happens that there are two tides of each in the space of 24 hours; and sometimes the tide will run one way for the space of 18 hours together, and only five or six hours the contrary, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be said with certainty on this subject. By reason of the trade winds blowing in the Atlantic ocean, and continuing into the bay of Mexico, it is natural to suppose that the water, being there hemmed in, will of course force a passage out where it finds the least resistance; which is through the gulph of Florida. From this general principle it should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that on the coast of West-Florida it ought to run from West to East, which in some measure would account for the shoals being found at the East end of all the islands on this coast, and deep water on the West ends; but in a large bay or Mediterranean sea like that of Mexico, where there are so many rivers, bays, &amp;c. the general course of the current must be greatly disturbed. From this proceeds that irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is observable on the North side of the bay of Mexico, where the tide of ebb always sets to the eastward near the shore, and the flood from the southward or S E: what it may do in the offing has not yet been examined, nor will it be easily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>

            <p>From the winds that prevail in general on this coast during the months of April, May, and to the middle of June, the weather is mild. The sea and land breezes are pretty regular, and they generally conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue so all the summer. In July, August, and most of September, there are frequent squalls, with much rain, thunder, and lightning; and sometimes gales of wind from the South and South-west for several days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. From the middle of October to the end of March, the northerly winds prevail, which at times blow very hard during that season; when the wind changes to the eastward or southward of that point, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attended with close, hazy, or foggy weather.</p>
            <p>It ought to be observed in sailing in the Gulph of Mexico, to be very careful of logs or driftwood in the night time; for when the waters of the Mississippi are high, that river disgorges an immense number of large logs, or trees, which being driven by the winds and currents all over the gulph, may do considerable damage to vessels under full sail.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:018532_0089_0FA7B4534DECAE98"/>
I SHALL here subjoin some Remarks on the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugas, &amp;c. as heretofore published by George Gauld, Esquire.</p>
            <p>AS a competent knowledge of the situation of the Dry Tortugas is absolutely necessary for the navigation to and from the North side of the bay of Mexico, and from the West-Indies through the Gulph of Florida, a few general remarks concerning them may not be unacceptable to the public at this time.</p>
            <p>They consist of ten small islands, or keys, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ENE and WSW for ten or eleven miles, at the distance of about thirty leagues from the nearest part of the coast of Florida, forty from the island of Cuba; and fourteen leagues from the westermost of the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida keys. They are all very low, but some of them covered with mangrove bushes, and may be seen at four leagues distance. The southwestermost keys, which, in going from Pensacola, Mobille, or the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sissippi, is the corner to be turned, and coming from Cape Antonio the point to be avoided, lies in 24d 32m North latitude, and about 83d 50m West lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich; the variation of the compass, by a medium of several observations, is seven degrees East. A reef of coral rocks runs about a quarter of a mile S W from these keys, the water on which is discoloured; and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, wherever there is danger it may easily be seen from the mast-head in the day time. There is a large bank of brown coral rocks, intermixed with white patches of sand, about five or six miles to the west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Tortugas, with very irregular soundings from six to twelve fathoms; the bottom appears very plainly, and though it may be alarming to strangers, yet there is no danger. You will find from thirteen to seventeen fathoms between this bank and the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="unknown:018532_0090_0FA7B45497EFD2A8"/>
If you are bound to the eastward, and meet with a strong easterly gale, which is frequent there in the summer season, you may safely come to an anchor in five or six fathoms, under the lee of the long sandy island to the northward of the S W key, about a quarter of a mile off shore. The bank of soundings extends only about five or six leagues to the south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Tortugas, but much farther to the west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and all the way to the northward along the Florida shore. This is a lucky circumstance for the safety of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>vigation in those parts, as caution in soundings may prevent any danger in the night time; for the soundings are extremely regular all along this bank to the northward, almost to Cape Blaise, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 29d 41m: so that by the latitude and depth of water, we generally know how far we are to the eastward or westward. There is a space of several leagues together, from twenty to fifty fathoms, but from fifty or sixty it deepens fast to seventy, eighty, and soon after no ground.</p>
            <p>From the bar of Pensacola to the Dry Tortugas the true course is S 30d E 134 leagues, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore SE by S by the compass will carry you clear of them to the westward; but it will be both prudent and necessary to sound frequently when you get into the latitude of 26d and 25m, and never stand in to less than thirty fathoms in the night time, till you are past the latitude of 24d 30m, when you may haul up S E by E or E S E, which will carry you near to the Havanna.</p>
            <p>There is a broad channel over the bank to the eastward of the Tortugas, of ten to seventeen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, which, in going to and from the coast of West-Florida, &amp;c. might occasionally cut off a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>al of the distance; but that passage is by no means to be attempted, unless you can see the Tortugas dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, and keep within two or three leagues of the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:018532_0091_0FA7B456153D2DF8"/>
eastermost of them, as there is a coral bank of only twelve feet at the distance of five leagues, and farther on towards Cayo Marques, the westermost of the Florida keys, there is a very dangerous and extensive bank of quicksand, on many parts of which there are no more than four or five feet of water. It is of a remarkable white colour, and may be easily seen and avoided in the day time.</p>
            <p>HAVING now finished my intended narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I shall close it with the following obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon the probable consequences that will arise to the United States of America, from the possession of so extensive a country, abounding with such a variety of climate, soil, and productions; refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my reader for his further information upon the subject, to the Philosophical Essays published in London in 1772, concerning the state of the British empire on this continent.</p>
            <p>There is some amusement at least in reflecting upon the vast consequences, which some-time or other must infallibly attend the settling of America. If we consider the progress of the empires which have hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isted in the world, we shall find the short duration of their most glorious periods, owing to causes which will not operate against that of North America. Those empires were formed by conquest; a great many nations different in character, language and ideas, were by force jumbled into one heterogeneous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: it is most surprising that such diss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nant parts should hold together so long. But when the band of union was weakened, they returned to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and natural separation: language and national character formed many sovereignties out of the former connected varieties. This, however, will be very different with North America. The habitable parts of which, including the dominions of Britain
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:018532_0092_0FA7B4562AE41658"/>
and of Spain, North of latitude 30d, contain above 3,500,000 square miles. It would be unnecessary to remark, that this includes what at present does not belong to our North America. If we want it, I warrant it will soon be ours. This extent of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is much greater than that of any empire that ever existed, as will appear by the following table.</p>

            <p>The Russian empire, including all Tartary, is larger than any of these. But I might as well throw into the American scale the countries about the Hudson's bay, for the one is as likely to be peopled as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereas all I have taken in will assuredly be so. Besides, North-America is actually peopling very fast, which is far enough from being the case with the Russian deserts. Now the habitable part of what was once the British dominions alone in North-America, contains above 1,200,000 square miles, or almost equal to any of the above. But the whole, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore observed, is 3,500,000, or more than the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian and Roman empires together. In respect, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to extent, and the means of maintaining num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people, it is superior to all. But then comes the advantage which is decisive of its duration. This immense continent will be peopled by persons whose language and national character must be the same. Foreigners who may resort to us, will be confounded by the general population, and the whole people, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically speaking, one: so that those seeds of decay, sown in the very foundation of the ancient empires,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:018532_0093_0FA7B456ECF76DC8"/>
will have no existence here. Further, the peopling of this vast tract from a nation renowned in trade, navigation and naval power, has occasioned all the ideas of the original to be transplanted into the copy. And these advantages having been so long enjoyed, with the amazing and unparalleled situation for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between Europe, Asia, and the great south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern continent; and America at the same time possess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, above other countries, the means of building, sitting out, and maintaining a great navy; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this potent empire, so far from being in the least danger from the attacks of any other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the globe, will have it in their power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross the whole commerce of it, and to reign, not only lords of America, but to possess, in the utmost security, the dominion of sea throughout the world, which their ancestors enjoyed before them. None of the ancient empires, therefore, which fell a prey to the Tartars, nor the present one of China, can be compared to this of North-America, which, as surely as the land is now in being, will hereafter be trod by the first people the world ever know.</p>
