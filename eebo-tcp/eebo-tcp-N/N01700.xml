            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Governour</hi> and Commander in chief, and having had a Princely Education in the Court of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and being highly accompliſhed by the ſpirit of wiſdom, meekneſs and courage for the Government of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he was by the Divine Election conſtituted <hi>King in Jeſhurun;</hi> as our Context has it: And now like another <hi>David</hi> he dies praying for and bleſſing the Inheritance of the Lord over whom he had been ruling. Again, He had been a <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Lord unto and among his People; <hi>Moſes</hi> the Man of God, and an Eminent Type of the Great Prophet and King of the Church; and now like the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding JESUS, being about to leave his People, he <hi>lifts up his hands</hi> in prayer and bleſſes 'em. Yea his Bleſſing of the <hi>Tribes,</hi> like that of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> to his Sons, is a very famous <hi>Prophecy,</hi> wherein he foretels the <hi>Lot</hi> of the Tribes, their <hi>Genius, Scituation, Imployments, Honours,</hi> and <hi>Services;</hi> what ſhould befal them hereafter; And the Event anſwer'd his words, and ſhow'd that he ſpake by Inſpiration and the Spirit of Prophecy.</p>
            <p>The particular part of the Prophecy and the Bleſſing now before us is that which reſpects <hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Iſſachar;</hi> who are here put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe of their Conſanguinity &amp; Nei'bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, being the Sons of one Mother, and their lots joyning together, which <hi>Moſes</hi> in Spirit foreſees and foretels.

The Bleſſing and the Prophecy here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Scituation, buſineſs and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe two tribes; <hi>Zebulun in his going out, and Iſſachar in his tents. Zebulun</hi> was to inhabit on the Sea-coaſts, and his buſineſs was to ly chiefly in trade and merchandize. As <hi>Jacob</hi> had long ſince foretold of him; Gen. 49.13. <hi>Zebulun ſhall be for an Haven of Ships, and his Border ſhall be unto Zidon.</hi> "They had three ports on the Sea of <hi>Geneſaret,</hi> and were not far from the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> It was a tribe of Merchants and Mariners.

Yet it ſeems meant of their <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,</hi> Exportation and Importation by Sea.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <hi>Iſſachars</hi> lot was more <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and his buſineſs more at home, in his <hi>tents,</hi> as the <hi>text</hi> ſpeaks.

It is a <hi>Prayer</hi> for each; let them rejoyce, GOD grant 'em Cauſe of Joy both the one &amp; the other; this bleſſing I wiſh them from GOD. And it is a <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that they ſhould have reaſon to rejoyce, and ſhould be made to rejoyce. It is a <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Joy from GOD, whoſe bleſſing gives the Proſperity and the Joy. And it ſounds alſo like a <hi>Grarulation</hi> with them on this proſpect; <hi>Moſes</hi> joyes in it, congratulates 'em upon it; gives the bleſſing with a dying Fathers Joy —; <hi>My ſon, the Lord be with thee, and proſper thou.</hi> Finally, It is a <hi>Precept</hi> to both one and the other to rejoyce in their lot, in their work, and in the bleſſing of GOD upon them therein. Only obſerve, <hi>Zebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lun</hi> is twice named: <hi>And of Zebulun he ſaid, Rejoyce</hi> Zebulun <hi>in thy going out.</hi> This trading Tribe ſeems to have a double portion of Joy and proſperity aſſured to it.

Their <hi>Neibours</hi> and brethren among whom they dwelt, and thro' whoſe towns and villages they paſs'd as they went up to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Or 2. <hi>Foreiners,</hi> the people of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that came to trade among them, or to whom they ſail'd: they ſhould inform them of <hi>Iſraels</hi> GOD, his laws, his works, his name and houſe and worſhip; they ſhould propagate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion abroad by their Merchandize, and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte ſtrangers at home. Happy <hi>Zebulun,</hi> pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly advantaged for this, and that had a heart to improve it. <hi>They ſhall call the people</hi>—</p>
            <p>—<hi>To the Mountain:</hi> what Mountain? the Mountain of the Lords houſe, <hi>Mount Sion in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> which was Mount <hi>Moriah.</hi> Here is a a prophecy of <hi>Solomons Temple</hi> there, the Houſe of Worſhip. There was the Lords <hi>Altar</hi> at laſt fixt, and there the <hi>Reſt of his Ark.</hi> There the place of Sacrifice and Offerings, whither the <hi>Tribes of Iſrael</hi> were commanded <hi>three times a year</hi> to appear before the Lord, and <hi>not to come empty.</hi> Thither the Tribes went up, <hi>the tribes of the Lord unto the Teſtimony of Iſrael, to give
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002018_0010_0FBA8639C60CACF0"/>thanks unto the Name of the LORD;</hi> and as they went up they were won't to call upon one another ſaying, <hi>Let us go up to the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 122.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There they ſhall offer ſacrifices of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Such as the Law requir'd of them. Such as in gratitude and juſtice were due unto GOD from them. Such as became their wealth &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate, as GOD ſhould bleſs and proſper them. There they offer'd <hi>Burnt ſacrifices of fatlings, with the incenſe of rams; bullocks with goats;</hi> their <hi>peace,</hi> their <hi>thank,</hi> their <hi>free will Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> —Was this their Character and praiſe? let it be ours.</p>
            <p>I come therefore to make a few practical and inſtructive <hi>Notes</hi> or <hi>Obſervations</hi> from the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">I. And in the firſt place I obſerve, <hi>That GOD the Wiſe and Great Governour of the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, ordains and determines our Times and our Habitations; and the Callings and Imployments of people as well as the places of their abode.</hi> Known unto GOD are all his works, from the beginning of the world unto the end of it. There is not a place nor perſon or thing in it, nor a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of one or the other, but what is order'd by infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate unerring Counſel. So in particular, are the habitable places of the earth, the times of their flouriſhing, and who ſhall inhabit the ſame, thro' the ſucceſſive Generations of men.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002018_0011_0FBA863B7AECAFB0"/>This the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> obſerved to the people at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and it is a prime and great Principle in the Doctrine of Divine Providence; <hi>That God who made the world and all things therein, Lord of heaven and earth, who gives to all life and breath and all things, hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and bath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of every ones habitation,</hi> Acts 17.26. The times and circumſtances of every perſon, in <hi>all</hi> the nations of men, that dwell on <hi>all</hi> the face of the earth, are foreknown &amp; determined by the great Creator &amp; Governour of all things. <q>He that appointed the Earth to be an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Children of men, has appointed to the Children of men a diſtinction of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the earth.</q> He made the earth to be inhabited in one place and in another, and Man to <hi>multiply</hi> upon it, and to <hi>diſperſe</hi> over it. He ſets the bounds of <hi>Nations</hi> and appoints their times; the times of <hi>Perſons</hi> alſo and their dwelligns. He fits perſons for the days and for the places which he allots unto them; and by a differing Genius directs and inclines one to this calling and abode, and another to that. He forms one man for his husbandry and another for his merchandize. One loves the Seacoaſt and another the Inland; One the trading buſy Town, and another the retir'd ſilent Villages. There is as much difference in men, tho' made of one blood, their inclinations and capacities, guſts and reliſhes, as there is in places, times and occaſions. How near in blood were <hi>Zebulun</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002018_0012_0FBA863F942C3EE0"/>and <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> and even their lots adjoyning too, and yet the one ſcituated and made for trafick by ſea, and if Occaſion for war; the other for paſturage and peace. So <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one womb, and were born in one hour, we may ſuppoſe (&amp; then under the ſame <hi>Planet,</hi> if there were any thing in that) and the boyes grew up together under the ſame Roof, and the ſame Inſtitutions of their gracious parents; but the one was a <hi>cunning hunter, a Man of the field;</hi> the other a <hi>plain man, dwelling in tents,</hi> Gen. 25.27. The one for an active, the other for the contemplative life; the one a hunter of the feirce or timerous wild beaſts of the woods, the other a mild and gentle ſhepherd whoſe pleaſure it was to feed and tend uſeful ſheep. Thus Providence firſt variouſly inclines &amp; gifts men, and then diſpoſes of them here and there, to this or that: forms ſome for the <hi>City</hi> and places 'em therein; ſome for the <hi>Country</hi> and ſeats 'em there; inclines ſome to the <hi>Sea,</hi> and ſends 'em forth into the world for the ſervice of many places; but keeps moſt <hi>aſhore</hi> on the dry land, the more natural Element to us; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ſome in the Sea-ports, others in the Inland Towns and upon pleaſant Rivers; and it makes vaſtly for the common Good that men are ſo variouſly led; <q>ſome to a book, ſome to trades, ſome to the ſea, and ſome to rural affairs. 'Tis well it is ſo, ſayes One on the <hi>Text;</hi> 'twas for the common good of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the men of <hi>Zebulun</hi> were for Merchandize and the men of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> for Husbandry; for <hi>if the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002018_0013_0FBA8641B7935350"/>whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? and if the whole were the ear, where were the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Wherefore it is the wiſdom and duty of every one to accommodate themſelves to their own proper places and buſineſs, as God has called every one and diſpoſed of them; wherever and to whatſover it be; and it is a great happineſs to be well pleaſed without place and work.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I obſerve from the Text, <hi>That it is the Bleſſing of GOD that makes one Place or another, and the Men of one Occupation or another proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſucceſsful. Iſſachar</hi> and <hi>Zebulun</hi> here are ſharers in the ſame Bleſſing from GOD, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſe, Deut. 28.3—7. <hi>Bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the city and bleſſed in the field; bleſſed in the fruit of thy ground; thy cattel, thy kine and thy ſheep; and bleſſed when thou comeſt in and when thou goeſt out.</hi> Town and Country flouriſh by the ſame bleſſing of GOD, the GOD of the ſea and dry land. He teaches the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant as well as the husbandman diſcretion; <hi>The way of man is not in himſelf, it is not in him that walketh to direct his ſteps.</hi> It is GOD that <hi>girdeth a man with ſtrength and maketh his way perfect.</hi> He bleſſes the work of our hand. He crowns places &amp; perſons with his goodneſs. It is a vain &amp; impious thing to look for ſucceſs and proſperity in any of our affairs, but by the bleſſing of Providence; and as evil is it to aſcribe the ſucceſs that does at any time attend us to our own prudence or diligence. This were to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002018_0014_0FBA8642CA618FF0"/>
               <hi>deify</hi> our ſelves, and to <hi>deny</hi> the GOD that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; to do ſacrifice to our own <hi>net,</hi> and burn Incence to our own <hi>drag.</hi> Pſal. 127.1, 2. <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the City the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man waketh in vain; it is vain for you to riſe up early, to ſit up late, to eat the bread of ſorrows.</hi> Deut 8.17. <hi>Say not thou in thy heart, my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth; but thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To GOD therefore the Prophet directs the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> to ask wiſdom and ſtrength, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on his bleſſing, and to give his praiſes when he reaps his harveſt. Iſai. 28.23—29. <hi>Give ye ear and hear my voice, hearken and hear my ſpeech. Doth the plowman plow all day to ſow? doth he open and break the clod of his ground? When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not caſt abroad the fitches, and ſcatter the cummin, and caſt in the principal wheat, and the appointed barley, and the rie in their place? For his God doth inſtruct him to diſcretion, and doth teach him: — This cometh forth from the LORD of Hosts, who is wonderful in counſel and excellent in working.</hi> It is ſuppos'd here that the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman applies himſelf to his buſineſs with a great deal of pains and prudence, from the ſowing his ſeed to the threſhing it out again; that he does it all with a diſcretion and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment equal to the labours of the Summer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; But then all his skill, and the happy fruits
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002018_0015_0FBA864441019568"/>of his labour, are from GOD, the LORD of hoſts, by whoſe excellent wiſdom and counſel it is, that men do any thing wiſely and diſcreetly.</p>
            <p>Has the Husbandman an <hi>Underſtanding</hi> for his work? or has he <hi>ſtrength</hi> of body for it? or are his <hi>oxen</hi> ſtrong for labour? does he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure his ground well and prepare it for the ſeed he ſows? does the <hi>ſeed</hi> take root and ſpring and yield him the expected Increaſe? have the <hi>rains</hi> fell and the <hi>ſun</hi> ſhone on his fields and paſtures and orchards? how readily will he acknowledge his immediate dependance on the hand and bleſſing of Providence in all theſe things?</p>
            <p>And have not the <hi>Merchant</hi> and the <hi>Mariner</hi> as much dependance on the bleſſing of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and as much to acknowledge of it, in their proſperity and ſucceſſes? If they have <hi>wiſdom</hi> for their buſineſs, which calls for a more extenſive knowledge of men and places, and the preſent ſeaſons too; is it not from GOD that they are inſtructed to diſcretion in their <hi>Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> and <hi>ventures?</hi> And as to their <hi>ſucceſſes,</hi> does not GOD govern the winds and the ſeas, preſerve them in its ragings, and timely relieve them from its calms, and <hi>bring them to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired haven?</hi> Pſal. 107.23. <hi>They that go down to ſea in ſhips, that do buſineſs in great waters, theſe ſee the works of God and his wonders in the deep.</hi> Well do they when they <hi>go forth</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves to the care and protection of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002018_0016_0FBA8645B84DC9B0"/>Him, that has the <hi>waters in the hollow of his hand and the winds in his fiſt;</hi> and when they <hi>come home</hi> alive, well do they to give Him praiſe on high, <hi>who is mightier than the noiſe of many waters, than the mighty waves of the ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our Merchants look upon their <hi>ſtacks of fiſh,</hi> muſt they not own the munificent hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as much therein, as the Husbandman in the ſtacks of <hi>hay and corn?</hi> 'tis hard to ſay which has moſt of the divine bounty to ſhow, the <hi>barn-floors</hi> or the <hi>ſtore-houſes?</hi> And which is moſt form'd for the inriching us, the <hi>Inland-country</hi> for the drying our fiſh, and our beauteous <hi>Havens</hi> for the receiving our Ships? And when the Merchant has hous'd his ſtores, and the Husbandman has gather'd in his, after cares and hazards it may be pretty equal; ſtill both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the continued watch of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to preſerve their ſubſtance from fires and from thieves, from moth and ruſt and vermine: And yet when they open their ſtores for ſale, they ſtill depend on the direction of Providence in their dealings with men; whether they ſhall fall into honeſt or diſhoneſt hands: and how often after all the labours of the field, and the dangers of the ſea, is the Increaſe made the ſpoil of the knave and the unjuſt!</p>
            <p>If then <hi>Zebulun</hi> be made to rejoyce in his going out, or <hi>Iſſachar</hi> in his tents, it is from the Bleſſing of GOD, upon which both the one and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002018_0017_0FBA8647327534B0"/>the other do alike depend, and thro' Grace are alike under. For our text teaches the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, the mariner, the trades-man and the merchant, that they do alike need and do alike enjoy the Bleſſing of Providence; ſhould ſeek it, obſerve it and aſcribe all their ſucceſſes or fruſtrations to it. Which may ſuffice for the <hi>Second Obſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I would obſerve further from the Text, concerning the wiſdom and bounty and equal regards of Providence towards the people of one place and buſineſs and of another; — <hi>That riches and affluence, the comfort and happineſs of life is not confined here or there, but is common to one as well as the other; and that GOD hath wiſely ordained the City and Country to have a mutual dependance one on another; need of and benefit by one another. Iſſachar</hi> and <hi>Zebulun</hi> are equally the <hi>Care</hi> of GOD, and he would have 'em both <hi>happy</hi> and rejoycing; Yea and one <hi>in</hi> the other; for as they are <hi>Brethren</hi> ſo they are <hi>bleſſings</hi> one to the other, and are <hi>politically</hi> as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in one anothers proſperity, as they are <hi>naturally</hi> and by blood related to one another. So that neither has the one any cauſe to <hi>envy</hi> the other, or to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the other; but both abundant reaſon to have the ſame care, honour and affection one for the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zebulun</hi> has his pleaſures, his ſtores and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; his toils too and cares and fears; his breaking loſſes, ſhipwrecks and ſore diſaſters.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002018_0018_0FBA864B5ADFBED8"/>To day he <hi>rejoyces in his laden Ships,</hi> as they ſpread their fails and <hi>ſwim down</hi> the Tyde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gentle gales, promiſing himſelf by the favour of GOD a rich return: Or with a greater Joy he makes his diſtant <hi>Sails coming in,</hi> and as they greaten to his eye ſo it may be his joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hopes riſe of the riches importing to him. But how often does <hi>Zebuluns fears riſe</hi> like the ſtormy wind, and toſs him like the troubled ſea, and put him at his wits end? And how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten does his <hi>heart ſink,</hi> like his ſtores in the mighty deep? <hi>it melteth in him becauſe of trouble. The Day of the Lord of Hoſts is upon the ſhips of Tarſhiſh, and the loftineſs of man is bowed down, and the hau'tineſs of men laid low,</hi> Iſai. 2.16, 17. <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> Voyage and venture, who ſet out his ſhips with a view of much Gold they ſhould bring him from <hi>Ophir,</hi> but the firſt news of 'em is that they were broken to piéces. Now comes in fitly the <hi>Burden of Tire,</hi> the Mart of Nations, and the Harveſt of the River her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue; but her ſhips howl, the Inhabitants of the Iſles are mute, <hi>Zidon</hi> is aſhamed, the ſea ſayes—<hi>I travail not;</hi> And now what becomes of <hi>the joyous City, the crowning City, whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are princes! when the Lord of hoſts purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to ſtain the pride of all glory, and to bring it into contempt.</hi> (ſee Iſai. 23. Init.)</p>
            <p>Who now would envy <hi>Zebulun</hi> his lot, his pleaſing proſpects,—or gains? what ventures and hazards does he run, what pains of mind endure? more then the labouring body ever
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002018_0019_0FBA864E8DA9AA58"/>felt? <hi>Iſſachar</hi> is eaſy and at reſt at home while the <hi>winds blow,</hi> and <hi>the rain fall,</hi> and the <hi>ſtorms beat.</hi> He has the pleaſure of the <hi>Sun ſhine</hi> too, his Soul calm as the <hi>light,</hi> and as the ſweet <hi>air</hi> he breathes. All is verdant and flouriſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, by the favour of Providence. <hi>GOD makes him to ly down in the green paſtures, and leads him beſide the ſtill waters, and reſtores his ſoul day by day, and year after year.</hi> His <hi>paſtures are clothed with flocks, and his valleys are covered with corn; they ſhout for joy, they alſo ſing.</hi> How many beauties ever entertain his eye, and what muſical ſounds his ears? I mean not the ſofter notes of numerous <hi>Birds,</hi> of various notes, that ſing among the branches; but the muſick of his <hi>lowing</hi> herds, and <hi>bleating</hi> flocks, which ſalute him daily and call him their Lord and Maſter. Which way ſoever he turns his eye or bends his ſteps, the graſs, the corn, the trees are growing, the <hi>milk and honey flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for him: ſo <hi>Iſſachar</hi> reaps the abundance of the earth, while <hi>Zebulun</hi> ſucks of the treaſures of the ſea, and has <hi>the joy of the harveſt</hi> his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar.</p>
            <p>And yet leſt <hi>Zebulun</hi> ſhould envy his Brothers reſt and plenty, <hi>Iſſachar</hi> has his equal ſhare of daily cares and conſtant labours; <hi>he goeth forth unto his work until the Evening;</hi> his earth brings forth <hi>briars and thorns,</hi> which he muſt ſubdue, and he eats his bread in <hi>the ſweat of his brows;</hi> he ſeems to live meaner and fare harder gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally than thoſe of the city, but his food and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002018_0020_0FBA864F6FB447C0"/>ſleep is uſually ſweeter than theirs; he is liable alſo to the blaſts and loſs of his Eſtate and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if GOD <hi>withhold</hi> the rain or if he ſends an <hi>exceſs</hi> of it, if he command the Sun to <hi>ſcorch</hi> it it or if he forbid it to <hi>ſhine</hi> eno' thereon; or if he commiſſion the ſtormy winds to <hi>rend</hi> the laden trees and <hi>tear up</hi> the Corn almoſt ripe for the fickle, or his ligatnings to <hi>fire</hi> and burn up the ſtacks of hay and the corn in the barn. So the Tempeſt produces at GODS will as many <hi>wrecks</hi> aſhore as at ſea; and the ſame rains that <hi>drown</hi> the growing Corn &amp; graſs which was ripe for the ſcithe and the ſickle, equally <hi>waſh away</hi> the treaſures of fiſh taken from the ſea, which need the kind heat of the Sun on their <hi>flakes,</hi> as much as the mown graſs does in the <hi>Meadows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus equal are <hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Iſſachar</hi> in their gains and pleaſures, and in their loſſes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, as GOD pleaſes to diſtribute the one and the other. So little neaſon have the <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>Country</hi> to repine at their own, or to grudge one anothers ſtate. Yea ſo much reaſon is there at times, both to congratulate and alſo to pity one another. We have in the end <hi>no private advantage</hi> one over the other, nor any <hi>private Intereſt</hi> oppoſite to each other. As in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body one Member cannot ſay to the other, <hi>I have no need of thee;</hi> ſo we are united by GOD, and <hi>are both of the body,</hi> and have the <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> one of another, and ſhould have the ſame <hi>honour</hi> for and <hi>Joy</hi> in one another; having the ſame <hi>care</hi> one for the other, and each one
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002018_0021_0FBA8650E6A226E8"/>ſeeking the others <hi>wealth.</hi> Yea it is a very <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> thing for Town and Country to entertain <hi>Jealouſies</hi> of, or <hi>grudgings</hi> at one anothers Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts or proſperities; or to conceive that it can be the <hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>prudence</hi> of one to oppoſe, ſtrai'ten, or put any hardſhips or burden on the other. No, both ſhould bear the common burthens to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yea <hi>bear one anothers burdens,</hi> ſeek one anothers eaſe, rejoyce in each others ſucceſſes, and ſo <hi>fulfil the law of love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>One</hi> therefore ſayes on the Text,</p>
            <p>"Let Zebulun thank God for the gains, and make the beſt of the troubles and loſſes of his Merchandize; and not deſpiſe the meaneſs, nor envy the quietneſs of <hi>Iſſachars</hi> tents: and let <hi>Iſſachar</hi> be well pleas'd with the Retirements, and content with the ſmaller (but ſurer) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his Country ſeat, and not envy the <hi>ſhow</hi> that <hi>Zebulun</hi> makes of greater riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. But let their mutual love, and pleaſure in one anothers weal, be like their relation to, dependance on and Intereſt in one another.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I will make but one more <hi>Obſervation</hi> from the words, which is, <hi>That when GOD makes people to proſper, be it in their husbandry, or in their merchandize,</hi> he <hi>juſtly expects a very thankful and devout Return from the, as of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and praiſe, ſo in Offerings to him out of their Eſtates.</hi> So the text ſuppoſes and requires of <hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> that as GOD made them to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in their going out and in their tents, that they ſhould <hi>call the people to the Mountain, to offer the ſacrifices of Righteouſneſs to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:002018_0022_0FBA865281AEE498"/>
It is our duty <hi>to rejoyce before the LORD,</hi> in the ſober chearful uſe of all the good things that the bounteous Providence of GOD gives us to enjoy. This was a repeated Precept to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and a Statute of the God of <hi>Jacob;</hi> his <hi>Law</hi> as <hi>gracious</hi> herein, as his <hi>Providence</hi> is <hi>bounteous</hi> to his People. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.12. &amp; 18. <hi>v.</hi> But then it is a ſtanding and moſt equitable <hi>Rule</hi> too, "That whatſoever we have the <hi>comfort</hi> of, GOD muſt have the <hi>Glory</hi> of: the Good things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of GOD gives us the <hi>Uſe</hi> we muſt uſe according to his <hi>will</hi> and for his <hi>honour.

            </p>
            <p>Out <hi>Text</hi> forbids that Religion ſhould be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi> from the Town or Country, or that it ſhould be <hi>confined</hi> to either. Nay it ſuppoſes that the genenous and zealous ſupport of it be the common ſpirit of both. That the <hi>Town</hi> be ſtirring up the Country to it, and that the <hi>Country</hi> be as forward to promote it in the Town. That <hi>both</hi> be Exemplary themſelves in practical Godlineſs &amp; devotion; and that each be calling upon the other, to regard with due reverence the <hi>Mountain</hi> of the LORD among us, his Houſe and Ordinances, his Sabbath &amp; appointed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to give an Entire Obedience to all his holy Laws and Commandments, <hi>which he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us for our Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The trading and <hi>Sea port</hi> Towns are apt to grow profane and looſe in their Manners; the <hi>Sea</hi> caſts up the <hi>mire &amp; dirt</hi> of profane ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; curſing, of exceſſive drinking, rude ſpeech and carriage among them: Worldlineſs, pride, vanity and ſenſuality, Uncleaneſs and every <hi>worldly lust that wars againſt the ſoul</hi> are bro't in among them. Theſe not only eat out much of the <hi>life</hi> of religion in ſuch buſy places, but very
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002018_0024_0FBA865998AF1398"/>often deſtroy the <hi>form</hi> of it. The Cares and pleaſures of the world devour the place. And yet there is ſometimes a <hi>ſingular</hi> ſpirit of piety and charity in populous &amp; trading Towns; and as the <hi>head</hi> ought to care for the body, ſo it is in fact true that the chief and rich trading Towns often <hi>do moſt</hi> in promoting Religion <hi>in other places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed they <hi>ought</hi> to do ſo; having uſually more capacity &amp; ability, and more opportunities and calls hereto, than other places. They have ordinarily more knowledge of the Neceſſities of other places, keep correſpondence with them, have their Intereſts among them, and have their Influence upon them. They are the <hi>Canter</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> or of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> as the <hi>Heart</hi> lies in the midſt of the body, and is continually receiving &amp; tranſmitting the blood (which is the life) from and to every part; whereby alſo ſpirit &amp; heat is in a perpetual circulation. And then it muſt be ſaid too, that in populous Places there are commonly Perſons of a generous and publick ſpirit, that live in a Nei bourhood and Acquaintance, and put one another upon and unite &amp; concur in noble Charities, and projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of pious Services, in other places as well as among themſelves. Thro' the favour of GOD it has been and is thus in <hi>London,</hi> and it is ſo in <hi>Boſton;</hi> and I pray GOD it may ſtill be ſo.</p>
            <p>But I would not have this honour in the text appropriated to <hi>Zebu un,</hi> the trading Tribe. Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> obſerves that Expoſitors have gone too much into the Appropriation of it to <hi>him;</hi> as if his alone were the praiſe here, <hi>of calling the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002018_0025_0FBA865B90F73748"/>people unto the Mountain; there to offer the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Righteouſneſs.</hi> GOD forbid, but that <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachar</hi> too have his part in this <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> in this glory. It ought equally to belong to him. Pray GOD it ever may, as we truſt it did of old.</p>
            <p>Our retir'd <hi>Inland Towns</hi> are (I hope) a more humble, meek, ſober, temperate people: They ſhould be ſo, for they are free from many of our temptations, and are more out of the way of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil cuſtoms &amp; examples imported with our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize. They have more of the Wiſh, which the <hi>Town</hi> is ready to make for it ſelf; <hi>Rid me of ſtrange Children, whoſe mouth ſpeaketh vanity.</hi> And yet if we ſurvey the Country places—Is not drinking and wantonneſs, worldlineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and <hi>penury of ſpirit</hi> prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them? Where is the place almoſt that does any thing in way of <hi>aſſiſtance to others,</hi> for the propagation of religion? and how many places are ſadly wanting in the juſt &amp; comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupport of it among themſelves? Is not the maintenance of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and the <hi>School</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a burden, and evaded as a greivance, in many of our Towns? How are the ſacrifices of Righteouſneſs wanting in ſuch <hi>Tents of Iſſachar!</hi> how do ſuch <hi>call</hi> the people unto the Mountain of the LORD! do they do it by <hi>word,</hi> or by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?</hi> far the contrary! how do they <hi>need</hi> to be call'd upon themſelves, not to forget and forſake the ſame?</p>
            <p>Far be it from us to think this of <hi>Iſſachar;</hi> Unworthy then to have been <hi>one of the Tribes of Iſrael.</hi> No, it appears that this peaceful retir'd

            <p>So let us come before the LORD on his <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi> on <hi>Faſts,</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving dayes.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks none of <hi>theſe</hi> ſhould paſs without a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution</hi> for the poor, or for ſome pious uſe.

            <p>So let our <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> be dayes of <hi>gladneſs and feaſting, a good Day and of ſending portions,</hi> Eſther 9.19. Can there be a day of <hi>religious Gratitude,</hi> a day of <hi>holy rejoycing</hi> in GODS benefits, a <hi>good day</hi> in the ſight of GOD, a <hi>good</hi> one to the poor, or can it be a <hi>good</hi> one to out own Souls, without acts of <hi>Charity</hi> and alms attending it? the morſels we give away ſhall more comfort our hearts than thoſe we eat, and if we give <hi>a portion to ſix and to ſeven</hi> ſo

            <p>And in our dayes of <hi>faſting</hi> and humiliation <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>ſacrifice of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Iſai. 58.7. <hi>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out to thine houſe? when thou ſeeſt the naked that thou cover him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Some are <hi>richer</hi> than others, and ſo able and obliged to <hi>do more</hi> in works of Charity and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety than others. <hi>To whom much is given, of him ſhall be much required,</hi> Luke 20.48. The abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of people is known to GOD and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

And this is the ſtanding <hi>Rule</hi> yet, (for Reaſon, Righteouſneſs and Equity are the ſame for ever, and alike honorary to GOD under both <hi>Teſtaments</hi>). 1 Pet. 4.11. <hi>Let him do it as of the Ability which GOD giveth, that God in all things may be glorified.</hi> GOD cannot demand <hi>leſs</hi> and be juſt to <hi>Himſelf,</hi> or have <hi>us</hi> juſt to him.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002018_0032_0FBA866A9DB25B20"/>We cannot do <hi>juſtice,</hi> and love <hi>mercy,</hi> and walk <hi>humbly</hi> with our GOD, if we do not give to the <hi>worſhip</hi> of GOD and the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of men, in ſome <hi>proportion</hi> to the Eſtate with which GOD bleſſeth us.</p>
            <p>If GOD has <hi>bleſſed</hi> thee, wilt thou not <hi>give</hi> ſomething at his demand, out of his <hi>bleſſing,</hi> his <hi>gift</hi> to thee? Is not this an eaſy <hi>rent</hi> to thy Proprietor, a reaſonable piece of <hi>Gratitude</hi> to thy Benefactor? Will He continue to give, continue to bleſs thee, <hi>if thou withholdeſt more than is meet?</hi> will it not tend to thy decreaſe? for what if he withhold his hand too? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his bleſſing, which maketh thee rich?</p>
            <p>He that has bleſſed thee, knows thy eſtate what it is, and <hi>he knows thy works &amp; thy charity:</hi> He meaſures both the one and the other, and may take the <hi>forfeited loan,</hi> and <hi>ſue</hi> out the <hi>Principal</hi> for want of receiving his yearly <hi>Uſury.</hi> The detaining his <hi>tythe</hi> may loſe thee the whole.

Wherefore <hi>lay by in ſtore</hi> for pious uſes, as the Lord thy GOD <hi>proſpers</hi> thee.</p>
            <p>O if the men of every <hi>Tribe,</hi> and of every <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> would but come into this kind and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit, the face of the earth would be changed, the world come into order &amp; beauty, and felicity would return and remain here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002018_0033_0FBA866C21CE0998"/>there would <hi>not be room to receive it.</hi> And with the riches of his bounty there would come <hi>no ſorrow.</hi> But the Grace that ſeaſons our hearts would ſweeten the Enjoyments of our lives, and render us a treble bleſſing in them. Pſal. 85.9,—13. <hi>Surely his ſalvation is nigh them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.

Righteouſneſs ſhall go before him, and ſhall ſet us in the way of his ſteps.</hi>]</p>
            <p>And now the LORD, the GOD of <hi>Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> bleſs us with <hi>this</hi> gracious and bleſſed ſpirit, out of his Houſe this day!
