            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THERE are in every country certain important criſes when exertion or neglect muſt produce conſequences of the utmoſt moment. The period at which the inhabitants of theſe ſtates have now arrived, will be admitted by every attent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive and ſerious mind to be clearly of this deſcription.</p>
            <p>Our money abſorbed by a wanton con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of imported luxuries, a fluctuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020306_0005_0FAE99CA4E24C210"/>paper medium ſubſtituting in its ſtead, foreign commerce extremely circumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and a foederal government not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effective but disjointed, tell us indeed too plainly that further negligence may ruin us forever. Impreſſed with this view of our affairs, the writer of the following pages has ventured to intrude upon the public. But as neither his time nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities will permit him to treat of all the great objects, which excite his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions or engage his wiſhes, he means principally to confine himſelf to that part of them, which have been moſt ſubjected to his obſervations and enquiries.</p>
            <p>Juſt opinions on our general affairs, muſt neceſſarily precede ſuch a wiſe ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of commercial regulations, as will extend our trade to the greateſt length to which it can be carried without affecting
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020306_0006_0FAE99CB15476728"/>unfavorably our other weighty intereſts. It may therefore be uſeful in the firſt place, to take a comparative view of the two moſt important objects in the United States—our agriculture and commerce.</p>
            <p>In a country bleſt with a fertile ſoil, and a climate admitting ſteady labour, where the cheapneſs of land tempts the European from his home, and the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturer from his trade, we are led by a few moments of reflexion to fix on agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture as the great leading intereſt. From this we ſhall find moſt of our other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages reſult, ſo far as they ariſe from the nature of our affairs, and where they are not produced by the coercion of laws —the fiſheries are the principal exception. In order to make a true eſtimate of the magnitude of agriculture, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is encouraged by few or
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020306_0007_0FAE99CBE701F258"/>no duties on the importation of rival pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce—that it furniſhes outward cargoes not only for all our own ſhips, but thoſe alſo which foreign nations ſend to our ports, or in other words, that it pays for all our importations—that it ſupplies a part of the cloathing of our people and the food of them and their cattle—that what is conſumed at home, including the materials for manufacturing, is four or five times the value of what is exported —that the number of people employed in agriculture, is at leaſt nine parts in ten of the inhabitants of America—that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the planters and farmers do form the body of the militia, the bulwark of the nation—that the value of property, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by agriculture, is manifold greater than that of the property employed in every other way—that the ſettlement of our waſte lands, and ſubdividing our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020306_0008_0FAE99CCA49F1F40"/>farms is every year encreaſing the pre-eminence of the agricultural intereſt —that the reſources we derive from it are at all times certain and indiſpenſibly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary—and laſtly, that the rural life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes health and morality by its active nature, and by keeping our people from the luxuries and vices of the towns. In ſhort, agriculture appears to be the ſpring of our commerce, and the parent of our manufactures.</p>
            <p>The commerce of America, including our exports, imports, ſhipping, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and fiſheries, may be properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as forming one intereſt. So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed or miſtaken have many of us been, that it has been ſtated as the great object, and I fear it is yet believed to be the moſt important intereſt of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But from the beſt calculations I
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020306_0009_0FAE99CD4F91D700"/>have been able to make, I cannot raiſe the proportion of property or the number of men employed in manufactures, fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries, navigation and trade to one-eighth of the property and people occupied by agriculture, even in that commercial quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Union. In making this eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate I have deducted ſomething from the value and population of the large towns for the idle and diſſipated, for thoſe who live upon their incomes, and for ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary domeſtic ſervants. But the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion is much greater, taking the Union at large, for ſeveral of the ſtates have little commerce, and no manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—others have no commerce and ſcarcely manufacture any thing. The timber, iron, cordage and many other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles neceſſary for building ſhips to fiſh or trade—nine parts in ten of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes—the ſubſiſtence of the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020306_0010_0FAE99CDF8E3CC08"/>and much of their raw materials are the produce of our lands. In almoſt all of the countries of Europe the moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious writers have conſidered commerce as the handmaid of agriculture; and if true there, with us it muſt be unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. We have few manufactories to throw into the ſcale againſt the landed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. We have in our lands full employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our preſent inhabitants, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſending colonies to new-diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed iſlands, we have adjoining townſhips and counties whoſe vacant fields await the future increaſe of our people.</p>
            <p>If a comparative view of the importance of our various intereſts ſhould terminate in a decided and great ſuperiority of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture over all the reſt combined—if emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration and natural increaſe are daily add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of our planters and farmers—if the ſtates are poſſeſſed of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020306_0011_0FAE99CEC765EBC0"/>of vacant acres, that court the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivator's hand—if the ſettlement of theſe immenſe tracts will greatly and ſteadily encreaſe the objects of taxation, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, the powers of the country—if they will prove an inherent treaſure of which neither folly nor chance can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us, let us be careful to do nothing that can interrupt this happy progreſs of our affairs. Should we from a miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of our true intereſts, or from any other cauſe, form a ſyſtem of commercial regulations, prejudicial to this great maſs of property, and to this great body of the people, we muſt injure our country during the continuance of the error. I muſt final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return, under the diſadvantages of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther changes, to that plan, which it muſt be our ſincere deſire, as it is our ſerious duty at this time to deviſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:020306_0012_0FAE99CF8DDFCDB8"/>
While I feel an abſolute conviction that our true intereſts ſhould reſtrain us from burdening or impeding agriculture in any way whatever, I am not only ready to admit, but muſt beg leave to urge, that ſound policy requires our giving every encouragement to commerce and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, which may be found conſiſtent with a due regard to agriculture.</p>
            <p>The communication between the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ports of every nation is a buſineſs entirely in their power—The policy of moſt countries has been to ſecure this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic navigation to their own people. The extenſive coaſts, the immenſe bays and numerous rivers of the United States have already made this an important ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and it muſt increaſe with our popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<note n="*" place="bottom">The coaſting veſſels, entered at the cuſtom houſe of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia in the year 1785, were 567 fail; all the other entries of ſea veſſels in the ſame year were 501.</note>.—As the places at which the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020306_0013_0FAE99D2A0EC1DA8"/>of coaſting veſſels are delivered muſt be ſupplied with American produce from ſome part of the Union, and as the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant can always have American bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms to tranſport the goods of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſtate to the ſtate conſuming them, no interruption to the market of the planters and farmers can be apprehended from prohibiting tranſportation in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign bottoms from port to port within the United States—A ſingle exception may perhaps be proper, permitting fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign veſſels to carry from port to port, for the purpoſe of finiſhing their ſales, any goods that ſhall be part of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes they brought into the Union, from the laſt foreign place at which they load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The fleets of colliers on the Britiſh coaſt evince the poſſible benefits of ſuch a regulation</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:020306_0014_0FAE99D37AABB6E0"/>
The conſumption of fiſh, oil, whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone and other articles obtained through the fiſheries, in the towns and counties, that are convenient to navigation, has become much greater than is generally ſuppoſed. I am informed that no leſs than five thouſand barrels of mackarel, ſalmon and pickled cod-fiſh, are vended in the city of Philadelphia annually; add to them the dried fiſh, oil, ſpermaceti candles, whalebone, &amp;c. and it will be found a little fleet of ſloops and ſchoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are employed in the buſineſs. The demand for the uſe of the inhabitants of thoſe parts of the Union to which theſe ſupplies can be carried, is already conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and the increaſe of our towns and manufactures will render it more ſo every year. In the preſent ſtate of our navigation we can be in no doubt of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing theſe ſupplies by means of our
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020306_0015_0FAE99D49D090F48"/>own veſſels. The country that interferes moſt with us at our own market is Nova Scotia, which alſo, I am informed, has had ſome emigrants from our fiſhing towns ſince the decline of their buſineſs. Such encouragement to this valuable branch of commerce, as would ſecure the benefits of it to our own people, without injuring our other eſſential intereſts, is certainly worth attention.—The Convention will probably find on conſideration of this point that a duty or prohibition of foreign articles, ſuch as our own fiſheries ſupply, will be ſafe and expedient.</p>
            <p>The article in the Britiſh trade laws, which confines the importation of foreign goods to the bottoms of the country pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them, and of their own citizens, appears applicable to our ſituation. By means of thoſe two flags we ſhould be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020306_0016_0FAE99D4B47E7A00"/>certain of the neceſſary importations, and we ſhould throw out of each department of the carrying trade every competitor, except the ſhips of the nation by which the goods were raiſed or manufactured. All trade with ſeveral countries, ſuch as China and India, whoſe veſſels ſeldom or never make foreign voyages, would be ſecured into our hands. It will be found, that an application of this regulation in practice, will be attended with no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties or inconveniencies, and beſides the immediate benefits already mentioned, our merchants will be led directly to the original market for the ſupplies of which we ſtand in need. Inſtead of purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goods of Ruſſia or the Eaſt-Indies in England, France or Holland, our own ſhips will ſail directly to the fountain from whence they have flowed to us through foreign channels. The credits
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020306_0017_0FAE99D58120E508"/>given us in Europe after the peace, kept us in the practice of going to a very few places, for all our importations. But they have truſted us in many inſtances at a dear rate indeed, and however uſeful cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit may be as a ſupplement to our means of trade in this young country, it is very certain that we ſhould firſt lay out to the beſt advantage our funds in hand.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principal encouragements to foreign commerce, which occur to me at preſent as proper to form a part of a permanent ſyſtem for the United States. Regulations for temporary purpoſes, ſuch as reſtrictions and prohibitions affecting particular nations, I do not mean to ſpeak of here. I muſt however obſerve, that they ſhould be adopted with great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and deliberation, as they may affect us very unfavorably, if they ſhould be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020306_0018_0FAE99D634BE6930"/>tried in vain. In taking meaſures to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote manufactures, we muſt be careful that the injuries to the general intereſts of commerce do not exceed the advantages reſulting from them. The circumſtances of the country, as they relate to this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, ſhould be diſpaſſionately and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly examined. Tho' it is confeſſed, that the United States have full employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all their citizens in the extenſive field of agriculture, yet as we have a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable body of manufacturers already here, as many more will probably emigrate from Europe, who will chuſe to continue at their trades, and as we have ſome citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſo poor as not to be able to effect a little ſettlement on our waſte lands, there is a real neceſſity for ſome wholeſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral regulations on this head. By tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care not to force manufactures in thoſe ſtates, where the people are fewer, tillage
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020306_0019_0FAE99D70EC72460"/>much more profitable, and proviſions dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than in ſeveral others, we ſhall give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture its full ſcope in the former, and leave all the benefits of manufacturing (ſo far as they are within our reach) to the latter. South-Carolina, for inſtance, muſt manufacture to an evident loſs, while the advancement of that buſineſs in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts will give the means of ſubſiſtence to many, whoſe occupations have been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered unprofitable by the conſequences of the revolution. A liberal policy on this ſubject ſhould be adopted, and the produce of the ſouthern ſtates ſhould be exchanged for ſuch manufactures as can be made by the northern, free from impoſt.</p>
            <p>Another inducement to ſome ſalutary regulations on this ſubject, will be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by conſidering ſome of our means of conducting manufactures. Unleſs bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020306_0020_0FAE99D7CAB9BA40"/>of this kind is carried on, certain great <hi>natural powers</hi> of the country will remain inactive and uſeleſs. Our nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mill ſeats, for example, by which flour, oil, paper, ſnuff, gunpowder, iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, woolen cloths, boards and ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſome other articles are prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or perfected, would be given by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in vain. If properly improved, they will ſave us an immenſe expence for the wages, proviſions, cloathing and lodging of workmen, without diverting the people from their farms—Fire, as well as water, affords, if I may ſo ſpeak, a fund of aſſiſtance, that cannot lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed without an evident neglect of our beſt intereſts. Breweries, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſtimate too highly, diſtilleries, ſugar houſes, potteries, caſting and ſteel fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, and ſeveral other works are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by this powerful element, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020306_0021_0FAE99D876356930"/>with the ſame ſavings, that were particularized in ſpeaking of water ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines—'Tis probable alſo that a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of ſteam engines will add great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this claſs of factories. In ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes where fire and water are not employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, horſes are made to ſerve the purpoſe as well and on much lower terms than men. The cheapneſs and the eaſy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of theſe ſerviceable animals inſure us this aid to any extent that occaſion may require, which however is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be very great.</p>
            <p>The encouragement to agriculture, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by ſome manufactories, is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſolid weight in favor of puſhing them with induſtry and ſpirit. Malt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, if generally uſed, linſeed oil, ſtarch (and were they not a poiſon to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and conſtitutions I might add corn,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020306_0022_0FAE99D934C9EA80"/>ſpirits) would require more grain to make them, than has been exported in any year ſince the revolution—I cannot omit to obſerve here, that beer ſtrengthens the arm of the labourer without debauching him, while the noxious drink now uſed enervates and corrupts him—The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in leather too of every kind, in flax and hemp, in iron, wood, ſtone and clay, in furs, horn, and many other articles employ either the ſpontaneous producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth or the fruits of cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If we are convinced by theſe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, that regular factories of many kinds ſhould be promoted in the moſt ſuitable parts of the Union, let us next conſider whether the encouragements now held out to them are both ſufficient and proper. The neareſt rivals of our
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020306_0023_0FAE99DA69FF7AE8"/>manufacturers are thoſe of Europe, who are ſubjected to the following charges in bringing their goods into our market— The merchant's commiſſion for ſhipping and the ſame for ſelling, coſt of pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, cuſtom houſe papers in Europe, and the ſame with a duty of 5 per cent. here, porterages, freight, inſurance, damage, intereſt of money, waſte, and loſs on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change—Theſe may be rated at 25 per cent on the leaſt bulky of our manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>We have no manufacture more compact than a piece of yard wide linen, equal to what coſts 15<abbr>d.</abbr> ſterling in Europe. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing minute calculation will ſhew the charges, under which a package of 100<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling value of that article can be imported.</p>

                  <p>In this calculation, waſte, which of ſome articles is great, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages below 5 per cent. which the underwriters do not pay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries not within the riſque inſured, difference of exchange now 6 per cent. above par, and other loſſes on remitting, poſtages of letters, and bad debts on ſales at a long credit, as well as the profit of the importer are not taken notice of, though ſeveral of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally occur in every importation.</p>
               </note>. Here is a ſolid premium, operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020306_0024_0FAE99DB4BF5E3C0"/>like a bounty, while it happily coſts the conſumer nothing, for the charges of importation are unavoidable and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being merely for the purpoſe of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, is applied to pay the public debts and expences of which he owes his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020306_0025_0FAE99DBA660CC70"/>This encouragement can only be encreaſed by exempting raw materials from duty, which may be very ſafe and proper and by additional duties and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, which would induce the loſs of the revenue and an injury to morals from ſmuggling, and would throw upon the other members of the commercial intereſt and the cultivators and improvers of our lands an unneceſſary burden. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers are a juſt and ſenſible body of men, and love their country. I feel a perfect confidence therefore, that when they ſee a ſubſtantial advantage of 25 per cent. in favour of their goods, which cannot be taken from them, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that government ſhould refrain from further duties and prohibitions. This eſtimate being made upon the fineſt of our manufactures, it is evident that the more
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020306_0026_0FAE99DC77EBCBC0"/>bulky and weighty would ſhew the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of our own workmen in a yet ſtronger light.</p>
            <p>The clear air and powerful ſun of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is another advantage our manufacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers enjoy. When the linen and cotton branches ſhall become conſiderable, a great ſaving of time and money will be made by the climate, and where bleaching is effected principally by the ſun and water, the quality of the cloth is known to be more excellent. The European proceſs by drugs and machines impairs the ſtrength. Ireland, I confeſs, with a cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate very different from ours, is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the quality of its linens, but they do not equal the American homeſpun in ſtrength. In confirmation of the above opinion, I may mention that there was a plan formed before the revolution, by a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020306_0027_0FAE99DCF28FA250"/>number of Engliſh merchants of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a company with a large capital, to import the brown linens of Europe to be bleached here for the ſupply of our markets.</p>
            <p>In this country the conſumer's money follows the delivery of the manufacture, therefore leſs capital is required. In e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of Europe extenſive credits are given upon their goods. For though ſome nations have not got into the habit of truſting us, their own merchants are known to buy on eaſy terms of payment. France is perhaps as little accuſtomed to give theſe indulgencies as any other great country in Europe, yet nothing is paid for there, in leſs than two months, and the credits are extended from that time to twelve months according to the article. At the expiration of the term an accepted bill at ſixty days is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020306_0028_0FAE99DED4D242E0"/>as prompt payment, ſo that the actual term of credit is from four months to fourteen.</p>
            <p>To theſe might be added ſeveral other little advantages, the joint benefits of which are ſenſibly felt, but I truſt enough has been ſaid to ſatisfy the juſt and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic mind, though concerned in the buſineſs, that a further addition of duties would not promote the general intereſts of the country. I muſt here beg leave however ſtrenuouſly to recommend, that every duty on American produce or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, impoliticly and unkindly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the laws of ſeveral of the ſtates, ſhould be taken off, and that the juſtice and ſound policy of the alteration ſhould be declared and admitted in ſome public inſtrument: And as ſhips may be very properly conſidered as the greateſt article
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020306_0029_0FAE99DF9D8C6848"/>we make, the tonnage on our own bottoms ſhould be equalized throughout the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the extra duties on goods import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in veſſels not belonging to the ſtate in which they are landed, ſhould be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way—Complaints againſt the trade laws of foreign nations come not conſiſtently from thoſe who lay ſimilar burdens on their ſiſter ſtates.</p>
            <p>A further encouragement to manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures will reſult from improvements and diſcoveries in agriculture—There are many raw materials, that could be produced in this country on a large ſcale which have hitherto been very confined. Cotton for many years before the revolution was not worth more than nine-pence ſterling in the Weſt-India Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. The perfection of the factories in Europe has raiſed it to ſuch a pitch, that beſides the prohibition againſt ſhipping it
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:020306_0030_0FAE99E008777330"/>from the colonies to any foreign port, the price has riſen fifty per cent. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers in Pennſylvania have paid near two ſhillings ſterling for the importation of this year. This article muſt be worth the attention of the ſouthern planters.</p>
            <p>If the facts and obſervations in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding part of this paper be admitted to be true and juſt, and if we take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them the acknowledged ſuperior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of foreign commerce, and the fiſheries over our manufactories, we may come to the following concluſions—That the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States of America cannot make a proper uſe of the natural advantages of the country, nor promote her agriculture and other leſſer intereſts without manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, that they cannot enjoy the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable benefits of commerce and the fiſheries, without ſome general reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020306_0031_0FAE99E0C1A41AE0"/>and prohibitions affecting foreign nations, that in forming theſe reſtrictions and prohibitions, as well as in eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manufactories, there is occaſion for great deliberation and wiſdom, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be introduced, which can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the ſale of our produce, or with the ſettlement and improvement of our waſte lands.</p>
            <p>Among the political conſiderations, which muſt neceſſarily be admitted in treating of this ſubject, the force that may be required for our protection is not to be forgotten. It is certainly the greateſt that attends it. America, we may aſſume, can have no inducement to engage in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean wars. From our local ſituation we may keep ourſelves long diſengaged from them. The principal European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would find us an unprofitable and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:020306_0032_0FAE99E1740788C8"/>troubleſome enemy. The trade of France, Great-Britain, Spain, Holland and Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, which paſſes by our coaſts, are a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt their hoſtilities. A war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in which we ſhould take no part, would be more beneficial to our farmers, merchants and manufacturers than all the advantages we could obtain, if engaged in it ourſelves. Our ſhips would carry for them, or inſtead of theirs, and our lands and manufactories would furniſh the ſupplies of their fleets and iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands in the Weſt-Indies. To counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance theſe advantages, and to pay the expences of a war would require captures rich and numerous indeed, but what could compenſate us for the drain of peaſantry and the loſt opportunity of cultivating commerce and the arts of peace. A war merely offenſive cannot be apprehended. —The fortune of the Britiſh arms againſt
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:020306_0033_0FAE99E254190118"/>America undiſciplined and divided, will inſtruct our enemies to beware of invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after the military leſſons taken from that long and ſerious conteſt. Having no foreign colonies whoſe ſituation and weakneſs would ſubject them to their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks, and having all our reſources at hand to defend our own coaſts, and cut up their trade in its paſſage by our doors, no Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean power will be inclined to inſult or moleſt us—ſhould any of them be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to their own intereſts, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the policy, which evidently ought to govern them, America, by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in concert with the moſt powerful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of ſuch hoſtile country, muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a war, which however inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and diſagreeable to us, would be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous to their Weſt-India trade, and fatal to their colonies. We are not deſtitute of reſources and powers to injure them or
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:020306_0034_0FAE99E31A0D1910"/>defend ourſelves. Our inland navigation, coaſting trade and fiſheries, and the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of foreign commerce we muſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably enjoy, are no inconſiderable nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for ſeamen. Good naval officers we ſhould not want; they have never been ſcarce, and one happy effect of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution has certainly been to raiſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the marine life and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the talents and reſpectability of its followers. Foreign ſeamen too, would find great temptations to enter on board our privateers and ſhips of war, and might be hired in any numbers we could pay. The increaſe of the ſtrength and riches of the country, by filling up our vacant lands, is the infallible method by which the neceſſary means may be acquired.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs to draw a picture of our country, as it would really exiſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:020306_0035_0FAE99E3B95DC698"/>under the operation of a ſyſtem of nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al laws formed upon theſe principles. While we indulge ourſelves in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of a ſubject at once ſo intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dear, let us confine ourſelves to ſubſtantial facts, and avoid thoſe pleaſing deluſions into which the ſpirits and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our countrymen have too long miſled them.</p>
            <p>In the foreground we ſhould find the maſs of our citizens the cultivators (and what is happily for us in moſt inſtances the ſame thing) the independent proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the ſoil. Every wheel would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in motion that could carry forward the intereſts of this great body of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bring into action the inherent powers of the country. A portion of the produce of our lands would be conſumed in the families or employed in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:020306_0036_0FAE99E4740F1278"/>of our manufacturers—a further por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be applied in the ſuſtenance of our merchants and fiſhermen and other numerous aſſiſtants, and the remainder would be tranſported by thoſe that could carry it at the loweſt freight (that is with the ſmalleſt deduction from the aggregate profits of the buſineſs of the country) to the beſt foreign markets. On one ſide we ſhould ſee our manufacturers encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the tillers of the earth by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and employment of the fruits of their labours, and ſupplying them and the reſt of their fellow citizens with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their occupations, and the neceſſaries and conveniencies of life, in every inſtance where it could be done without injuriouſly and unneceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the diſtreſs of commerce, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the huſbandmen and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of changing our native wilds into
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020306_0037_0FAE99E545191D60"/>ſcenes of cultivation and plenty. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce on the other hand, attentive to the general intereſts, would come forward with offers to range through foreign cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in ſearch of thoſe ſupplies, which the manufacturers could not furniſh but at too high a price, or which nature has not given us at home, in return for the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of thoſe ſtores, that had been drawn from the ocean or produced by the earth.</p>
            <p>On a review of the preceding facts and obſervations there appears to me reaſon to believe, that the neceſſary meaſures might be taken to render our farms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and to improve our new lands, and that our manufactures, fiſheries, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation and trade, would ſtill be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. The long voyage by which all interfering foreign articles muſt be brought to theſe markets, and the inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:020306_0038_0FAE99E6479CA778"/>neceſſity for a revenue, give us, as hath been demonſtrated, a virtual bounty of 25 per cent. in favor of our own commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and this in the leaſt favorable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. When <hi>returning</hi> occonony, and the fall of rents, and proviſions ſhall have reduced the expences of living, when our increaſing farms ſhall have poured in their addition of raw materials, and we ſhall have felt the ſhortneſs of importation produced by the ſuffering of our credit abroad, and by the check which has been given to foreign adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers in our trade, this difference of 25 per cent. will have a ſenſible effect. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rated on the whole value of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that is, as well on the labour as the raw materials, it is in fact 50 per cent. on the labour in all caſes where the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip is half the value of the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured goods, and ſo in proportion where it
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:020306_0039_0FAE99E6B3CBA8A8"/>is more. Beer, diſtilled liquors, potaſh, gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, cordage, loaf ſugar, hanging and writing paper, ſnuff, tobacco, ſtarch, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, nail rods, and many other articles of iron, bricks, tiles, potters ware, mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, and other ſtone work, cabinet work, corn fans, Windſor chairs, carriages, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlery, ſhoes and boots, and other wearing apparel, coarſe linens, hats, a few coarſe woolen articles, linſeed oil, wares of gold and ſilver tin and copper, ſome braziery, wool cards, worms and ſtills, and ſeveral other articles may be conſidered as eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. Theſe are tending to greater perfection, and will ſoon be ſold ſo cheap as to throw foreign goods of the ſame kind entirely out of the market.</p>
            <p>Many of the ſame circumſtances, that favour the manufacturer will render the fiſheries more profitable, and from the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020306_0040_0FAE99E880038270"/>cheapneſs of veſſels, they will be carried on at leſs expence than in the few laſt years. The American market, where the conſumption (with population) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing faſt, may be entirely ſecured to them. Our manufactories and towns will annually make larger demands for candles, oil, whalebone and pickled fiſh, and it may be policy, in cities where meat is yet ſo dear, to introduce the conſumption of the dried cod. The Daniſh and French Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and the free ports in the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, receive ſome of the produce of the fiſheries—France is likely to take off a conſiderable quantity, as alſo are the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, Portugueſe and Italians, and the Engliſh will always want certain articles for their manufactories, though not to any great amount—New-England, the ſeat of the fiſheries, has the great advantage of being the cheapeſt and moſt populous part
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020306_0041_0FAE99E94070A008"/>of America. Its inhabitants are healthy, active and intelligent, and can be frugal; wherefore I am very much diſpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that many factories will in the courſe of a very few years revive their declining towns.</p>
            <p>The commercial citizens of America have for ſome time felt the deepeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs—among the principal cauſes of their unhappy ſituation were the inconſiderate ſpirit of adventure to this country, which pervaded every kingdom in Europe, and the prodigious credits from thence given to our merchants. To theſe may be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the high ſpirits and the golden dreams that naturally followed ſuch a war, cloſed with ſo much honor and ſucceſs.—Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant over a great enemy, courted by the moſt powerful nations in the world, it was not in human nature that America
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020306_0042_0FAE99E9C8DD60F0"/>ſhould immediately comprehend her new ſituation—really poſſeſſed of the means of future greatneſs, ſhe anticipated the moſt diſtant benefits of the revolution, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered them as already in her hands. She formed the higheſt expectations ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of which however, ſerious experience has taught her to relinquiſh, and now that the thoughtleſs adventures and imprudent credits from foreign countries take place no more, <note n="*" place="bottom">An application of the foregoing obſervations to the commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſubject, can only be admiſſible into this eſſay.</note> and time has been given for cool reflexion, ſhe will ſee her true ſituation and need not be diſcouraged.</p>
            <p>Our future trade may comprehend the fiſheries with the excluſive benefit of ſupplying our own markets, as hath been already obſerved. The coaſting trade will be entirely ſecured to us. The right of bringing the commodities of foreign countries may be divided with the ſhips
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:020306_0043_0FAE99EA74681F58"/>of the nation from whom they come, or in thoſe caſes where they have no native ſhips the carrying trade may be our own. The revolution has opened to us ſome new branches of valuable commerce. The intercourſe with France was next to none before the war, and with Ruſſia, India and China not thought of. With activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſtrict oeconomy we may pay Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope with ſome of the <hi>produce</hi> of India, for a part of the goods with which they ſupply us, and if we do not over-regulate trade, we ſhall be an <hi>entrepot</hi> of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain commodities for their Weſt-India and ſouth American colonies. Beſides theſe objects all the manufacturing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and many free ports will be open to us, and we may adventure in foreign ſhips to a conſiderable extent, though it would be more deſireable to employ our own. As the propoſed regulations would
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020306_0044_0FAE99EB479832D8"/>compel the Britiſh or Dutch merchants, to import into the United States a part of the produce of France and Spain in American bottoms, ſo may ours ſerve the general intereſts of their country by ſending tobacco to Sweden, or flour, rice and live ſtock to the Britiſh colonies in the veſſels of the reſpective nations.</p>
            <p>The foundations of national wealth and conſequence are ſo firmly laid in the United States, that no <hi>foreign</hi> power can undetermine or deſtroy them. But the enjoyment of theſe ſubſtantial bleſſings is rendered precarious by domeſtic cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Scarcely held together by a weak and half formed foederal conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the powers of our national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are unequal to the complete execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſalutary purpoſe, foreign or domeſtic. The evils reſulting from this unhappy ſtate of things have again
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:020306_0045_0FAE99EC0D3C2B18"/>ſhocked our reviving credit, produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our people alarming inſtances of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the laws, and if not remedied, muſt deſtroy our property, liberties and peace. Foreign powers, however diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to favor us, can expect neither ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction nor benefit from treaties with congreſs, while they are unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them. We can therefore hope to ſecure no privileges from them, if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are thus conducted. We muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately remedy this defect or ſuffer exceedingly. Deſultory commercial acts of the legiſlatures, formed on the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the moment, proceeding from no uniform or permanent principles, claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the laws of the other ſtates and oppoſing thoſe made in the preceding year by the enacting ſtate, can no longer be ſupported, if we are to continue one people. <hi>A ſyſtem which will promote
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020306_0046_0FAE99ECB58A3CE0"/>the general intereſts with the ſmalleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to particular ones has become indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly neceſſary.</hi> Commerce is more affected by the diſtractions and evils ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the uncertainty, oppoſition and errors of our trade laws, than by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions of any one power in Europe. A negative upon all commercial acts of the legiſlatures, if granted to Congreſs would be perfectly ſafe, and muſt have an excellent effect. If thought expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent it ſhould be given as well with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to thoſe that exiſt, as to thoſe that may be diviſed in future. Congreſs would thus be enabled to prevent every regulation, that might oppoſe the general intereſts, and by reſtraining the ſtates from impolitic laws, would gradually bring our national commerce to order and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Such of the ideas ſuggeſted in the preceding part of this paper, as ſhall
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:020306_0047_0FAE99ED76BCF468"/>be honored with the public approbation, may be better digeſted, and, if they appear worthy of it, may form new articles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation, which would be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the commercial ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>I have ventured to hint at prohibitory powers, but ſhall leave that point and the general power of regulating trade to thoſe who may undertake to conſider the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical objects of the Convention, ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the evident propriety of ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Congreſs to prevent the importation of ſuch foreign commodities, as are made from our own raw materials. When any article of that kind can be ſupplied at home, upon as low terms as it can be imported on, a manufacture of <hi>our own produce,</hi> ſo well eſtabliſhed, ought not by any means to be ſacrificed to the intereſts of foreign trade, or ſubjected to injury by
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020306_0048_0FAE99EF78E9DEB8"/>the wild ſpeculations of ignorant adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers. In all caſes careful proviſion ſhould be made for refunding the duties on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, which renders the impoſt a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual exciſe without being liable to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt an actual one, and is a great encouragement to trade.</p>
            <p>The reſtoration of public credit at home and abroad ſhould be the firſt wiſh of our hearts, and requires every oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my—every exertion we can make. The wiſe and virtuous axioms of our political conſtitutions, reſulting from a lively and perfect ſenſe of what is due from man to man, ſhould prompt us to the diſcharge of debts of ſuch peculiar obligation. We ſtand bound to no common creditors. The friendly foreigner, the widow and the orphan, the truſtees of charity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the patriotic citizen, the war-worn
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:020306_0049_0FAE99F060D18510"/>ſoldier, and a magnanimous ally—theſe are the principal claimants upon the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and juſtice of America. Let her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all her reſources to this great duty, and wipe away the darkeſt ſtain, that has ever fallen upon her. The general im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt—the ſale of the lands and every other unneceſſary article of public property— reſtraining with a firm hand every need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs expence of government and private life—ſteady and patient induſtry, with proper diſpoſitions in the people, would relieve us of part of the burden, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Congreſs to commence their payments, and with the aid of taxation, would put the ſinking and funding of our debts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the power of all the ſtates.</p>
            <p>The violence committed on the rights of property under the authority of tender laws in ſome of the ſtates, the famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:020306_0050_0FAE99F129C77AF8"/>with which that pernicious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure has been recurred to, and the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſeverance with which it has been perſiſted in after the value of the paper was confeſſedly gone, call aloud for ſome remedy. This is not merely a matter of juſtice between man and man; it diſhonors our national character abroad, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine has been employed to give the <hi>coup de grace</hi> to public credit. It would not be difficult perhaps to form a new article of confederation to prevent it in future, and a queſtion may ariſe whether fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with any ſtate, that would refuſe to admit it, can be ſatisfactory or ſafe. To remove difficulties it need not be retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective. The preſent ſtate of things inſtead of inviting emigrants, deters all who have the means of information, and are capable of thinking. The ſettlement of our lands, and the introduction of manufactories and
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:020306_0051_0FAE99F14042C9A8"/>lines of trade yet unknown among us or requiring a force of capital, which are to make our country rich and powerful, are interrupted and ſuſpended by our want of public credit and the diſorders of our government.</p>
