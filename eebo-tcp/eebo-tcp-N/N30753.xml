            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>Thou Care for us did take,</l>
               <l>When by thy Hand thou did Command,</l>
               <l>the Earth and Sea to ſhake.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What Heart ſo hard that can't be jarr'd,</l>
               <l>when thou the Earth doth ſhake:</l>
               <l>O Lord what Eye can then be dry,</l>
               <l>in terrible EARTHQUAKE.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thy terrible Hand is on the Land,</l>
               <l>by bloody War and Death;</l>
               <l>It is becauſe we broke thy Laws,</l>
               <l>that thou didſt ſhake the Earth.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Is ten good Men in each Town then?</l>
               <l>becauſe our Towns are ſpar'd!</l>
               <l>Bleſs God that they have made a Way,</l>
               <l>that God might us Regard.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>God looked ſtrait in <hi>Sodom's</hi> Gate,</l>
               <l>but ten good Men were not;</l>
               <l>But yet we ſee he did agree,</l>
               <l>with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>God would be juſt if he had thruſt</l>
               <l>us in the gaping Ground;</l>
               <l>When we did ſhake by the Earthquake,</l>
               <l>clean is his guiltleſs Throne.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Come to the Lord with one Accord,</l>
               <l>and forth his Praiſes ſound;</l>
               <l>For ſeeing he ſo kind to thee,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For by God's Hand, <hi>New-England</hi>
               </l>

               <l>By that we know, thou'rt ſtrong enough</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>The God of Hoſt and Holy Ghoſt, for Chriſt, his Saints will raiſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>By rending Rocks and by Earth Shocks,</l>

               <l>The Saints aroſe and that to ſee</l>
               <l>our Saviour's Crucifixion.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The old muſt dye, you can't deny,</l>
               <l>the young he doth command;</l>
               <l>The middle-age when death engage,</l>

               <l>a Pardon for to ſeek;</l>
               <l>When God hath told the Young and Old</l>
               <l>as plain as Words can ſpeak.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then do not ſay old People may</l>
               <l>be e'er too old for Death;</l>
               <l>For it is ſent in a Moment,</l>
               <l>'twill ſnatch away their Breath.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then O young Man, don't ſay you can</l>
               <l>your ſelf from Death deliver;</l>
               <l>Your Fathers ſurely now are dead;</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O how can we who ſinners be</l>

               <l>What ſhall I ſay, of Youth, I pray;</l>
               <l>O! Can they Conquer Death?</l>
               <l>For when it goes with deadly Blows,</l>
               <l>'twill ſtrike away their Breath.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There comes a Day, the Scriptures ſay,</l>
