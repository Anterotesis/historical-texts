            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>JUDGING only by our natural partial Ideas of the divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and from our inadequate Views of the Deſigns of Providence, we ſhould be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that when the <hi>Father of Mercies,</hi> the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> ſent his <hi>only begotten Son</hi> into the World, on a Meſſage of Love to Mankind, one principal Deſign of his Miſſion had been, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Nations, and eſtabliſh Peace in this lower World; that he had cruſhed all the Sons of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſet up a Kingdom againſt which no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had dared to exalt itſelf; that all his Diſciples, by their Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, had been ſecured from the Wrath and Violence of a wicked and reſtleſs World; that he had ſaid to the World, <q>Touch not mine Anointed, nor do my Prophets Harm;</q> that every Attempt to diſturb their Tranquility, had been puniſhed with immediate Vengeance, Fire from Heaven to devour them. And when, in Contradiction to all ſuch Expectations, we find that the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> has, in every Age, ſhared in the Calamities common to Mankind: and more than this, when we find it has been the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Object of the implacable Malice of the World;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008289_0005_102E8113E6E34AB0"/>
that <hi>the Kings of the Earth have ſet themſelves, and the</hi> Princes <hi>taken Counſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt;</hi> ſuch a Conduct in divine Providence, leads us to wonder at the Deſigns of Providence, ſo contrary to what Reaſon ſeem'd to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt: we are tempted to ſay, there is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked; were there an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe and good Being, that preſided over the Affairs of Mortals, ſurely we ſhould not ſee real Chriſtianity depreſſed, and Sin reign and triumph; we ſhould not find the Church of God a Field of Blood, under the long-expected Reign of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Prince of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To teach us therefore, how apt we are to form wrong and inadequate Notions of the Methods of God's Government; to give Relief to our Minds under thoſe Diſcouragements, that the Events of Providence are apt to produce; and that no one might miſtake the Nature, the Deſign and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of his Kingdom, our Saviour has plainly told us what we are to expect; he has pointed out what is like to be the Condition of his People, and taught us not to wonder, when we ſee all theſe Things come to paſs: <hi>think not that I am come to ſend Peace on Earth; I came not to ſend Peace, but a Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Verſe, to any one, who will conſider the Tenor of our Saviour's Diſcourſe, is ſufficiently plain, and void of Difficulty; and leads us, on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to conſider the following Things; <abbr>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THE Reaſons of the divine Conduct in this Affair.</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. WE are to conſider the Chriſtian-Church, as ſharing in the Calamities common to a degenerate World, eſpecially that of War.</p>
            <p>GOD was pleaſed of old, for wiſe Purpoſes, to take a particular People, the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> into a peculiar Covenant with Himſelf: He ſeparated them from all the Nations of the Earth, He dealt with them as he did not with any other Nation, He gave them Laws different from all other Nations; and as it was neceſſary in that Age, before <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> were brought to Light by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> He invited them to the Worſhip and Obedience of the True God, by the certain Promiſe of temporal Rewards, and deter'd them from Idolatry and Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by the Threatnings of temporal Judgments. Theſe Promiſes and Threatnings were a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Part of God's Covenant with that People: if they obey'd and ſerv'd him, they were ſure of Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; that God would draw a Line of Protection around them; that all their Enemies ſhould flee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them:—But, if they forſook God, and went after the gods of the Nations, the Sword was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to cut them off from under Heaven, Iſai. i. 19, 20. <hi>if ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the Good of the Land; but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured of the Sword, for the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> And according to the Tenor of this Covenant, God always dealt with that People; when they feared and obeyed Him, He ſubdued their
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008289_0007_102E8118140A8610"/>
Enemies and gave them Peace and Reſt; but when they forſook God, the Heathen had Dominion over them. To acquaint us how exactly God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Dealings to their moral Conduct, and to this Covenant, ſo to teach us the Regard God has to Virtue, ſeems to be one principal Deſign of the large <hi>Hiſtory</hi> we have of that People in the <hi>Bible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH Promiſes, and Threatnings, with a Conduct agreable to them, were ſuitable and neceſſary for that People. This was perhaps the only Method in which they could be brought to Obedience: Their ſpiritual Capacities and Diſcoveries were but ſmall, not ſufficient to govern them, without the immediate, and ſenſible Effects of Virtue and Vice. This was a Government exactly agreable to the Genius and Capacity of that People, and in this Way God's moral Dominion was long ſupported.</p>
            <p>BUT even then the Promiſes belonged to them as a People, and not to Individuals, as ſuch. Hence we find even in that Day, Examples of ſuffering Virtue, and triumphant Wickedneſs. The Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Wicked, and Affliction of the Righteous, was a Subject that engaged the Attention, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the Patience of good Men, in that Day. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that People, the Apoſtle tells us of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints, that <hi>had Trial of cruel Mockings and Scourgings,—they were ſtoned, were ſawn aſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the Sword,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THUS were the <hi>Jews</hi> taken into a peculiar Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and as a People, were the Subjects of temporal Promiſes and Threatnings.</p>
            <p>BUT upon God's ſending his Son into the World, the State of Things was much changed. That particular Covenant with the <hi>Jews,</hi> to which theſe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008289_0008_102E811AC7F746B0"/>
Promiſes belonged, was aboliſhed, the <hi>Jews</hi> were no longer conſidered as God's peculiar People. The Promiſes and Threatnings that belonged to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Being ceaſed; nor was there any Nation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſucceed them. The <hi>Bleſſing of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the ſpiritual Promiſes deſcended, from that Time, equally on <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Our Lord appeared, to ſet up a Kingdom, that <hi>is not of this World,</hi> to reveal a <hi>New, a better Covenant;</hi> which was <hi>eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes;</hi> enforced not with temporary Sanctions, but with ſpiritual and eternal Motives; <hi>exceeding greet and precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> by which we are made <hi>Partakers of the divine Nature.</hi> The Goſpel is a Diſpenſation of ſuperior Light; in it Life and Immortality are ſet before us in the cleareſt Light; its Promiſes are of a divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, its Motives to Obedience are not temporal Peace, but ſpiritual Happineſs; Motives drawn from the World to come. The Obedience of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant, is that of Faith; it flows from an unſhaken Faith in the Rewards and Puniſhments of another Life; <hi>We walk by Faith, and not by Sight.</hi> Evangelic Religion, does not take its Riſe from the Hope of Silver or Gold; but from the Love of God, the Love of our Redeemer; and a bleſſed Faith and Hope in the Promiſes of future Glory. Chriſtians are not, under the Goſpel, conſidered in a political View, as the Nation of the Jews was; nor have we any Exemption from the Calamities that are common to Mankind: So far from this, that our bleſſed Lord has expreſly taught us, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the peculiar Reſentment of the World, to be ſubject to the Sword, and fiery Perſecutions, till that happy Day come when <hi>the Nations ſhall learn War no more.

            <p>IT is readily granted that Sin and Miſery, Virtue and Happineſs are nearly connected; that public Virtue is the natural Parent of public Happineſs. The Goſpel is excellently adapted to advance tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Proſperity;—Peace, Harmony and good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are naturally grafted on the Chriſtian Syſtem.

But how often do we ſee the Order of things inverted, the Tendency of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue obſtructed, in this World of moral Diſorder! Chriſtians don't feel that Felicity, for which the chriſtian Precepts are divinely adapted. Indeed God may interpoſe, and cauſe Religion to have its genuine Effects;—I don't ſay, his Providence does not in this State ſometimes give us a viſible Token of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Religion, (tho' I make no doubt, this was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

WE find God often ſpeaking of his Agency in the Wars and Deſtructions of Mankind. Iſai. xlv. 7. <hi>I form the Light, and create Darkneſs, I make Peace and create Evil; I, the Lord, do all theſe Things.</hi>—Iſai. liv. 16. <hi>I have created the Waſter to deſtroy.</hi> We find him expreſly calling for the Sword, Iſai. xxv. 29.—<hi>for I will call for a Sword upon all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Amos ix. 4.—<hi>thence will I command the Sword, and it ſhall ſlay them.</hi> So we find the Almighty calling and raiſing up Enemies to chaſtize Nations.</p>
            <p>THESE ſtrong Expreſſions of Scripture ſeem to intimate ſome powerful Influence of God, raiſing up, and ſpriting Men to be the Executioners of one another: But they muſt be taken in a limited Senſe; nor may we imagine God to have any other Agency in theſe Things, but what is perfectly conſiſtent with the Goodneſs of his Nature. It would be a moſt diſhonourable Thought of God, to imagine, that he excited the Luſt and Ambition of Mankind; that he made them cruel, or inſpired them with that unnatural Deſire to butcher, and devour one another: No; theſe are Thoughts unworthy that Being, whoſe moſt endearing Character <hi>is Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT muſt however be acknowledged, that God does in ſome Senſe ſend the Sword, and ſuffer his own Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Superiority of Power, which are the Cauſe and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of civil Contentions: But herein, He is no more the blameable Cauſe of that Deſtruction, which is made in the World, by the Abuſe of that Strength and Power, than He is the Author of all the Sin which is committed in the World, becauſe He has created and upholds all, and gives to every one thoſe Abilities they have; yea, He ſupports them in their Rebellions, by giving them <hi>Food and Raiment; ſending his Rain upon the Juſt and upon the Unjuſt.</hi> Even the Goſpel, one of the richeſt of all Bleſſings, is the Occaſion of Sin in this Life, and of an aggravated Damnation, to ſuch as receive the <hi>Grace of God in vain,</hi> in the next. The Means, Occaſions and Inſtruments of War, are the Effects of divine Bounty; but in all theſe, God by no Means unſuitably influences his Creatures, nor is He the blameable Cauſe of Evil.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008289_0016_102E8130B2C6E2D8"/>
lay that Reſtraint on his Creatures, that he is able to do: He ſuffers the proud Oppreſſors of Mankind to make ſad Deſtruction; and ſometimes to ſpread De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation among his own People He; beholds Nations and Empires ruſhing on certain Ruin. In this Senſe God is often ſaid to do, what he does not hinder, or permits to be done. Thus when he raiſes up the Scourges of Mankind, and ſuffers them to go on and proſper; He is ſaid to call and ſend them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Judgments;—It is in this Senſe He is ſaid to harden Men's Hearts, and blind their Eyes; thus He bid <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe <hi>David;</hi> though in all theſe Inſtances, He only permitted them to be done: the Purpoſe, Deſire and Action was not of God. So God not only gives Permiſſion to the Sword, but equally permits thoſe numerous Rebellions, that are daily committed againſt Himſelf; yea, <hi>by one Man</hi> he permitted <hi>Sin</hi> at firſt to <hi>enter into the World,</hi> from whence ſpring all the Evils of his Creatures, whether of a moral or penal Nature. This Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin and Diſorder, is agreable to the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Truth, but is one of the deep Myſteries of Heaven: <hi>His Judgments are a great Deep.</hi>

Enemies of the Church, and of Mankind, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving and deſtroying them in ſubſerviency to their boundleſs Ambition, they are all this Time ſerving the Ends of his Government, executing the good Purpoſes of God;—Purpoſes laid in the eternal Counſels of the divine Mind—Ends, wiſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, holy, juſt and good. The bloody tragical Scenes acted on the Stage of this World, tho' dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in themſelves, are finally over-ruled for good; in the End they will appear Parts of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which divine Wiſdom, Holineſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will ſhine forevermore.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>. GOD ſometimes ſecretly influences and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits his People to ſtand up in Defence of Liberty and Religion. So He gave Charge to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be the Executioners of his Vengeance upon the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Nations; to make no Peace with them, 'til they were utterly deſtroyed from off the Earth; and in a wonderful Manner aſſiſted them to execute the awful Commiſſion: a Judgment which thoſe Nations deſerved for their Idolatry. We likewiſe find military Skill and Power aſcribed to God; <hi>He teaches,</hi> ſays David, <hi>my Hands to war, and my Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to fight:</hi> This ſpecial Influence, this powerful Aſſiſtance, has been often experienced in a juſt Cauſe, in the Defence of his People, in executing the particular Commands of Heaven. He who has the Hearts of Kings in his Hand, often raiſes up Inſtruments to aſſert his Cauſe, to vindicate the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Liberties of Mankind, when threatned by the unbridled Rage and Ambition of Princes.—Of old He raiſed up Deliverers for his People: He made them valiant and victorious.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:008289_0018_102E813A38929310"/>
BUT after all, Wars and Fightings come from the Luſts of Men: they have their Origin in that Luſt of Riches and Dominion ſo common to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate World. It is Ambition and Coveteouſneſs that have, thro' all Ages, depopulated Kingdoms, ſubverted Empires, and delug'd this World in Blood and Ruin. Wars are viſible ſad Inſtances, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening dreadful Demonſtrations, of the deep Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of human Nature; ſuch unnatural Events, as proclaim Mankind awfully deviated from the Rule and Order of their Being; awfully loſt to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principles of Humanity; filled with that malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Hatred, that is not to be found in the brutal World. How many of the Wars and Perſecutions that have diſtreſſed the World, have proceeded from that Malice there is in the Hearts of Men to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that beſt of Religions, He has taught and ſupported in the World!</p>
            <p>BUT when you read and hear of the Calamities God has permitted upon the World by the Sword: when you think how many Thouſands, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid Millions, have been ſacrific'd to the Pride of Princes; how often the World has been drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Blood, and wide Deſtruction ſpread among ſuffering Mortals; you are ready to aſk, <q>What are the Reaſons of God's Judgments; what Ends, agreable to the divine Wiſdom, are anſwer'd? can ſuch Things conſiſt with the divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? are they not Evidences of God's want of Regard to His Creatures?—Can you vindicate the Ways of Heaven, and <hi>aſcribe Righteouſneſs to our Maker?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008289_0019_102E813CE30BD128"/>
for us to inveſtigate the particular Reaſons of many Parts of the divine Conduct:—But even in theſe dreadful Things, there are wiſe Deſigns of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence purſu'd. Upon the moſt ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Things, we ſhall ſee much of the wiſe and good Government of God; that theſe are a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Diſcipline, a State of Things exactly adapted to the moral Temper and State of the World, and not without their ſalutary Effects in God's Creation.</p>
            <p>As to the Church of Chriſt, the Sword may be ſent to refine and purify it. This is a Diſcipline by which God tries the Fidelity of Chriſtians, brightens their Virtues, and prepares them for a Crown of Life: and if God is pleaſed to exerciſe his Children with ſevere Diſcipline; if they <hi>ſuffer with Chriſt</hi> here, <hi>and reign with Him</hi> hereafter, who can ſay that God is unrighteous; ſeeing this is but a Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Life, that perfect Rewards and Puniſhments are reſerv'd for the next Life, when <hi>every one ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive according as his Works ſhall be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, the Sword often ſerves to chaſtize the Church for their Apoſtacy. Chriſtians often fall into great Apoſtacy and loſe the Power, and in a Meaſure, the Form of Godlineſs; they often need the Rod to ſcourge, awaken and reclaim them: this is frequently the Caſe, when Chriſtians have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long Peace and Proſperity; they need ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Diſcipline to recover them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>AND then as to the World in general: Wars and Deſolations are ſuffered, to curb the Luſts and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Wickedneſs of Mankind. That Mankind have revolted from God, and are liable to his juſt Vengeance, is too manifeſt to be deny'd.

Where reaſonable Creatures are innocent and uncorrupt, milder Means are ſufficient; but where Children are obſtinate, God, as the tender Father of his Creatures, muſt take the Rod in Hand:—From this Neceſſity He deſtroy'd a World of Ungodly by a Flood; he ſends Plagues, Famines and the Sword, to correct the exorbitant Growth of Wickedneſs, to leſſen the Number of Sinners, to lay Reſtraints upon Survivors. As Sin and Miſery are cloſely connected, in the Nature of Things,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008289_0021_102E81415FF8EBD8"/>
what Wiſdom is it in God to ſuffer Men to feel the Folly of their own Ways, in the Vengeance they execute upon one another: thus Sin is its own Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: The alwiſe RULER teaches the Evil of Sin, ſets Bounds to human Wickedneſs, prevents the dreadful Effects of Proſperity, and keeps the World in Awe: for, O! Lord, <hi>when thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World will learn Righteouſneſs.</hi> Examples of divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment are needful: So God drowned the Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>World; He rained Fire and Brimſtone upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> to make Examples of Judgment for all ſucceeding Generations. Theſe Severities in Government are not to be look'd upon as the Effects of Paſſion, or arbitrary Will, or a needleſs Rigour; but as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Diſpenſations;—'tis in Mercy to Mankind that He inflicts them: He ſuffers no more Examples of Vengeance in the World, than are neceſſary to the good Government of it:—In the End, all theſe bitter Things will be found to be the moſt proper Diſcipline for this degenerate Race: the Ends of Government will be wiſely anſwered; we ſhall be able in the Review of all, to ſay, <hi>great and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are thy Works, Lord God Almighty, juſt and true are thy Ways, thou King of Saints. </hi>—We ſhall ſee Order, Harmony and the beſt Good of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſulting from this Confuſion.</p>

But ſhould any go farther, and aſk, <q>Wherefore has the ſupreme RULER form'd ſuch a Plan of Government, and permitted ſuch a lapſed State of Being as to make theſe Confuſions neceſſary?</q>—Let ſuch know, that they <hi>do not enquire wiſely of this Matter.

His Ways are above our Ways.—Shall the Thing formed ſay to him that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, why haſt thou made me thus?</hi>—'Tis not for us, ſhort-ſighted Mortals, to pry into the ſecret Reaſons of the divine Conduct, nor to ſay whether this was the only poſſible Plan of divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The indiſputable Marks of Wiſdom and Love, which we ſee in all his Works, lead us to believe, that <hi>his Way is perfect; that he is a God of Judgment, without Iniquity, Juſt and Right is He.</hi>

            <p>From what has been offered:—</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. LET us learn to think well of God, and his Diſpenſations. When we think on the Miſeries, the Nations have in all Ages ſuffered by the Sword: when we reflect on the Pride of Monarchs, and the Horrors of War; and conſider that theſe are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God, in the Wiſdom of his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are ready to think hard of Heaven, and fooliſhly charge God with a want of Regard to our Happineſs: <q>Are theſe the Diſpenſations of that Being, whoſe Nature is Love? is this the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of paternal Goodneſs?</q>—But we ought to remember that Sin, which by one Man entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, has reigned triumphant in all Periods of Time, notwithſtanding the more gentle Methods of Grace to reform it; ſo that it was neceſſary to uphold God's moral Dominion, that Men ſhould feel ſome of the natural penal Effects of Vice. The natural State of the World has never been worſe; the <hi>Father of Mercies</hi> has never been more ſevere, than was neceſſary to the Purpoſes of his moral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

Good to my Country. We are indeed to look on this Neceſſity as the Judgment of God. We are to cultivate the Arts of War, as beſide the genuine Tendency of our holy Religion; nevertheleſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in this State of Diſorder. The ſkilful Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our Lives and Liberties are great Bleſſings to Mankind. Does it not create Anxiety in every conſiderate Mind, to find, that after ſo many Years Exerciſe in War, military Skill and Diſcipline have received no greater Improvements? Every one knows the Poſture of our military Affairs is greatly changed ſince the Beginning of the War; that the Diſcipline which was before, is now by no Means ſuitable and adequate to the preſent State of <hi>America.</hi> Should God ſuffer us to be invaded, we ſhould not have to deal only with raw undiſciplined <hi>Savages,</hi> but with regular Battalions, expert in all the Arts of War, provided with a numerous Train of Artillery, no Way to be broken but by Troops equally provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of equal Skill and Fortitude. What an unequal Match are twice their Number of half-armed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined <hi>Militia,</hi> ſuddenly aſſembled; the greater Part of whom never faced an Enemy, or were marſhaled in regimental Order? What Impreſſion could they make upon the firm Battalions of veteran Troops? What Perplexity, what Amazement, what Confuſion would a powerful Invaſion throw us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? How highly neceſſary is it that our Troops know how to approach, and retreat from an Enemy in unbroken Order, and to withſtand the furious Shock of a regular Army? Providence therefore calls us to make great Improvements in this neceſſary Science. This good Land, which God gave to our Fathers, with the noble Privileges tranſmitted to

We become more and more the Object of public Attention. We may expect this <hi>New World</hi> will henceforth be the Seat of War; we may expect in our Turn to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded: Some of us may yet ſee our Plains flow with human Blood.
