            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE following letters were written laſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, immediately after the adoption of the article ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory of the Britiſh Treaty. As the ſubject of our French relations is now before the public, it has been deemed proper to preſent them in the form of a pamphlet, as they may enable the citizens of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States to make a juſt eſtimate of the conduct of the Federal Executive. The explanatory article to the Britiſh Treaty has been introduced into the diſcuſſion to ſhew to what lengths the adminiſtration has gone to conciliate the Britiſh government, and to ſhew likewiſe, that all hazards were to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered and all intereſts proſtrated to render our country ſubſervient to Great Britain.</p>
            <p>As an attempt has been juſt made by the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration to juſtify their conduct, to criminate the French Republic, and to alienate the American af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from their friends and allies, it is peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, that an antidote ſhould be applied to the circulating poiſon—this antidote may be found in theſe letters; for whatever may be their demerit, it will be beſtowing little commendation on them to
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:032172_0003_0FF1684A98893448"/>ſay, that they contain a full refutation of the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, calumnies and perverſions, which <q>the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in form to the deliberative talents of his predeceſſors</q> has attempted to impoſe upon the American world. Indeed a refutation of that deformed maſs of unfledged matter would be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it a conſideration it illy merited, were it not accompanied by an authority, which too often, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for our country! has legitimized injuſtice, and given a ſanction to the perverſion of truth.</p>
            <p>A diſpaſſionate and unprejudiced conſideration of the ſubject of our French relations ſeems to be all that is requeſted by the author; for it is a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this ſort which muſt have given riſe to the impreſſions on his mind, and an enquiry, unſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticated by party ſpirit, and uninfluenced by names, muſt give birth to ſimilar impreſſions on the minds of the reader. It is high time that truth ſhould be ſubſtituted for authority; for if the deſigns of the adminiſtration are carried into effect, we may exclaim with the poet:</p>
            <q>"Curſe on his virtues! theyve undone his country."</q>
            <p>The letter of "The Preſidents man Timothy" has diſcovered the cloven foot of the Britiſh faction; and although to avoid a <hi>war</hi> was the argument in favour of the adoption of the Britiſh Treaty, yet now the controverſy is with the French Republic, every means which malice can deviſe, and indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy can ſuggeſt, are employed to effect a rupture with her. Diplomatic hiſtory is without an example of ſo ſtrange a proceeding as the publication of the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:032172_0004_0FF1684E84283580"/>of States letter, before its receipt by the Miniſter to whom it was addreſſed, and from its extraordinary matter as well as manner; from its mixture of levity with an attempt at wit, when a ſolemn ſubject was in diſcuſſion and being deſtitute of even a conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatory idea or ſoothing expreſſion, no doubt can be entertained, that the object is to prepare us for a war with France, and to provoke her to a declaration of it. The American mind muſt be proſtituted indeed, if it could be ſo far eſtranged from the obligations of gratitude and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their revolution, as to coincide with the adminiſtration in the baſe attempt to couple our country with the league of deſpots. Let them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their ſympathy for the cauſe of kings in ſecret, but let them forbear to throw the gauntlet—let them pauſe before they paſs the Rubicon; for the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans have not yet been trained to paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, they have not yet ſubſtituted the principles of a Machiavelian adminiſtration for their own; neither have they been ſufficiently debaſed to embrace Great Britain and brandiſh the dagger at their friends and allies—They have conſtituted a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not blindly to ſubmit to its will; for as they have retained the ſovereignty in themſelves, they will neither proſtrate the principles of immutable juſtice, nor the divine attribute of reaſon to become the ſubmiſſive tools of creatures of their own creation— As <hi>"we the people"</hi> conſtituted the government, and as we the people can annihilate it, let not the ſlaviſh, the unworthy doctrine of paſſive obedience be any longer preached up by the minions of a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh faction to prevent the people from an exerciſe
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032172_0005_0FF1685022508BC0"/>of their own judgment, and to prevent them from teſting the conduct of their ſervants by the eternal principles of juſtice—If the adminiſtration has acted juſtly the people will approve, if they have acted unjuſtly they will condemn—they will never partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in crimes by becoming their advocates, as long as republicaniſm ſhall retain its empire in our country.</p>

               <p>IT is the duty of every citizen to contribute all in his power towards the information of the public mind, or the general good. This obligation is ſo impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that no man can evade it, without meriting the character of a luke-warm patriot, or of an enemy to the public happineſs. As far as my powers go they ſhall be exerciſed on thoſe two objects, and that too with the fulleſt determination to permit neither char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter nor ſtation to draw me aſide from a candid ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of facts, and as candid a deduction from them.</p>
               <p>The Conſtitution of the United States ought to be to the people of this country what the Alcoran is to the Mahometans—It is to politics what that is to religion, and ought to be as ſacred to the one, as that is to the other. The expoſition of its text ought to be uniform, at leaſt when interpreted by the <hi>ſame</hi> perſon.—A vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egated conſtruction of the <hi>ſame</hi> part, by the <hi>ſame</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at <hi>different</hi> times, cannot but lead us to think it an inſtrument, contrived for the accomodation of thoſe
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:032172_0007_0FF168561B6D9370"/>who adminiſter it, rather than of the people. My object in this eſſay is to ſhew, that the Executive has inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the <hi>ſame</hi> parts of the Conſtitution, variouſly at different times; and that he has thereby converted the great charter of our country into a thing of chance, liable to the direction of whim, caprice or deſign.</p>
               <p>By the firſt conſtruction of the treaty making power by the Executive, his power was co-ordinate only, and not omnipotent; but by his laſt conſtruction he has completely abſorbed in himſelf, the right of making treaties under all circumſtances, and in all their varieties. This aſſertion I will illuſtrate by facts. In the year 1790 or 1791, it was deemed expedient to make ſome arrangement with Algiers, for the ſecurity of our ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the protection of our commerce.</p>
               <p>As monied engagements were neceſſarily involved in ſuch a negociation, the Executive did not think himſelf conſtitutionally authorized to negociate a treaty, in which were contained ſuch ſtipulations, without firſt having a reſolution of Congreſs, communicating ſuch a power. By his direction the Secretary of State wrote to the chairman of a committee of Congreſs, appointed on this ſubject, and encloſed a reſolution which he wiſhed to be adopted, purporting the aſſent of Congreſs to ſuch a negociation. Thus it appears from the <hi>then</hi> conſtruction of the Conſtitution by the Executive, that he did not conceive himſelf authorized to make monied contracts, without firſt obtaining the aſſent of Congreſs thereto.—But in the Treaty, which he negociated with Great Britain, he abandoned this ground, and pledged the United States for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>millions of dollars,</hi> on his own individual autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Again, in the Treaty which he negociated with the Creek Indians, he thought the <hi>advice</hi> of the Senate, neceſſary before he entered upon the negociation. To
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:032172_0008_0FF16858E942ED60"/>obtain this he went in perſon to the Senate, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them the outlines of a treaty. Objections were made to ſome of its parts, and amendments were made before the Senate would give their <hi>advice</hi> in favour of the negociation.—But in the negociation with Great Britain, the Senate were not even apprized that a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was to be made, much leſs was their <hi>advice</hi> taken upon the ſubject. By the Conſtitution, the <hi>"advice and conſent"</hi> of the Senate are neceſſary to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of treaties, and it is obvious, that the Executive underſtood <hi>advice</hi> to mean a different thing from <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> when he contemplated a Treaty with the Creek Indians. Thus then there has been a manifeſt differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the conſtruction of the Conſtitution by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive in theſe two caſes, the <hi>advice</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> of the Senate having been taken in the one caſe, and their <hi>conſent</hi> only in the other. How are we to underſtand this difference of the Executive with himſelf? What are we to ſuppoſe of a Conſtitution, ſuſceptible of ſuch oppoſite conſtructions? What ſecurity are we to look for in an adminiſtration, capable of torturing the charter of freemen to mean oppoſite things? What bulwark have the people againſt the introduction of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power, when their ſolemn political covenant can be moulded at will, and according to the views of the Executive?—Theſe things require ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for in vain have we ſeceded from the arbitrary power of Great Britain, if we are to ſubſtitute the will of an individual for the conſtitution of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>

               <p>IT is incumbent on freemen to enquire—it is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to their independent exiſtence to know how their
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032172_0009_0FF1685BD1C0E048"/>affairs are adminiſtered—without inquiry they cannot be informed, without a knowledge of facts they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſcertain, whether they are advancing or retrogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in political truth. Subjects and ſlaves ſhould alone endeavour to bury the poignacy of their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ignorance—citizens, to retain their rank, ought to have the torch of inveſtigation ever in a blaze. Every meaſure is a wrong one that is abaſhed by ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny; every public ſervant gives cauſe for ſuſpicion, whoſe conduct cannot bid defiance to the ſevereſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions. Truth cannot ſuffer from inveſtigation; upright character cannot be injured by free inquiry; the moment, therefore, expedients are employed to keep truth at a diſtance, or to circumvallate cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter by adventitious lines, ſuſpicion has food to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge upon, and honeſty cauſe for alarm.—Our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and its adminiſtrators have had divine qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities aſcribed to them—if then their merit is equal to the eulogium of their admirers, nothing I can advance can bring their reputation into queſtion; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they muſt derive additional luſtre from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to caſt a ſhade over their virtues, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a conduct like mine ought to be approved, whoſe endeavours to expoſe defects, if unſupported, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil upon the author, and render merit more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. To know merit, it is neceſſary to ſearch for it; to be enamoured of it, it is neceſſary to know it, how far wrong then are thoſe, who condemn the freedom of inquiry into the men and meaſures of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Cenſures upon a free preſs are libels upon truth and virtue, and as the diamond receives freſh luſtre from friction, untainted virtue muſt acquire additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal brilliance from the rudeſt contacts. I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to my ſubject, and ſhew a conduct in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive towards the French Republic, that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle a man's honour in private life in inextricable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Genet, the firſt Miniſter under the French Republic, arrived in this city, he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032172_0010_0FF1685D70456818"/>his powers and his wiſhes, and thoſe of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our Executive, to enter into a new treaty, <q>

                     <hi>the Senate was in receſs, and that he would meet them as ſoon as he could do it, by the forms of the conſtitution,</hi>
                  </q> and thus the propoſition was refuſed, under a pretext, that the forms of the Conſtitution would not them admit of a negociation.</p>
               <p>Let us now enquire how thoſe forms operated in a late negociation, when the preſent Secretary of State was appointed a commiſſioner to draught a codicil to the laſt will and teſtament of American Independence— the Britiſh treaty. Scarcely had the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives decided to make appropriations to carry the Britiſh treaty into effect, when a memorial from the Britiſh Charge d' Affaires announced to the Executive an interference of exiſting treaties with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with Great Britain. Without giving this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial time to breathe, and to recover from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, which its haſte occaſioned, the Secretary of State was commiſſioned by the <hi>Preſident</hi> to enter into a negociation with the Britiſh Charge d' Affaires, and to form a Treaty Dictionary, by which all treaties, ſubſequent to the Britiſh treaty, were to be defined, and expounded. The appointment of the Secretary of State to this duty is declared in the commiſſion, to be <hi>agreeably to the laws of the United States,</hi> and the law, authorizing the delegation of ſuch a truſt to the Secretary of State, was paſſed the 27th of July, in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty nine. Under a law then, which exiſted before the Republic of France had a being, was the preſent Secretary of State appointed to negociate with a Britiſh miniſter, and yet when the miniſter of the <hi>French Republic</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a negociation on the 23d of May, 1793, he was informed by the Executive, "That the participation in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032172_0011_0FF1686172BA82E0"/>matters of treaty, given by the conſtitution to that branch of our government, would of courſe delay any definitive anſwer to his friendly propoſition," and that he would, <q>meet them with the moſt friendly diſpoſitions on the grounds of treaty, propoſed by the National Convention, as ſoon as he could do it by the forms of the Conſtitution.</q> The Senate was in receſs, to be ſure, when Mr. Genet made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and they might as well have been in receſs, when the new treaty was negociated between Phineas Bond and Timothy Pickering; for they were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of the negociation, until the article was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted and ſent to them to be regiſtered.</p>
               <p>One of two inferences obtrude themſelves involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily upon the mind from the foregoing facts—either that the Preſident conceived he had not a power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a negociation, without the advice of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and, therefore, that he was guilty of a wilful vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the Conſtiution in the negociation of the new explanatory article; or, that the exiſting laws gave him ſuch an authority, and, therefore, that he was guilty of a violation of his own and the faith of the United States, in declaring to Mr. Genet, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the French Republic, that he had no power, by the forms of the Conſtitution to enter into a negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with him, as the Senate was in receſs.</p>
               <p>We have heard much, lately, about public faith; but what kind of faith is it, which impelled the firſt Executive Magiſtrate to declare to the French miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the forms of the Conſtitution prohibited trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him, and yet under the ſame forms negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a treaty with a Britiſh Commiſſioner? The nerves of certain gentlemen, who were ſtaunch advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for high toned Executive power, were tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly alive when the faith of the United States, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be pledged by the Executive, was in danger of inexecution as to the Britiſh Treaty; but how ſtands
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032172_0012_0FF168643A81FB48"/>the account of honor ſince the laſt negociation? If it is a juſt maxim, that nothing can be politically right which is morally wrong, in what ſyſtem of political morality are we to ſearch for an extenuation of a breach of faith with one nation more than another? I will leave to caſuiſts to determine the degree of turpitude in deception and falſehood to a friend, and in abject ſubmiſſion to a perfidious and tyrannical enemy.</p>

               <head>LETTER III.</head>
               <p>IN my laſt letter I purpoſely avoided conſidering the probable effects of our <hi>punic</hi> faith to France. It was not my intention to anticipate the concluſions which would naturally ariſe in every honeſt mind. The facts ſtated muſt bring a bluſh into the cheek of every Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, who feels for his country's honor, and who has not forgotten, that France engaged in a war againſt Great Britain to aid us in the eſtabliſhment of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, and that ſhe is now at war with the ſame nation, who headed the cruſade againſt her, to eſtabliſh her own and the rights of man. The ſuffuſion of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſenſibility muſt be increaſed by the information, that Mr. Fauchet, the ſucceſſor of Mr. Genet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the propoſition to treat, and that he never received a poſitive anſwer to his requeſt.—When our Executive had refuſed treating with Mr. Genet, under the pretext already ſtated, Mr. Morris, our Miniſter at the Republic of France, was deſired <hi>"to explain to the Executive of France this delay, which had prevented, as yet, our formal acceſſion to their propoſition to treat; and to aſſure them, that the Preſident would meet them with the moſt friendly diſpoſitions on the grounds of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, propoſed by the National Convention, as ſoon as he could do it by the forms of the Conſtitution,"</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032172_0013_0FF16865DC2B0770"/>
                  <hi>"that the powers of Mr. Genet be renewed to his ſucceſſor."</hi> The powers of Mr. Genet, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed to his ſucceſſor. Mr. Fauchet propoſed to treat, but was played off with diplomatic fineſſe! By what name ſhall we diſtinguiſh this conduct? In what moral code ſhall we find an apology for a breach of ſolemn and plighted faith? Mr. Morris was deſired, to <hi>"aſſure"</hi> the Executive of France, that the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent would meet them, with the <hi>moſt friendly diſpoſitions</hi> on the grounds of treaty, and yet, when Mr. Fauchet made his overtures he could obtain no poſitive anſwer —Does this management comport with the <hi>profeſſions</hi> made by cur Government to the Republic of France, through Mr. Monroe? Does it accord with the <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful letter</hi> written by the Preſident to Mr. Adet, on the receipt of the French Flag? Well might Mr. Adet now exclaim in turn, <hi>"Wonderful People!"</hi> when our Government has become a phenomenon of hypocriſy and treachery. I could ſwell the black catalogue by adding other inſtances of the groſſeſt deception, but at preſent I ſhall content myſelf with barely ſtating, that when Mr. Fauchet expreſſed his apprehenſions about Mr. Jay's miſſion, he was informed, that nothing more was intended by it, than <hi>to demand a reparation, for the ſpoliations upon our commerce, and that he had no powers to do any thing, which could militate againſt the intereſt of France</hi>—And yet the Britiſh treaty, was the offspring of this miſſion!!!</p>
               <p>As <hi>fear</hi> has been the operative motive in the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Britiſh Treaty, I might here ſhew cauſe for alarm to the <hi>funding order,</hi> and to the <hi>mamalukes</hi> of adminiſtration by maintaining, that we have given the French Republic a ſufficient inducement to treat us with ſeverity—we have by a Treaty with her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, actually <hi>changed the exiſting ſtate of things,</hi> and thereby furniſhed ample cauſe for conſidering us as in combination againſt her—we have declared a neutrality, co-incident with the <hi>"modern"</hi> uſage of nations, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032172_0014_0FF16868CF1E77D8"/>we have, by ſubſequent ſtipulations, abandoned this ground, and left a queſtion, decided by the modern law, to be determined after the concluſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war—We have increaſed the number of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band articles, contrary to the ſame modern law, and thereby given evident advantages to Great Britain, at the expence of the French Republic. We have thus violated our neutrality, by <hi>"favouring the arms of one, to the detriment of the other."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"A neutral nation," ſays Vattel, "deſirous ſafely to enjoy the conveniencies of that ſtate, is <hi>in all things</hi> to ſhew an <hi>exact impartiality</hi> between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at war; for ſhould he <hi>favour one, to the detriment of the other,</hi> he cannot complain of being treated by him as an adherent, and confederate of his enemy; his neutrality would be <hi>a fraudulent neutrality,</hi> but of which no nation would be the dupe."</p>
               <p>Have we ſhewn an exact impartiality between the parties at war? Have we not favoured one to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the other? Has not our neutrality been a fraudulent one? Have we nor declared, the <hi>"modern uſage of nations,"</hi> to be our guide, and have we not abandoned this uſage to prejudice France, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit Great Britain? Does not the Britiſh treaty contain ſtipulations calculated for the <hi>preſent war,</hi> and are theſe not to be conſidered as a deriliction of our neutrality? Did not the Preſident's <hi>edict</hi> of neutrality declare, that "the duty and the intereſt of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States require, that they ſhould with ſincerity and good faith, adopt and purſue a conduct friendly and impartial towards the belligerent powers?" Did we treat France with <hi>"ſincerity?"</hi> Did we exerciſe <hi>"good faith"</hi> towards her? Has our conduct been <hi>"friendly and impartial?"</hi> Let the anſwer to citizen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net's propoſition—the continual embarraſſments thrown in the way of the French Republic, and the Britiſh treaty, ſpeak our ſincerity, our good faith, our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and our impartiality.</p>

                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:032172_0015_0FF1686BBB5E6510"/>
I will now ſhew, that in defiance of our pretended neutrality, in defiance of every obligation of honor, and gratitude, and good faith, our adminiſtration balanced as to the part they would take in relation to the French Republic. Indeed nothing but the univerſal ſentiment of enthuſiaſtic affection, diſplayed by <hi>the people</hi> of the United States, on the arrival of Mr. Genet, could have ſubdued the Machiavelian policy, exhibited in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing queries.</p>

               <p>THE proceedings of our government, during the "ſix years glorious adminiſtration," have ſuch an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aſpect, that it will be difficult to impreſs a belief of the reality of the tranſactions.

               </p>
               <p>"WHEREAS by the third article of the treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, concluded at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don on the 19th day of november, 1794, between his Britannic Majeſty and the United States of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, it was agreed that it ſhould at all times be free to his Majeſty's ſubjects and to the Citizens of the United States, and alſo to the Indians dwelling on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the boundary line aſſigned by the treaty of peace to the United States, freely to paſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs by land or inland navigation, into the reſpective territories and countries of the two contracting parties on the continent of America (the Bay Company on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with each other, ſubject to the proviſions and limitations contained in the firſt article: And whereas by the 8th article of the treaty of peace and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip concluded at Greenville on the 3d day of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 1795, between the United States, and the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or tribes of Indians called the Wyandots, Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, Shawanees, Ottawas, Chippewas, Pattawati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Miamies, Elkias, it was ſtipulated that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be permitted to reſide at any of the towns or hunting camps of the ſaid Indian tribes as a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who is not furniſhed with a licence for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, under the authority of the United States, which latter ſtipulation has excited doubts, whether in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032172_0019_0FF168744D982210"/>it may not interfere with the due execution of the ſaid article of the treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation; and it being the ſincere deſire of his Britannic Majeſty, and of the United States, that this point ſhould be ſo explained as to remove all doubts, and promote mutual ſatisfacton and friendſhip: and for this purpoſe his Britannic Majeſty having named for his Commiſſioner, PHINEAS BOND, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Conſul General for the middle and ſouthern States of America, (and now his Majeſty's Charge d' Affaires to the United States) and the Preſident of the United States having named for their Commiſſioner, TIMOTHY PICKERING, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Secretary of State for the United States, to whom, agreeably to the laws of the United States, he has entruſted this negociation. They, the ſaid commiſſioners, having communicated to each other their full powers, have, in virtue of the ſame and conformably to the ſpirit of the laſt article of the ſaid treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, entered into this explanatory article, and now by theſe preſents, explicitly agree and declare, that no ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations in any treaty ſubſequently concluded by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the contracting parties with any other ſtate or nation, or with any Indian tribe can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to derogate in any manner from the rights and free intercourſe and commerce ſecured by the aforeſaid third article of the treaty to the ſubjects of his Majeſty, and to the citizens of the United States, and Indians dwelling on either ſide of the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry line aforeſaid; but that all the ſaid perſons ſhall remain at full liberty freely to paſs and repaſs by land or inland navigation, into the reſpective terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and countries of the contracting parties on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the ſaid boundary line, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other, according to the ſtipulations of the ſaid third article of the treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation. This explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory article, when the ſame ſhall have been ratified by his Majeſty, and by the Preſident of the United States;

               <p>"In witneſs whereof, we the ſaid commiſſioners of his Majeſty the King of great Britain and the United States of America, have ſigned this expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory article, and thereto affixed our ſeals.</p>

               <p>IN the formation of this article the American Puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendorf who negociated it ſeems to have forgotten that he was not the Secretary of State to Sancho Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha, and that he was not fabricating an explanatory law for the iſland of Barataria. If ſuch were his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they might have made a figure in the renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed adventures of <hi>The Knight of la Mancha;</hi> but Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans have not yet been gifted like him, that they are able to ſee a <hi>"citadel"</hi> in a wind mill, or an army in a flock of ſheep. I will ſubmit to this <hi>coloſſal juriſt</hi> an extract from Vattel, and leave to the intelligent freemen of the United States to decide, how far we have acted with <hi>good faith</hi> towards Spain and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian tribes in the admiſſion of this explanatory article. <q>The third general maxim, or principle, on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of interpretation is: <hi>that neither the one nor the other of the intereſted or contracting powers has a right to interpret the act, or treaty at pleaſure.</hi> For if you are at liberty to give my promiſe whatever ſenſe you pleaſe, you will have the power of obliging me to do whatever you have a mind, contrary to my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032172_0021_0FF1687B0C9BFF30"/>and beyond my real engagement; and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, if I am allowed to explain my promiſes as I pleaſe, I may render them vain and illuſive, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a ſenſe quite different from that in which they were preſented to you, and in which you muſt have taken them in accepting them.</q> Our executive has undertaken not only to <hi>intrepret</hi> but to <hi>explain away</hi> the Spaniſh and Indian treaties <hi>"at pleaſure;"</hi> for it is a fact of public notoriety, that neither Spain nor the Indian tribes have been conſulted. Indeed ſuch was the precipitancy with which this explanatory article was concluded. That I much doubt whether the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient negociator himſelf was aware of its effects. His hurry ſeems to have been as great as it was to uncloath himſelf of a ſet of opinions hoſtile to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, the moment he became a member of the Privy Council of his Columbian Majeſty.</p>

               <p>FROM the contemplation of the incomprehenſible perfections of the explanatory article and its negociator —from a ſurvey of this prodigy in intellectual endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whoſe almighty mind diſdains <hi>American</hi> limits— from a view of that philantrophy, which ſcorns to epitomize human benefits, by the ſelfiſh policy of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—from him, whoſe ſympathy for Great Britain can only be exceeded by his abhorrence of the Republic of France, I revert to the conſideration of the queries contained in my third letter—In juſtice to the "ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in form to his predeceſſors," I muſt acquit him from having had any agency in them—They ſmell too ſtrongly of <hi>St. Omers</hi> to admit the ſuppoſition for a moment, that <hi>ſuch</hi> a Secretary of Sate could compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, much leſs have conceived them.</p>

It will be remembered, that Citizen Genet arrived at Charleſton, on the 8th of April 1793—that the queries were ſubmitted to the heads of the departments, on the 18th of the ſame month—that the proclamation of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality was iſſued on the 22d, and that the French Miniſter did not arrive in this city, until the 16th of May—Scarcely had the news arrived in this city, that a Miniſter from the Republic of France had landed at Charleſton, before the queries were manufactured, and tranſmitted for conſideration to the different heads of departments—<hi>Ten</hi> days only intervened between the arrival and the queries, juſt time enough for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be received from Charleſton—<hi>Four</hi> days after the date of the queries, the edict of neutrality was uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the world, to the aſtoniſhment of every repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican in our country. It appears clearly then, that the edict of neutrality was occaſioned by the arrival of Mr. Genet, from its appearing <hi>immediately after</hi> information was received of his arrival at Charleſton. If the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive could reconcile himſelf to a promulgation of a proclamation of neutrality, under unconſtitutional and other circumſtances, the other arrangements in the view of the queries followed of courſe. The procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation indicated as little regard to the conſtitution as the queries did to our treaties, and the one was not more perfidious, than the other was an arrogant aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of power, and the man who could contrive the one could execute the other. The proclamation was the firſt link in the chain, and no doubt the order would have been purſued, as the ſecond queſtion related to the recognition of the miniſter of the Republic of France, had not an univerſal ſentiment of affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate recognition by <hi>the people,</hi> diſplayed itſelf on his paſſage through the country from Charleſton to this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—Numerous addreſſes were preſented to him, and but one feeling ſeemed to actuate the American peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Under theſe circumſtances it would have made the refuſal to acknowledge the Miniſter <q>

                  </q> at that time, the executive muſt have been reluctantly dragged to obey the voice of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—as a demonſtrative proof that it was the intention of the executive to purſue the ſyſtem plainly indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the queries, the letter of <hi>"Pacificus,"</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about this time, may be adduced. Theſe letters were aſcribed, and never denied, to the Secretary of the Treaſury, the virtual Preſident of the United States, whoſe baneful councils directed the affairs of the Union. The doctrines they contain are calculated to deſtroy the favourable diſpoſition of the people of this country towards the French Republic, and to pave the way for the execution of the plan contemplated in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Liſten to this apoſtle of monarchy, and no doubt can remain of his intention to detach us from the French Republic. <q>
                     <hi>If there was any kindneſs in the deciſion, demanding a return of kindneſs from us, it was the kindneſs of Louis the</hi> 16th; <hi>his heart was the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory of the ſentiment—let the genuine voice of nature then, unperverted by political ſubtelties, pronounce whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the acknowledgement, which may be due for that kindneſs, can be equitably transfered from him to others, who had no ſhare in the deciſion—whether the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of gratitude ought to determine us to behold with indifference his misfortunes, and with ſatisfaction the triumphs of his enemies</hi>
                  </q>—To receive a miniſter from the <hi>Republic</hi> of France muſt have been ſuppoſed by him to be a transfer of kindneſs from <hi>the king, <q>to others who had no ſhare in the deciſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </q> Under impreſſions like theſe, no wonder he ſhould have created doubts, whether as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter from the Republic of France ſhould be received,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032172_0024_0FF16881609A2D18"/>whether the treaties between that Republic, and the United States ſhould be conſidered as ſtill in operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whether a miniſter from the regent of France ſhould be received—his intimacy with Talon at that time, who was believed to be a miſſionary of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal regent, made it no doubt a deſideratum with him, that a miniſter from the regent ſhould be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>To remove all doubt about the ſentiments of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Treaſury reſpecting the French Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, I will make a few more quotations from <hi>"Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus. In a caſe ſo circumſtanced,"</hi> ſays this cruſader againſt Republicaniſm, <q>
                     <hi>does it, can it conſiſt with our juſtice or our humanity, to partake in the angry and vindicative paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which are endeavoured to be excited againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Monarch</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Would gratiude dictate to a people ſituated as are the people of this country, to lend their aid to extend to the ſon the misfortunes of the father?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If too (as no ſenſible and candid man, will deny) the extent of the preſent combination againſt France is in a degree to be aſcribed to <hi>imprudences</hi> on her part; <hi>the exemption of the United States in ſtill more manifeſt and complete.</hi> No country is bound to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in hazards of the moſt critical kind, which may have been produced or promoted by the <hi>indiſcretion</hi> and <hi>intemperance</hi> of another.</q> Can repugnance be ſtronger than that evidenced in the foregoing queſtions? Muſt we not be irreſiſtibly urged to the belief, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the omnipotence of the Secretary in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, that the intention was to refuſe acknowledging a miniſter from the Republic of France, to renounce the treaties, or hold them ſuſpended until the monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy was re-eſtabliſhed, and to recognize a miniſter from the regent? Why the appeal to our juſtice and humanity in favour of the <hi>"unfortunate monarch;"</hi> why that ſympathy for the <hi>"ſon,"</hi> if it was the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Executive to recognize their <hi>"enemies?"</hi> Would the Secretary of the Treaſury have been ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032172_0025_0FF16886946B66D8"/>in pleading the cauſe of Louis and his ſon, if his feelings had been in uniſon with the triumphs of the nation? His cloquence in favor of royalty was too animated, to excite a doubt of his ſenſibility for its cauſe, or his apathy for the Republic. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the eagerneſs he diſplayed during the weſtern inſurrection to parſue certain innocent men to the gibbet to favour his purpoſes, yet when the cauſe of <hi>kings</hi> was to plead, he ſeemed melted by humanity, and the ferocity of his nature appeared to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into lamb-like ſoftneſs!! Was the combination againſt France owing to her <hi>imprudencies</hi> or to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution? The Secretary here pleads the cauſe of <hi>the coalition,</hi> by aſcribing the combination againſt France to her <hi>imprudencies,</hi> rather than to the revolution. This is in exact coincidence with his views; for if he could make France appear to be the agreſſor, his purpoſes would have been anſwered, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, in his eſtimation, muſt have been abſolved from their engagements. If the revolution itſelf was an imprudence, or an act of <hi>"indiſcretion and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,"</hi> then indeed have we no honour to look for, for our ſeceſſion from the deſpotiſm of a Britiſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and, perhaps, it would not be uncharitable to believe, that the Secretary intended to characterize all revolutions as acts of imprudence, indiſcretion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance. The reſiſtance of France againſt deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, her energy in oppoſition to the coalition of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants was conſidered as imprudence, indiſcretion and intemperance, and, therefore, the United States were to <hi>renounce</hi> their treaties with her, or hold them <hi>ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> until the government of deſpotiſm ſhould eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, their <hi>"exemption"</hi> being <hi>"manifeſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete!!"</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the preſent Secretary of the Treaſury had made it a problem, whether the treaties between France and the United States ought to be conſidered as ſtill in operation, I could have found an apology for him, in the limitation of his mind to the arithmetical rules
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032172_0026_0FF1688834D41FC8"/>of addition and multiplication; and had the preſent Secretary of State laboured under the ſame difficulty, an ample excuſe might have been found for him, as he is <hi>"the ſucceſſor but in forms to his predeceſſors;"</hi> but that the ex-Secretary of the Treaſury ſhould have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted difficulties, who ſeems to have made all writers his ſtudy, from <hi>Machiavel</hi> to Vattel, can only find a ſolution in his known averſion from the Republic of France, and devotion to monarchy. Vattel and Burla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maqui are books as familiar to him as Machiavel, and although he has the latter in his <hi>heart,</hi> he has the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in his head, and can quote them, as the devil does ſcripture, for his purpoſes. Theſe writers and others of like deſcription, muſt have taught him, that the treaties between France and the United States are <hi>real</hi> and not <hi>perſonal,</hi> and that notwithſtanding the change in the form of government, the treaties continued in full force. To make it a queſtion then, whether the treaties were to be conſidered as ſtill in operation, was implying a deſire to ſet them aſide, which would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have been attempted, if all things had conſpired to render ſuch a breach of faith ſafe.</p>

               <p>EITHER the Executive muſt have been ſupremely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Laws of Nations, or his moral ſenſe muſt have ſympathized with that of the Secretary of the Treaſury.

I will now refer to the authorities of which the Secretary ſeems ſo fond, when they can be cited, or perverted to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his purpoſes. Vattel and Burlamaqui, to whoſe works I ſhall have recourſe, will ſubſtantiate the <hi>reality</hi> of our Treaties with France, and will furniſh deciſive evidence againſt the queriſt.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>By another general diviſion of Treaties, or Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, ſays Vattel, they are diſtinguiſhed into <hi>perſonal</hi> and <hi>real:</hi> the firſt are thoſe that relate to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the contracting parties, and are reſtrained and in a manner attached to them. Real alliances relate only to the things of which they treat, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dependence on the perſon of the contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The real alliance is affixed to the body of the ſtate, and ſubſiſts as long as the ſtate; if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of its duration is not limited.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every public Treaty concluded by a King, or by any other Monarch, is a Treaty of the State;</hi> it lays un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an obligation the entire State, the nation which the King repreſents, and whoſe power and right he exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Treaties that are perpetual, and thoſe made for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate time are</hi> Real; ſince their duration does not depend on the lives of the contracting parties.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner, when a King declares in the Treaty that it is made for himſelf and <hi>his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,</hi> it is manifeſt that the Treaty is <hi>real.</hi> It is affixed to the ſtate, and made in order to laſt as long as the kingdom itſelf.</p>

Speaking of <hi>perſonal</hi> alliances he aſks. <q>But whe ſhall judge if the King be dethroned lawfully, or by violence? An independent nation acknowledges no judge. If the body of the nation declares the King deprived of his rights by the abuſe he has made of them, and depoſes him, it may juſtly do it when its grievances are well founded, and no other power has a right to cenſure it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>real</hi> alliances he offers the following ſentiments. <q>The ſame queſtion preſents itſelf in <hi>real</hi> alliances and in general, in all alliances made with the State, and not in particular with a king for the defence of his perſon. An ally ought doubtleſs to be defended againſt every invaſion, againſt every foreign violence, and even againſt his rebellious ſubjects, in the ſame manner a republic ought to be defended againſt the enterprizes of one who attempts to deſtroy the public liberty. <hi>But it ought to remembered, that an ally of the ſtate or nation, is not its judge. If the nation has depoſed its king in form,</hi> if the people of a republic have driven out their magiſtrates, or ſet themſelves at liberty, or acknowledged the authority of an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, either expreſsly or tacitly; <hi>to oppoſe theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic regulations, by diſputing their juſtice or validity, would be to interfere in the government of the nation. and to do it an injury. The ally remains the ally of the ſtate notwithſtanding the change that has happened in it.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Public Treaties, ſays Burlamaqui, are alſo divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>real</hi> and <hi>perſonal.</hi>—The latter are thoſe made with a prince, purely in regard to his perſon and expire with him. The former are ſuch, as are made which the whole body of the ſtate, not with the king or government, and which conſequently cutlive thoſe who made them and oblige their ſucceſſors.</p>
                  <p>To know which of theſe two claſſes every treaty belongs to, the following rules may be laid down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:032172_0029_0FF16892B0C04920"/>
We muſt firſt attend to the form and phraſe of the treaty; to its clauſes, and the views propoſed by the contracting parties. Utram autem in rem, an in perſonam factum eſt, non minus ex verbis, quam ex mente convenientium eſti mandum eſt. Thus, if there be an expreſs clauſe, mentioning that the treaty is <hi>perpetual,</hi> or for a certain number of years, or for the good of the ſtate, or with the king for him and <hi>his ſucceſſors,</hi> we may conclude the treaty is real.</p>
                  <p>Though the government ſhould happen to be changed from a republic into a monarchy, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſtill in force becauſe the body is ſtill the ſame, and has only another chief.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that as after the change of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy into a monarchy, the treaty is ſtill in force, in regard to the new ſovereign; ſo <hi>if the government, from a monarchy, becomes a republic, the treaty made with the King does not expire, unleſs it was manifeſtly perſonal.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Let us now enquire whether the treaties between France and the United States are <hi>real</hi> or <hi>perſonal,</hi> and whether we had a right to make a queſtion to <hi>"re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce"</hi> or hold them <hi>"ſuſpended" until the reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the monarchy.</hi> In the 11th article of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Alliance we find the following words: "The two parties guarantee mutually from the preſent time and <hi>for over</hi> againſt all other powers" &amp;c. And in the firſt article of the Treaty of Amity, and Commerce, we have the following words : "There ſhall be a firm, inviolable and univerſal peace, and a true and ſincere friendſhip between the moſt Chriſtian King, <hi>his heirs and ſucceſſors,</hi> and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States of America. And the terms herein after mentioned ſhall be <hi>perpetual</hi> between the moſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032172_0030_0FF1689451A31748"/>King, <hi>his heirs and ſucceſſors,</hi> and the ſaid United States."</p>
               <p>The Treaties then between France and the United States being <hi>public</hi> Treaties, having been made for the good of the two nations, and having been made with the king, for himſelf and <hi>ſucceſſors for ever,</hi> and the terms in them being declared <hi>perpetual,</hi> it follows evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that the treaties are <hi>real,</hi> and therefore in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete operation, notwithſtanding the change in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from a monarchy to a republic, and that a queſtion to <hi>renounce</hi> them or hold them <hi>ſuſpended</hi> muſt have been dictated by ignorance or depravity.</p>
               <p>My concluſions on this ſubject are already drawn; but the people of the United States will decide, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>perfidy</hi> originated a ſet of queries, which go to the deſtruction of our national faith, and to diſſolve the ties between the United States and their beſt friend; a friend without whoſe aid the Preſident's fame and power might have terminated in the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious fate of a rebel. Was it honour—was it gratitude —was it a love of liberty—was it a ſympathy for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happineſs which gave birth to the queries? Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that too from an author, which the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary himſelf, in his character of "Pacificus," calls "one of the beſt writers on the laws of nations," has ſtamped an unqueſtionable <hi>reality</hi> upon our treaties with France; how then the Preſident could conjure up the difficulties contained in the queries, remains with him to explain. That no ignoble motive may have operated upon him is devoutly to be wiſhed; but the act ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo foul, that charity itſelf is ſtruck dumb. When we review the conduct of the Executive from that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to the preſent: the partialities for Great Britain, and the frigidity to France—the refuſal to treat with the latter, and the extreme anxiety to be in union with the former—the arreſtation of the proceedings of the National Legiſlature to act with energy againſt
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032172_0031_0FF16895F1744358"/>Great Britain, when ſhe was robbing us and aiding in the butchery of our citizens, and the deliberate plan to ruin the miniſter of he French Republic—the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Amity with Great Britain under every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of aggravated injury and barbarity, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Jay's inſtructions declared, that there were <hi>"ſatisfactory proofs that Britiſh agents were guilty of ſtirring up and aſſiſting the Indian tribes againſt us:"</hi> When we review theſe things, it will be difficult to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the motives which led to them can have any claim to indulgence.</p>

                  <q>DOES the war in which France is engaged appear to be offenſive or defenſive on her part? Or of a mixed and <hi>equivocal</hi> character?</q> Theſe are among the queſtions which are to ſhed a luſture around the Executive! Did an <hi>equivocal</hi> war ever enter the head of any man, who was not of equivocal virtue? War may be equivocal as to its iſſue; but that it ſhould be equivocal as to its character could only be imagined by the moſt refined ſophiſt—I might, with at leaſt equal propriety, aſk, whether the Preſident's council chamber was of a <hi>mixed</hi> and <hi>equivocal</hi> character? For ſo jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal is the complexion of the queries, that they look as if they had iſſued from an apartment of <hi>St. Omers</hi>— Anatomiſts tell us of Hermaphrodites: but never yet was an <hi>Hermaphrodite war</hi> conceived, unleſs in the council chamber of the Preſident of the United States—<hi>Machiavel</hi> may contain the ingredients of ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and ſo may "Pacificus;" but excepting among thoſe two kindred ſpirits and their diſciples, a war without a gender would be deemed as much a phoenomenon, as "Pacificus" without vice. Queſtions
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032172_0032_0FF16897964B2358"/>of this ſort mean more than they expreſs; they are like a vane which ſhews the direction of the wind, and I do not heſitate to affirm from their caſt, that our Treaties with France would have been pat in durance, had not the voice of the people ſilenced the whiſpers of the <hi>Executive conclave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Pacificus" calls Vattel "the beſt writer on the laws of nations," and no doubt the manufacturer of the queries muſt have known, that Vattel ſays, <hi>"war is either offenſive or defenſive;"</hi> in his whole work he has not a ſyllable about <hi>equivocal</hi> war. Can the author of the queries be of the <hi>epicene</hi> gender himſelf, that he has made war an anomaly? As "the beſt writer on the laws of nations," knows no ſuch thing as an <hi>equivocal</hi> war, and as a diſtinction which he does not recognize is reſorted to by the Executive, it muſt be evident, that this ſubſtitution of his own opinion for the law of nations muſt have been advanced to render abortive the Treaties between France and the United States. The <hi>bull</hi> of neutrality verifies this concluſion; for it was predicated on the idea, that the treaties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Executive fiat.</p>
               <p>And here the aſſumption of the Executive to <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret</hi> treaties <hi>at his pleaſure,</hi> might call our attention—The proclamation of neutrality pre-determined our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations with France, previouſly to the arrival of the miniſter of the Republic in this city; and although we had a Treaty of Alliance with France, and her miniſter ought to have been a party to the interpretation, yet in defiance of the poſitive law of nations on this ſubject, did the Executive undertake to impoſe his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. I have on another occaſion cited Vattel; but I will again bring his opinion into view, that no doubt may remain of the truth of my aſſertion—"The third general maxim, or principle, on the ſubject of interpretation is: <hi>that neither the one nor the other of the intereſted, or contracting powers has a right to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032172_0033_0FF1689B86B61808"/>the act or treats at his pleaſure;</hi> for if you are at liberty to give my promiſe whatever ſenſe you pleaſe, you will have the power of obliging me to do whatever you have a mind, contrary to my intention, and beyond my real engagement: and reciprocally, if I am allowed to explain my promiſes as I pleaſe, I may render them vain and illuſive, by giving them a ſenſe quite different from that in which they were preſented to you, and in which you muſt have taken them in accepting them."</p>
               <p>That the proclamation of neutrality was itnended as an interpretation of the Treaties, is not only obvious from the inſtrument itſelf; but it is confirmed by the opinions of Secretary Pacificus—"It has however been admitted, ſays this cormorant of monarchy, that the declaration of neutrality <hi>excludes the idea of the clauſe of guarantee."</hi>—If the laws of nations are the rules by which governments meaſure the juſtice or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of things, what would be the verdict of the world ſhould the Executive be tried by the text already quoted? He interpreted a ſolemn covenant between two nations, <hi>"at his pleaſure,"</hi> and in contradiction of a ſtipulation, that, to ſay no more, admitted of doubt, did he declare the United States to be in a ſtate of neutrality, to the excluſion of the clauſe of guarantee!! By aſſuming to himſelf the authority to interpret the treaties between France and the United States, <hi>at bis pleaſure,</hi> the Preſident has viclated thoſe treaties, and has done France an injury. "As the engagements of a treaty, ſays Vattel, impoſe on the one hand a perfect obligation, they produce on the other a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect right. <hi>To violate</hi> a treaty, is then to violate the perfect right of him with whom we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and this is to do him <hi>an injury.</hi>" How our neutrality has been obſerved, has been already glanced at; but how France will view it, begins now to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt itſelf.—If her forbearance could continue longer, ſhe muſt be more than mortal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:032172_0034_0FF1689F9110D9C8"/>
Admitting the doctrines of the Secretary, as held forth in the letters of "Pacificus," and taking for granted, what remains to be proved, that our alliance is purely defenſive, I deny the invalidity of the clauſe of guarnatee. In my next letter I will prove, that Great Britain made the firſt declaration of war againſt France, that ſo far from having acted with <hi>imprudence,</hi> or <hi>intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi> that France courted the friendſhip of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and was treated with the utmoſt inſolence, and that the clauſe of guarantee remains in full force, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the affertion of Pacificus in behalf of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, that "the declaration of neutrality excludes the idea of the clauſe of gaurantee."</p>
               <p>If the law of nations, as has been ſhewn, proncunces ſentence of condemnation upon the Executive, how will the caſe appear <hi>in foro conſcientie?</hi> How will the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent acquit himſelf to his own feelings, (for I take it for granted he has feelings left) in endeavouring to alienate our country from her beſt friend? Will his ſenſations be unmixed with remorſe, when he caſts a retroſpective eye on the events of the late Revolution? Can be have forgotten that France was our ſheet-anchor, that her aſſiſtance brought the Revolution to a ſpeedy and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous iſſue, to ſay no more, and that the "unequalled proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity" of which he boaſts, is in a degree owing to her? Can the unequalled barbarities of Great Britain, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon the defenders of our Revolution, be already effaced from his memory? Has he forgotten the <hi>priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and jails,</hi> thoſe receptacles of miſery and death, where the wretched priſoner was doomed to expne by inches? Can the groans of the miſerable captives, who died in lingering torture with <hi>graſs in their mouths,</hi> in the jail of this city, be obliterated from his remembrance ſince he has become Preſident of the United States? Can the more than ſavage barbarity exerelſed on the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia at the billet near this city, where the <hi>wounded priſoner</hi> was placed upon the ſame pile with the dead, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032172_0035_0FF168A14BD868E0"/>to aſhes, be already forgotten? If ſo, we might exclaim with the poet, "Ye gods! <hi>what havoc does am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition make among your creatures!"</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The name of a Frenchman ought to be dear to every American who ſympathiſed in his country's cauſe, and infamy ought to attend the man who would endeavour to obliterate the affectionate impreſſion. The benefits we have derived from France, the forbearance which the has exerciſed, and the cauſe in which ſhe is embarked, ought to rivet us to her, unleſs we view our Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as a misfortune, and our Liberty as a curſe.</p>

               <p>THE guarantee in the Treaty of Alliance between France and the United States remains in full force, and is obligatory upon us, the proclamation of neutrality, the declaration of Secretary Pacificus, and the treaty with Great Britain to the contrary notwithſtanding. Great Britain was not only the <hi>firſt aggreſſor,</hi> but ſhe made <hi>a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual declaration of war</hi> againſt France, before the formal declaration took place on the part of the Franch Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. It is <hi>the act</hi> itſelf which we are to conſider; for as the practice of the Britiſh nation is to make war firſt, and to declare it afterwards, we are to revert to the act itſelf to prove that the declaration of war was firſt made by Great Britain. In the treaty of navigation and commerce between Great Britain and France, ſigned at Verſailles on the 26th day of September, 1786, is contained a clauſe which ſtipulates, that war ſhall not be deemed to exiſt until the recalling of ſending home of the reſpective ambaſſadors and miniſters. This clauſe is contained in the ſecond article of that Treaty, a part of which I will recite to prevent all doubts on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:032172_0036_0FF168A2F5554E18"/>
                  <q>Article II. For the further ſecurity of commerce and friendſhip between the ſubjects of their ſaid maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties and to the end that this good corrſpondence may be preſerved from all interruption and diſturbance, it is concluded and agreed, that if at any time there ſhould ariſe any miſunderſtanding, breach of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>or rupture</hi> between the crowns of their majeſties, which God forbid! <hi>(which rupture ſball not be deemed to exiſt until the recalling or ſending home of the reſpective ambaſſadors and miniſters)</hi> the ſubjects of each of the two parties, reſiding in the dominion of the other, ſhall have the privilege of remaining and continuing their trade therein, without any manner of diſturbance, ſo long as they behave peaceably, and commit no offence againſt the laws and ordinances,</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It appears then, from this article, that a rupture was to be deemed to exiſt, or that an actual declaration of war was to be inferred from the recalling or ſending home the reſpective ambaſſadors and miniſters. Facts will now decide the queſtion, that Great Britain declared war firſt againſt France, and therefore that France is acting on the <hi>defenſive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Immediately after the depoſition of the King, Lord Gower, the Engliſh miniſter at Paris, was recalled by the Britiſh court. For a conſiderable time after the recall of Lord Gower, Mr. Chauvelin, the French miniſter at the court of London, was continued there by the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Council. On the 17th of December 1792, Mr. Chauvelin preſented a memorial to Lord Grenville, in which he informed him <hi>"that the Executive Council of the French Republic thinking it a duty which they owe to the French nation, not to leave it in the ſtate of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence into which it has been thrown by the late meaſures of the Britiſh government, have authorized him to demand with openneſs, whether France ought to conſider England as a neutral or hoſtile power; at the ſame time being ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032172_0037_0FF168A5CC139D20"/>that not the ſmalleſt doubt ſhould exiſt reſpecting the diſpoſition of France towards England, and of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to remain in peace."</hi> To a memorial, fraught with ſuch friendly and pacific ſentiments, Lord Grenville returned the moſt arrogant and inſulting anſwer. "He acknowledged the receipt of a <hi>note</hi> from Mr. Chauve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, <hi>ſtyling himſelf</hi> miniſter plenipotentiary of France, and informed him, that ſince the unhappy events of the 10th Auguſt, the king had ſuſpended all <hi>official</hi> communication with France, and that <hi>he could not be treated with in the quality and under form ſtated in his note."</hi> Notwithſtanding the inſulting and irritat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conduct diſplayed by the Britiſh miniſtry, <hi>Le Brun</hi> the miniſter of foreign affairs in France, tranſmitted a memorial in anſwer to Lord Grenville's letter, replete with pacific ſentiments. He repeated "the aſſurances of their ſincere deſire to maintain peace and harmony between France and England, and declared it was with great reluctance that the Republic would ſee itſelf forced to a rupture <hi>much more contrary to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> than its intereſt." Lord Grenville's reply to this memorial was, if poſſible, more inſolent and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating than the firſt. He informed Mr. Chauvelin by note, that his majeſty would not receive his new letters of credence from the French Republic. On the 24th of January 1793, the Britiſh court diſmiſſed the French miniſter by a letter from Lord Grenville in the following terms: "I am charged to notify to you, Sir, that the character with which you have been inveſted at this court, and the functions of which have been ſo long ſuſpended, being now entirely terminated by the fatal death of his Moſt Chriſtian majeſty, you have no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any public character here; and his majeſty has thought fit to order that you ſhould retire from this kingdom within the term of eight days." The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive Council diſcovered the extremeſt ſolicitude to preſerve peace with Great Britain: for although the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent brutality of Lord Grenville was extreme, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive Council further condeſcended to ſend Mr. Maret
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032172_0038_0FF168AAF94C3298"/>as a confidential agent, to endeavour to endeavour to conciliate the Britiſh court. As Mr. Chauvelin was diſmiſſed before his arrival he did not feel himſelf authoriſed to make known his powers; but he announced his arrival to Lord Grenville, who took no notice of him. Thus was the rupture complete by treaty. The declaration of war then being made by Great Britain, <hi>by recalling her ambaſſador and ſending home the miniſter of France,</hi> the Executive Council reſolved unanimouſly on the 1ſt of February, that the Republic of France was at war with the king of Great Britain.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing facts who will dare to ſay, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting our adminiſtration and their minions, that Great Britain did not firſt declare war againſt France, and that ſhe did not treat France with the utmoſt inſolence, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and brutality? Did France diſcover the <hi>"indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and intemperance"</hi> which Secretary Paciſicus dwells upon with ſo much rapture? Did ſhe exhibit thoſe <hi>"angry and vindictive paſſions,"</hi> that called forth all his pathos in favour of Louis and his ſon? Her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance was exemplary, and the ultima ratio was in her own defence. Theſe <hi>"partizans of war and confuſion,"</hi> to ſpeak in Preſidential language, diſplayed a temper and moderation honourable to their cauſe and human nature.</p>
               <p>Taking Paciſicus' aſſertion now for granted, that our alliance with France is <hi>defenſive,</hi> I pronounce that the clauſe of guarantee is obligatory, Great Britain having declared war firſt according to treaty, and that we are bound to fulfil it, whenever France ſhall think proper to make the demand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Public Faith</hi> has been echoed and re-echoed by our adminiſtration and its minions, while the Britiſh Treaty hung in ſuſpence in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, till the reiterated cries almoſt produced a belief that <hi>they</hi> imagined it a <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> The review of their conduct to France however, has demonſtrated, that with them it
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032172_0039_0FF168AC9C7533B8"/>is only <hi>a ſhadow</hi>—a fit article of traffic which may be hawked about as beſt ſuits intereſt or ambition. There is not a feature in our public tranſactions with France, which has not a perfidious caſt, and were we dipoſed to cite examples of the deepeſt hypocriſy, and moſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous policy, we need not travel without the purvieu of our Executive adminiſtration.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>DOES any article in either of the Treaties prevent ſhips of war other than privateers, of the powers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to France, from coming into the ports of the United States to act as convoys to their own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantmen? Or does it lay any other reſtraint upon them more than would apply to the ſhips of war of France?</q> Theſe queſtions have been fully anſwered in favour of Great Britain by the conduct of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Was additional evidence neceſſary to ſubſtantiate the exiſtence of a plan hoſtile to the French Republic, the free ingreſs and egreſs of Britiſh ſhips of war into and from our ports would complete the maſs of teſtimony. Whenever the ſubtlety of conſtruction, or perhaps more properly miſconſtruction, could be uſed to injure France and benefit Great Britain, it has been the almoſt invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reſort of the Executive. A moſt extraordinary and palpable latitude has been given to the ſhips of war of Great Britain in flagrant violation of expreſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal ſtipulations. By the 17th article of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between France and the United States, it is expreſsly declared, that "no ſhelter or refuge ſhall be given in their ports to ſuch (ſpeaking of ſhips of war) as ſhall have made prize of the ſubjects, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or property of the parties; but if ſuch ſhall come in, forced by ſtreſs of weather or danger of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032172_0040_0FF168AEEAC07540"/>the ſea, all proper means ſhall be vigorouſly uſed, that they go out and retire from thence as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible." Pacificus himſelf with all his talents at riddle and perverſion, would be puzzled to make even a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible defence for the Executive if tried by this article. Several of the ſhips of war of Great Britain have been conſtantly cruiſing on our coaſt to intercept French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; they have captured French property to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable amount, and yet theſe ſame ſhips of war have been permitted to enter our ports <hi>ad libitum</hi> unforced by ſtreſs of weather, or danger of the ſea! The patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age which has been thus given them by the Executive, has enabled them to keep their ſtations on our coaſt and more effectually to harraſs the commerce of the French Republic. The Thetis, Thiſbe, Huſſar, Cleopatra and Prevoyante frigates have been perfectly at home in our ports, and have been as much at their eaſe as if we had no ſtipulations to the contrary, and had been colonized anew. His Britannic majeſty's dockyard at Norfolk, would make the preſumption ſtrong, that our Executive, if not the United States, was in <hi>alliance</hi> with the "mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous" George. Thus has the Executive given <q>
                     <hi>ſhelter and refuge in our ports to ſuch as have made prize of the people and property</hi>
                  </q> of the French Republic, in open violation of our public faith!</p>
               <p>If the people of the United States are inſenſible to ſuch outrages upon our public faith, becauſe they are committed by him, who is ſtyled the "Saviour of his Country," can they expect that France will be the dupe of ſuch flagrant injuſtice? Will <hi>a name</hi> ſanctify hypocriſy and perfidy there? A ſolitary breach of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional faith may have claimed her indulgence, but when theſe breaches are multiplied to an aggravated exceſs, we cannot expect further forbearance. Injury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult have their limits, and friendſhip itſelf will reſiſt when the ultimate point is exceeded; and that our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive has paſſed the ne plus ultra cannot any longer admit of doubt. Our public faith, like Falſtaff's honor,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032172_0041_0FF1683AD995F510"/>has been an affair of calculation, and like the <hi>fides punica</hi> will ſoon become proverbial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Should the future Regent of France ſend a miniſter to "the United States, ought he to be received?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can a queſtion of this ſort, coming from the Chief Magiſtrate of the United States, be read without the ſtrongeſt emotions of horror and indignation? Muſt we not lament the profound hypocriſy or the fall of the man who could conceive ſuch a propoſition? Had the politics of Pitt found entrance into our councils, that a propoſition to receive a miniſter from the Regent ſhould have been agitated in both countries nearly at the ſame time? A miniſter from the Regent of France! Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God! that ſuch an idea ſhould ever have found its way into an American boſom! While the dread of Britiſh ſhackles had not yet left the memory—while the hilarity of emancipation ſtill vibrated in our hearts— while the impreſſion of the benefaction of France was yet warm in our boſoms—while the horror of tyranny appeared to us in its moſt vivid colours, was the dark project conceived of receiving the infernal agent of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm!! Was it WASHINGTON who entertained the thought! He who headed the armies of America to repulſe tyranny! He whoſe command extended over thoſe brave Gallic legions, who traverſed the Atlantic to give us freedom! Is this the Apoſtle of Liberty— the Saviour of his Country—the Benefactor of Mankind! Where was the pretended ſympathy for a great and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant nation, ſtruggling for the ſame rights which they had contributed to eſtabliſh! Had power obtunded every philanthropic ſentiment, every ſenſation in favour of liberty, that Frenchmen embarked in ſupport of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's beſt gift to man, could not awaken a ſolicitude for their cauſe, and a ſenſibility for their ſufferings! A miniſter from the Regent of France!!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:032172_0042_0FF1687152D16DB8"/>
Without forcing an interpretation this queſtion plainly reads thus: Shall the United States become a member of the confederacy againſt the French Republic? To have received a miniſter from the Regent would have been a ſignal of hoſtility—it would have unfurled the cruſading banner, and our Executive muſt have taken up the croſs againſt liberty in concert with tyrants. No na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion admitted a repreſentative from the Regent but thoſe in open hoſtility againſt to Republic, and I believe no nation made a queſtion about it, but thoſe who were or wiſhed to be of the coalition. When we conſider the <hi>extreme intimacy</hi> which ſubſiſted between Secretary Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficus, and Talon, the agent of the Regent, this queſtion receives the ſtamp of greater ſolemnity, and removes all doubt of the favourable diſpoſition of the Executive to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the government of baſtiles and lettres de cachet.</p>
               <p>I have in a former letter demonſtrated that our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with France are <hi>real,</hi> and that notwithſtanding the change in the government from a monarchy to a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, the Treaties between the United States and her are completely obligatory. It cannot now be neceſſary to diſcuſs the legal impropriety of receiving a miniſter from a wandering Regent, it being a ramification of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject already conſidered; for if the Treaties were not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, we had a diſcretionary power to receive or refuſe a miniſter from the Regent; but if they were, no ſuch diſcretion could exiſt; the queſtion, therefore, partakes all circumſtances conſidered, of a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of turpitude than any that has preſented itſelf.</p>

               <p>Although the ſituation of the United States was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly delicate, and much conſideration was neceſſary to the adoption of proper meaſures; and although Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs alone has the right to decide upon meaſures in which are implicated <hi>war,</hi> yet, whatever qualms may have exiſted anterior to the meeting, did the Executive determine, or his council for him, that his fiat ſhould be ſupreme, and that his own omniſcience was commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to every object. Theſe opinions, and the conduct conſequent upon them, were the ſource of all our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and of all our diſtractions.

They were the ſtepping-ſtone to future meaſures which were to throw our country into the arms of Great Britain, which were to draw the cords of connection between the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and his "great, good and dear friend" into a gordian knot and to alienate the freemen of America from <hi>their</hi> beſt friend, the Republic of France. The aſſumption of power in the Executive to act independently of Congreſs in things in which their deciſion were conſtitutionally eſſential, was the key-ſtone in the arch, and bound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſyſtem manifeſted in the queries. Had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs been convened, different meaſures might have been adopted. That diſgraceful act of uſurpation, the Edict of Neutrality, might have been prevented, and the neutrality of the United States might have been dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and honourable, inſtead of abject and fraudulent. I might ſay, and with truth, "that during the ſix years" glorious adminiſtration, we have had a government of individual will indeed of that of the people; for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive had but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032172_0045_0FF168B4846021E8"/>Virtually, Congreſs have been a committee of ways and means—a parliament, ſomewhat after the ancient rigime of Frances to regiſter edicts. Even information as to the affairs of the union, of which as <hi>individuals</hi> they are a part, and as <hi>Republicans</hi> they have a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, was denied them. This conduct plainly evinced that the Executive imagined Congreſs had no right to deliberate but to act, and that according to the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>he</hi> ſhould think proper to give, and the promptitude <hi>he</hi> ſhould conceive fit to direct. In this inſtance his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment was analogous to that of Louis 16th to the notables. They refuſed their concurrence to the new ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorial impoſt, unleſs the accounts and eſtimates of the government were ſubmitted to their inſpection. The king refuſed this a-la-mode de Preſident, and ſaid, that he was determined to introduce the <hi>impot territorial,</hi> and and that it therefore became them to debate, <hi>not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the meaſure,</hi> but the moſt equitable form it could aſſume. Congreſs were to debate not the propriety of carrying the Treaty into effect, but the moſt equitable way of making proviſion for it, the readieſt way of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effect to the Executive <hi>will!</hi> Ignorance was as well adapted to this end as information, and as the Roman pontiff prohibits the ſheep of his flock from a knowledge of the bible to keep up his infallibility, in like manner was the infallibility of the Executive to be ſuſtained, by myſtery and concealment.</p>
               <p>Royal as well as papal importance has diſplayed itſelf in our Executive tranſactions. Proclamations have iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the "United States" as from a hot bed. We have had a Proclamation of Neutrality, a Proclamation for a day of thankſgiving (as if we had a <hi>Vatican</hi> and a <hi>Tiara</hi>) and a proclamation declaring a ſupreme law of the United States before it had paſſed through all the neceſſary forms! Thus is the thing taking effect in ſubſtance which was contemplated in form, and that kind of government meditated by Secretary "Pacificus" in and out of the convention, beginning to be realized.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032172_0046_0FF168B89FA43458"/>We are now to have the <hi>"ſauce to the ſame pig"</hi> which the chaſte Secretary endeavoured to obtain in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; for circumſtances will warrant the concluſion, that the aim is, to aſſimilate our government to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Every meaſure ſeems to ſquint towards this darling object, and hence <hi>irredeemable debts, exciſe ſyſtems, national banks, loans, federal cities, reports for raiſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue by an officer unknown to the Conſtitution, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant upon the Executive—hence the plan to excite the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Inſurrection to increaſe the national debt, to furniſh a pretext for a ſtanding army, and to ſupply arguments againſt the cauſe of republicaniſm—hence the pious wiſh of the more pious Secretary, in the preſence of "the Benefactor of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind!" that the inſurgents would burn Pittſburgh!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the queſtion to convene Congreſs was propoſed, Congreſs had been ſomewhat purged of its droſs. Fewer <hi>bank directors</hi> and <hi>ſtockjobbers</hi> held ſeats in that body, and as their intentions with reſpect to <hi>high toned government</hi> were rather problematical, hence the determination not to convene them, but to ſubſtitute the will of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for the will of the Repreſentatives of the People.</p>

               <p>THE Conſtitution has ſolemnly recognized but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Executive. It has ordered, that Executive reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility ſhould be an unit.

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032172_0047_0FF168BA5903A020"/>of the powers of the Preſident, the Conſtitution ſays, "he may require the opinion, <hi>in writing,</hi> of the principle officers in each of the Executive Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon any ſubject <hi>relating to the duties of their reſpective offices.</hi>" In the laws organizing the Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Governments we find certain duties alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them: but we cannot diſcover any thing like an authority to make the Heads of the Departments an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive Council. But although neither the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not the laws of the United States acknowledge an <hi>Executive Council,</hi> the Preſident has thought proper to metamorphoſe the Secretaries of State, of the Treaſury and of War, and the Attorney General of the United States into ſuch a body. He has eſtabliſhed a rule to commit things <hi>not relating to the duties of their reſpective offices</hi> to their advice and deciſion. <hi>Numbers</hi> in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil decide the great intereſts of the nation. This <hi>"ſelf-created"</hi> Council manufacture memorials to foreign nations, ſpeeches to Congreſs, and anſwers to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They deliberate and decide upon what meaſures are proper for the Executive to purſue, and thus in many inſtances ſubſtitute their own advice to that of the Senate, which is conſtitutionally authoriſed to give advice. Mr. Randolph tells us in his Vindication, that a memorial relative to the Treaty was to be preſented to the Britiſh miniſter, and that this memorial was to be ſubmitted to the ſelf-created Council The Preſident in his letter of the 29th July, tells Mr. Randolph, that "the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, the ratification, and the inſtructions, <hi>which are framing,</hi> are of ſuch vaſt magnitude, as not only to require great individual conſideration, but a ſolemn the ratification, and the inſtructions, <hi>which are framing,</hi> are of ſuch vaſt magnitude, as not only to require great individual conſideration, but a ſolemn <hi>conjunct reviſion.</hi>" In his letter of the 18th of July, written at Baltimore, he deſires "that the addreſs of the people of Boſton ſhould be taken into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>the Secretaries and Attorney General.</hi>" Mr. Randolph mentions, that "they were collected imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the receipt of the letter; and <hi>did not at once agree, whether an anſwer ſhould or ſhould not be returned.</hi>" In reference to the memorial, Mr. Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph

Pickering and Bradford, that the ſooner the memorial was reviſed by the gentleman <hi>jointly,</hi> who were prepared with their opinions, the better; and he replied, that <hi>be ſuppoſed every thing of this ſort had been ſettled.</hi>"</p>
               <p>From theſe facts it would appear, that the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſigned the Executive Department as a <hi>Puppet Shew,</hi> where the firſt Magiſtrate was to play <hi>Punch,</hi> and the Heads of the Department the <hi>Jugglers!!!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a circumſtance not more alarming than extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, that a Council to which no reſponſibility is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached, ſhould be created by the Preſident, where the moſt momentous tranſactions of the Executive Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are determined on by a plurality of voices. In queſtions relating to Treaties, this Council decides whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Treaty ſhall be made—thus the advice of <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> conſtitutionally requiſite, is ſuperceded by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a Council unknown to our lows or to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution! We find by the letter which covered the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that even a queſtion which had relation to <hi>war,</hi> was to be decided by this <hi>ſelf-created</hi> Council. Inſtead of petitions or memorials to the Preſident, the people ought in future to make their application to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; for more ſucceſs has often reſulted from an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Monarchs <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> than from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Monarch himſelf.</p>
               <p>The king of Great Britain has a Council where Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive meaſures are determined a little a-la-mode de Preſident; but this Council is <hi>reſponſible,</hi> and by the Conſtitution <hi>the king can do no wrong.</hi> Is it the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Executive to ſhift the reſponſibility attached to his office from himſelf to his Council, and thereby to introduce the royal principle, that <hi>he</hi> can do no wrong? A Conſtitution in the eſtimation of a quondam Secretary
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032172_0049_0FF168BFE4B3DFC0"/>being nothing more than <hi>"paper and parchment,"</hi> it may be deemed very caſy to impreſs upon this paper and parchment any character he and <hi>his machine</hi> may think proper. Perhaps the attempt may ſoon be leſs covert, and then the people will be convinced that a man may affect a prodigality of patrictiſm to become the tyrant, inſtead of the Saviour of his Country.</p>
               <p>When in connection with this moſt extraordinary mode of tranſacting the affairs of the Executive Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſurvey the characters who give laws to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our feelings are not much relieved; for as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident himſelf has pronounced them to be but the <hi>"ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in form to the deliberative talents of their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi>" patriotiſm cannot ſuppreſs its anxiety, when our deareſt intereſts are committed to ſuch hands. An auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Prothonotary may make a more clumſy Secretary of State, and a ſtill more aukward Privy Counſellor. He may have a <hi>verſatility</hi> of viſion, by means of which he can ſee beauty or deformity in political objects according to the ſtation he occupies. He may <hi>"throw the veſſel of State up into the wind"</hi> through his ignorance of political tactics; but the attributes of a man calculated to govern freemen are neither <hi>folly, hypocriſy</hi> nor <hi>phrenzy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The man whoſe utmoſt range of capacity went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to ſtate an account, or to tell you that two and two made four, and that twice five made ten, might paſs in a ſubordinate ſtation in the Treaſury: but would it not be viewed as madneſs or wickedneſs to place ſuch a man in a ſituation where his voice might determine the ſate of millions? He might be well qualified to head a hand of Connecticut intruders, <hi>"or friends to order,"</hi> and to tie a ſorry Prothonotary, or a brawny Sachem by the leg in the woods who would attempt to oppoſe him; but would ſuch qualifications entitle him to the rank of a Privy Counſellor?

The people of the United States made a Conſtitution for their government, in which certain duties are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the different departments created by it, and certain boundaries eſtabliſhed. This Conſtitution they expected would be adminiſtered with fidelity, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its true intent and meaning.

               <p>HAVING taken a curſory view of the queries, I come now to the conſideration of the explanatory arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to the Britiſh Treaty. Viewed in all its relations this article is as complete a libel upon the American character as the utmoſt ingenuity of the adminiſtration could deviſe. It is a climax of weakneſs and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Whether we conſider it in reference to ourſelves, or to thoſe nations with whom we have made treaties— whether we regard in it the aſſumption of power in the Executive to act independently of the <hi>advice</hi> of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and making it a mere <hi>regiſtering</hi> body, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we view it as an emanation from that <hi>ſelf created</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:032172_0051_0FF168C6BAFBC6F8"/>Council, which has been ſubſtituded by an Executive fiat to the legal Council of the nation—whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Executive and this Council as arrogating to themſelves the ſtile and authority of <hi>Amphyctions,</hi> and interpreting laws for nations, ſovereign and independent as we are—whether we conſider the deception practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Spain and the Indian tribes by the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſtipulations into our treaties with them which we could not fulfil, or the proſtration of honour and national character in entering into ſubſequent ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are at war with former ones—ſurveying it in all its aſpects, it appears deſigned, as the apple of Juno, for jealouſy and diſcord.</p>
               <p>I will proceed to the conſideration of that article in the Spaniſh Treaty, which relates to the navigation of the Miſſiſippi. The explanatory article of the Britiſh Treaty either diſmiſſes this article altogether, and by means of it renders abortive the whole Treaty, or it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes an obligation upon the United States to render the navigation of the Miſſiſippi free to the ſubjects of Great Britain. Had no explanation of this ſort been entered into, it is fair from the article itſelf to ſuppoſe, that the United States would not have been under the ſame obligation to Great Britain; but as they have expreſsly declared <hi>by Treaty,</hi> that no ſtipulations <hi>in any Treaty</hi> can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to interfere with the rights and free intercouſe and commerce ſecured by the third article of the treaty with Great Britain, the Britiſh Treaty then becomes a political decalogue, by which the people of the United States are bound to meaſure their actions.</p>
               <p>The fourth article of our treaty with Spain is in the following words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is likewiſe agreed, that the weſtern boundary of the United States which ſeperates them from the Spaniſh colony of Louiſiana, is in the middle of the channel or bed of the river Miſſiſippi from the northern
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032172_0052_0FF168C984DA4B58"/>boundary of the ſaid ſtates to the completion of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-firſt degree of latitude North of the Equator. And his Catholic Majeſty has likewiſe agreed that the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſaid river in its whole breadth from its ſource to the ocean ſhall be free only <hi>to his ſubjects, and the citizens of the United States,</hi> unleſs he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this privilege to the ſubjects of other powers by ſpecial convention.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now compare this article with that part of the third article of the Britiſh Treaty which relates to the navigation of the Miſſiſippi.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The river Miſſiſippi ſhall, however, <hi>according to the treaty of peace,</hi> be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on the Eaſtern ſide, to whichſoever of the parties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may freely be reſorted to, and uſed by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States or his Majeſty in Great Britain.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The eighth article of the treaty of peace is in the following words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>The navigation of the river Miſſiſippi, from its ſource to the ocean, ſhall forever remain free and open to the ſubjects of Great Britain, and to the citizens of the United States.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>What is the reſult of the compariſon of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and Spaniſh Treaties?—The Britiſh ſays the river Miſſiſippi <hi>ſhall</hi> forever remain free and open to <hi>the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Great Britain;</hi> the Spaniſh Treaty on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſays, it ſhall be free <hi>only to the ſubjects of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Majeſty and the citizens of the United States.</hi> From the terms of the article it will be obſerved, that it conveys the idea of a right on the part of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States to the navigation of the Miſſiſippi; for if
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032172_0053_0FF168CD97F92948"/>they had not a right themſelves they could not grant it to another, and guarantee this right to the ſubjects of Great Britain; if then, the United Sates are poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the navigation of the Miſſiſippi, they are bound to poſſeſs Great Britain of it. As long as we had not the uſe of that river ourſelves, Great Britain could not exact from us the right to navigate it; but no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do we become ſeized of it ourſelves, than the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation commences to extend it to them.</p>
               <p>The clauſe in the explanatory article to this point reads thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And do by theſe preſents explicitly agree and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that <hi>no ſtipulation in any treaty</hi> ſubſequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by either of the contracting parties with <hi>any other ſtate or nation,</hi> or with any Indian Tribe, <hi>can be underſtood to derogate in any manner from the rights of free intercourſe and commerce ſecured by the aforeſaid third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation to the ſubjects of his Majeſty,</hi> and to the citizens of the United States, and the Indians dwelling on either ſide of the Boundary Line aforeſaid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Spaniſh Treaty is poſterior to the Britiſh Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore, any clauſe in that treaty which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terferes with the treaty with Great Britain is complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done away by the explanatory article. How then is the difficulty to be ſolved? Is Secretary <hi>"Camillus"</hi> ready with ſome new logic (for I cannot believe that the ſucceſſor in form underſtands the article to this day) to convince us that the two Treaties harmoniſe? Is not the concluſion irreſiſtible, that we muſt either renounce the navigation of the Miſſiſippi ourſelves, or confirm it to Great Britain in common with ourſelves, and thereby incur a war with Spain?</p>
               <p>There is a wonderful aptitude in the Executive, by which I do not mean the ſucceſſors in form to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032172_0054_0FF1684212075B40"/>to interpret things ſo as to anſwer the purpoſes of the day. The French Treaty has experienced the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of Executive expoſition, and has been made to mean any thing or nothing according to the wiſhes of the Britiſh miniſtry. Perhaps Spain may be equally pliant with France, and ſubmit to the interpretation which the Executive may think fit to give. Indeed ſuch has been the ſucceſs at impoſition, that perhaps Spain may be perſuaded, that ſo far from the navigation of the Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi being injurious to her if extended to Great Britain, that ſhe will receive abundant benefits by even admitting the ſubjects of his Britannic majeſty to the mines of Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico and Peru; for as many of the people of the United States have been ſo far impoſed upon as to be made to believe that the Britiſh Treaty is a good and proper one, the Spaniards may, with the ſame original proſpect of ſucceſs, and certainly with equal juſtice, be perſuaded that Great Britain ought to have the right to navigate the Miſſiſippi, for that ſhe is the beſt friend, the beſt neighbour and the moſt peaceable, the moſt benevolent, and the moſt diſintereſted nation upon earth. Thirty-nine long winded numbers may work miracles upon the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh court, unleſs indeed their natural love of eaſe ſhould make them loath a farrago of falſehood and perverſion. Perhaps the effect may be as wonderful as that experienced by the Preſident, who could ſee more difficulties and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in the Britiſh Treaty every time he read it, and yet after all, feel himſelf ſo much converted (I will not ſay as St. Paul was) as to loſe ſight of common decorum and propriety in promulgating it as the ſupreme law of the land.</p>

               <p>THE more the explanatory article is viewed, the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker does it appear. It is a foul leproſy upon the body politic, which ages will hardly cleanſe. That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive ſhould have made a Treaty with the Indian Tribes poſteriorly to the Britiſh Treaty, and recognize ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations repugnant to the anterior treaty, can ſcarcly find an apology even from an idolater. Is this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic faith? Is it common honour? Is it common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty? <q>The ſeveral principles already eſtabliſhed, ſays Burlamaqui, concerning the validity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions in general, agree to public Treaties, as well as to the contracts of individuals.

And if any perſon ſhall intrude himſelf as a trader, without ſuch licenſe the ſaid Indians ſhall take and bring him before the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendant or his Deputy, to be dealt with accord-to law.

               <p>The treaty with Great Britain was concluded at London the nineteenth day of November, 1794, and was ratified by the Senate the 24th of June 1795. In this Treaty and in the 3d article of it, we find the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtipulation. "It is agreed, <hi>that it ſhall at all times be free to his Majeſtys ſubjects,</hi> and to the citizens of the United States, and alſo to the Indians dwelling on either ſide of the ſaid boundary line, <hi>freely to paſs and repaſs by land or inland navigation, into the reſpective territories and countries of the two contracting parties on the continent of America</hi> (the country within the limits of the Hudſons Bay Company only excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers, and waters thereof, and <hi>freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other.</hi>"</p>
               <p>It is no compliment to a mans penetration to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that theſe two articles are at war with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—to do away the colliſion was the object of the explanatory article. Let me now aſk, whether, in the negociation with the Indian tribes, there was "<hi>a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſent, properly declared, and exempt from error, fraud and violence?</hi> Was there no <hi>fraud</hi> in ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating with the Indian Tribes, that no perſon ſhould be permitted to reſide at any of their towns or hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing camps as a trader, who was not furniſhed with a liſence for that purpoſe," when an anterior Treaty declared that Britiſh ſubjects ſhould poſſeſs this right?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:032172_0057_0FF168D7B3451388"/>
The face of the 8th article of the Indian Treaty ſhews, that they conſidered it as an important ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the licenſes were to be granted <hi>"to the end that the Indians might not be impoſed on in their trade.</hi>" Was there no <hi>fraud</hi> in pretending to ſecure the Indians againſt impoſition in their trade by Treaty, and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the promiſed ſecurity by an explanatory article? Was there no <hi>fraud</hi> in making a Treaty, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining it away without the conſent of the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Was there no <hi>fraud</hi> in an American Secretary of State and a Britiſh Charge d'Affaires interpreting <hi>an Indian Treaty</hi> at pleaſure?</p>
               <p>I have already proved, that the Executive had no right to interpret a Treaty at <hi>his pleaſure;</hi> but that there is the ſame reciprocity of interpretation due, that there was in the contract. As then the Executive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the Indian Treaty at his pleaſure, he violated that Treaty, and was guilty of a breach of the laws of nations. "He who violates his Treaties, ſays Vattel, violates at the ſame time the law of nations; for he deſpiſes the faith of Treaties, that faith which the law of nations declares ſacred, and he does all in his power to render it vain.—Doubly guilty, he does an injury to his ally, he does an injury to all nations, and wounds the whole human race."</p>
               <p>Further. "It is ſhewn by the law of nature, that <hi>he who has made a promiſe to any one, has conferred upon him a true right, to require the thing promiſed; and that, conſequently, not to keep a perfect promiſe, is to violate the right of another; and is as manifeſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, as that of depriving a perſon of his property.</hi> All the tranquility, the happineſs, and ſecurity of the human race, reſts on juſtice; on the obligation of paying a regard to the rights of others. The reſpect of others for our rights of domain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty conſtitute the ſecurity of our actual poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032172_0058_0FF168D953991318"/>the faith of promiſes is our ſecurity for the things that cannot be delivered or executed upon the ſpot. <hi>There would be no more ſecurity, no longer any commerce between mankind did they not believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to preſerve their faith, and to keep their word.</hi> This obligation is then as neceſſary, as it is natural and indubitable between the nations that live together in a ſtate of nature, and acknowledge no ſuperior upon earth, to maintain order and peace in their ſociety."</p>
               <p>Did the Executive make <hi>a promiſe</hi> to the Indian Tribes in the 8th article of the Treaty with them? If he did, and that promiſe was reſcinded without their conſent, did he not violate the rights of thoſe Indian Tribes? Is not the violation of that right a violation of the Treaty, and a violation of the laws of nations, which renders him "<hi>doubly guilty, as he does an injury to his ally, as he does an injury to all nations and wounds the human race.</hi>"</p>
               <p>For what purpoſe, let me aſk, did the Executive make a Treaty, which he muſt have known, unleſs we ſuppoſe him profoundly ignorant of the Britiſh Treaty, could not be fulfilled? Was it ad captandum vulgus, that he alſo might be ſtiled "the prince of peace?" Was it that another pretext might be afforded the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, in our violation of one of the articles, to keep up a frontier war, that a Major General and others might be provided for, and the public debt be made ſuſceptible of multiplication? Was it that the nucleus of a ſtanding army might be completely formed? The inſecurity of Treaties with ſavages has furniſhed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for many an animated harangue; but have the United States more to boaſt of than ſavages in this inſtance? Did not the Executive <hi>deceive</hi> the Indians by entering into a contract with them, that "<hi>no perſon</hi> be permitted to reſide at any of their towns or hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing camps as a trader who was not furniſhed with
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032172_0059_0FF168DB0AD1BEB0"/>a licenſe for that purpoſe," when by the Britiſh Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>the ſubjects of Great Britain</hi> were exempted from this obligation? Mr. Jay's inſtructions ſtates in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal terms, that "we have ſatisfactory proofs, ſome of which, however, cannot, as you will diſcern, be well uſed <hi>in public,</hi> that Britiſh agents are guilty of ſtirring up and aſſiſting with arms, ammunition and warlike inſtruments and implements, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent tribes of Indians againſt us;" was it, then, for the purpoſe of giving Britiſh agents a better opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of exciting the Indians againſt us, that they are thus permitted to rove at large, although prohibited by the Indian Treaty? Would the obligation to have a licenſe reſtrict them too much, by placing them upon a footing with <hi>Amercan citizens?</hi> Was it the object of the Executive to have a greater ſolicitude for a Britiſh ſubject than an American citizen?</p>
               <p>If uncivilized nations feel the obligation of Treaties leſs than thoſe who are more advanced in refinement, does this furniſh an argument for deceiving them? Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canery in negotiation is a ſtain upon the national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and how our Executive will acquit himſelf in having made a Treaty with the Indian tribes repugnant to another Treaty anteriorly made, we ſhall perhaps, diſcover, when the dark miſt of ſecreſy which ſurrounds his cabinet ſhall be diſſipated.</p>

               <p>THE explanatory article annihilates the ſecurity which the Indians promiſed themſelves under the Grenville Treaty; and what is very remarkable, the 8th article of this Treaty is but a tranſcript of the 7th arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Treaty concluded with the ſame Indians at
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032172_0060_0FF168DCB21B4540"/>Fort Harmer, in the year 1789, long before the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Treaty was thought of, and long before a Britiſh faction was matured, or a Chief Magiſtrate of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States had become its patron—nay its head. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in this inſtance muſt have been reduced to a ſcience, or why was an article from the Fort Harmer Treaty, copied almoſt verbatim unto the Grenville Treaty? Had not the Indians the beſt of reaſons to ſuppoſe, that the former Treaty was recognized as far as related to the 7th article, when not only the ſubſtance but the form of that article was retained in the laſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Perhaps I ſhould not go too far in aſſerting, that this article has a priority to the Britiſh Treaty, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is a part of the Treaty of 1789, and that the Executive was not conſtitutionally authorized to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſubſervient to the views and intereſts of Great Britain. This, however, I ſhall not inſiſt upon, as my object is to ſhew that ſuch is the Britiſh caſt of our Executive, that neither the faith nor the intereſts of the nation are cords ſtrong enough to bind the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration when in colliſion with the wiſhes of the Britiſh Cabinet.</p>
               <p>Although I never could aſſent to that plenitude of wiſdom aſcribed to the Executive and although I never could diſcover evidences enough to ſatisfy my mind that he was a <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet I am unwilling to believe him ſo ignorant of the alphabet of the laws of nations, as not to know, that he was <hi>deceiving</hi> the Indians by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtipulations in his Treaty with them, which his idolatry for Great Britain, had already rendered nugatory by a Treaty with her.</p>
               <p>The preference, the unqualified preference given to Britiſh ſubjects at the expence of American citizens by the explanatory article, perhaps, ought not to excite new aſtoniſhment, when we conſider, that Britiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts have generally had more attention, and have excited more ſolicitude, than the intereſts of Americans
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032172_0061_0FF168E313BE3300"/>Indeed were any additional teſtimony, more than the world is in poſſeſſion of, neceſſary to ſubſtantiate the identity of the following paſſage in certain private let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>"I love my King, you know I do; a ſoldier and a good man cannot but love him,"</hi> the uniform proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our national intereſt and character at the feet of his <hi>beloved King,</hi> would ſubdue the moſt ſtubborn ſcepticiſm. When Britiſh ſubjects are allowed more privileges, even within our own territory, than Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can citizens—when American citizens are ſurrendered to impreſſment, even without a murmur from the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive, to man the Britiſh Kings navy to fight againſt their deliverers, and againſt thoſe who were once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized as friends and as allies—when under the fulleſt conviction, that Great Britain was aiding the Savages in their murderous warfare, our Executive would kiſs the knife and the tomahawk of thoſe bloody aſſaſſins, by greeting <hi>the King</hi> as his <hi>"great good and dear friend"</hi>— when honour the moſt ſacred, and rights the moſt eſtimable are proſtrated in humble ſubmiſſion before a perfidious and barbarous Monarch, where is the care for <hi>American</hi> intereſts—where is the ſolicitude for <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> rights—where is the concern for <hi>American</hi> ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity —where is the feeling for <hi>American</hi> honour and independence? If ſuch is the reign of idolatry that the voice of juſtice cannot now be heard, poſterity will deal impartialy with the man who has paralyzed his countrys efforts;—who has leagued himſelf with a Government, the ſworn foe to Liberty; who has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Treaty, the price of our independence, mere paper and parchment; and who has endeavoured to convert a nation of Freemen into a race of Eunuchs.</p>
               <p>Having demonſtrated that the Spaniſh and Indian Treaties have been violated in two of their moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial articles, it remains only to prove, that by the laws of nations both Treaties are annulled. "We cannot conſider the ſeveral articles of the ſame Treaty, ſays Vattel, as ſo many particular and independent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032172_0062_0FF168E4ADA2C510"/>for though we do not ſee an immediate connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between every one of theſe articles, they are all connected by this common relation, that the contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers paſs them with a view to each other, by way of compenſation—I ſhould never perhaps have paſſed this article if my ally had not granted me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which in its own nature, has no relation to it. Every thing comprehended in the ſame treaty has then the force and nature of reciprocal promiſed, at leaſt if they are not excepted in due form. Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius ſays very well, that all the articles of a Treaty have the force of conditions, which by a default are rendered null."</p>
               <p>Again. "Laſtly, the peace is broken by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any of the expreſs articles of the Treaty. This third manner of breaking it is moſt deciſive, the leaſt ſuſceptible of chicanery and evaſion. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fails in engagements, as far as in him lies, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuls the contract; this is beyond all doubt."</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But it is aſked, whether the violation of one arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle only of the treaty may cauſe the total rupture of it? Some here diſtinguiſh between the articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected together <hi>(connexi)</hi> and the ſeperate articles <hi>(di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſi)</hi> and pronounce, that though the Treaty be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated in the ſeperate articles, the peace ſubſiſts with regard to the other.—But to me Grotiuss opinion ſeems evidently founded on the nature and ſpirit of Treaties of peace. This Great man ſays, that all the articles of one and the ſame Treaty are conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally included in one another, as if it had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally ſaid; I will do this, provided on your ſide you do that. And he juſtly adds that, when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned that the engagement ſhall not be rendered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual thereby, this expreſs clauſe is inſerted; that though any one of the articles of a Treaty ſhould be broken, the other nevertheleſs ſhall ſubſiſt
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032172_0063_0FF168E6643C8CE0"/>in their whole force.—Such an agreement may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably be made.</p>
                  <p>It may likewiſe be agreed, that the violation of one article ſhall produce only the nullity of thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to it. And which, as it were, conſtitute the equivalent to it.</p>
                  <p>But if this clauſe be not expreſsly ſpecified in the Treaty of peace, the violation of one ſingle article overthrown the whole Treaty, as we have proved above in ſpeaking of Treaties in general.</p>
                  <p>It is in the nature of all compacts in general, ſays Burlamaqui, that when one of the parties violates the engagements into which he had entered by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the other is freed, and may refuſe to ſtand to the agreement; for generally each article of a Treaty has the force of a condition, the want of which renders it void.</p>
                  <p>This is generally the caſe, that is to ſay when there is no agreement otherwiſe; for ſometimes this clauſe is inſerted, that the violation of any ſingle article of the Treaty ſhall not break it entirely, to the end that neither party ſhould fly from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements for every ſlight offence. But he who by the action of another, ſuffers any damage, ought to be indemnified in ſome ſhape or other.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Let me now aſk, whether in the Spaniſh or Indian Treaties proviſion is made, that the violation of one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſhall not invalidate the whole treaty? For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpecific proviſion of this fort, it is undeniable, that both Treaties are rendered ineffectual, ſhould the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties think proper to avail themſelves of our miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. If Spain and the Indian Tribes, pitying the the weakneſs and depravity of our adminiſtration, and ſcorning to viſit its ſins upon the heads of the people,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032172_0064_0FF168E987F98CB8"/>ſhould conſider the Treaties as ſtill in operation, we ſhall be under greater obligations to their magnanimity, than to the wiſdom and virtue of our government.—How they will view the ſubject remains yet to be ſeen; for it is not probable they are, as yet, in poſſeſſion of the explanatory article.</p>

               <p>TO give a complete portrait of the character and diſpoſition of the Executive, the infractions of the treaty with France muſt be taken into the colouring. A full detail of theſe would cap the climax of baſeneſs, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, and perfidy. It ſhall be my taſk to enumerate thoſe which have not eſcaped my memory, and I ſhall leave the reſt to be ſupplied by the recollection of every man, who has been an attentive ſpectator of the intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenes which his country has exhibited.</p>
               <p>The proclamation of neutrality is firſt in order; for until France became a <hi>Republic,</hi> the Executive was attentive to the engagements which had been made with the monarch. Moſt probably had ſhe continued under the old regime, and a war with Great Britain had been conducted under ever circumſtance of inveteracy and and deſperation, the Apoſtle of Liberty at the head of our affairs, would have either became a party with her, or he would have maintained a neutrality unſuſceptible of the character of fraudulent. France however became a Republic, and a proclamation of neutrality was iſſued. I have already demonſtrated, that the clauſes in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Alliance which related to us, admitting the Treaty to be purely deſenſive, were completely operative, as Great Britain made the firſt actual declaration of war
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032172_0065_0FF168EEC4E89F50"/>againſt France. If this be true, and no honeſt man can deny it, upon what foundation does the proclamation of neutrality reſt? Is it not an evident and a palpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention of the Treaty? Could we remain neutral and yet fulfil the clauſe of guarantee? At the time of the arrival of the miniſter of the French Republic here, we were in a ſtate of peace with Great Britain: this ſtate of peace muſt have continued until hoſtilites were either commenced or declared by one of the parties, whence then the neceſſity of a delaration of neutraliy? The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation then was intended to neutralize the Treaty with France, and to determine the conduct of the United States, before they were called upon to fulfill their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal faith—It was telling France, that we were detemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take no part in her differences, whatever may have been our engagements to the contrary. Did any other nation except the United States iſſue proclamtions of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality? If no nation with whom France was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected by Treaty purſued this ſyſtem of policy, what muſt be ſaid of the United States, who in the face of a Treaty of Alliance made this manifeſtation?</p>
               <p>In the Treaty of Alliance there is a reciprocal guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee. France guarantees to the United Sates her inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and we guarantee her Weſt India poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and this may be ſaid to be truly the <hi>caſus federis.</hi>— If the independence of the United States had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, would it not have ben a paramount obligation in France to fly to our aſſiſtance, without weighing the circumſtances which led to it in a gold ſcales? Perfidy would have been a mild term in our mouths againſt her if ſhe had heſitated, much more refuſed—But inſtead of our independence the Weſt India poſſeſſions of France are attacked—how ſtands the clauſe of guarantee then in this caſe? If France was obligated to aid us in caſe our independence was attacked, we were equally bound to aid her in caſe her Weſt India poſſeſſions were attacked, The caſus federis is reciprocal, and the charge of perfidy in caſe of failure, applies equally to both parties—No
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032172_0066_0FF168F0771F6B70"/>truth can be more apparent, then that the proclamation of neutrality was an infraction of the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The privilege allowed Britiſh ſhips of war to enter our ports, after having made prize of the property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to French citizens, affords another inſtance of diſregard to national ſaith. I have in a former letter cited the article of the Treaty to this point. It is ſo unequivocal, that Machiavel himſelf would hardly have the front to cavil about it—Not only have Britiſh ſhips of war found acceſs to our ports; but the Africa at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſeize the miniſter of France within the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of the United States! After <hi>a months delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the Africa was ordered to quit the port for this unexampled outrage; <hi>but this did not happen until the Meduſa was ready to ſail!</hi> The Cleopatra retook the Pamela within the capes, and yet this ſame Cleopatra is permitted to enter our ports at pleaſure, without any indemnity having been made for the capture, or any ſatisfaction for the outrage upon our ſovereignty.</p>
               <p>The moſt rigid <hi>look-out</hi> has been kept by the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration that French privateers ſhould not be armed in the United States. Punctilio has been refined upon to embarraſs all armed veſſels belonging to the French Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, while Britiſh veſſels have been actnally armed in our ports, without the leaſt hindrance from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment —Out of many inſtances I will mention a few, to remove any doubts of the facts.—At Baltimore the Truſty was publicly armed as a privateer, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the remonſtrances of the Conſul. In the months of May and June 1793, ſeveral Britiſh and one Dutch veſſel were armed at Charleſton, and yet when French merchantmen were attempted to be armed for ſelf-defence, the government immediately interpoſed and prevented them. At Norfolk ſeveral French mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantmen, who were arming for ſelf-defence, were arreſted by order of the adminiſtration in 1794, and although the miniſter complained, his complaints were diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032172_0067_0FF168F3498EE640"/>The Argonaut captured the corvette lEſperance and ſent her into Lynn Haven bay, where ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted and ſent on a cruize. In this caſe the miniſter complained likewiſe, but he received neither ſatisfaction nor indemnity.</p>
               <p>I could ſwell the black catalogue of infractions to a ſize, which would perhaps appal the Executive himſelf; but I have already exhibited an ample ſpecimen of the <hi>good faith</hi> of our government, and ſhall now content my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the addition of the laſt outrage upon national honour by the government—<hi>the revocation of the right to ſell French prizes in our ports</hi>—Not content with making the Spaniſh and Indian Treaties ſubſervient to Great Britain, the Executive ſeemed determined to make the Britiſh Treaty the Athanaſian creed of polities, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the heretical Treaty with France. This Treaty was a memento of Britiſh diſgrace, and one of the monuments of our independence; no wonder then the Executive ſhould wiſh to remove ſo offenſive a thing from the view of his <hi>"great, good and dear friend."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although the right to ſell prizes within our ports is not expreſsly granted by Treaty, it was acknowledged by the Executive, and prizes were made ſale of, until the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand was put to the Britiſh Treaty. If the right was not ſuppoſed to exiſt in the Treaty with France, upon what principle was it allowed by the Executive? Either the French have a right to ſell their prizes, or the have not—If they have a right, it is a daring viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Treaty to retract it—If they have not a right, the Executive made an inroad upon our neutrality by permitting it. He has contradicted thereby his own edict of neutrality, and is an offender againſt the declared will of the firſt Magiſtrate of the United States! Was ever injuſtice or abſurdity more apparent!</p>
               <p>But why was the revocation reſerved until the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the Britiſh Treaty? Was not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032172_0068_0FF168F4EC9BC108"/>of France repeatedly aſſured, that nothing in this Treaty contradicted the privileges of the Treaty with her? It has been aſſerted, that the revocation was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated on the colliſion between the two Treaties—Can this be poſſible? Can the adminiſtration be ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely immerſed in iniquity, as to have bottomed the revocation upon a Treaty <hi>ſubſequently</hi> concluded? This would be not only a contradiction of themſelves, but a contradiction of the eſtabliſhed law of nations, and of the eternal and immutable principles of juſtice. The Spaniſh and Indian Treaties were made to cede to the Britiſh Treaty, becauſe they were junior Treaties. This was the opinion of the Executive as expreſſed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory article.</p>
               <p>But why was this revocation reſerved until the will of the repreſentative body was known? This will ſeemed clearly to be, that the prohibition to ſell prizes ſhould not contravene exiſting engagements, and even the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the United States made this amendment to the bill. Does the Executive mean to perſiſt in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the people by treating with contempt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their repreſentatives? When Jay was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a miſſionary to manifeſt our repentance for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, the will of the repreſentatives had a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent tendency and, inter alia, to oppoſe this will was the object of the Executive. The revocation had its riſe in a mixed feeling, in which the ſame contempt was an ingredient, and manifeſted the ſame domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit, which dictated the arrogant and imperious anſwer to the petition from the people of the town of Boſton againſt the ratification of the Treaty.</p>
               <p>Why was it reſerved for the preſent Chief Juſtice to declare, that French prizes ſhould not be ſold in the United States? Was there too much virtue in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devant chief juſtice to expect ſuch a declaration from him, that it was not made before? When Dionyſius turns <hi>land-jobber</hi> what may we not expect!</p>

Hitherto it has been an affair of Executive cognizance alone, whether prizes ſhould or ſhould nat be ſold; but <hi>all of a ſudden</hi> the chief juſtice undertakes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce upon it, and declares its illegality. Here again we undertake to <hi>interpret Treaties at pleaſure,</hi> in defiance of the laws of nations.</p>
               <p>If anything could impreſs the world with an abhorrence and contempt for the American character, the conduct of the Executive towards France would be indelible. The ingratitude, hypocriſy, and perfidy of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards her, muſt remain a laſting monument of infamy againſt the United States; and pity it is that the people are obliged to participate in the diſgrace. What ought to add to the remorſe of the Executive is, that while our conduct has ſerved to eſtrange from us our beſt friend, it has not conciliated the good will of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to whom every thing has been ſacrificed—Their contempt and barbarities have riſen in a degree equal to our proſtitution, and we are daily witneſſing outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that would produce a bluſh even in the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate and abandoned.</p>

               <head>LETTER XVI.</head>
               <p>IN the enumeration of the infractions of the Treaty with France, I purpoſely omitted the <hi>acquieſcence</hi> of the Executive in the impreſſment of our ſeamen. This is an infraction of a ſolemn nature, both in relation to our allies, and as applicable to ourſelves, and deſerves a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific conſideration. It is a virtual oppoſition to France, and ſtamps our government as an acceſſory in the war
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032172_0070_0FF168FBC21D9870"/>againſt that Republic. Would, could our adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſubmit to ſuch outrages as thoſe committed upon our flag, and to the barbarities exerciſed upon thoſe ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under it, without being in ſecret combination with the nation committing them? Scarcely a day elapſes without an account of further impreſſments. Not a week paſſes over our heads without a recital of ſome hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid barbarity exerciſed upon the American mariners— barbarity ſufficient to rouſe the revenge of any man, not dead to the feelings of humanity and to his countrys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. Have the walls of the American <hi>divan</hi> been rendered impenetrable to the agonizing cries of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can citizens? Has Pitt with his <hi>magic wand</hi> deſcribed a circle about the Executive <hi>conclave,</hi> that American feelings and American intereſts are denied admittance? What <hi>ſpell</hi> has been put upon the adminiſtration, that thoſe they are bound to protect, excite no more ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude than if they were inhabitants of California? When it was rumoured that the Executive Directory intended to call us to account for our perſidies, a ci-devant trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury officer, and the chief juggler of the legerdemain tricks of our government, expreſſed his hope, <hi>that the patriotiſm of the ſouthern States would lead them to an union with the eaſtern againſt France, in caſe ſhe ſhould carry ſuch intention into effect!</hi> This <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> of our country felt hot for war when the Republic of France was the object of it; but every outrage, every barbarity, and every indignity was to be endured, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than energetic meaſures ſhould be adopted againſt his idol Great Britain. No wonder our country lies proſtrate and is at them mercy of a Britiſh miniſter, when the chief automaton is made to reſpond to ſo unprincipl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and profligate a creole!</p>
               <p>The willing ſubmiſſion of the Executive to the impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſeamen to man the Britiſh navy is not only an infraction of our Treaty, but is a poſitive contraven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our neutrality. In ſpeaking of the conduct to be obſerved by a neutral nation, Vattel makes the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032172_0071_0FF168FE97B4F458"/>remarks. <q>Let us then ſee wherein this impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, which a neutral nation is to obſerve, conſiſts It relates ſolely to war, and includes two articles, one <hi>not to give any ſuccours</hi> when there is no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor freely to furniſh troops, arms, ammunition, or any thing of direct uſe in war. I ſay, <hi>to give no succours,</hi> and not to give equally, for that a ſtate ſhould at one and the ſame time ſuccour two ſtates, would be abſurd, as beſides it would be impoſſible to do it equally.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>A nation that without any other motive than the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of gain, is employed in ſtrengthening my enemy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding how far I may ſuffer, is certainly far from being my friend, and gives me a right to conſider and treat it as an aſſociate of my enemy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Have not the United State <hi>ſuccoured</hi> Great Britain by conniving at the impreſſments of our ſeamen? Are not numbers of our ſeamen on board Britiſh ſhips of war? By permitting this, are we not ſtrengthening the enemy of France, and giving her a right to confider and treat us as an aſſociate of that enemy? Is not this a violation of our neutrality and an infraction of our Treaty? The Treaty of Alliance ſtipulates that we ſhall aid France; but inſtead of aiding her, we are aiding her enemy!</p>
               <p>The conduct of our adminiſtration in permitting the impreſſment of our ſeamen and leaving them to their fate, reflects the deepeſt diſhonour on the government. The little Republic of Genoa ſcorned an humiliation leſs extravagant, and reſiſted an attempt of Britiſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment with a manlineſs, which has rendered her reſpected. Poor America is degraded almoſt below contempt! We have exhibited leſs ſpirit than the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbs</hi> of St. Vincents when the Britiſh government in 1768 attempted to diſpoſſeſs them of their rights. They diſdained to proſtrate themſelves without a ſtruggle, they reſiſted and ſucceeded, and obliged the government of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032172_0072_0FF16900391F7578"/>Great Britain to confirm their rights by a Treaty. <q>The Treaty between the Caribbs of St. Vincents and the king of Great Britain, ſays a modern hiſtorian, is a monument of hiſtorical curioſity, singularly valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as a ſtriking confirmation of the utility and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the magnimous maxim, in no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to deſpair of the commonwealth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Even the Caribbs of St. Vincents would have bluſhed at a ſubmiſſion to ſuch an outrage as that committed on capt. Jeſſop. What nation beſides the American, would tamely bear to have a captain of a veſſel ſailing under their flag, ſcourged by order of a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Britiſh veſſel of war, until he was ready to expire under the torture? What muſt be the <hi>principles</hi> or <hi>ſenſations</hi> of an adminiſtration, that could acquieſce in ſuch barbarity and outrage? Can ſuch men be ſtiled the guardians of American honour, rights, or indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</p>
               <p>Already have the Britiſh upwards of two thouſand American ſeamen impreſſed on board their ſhips of war, and yet our adminiſtration is as eaſy under it as if Great Britain was defending our rights, and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our commerce. The impreſſments are continuing daily; no ſpirited exertions on the part of the Executive to prevent it, any yet ſome among us dare to talk of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional faith and neutrality! This is, I ſuppoſe, one of the ingredients in a "ſix years glorious adminiſtration!" Speaking of the diſturbances in the colonies, Lord Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham made the following memorable reflection.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Better were it for them to periſh in a glorious conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their rights, than to purchaſe a ſlaviſh tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity at the expence of a ſingle iota of the Conſtitution.</hi>
                  </q> How much to be lamented that a man poſſeſſing ſuch a mind and ſuch an heart was not the Chief Magiſtrate of the United States. Our commerce would then have been free from reſtraint, and our ſeamen would then have found ſympathy and protection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:032172_0073_0FF1690678B0BDB8"/>
The ſpirit which animated our country to reſiſt Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh tyranny and to declare independence is, alas, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized by ſyſtems, artfully contrived to render the mind pliant to the views of an inſidious and ambitious admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. Funding and band ſyſtems, with the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which have grown out of them, have ſubſtituted an avarice of wealth, for the glory and love of country. Had America in the year 1775 been what ſhe is now, a nation governed by ſtock jabbers, ſtockholders, bank directors and brokers, we ſhould have hugged the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which Great Brain had then forged for us.—War and all its horrors would have been conjured up to our view, and our affrighted ſouls would have claſped the pelf as a ſubſtance. more precious than liberty. We would have rather purchaſed "a ſlaviſh tranquility at the expence of the faireſt gift of Heaven, than to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered our luſt of wealth to meet with a moments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption from the "dreams of poets" or "the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of philoſophers."</p>
               <p>I have many more facts at command in relation to the conduct of our adminiſtration. The propoſition of the Republic of France <hi>to naturalize all mercantile citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and thereby to give them a free trade to all their poſſeſſions, on condition that the United States would do the ſame;</hi> incalculable in benefit as this would have been to our country, even this propoſition was treated by our adminiſtration with the ſame indifferent and diſregard which has characteriſed all its actions in relation to that Republic. Other facts of importance might likewiſe be preſented to the public attention, but as theſe letters have increaſed beyond my expectation, and as my avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations interfere too much with a continuance of them, I will reſerve the balance to ſome more convenient oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Matter enough has already been given to the people of the United States to cauſe hem to reflect ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly; matter enough to rouſe them from their torper. I have ſhewn the cloven foot of the adminiſtration, and if this is not ſufficient to alarm, the people muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032172_0074_0FF1690819974118"/>in their idolatry and ſink into ſlaves. That they may be awakened to their true condition, and ſeek and apply a remedy before it is too late, ought to be the wiſh of every friend to humanity, and well wiſher of his country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The following letter was written in anſwer in anſwer to ſome ſirictures which were made on the explanatory article to the Britiſh Treaty; as it is the product of the foregoing author of the letters, and may ſerve to throw additonal light on the explanatory article itſelf, the editor has thought proper to publiſh it among the collection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE confeſſion of <hi>ignorance</hi> diſarms even the ſatyriſt, unleſs indeed that confeſſion has the countenance of ſelf ſufficiency. Underſtanding to be ſure is the gift of heaven, and the want of it ought no more to expoſe a man to inſult or deriſion, than a want of ſymmetry of features. He only is fair game who attempts to take the moat out of his neighbours eye while the beam is ſticking in his own. Your correſpondent "Agrico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la makes a parade with his <hi>ignorance</hi> in political matters," and yet endeavours to convict a writer in your paper of ſophiſtry and falſehood. How a man ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his ſubject ſhould be able to comprehend it, to me, I confeſs, is a myſtery, and did not charity forbid the ſuppoſition, I ſhould be led to imagine, that Agricola conceived himſelf an Achiles in politics, while he attempted to impoſe a belief upon the world, that he imagined himſelf only an infant. As my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is truth I will not take advantage of his weakneſs; but ſhall conſider his remarks with more charity then he felt when he meant a reply to Paulding.</p>
               <p>For a man ignorant as he confeſſes himſelf to be, he has gone ſay indeed in his aſſertion, that "the two
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032172_0075_0FF16909E336ADD0"/>inſtruments (ſpeaking of the Britiſh and Spaniſh Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) do not interfere <hi>at all.</hi>" I cannot ſuppoſed that he even read the explanatory article, or he certainly would have been leſs bold in his aſſertion; for it is confeſſedly predicated on the idea of ſuch interference. If there was no interference, whence the neceſſity, whence the uſe of an explanatory article?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When we agree to grant privileges to another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſays this very able advocate of government, we grant what we poſſeſs at the time of donation and nothing more.</q> Did we or did we not poſſeſs the right to navigate the Miſſiſippi at the time the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory article was agreed upon? If we did, and Agricola himſelf will hardly deny it, does he not ſtand convicted by his own poſition? Does not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation article expreſsly declare <q>that no ſtipulations <hi>in any Treaty ſubſequently concluded</hi> by either of the contracting parties with any other ſtate or nation, or with any Indian Tribe, can be underſtood to derogate from the rights of free intercourſe and commerce ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the aforeſaid <hi>third</hi> article of the Treaty to the ſubjects of his majeſty?</q> What free intercourſe and commerce were ſecured by the third article of the Britiſh Treaty? <q>The river Miſſiſippi ſhall, however, according to the Treaty of peace be entirely open to both parties.</q> This is one of the privileges granted by that article. Although at the time the Britiſh Treaty was concluded we were not in actual poſſeſſion of the navigation of the Miſſiſippi, and the right on the part of the Britiſh to navigate in depended, as did ours, on a contingency, yet, if even a dilemma exiſted before the concluſion of the explanatory article, that article removes all doubts and completely confirms the right of Great Britain to navigate that river, in as ample a manner as we poſſeſs it ourſelves.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh Treaty was prior to the Spaniſh, and granted a right which we claimed but did not peſſeſs.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032172_0076_0FF1690C10AEACF8"/>The Spaniſh Treaty cedes to the United States the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Miſſiſippi and confirms the right thereto, with an expreſs reſervation, that no other nation ſhould poſſeſs it, unleſs by ſpecial convention with his Catholic majeſty. The Spaniſh Treaty then was a repeal of that clauſe in the Britiſh Treaty which granted this right to Great Britain; but to guard againſt this, a new article is entered into confirmatory of ſuch right. Had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation taken place doubts might have ariſen; but the explanation has left no room for further negotiation. Anxious to anticipate even the wiſhes of Great Britain, our adminiſtration determined to place the United States in a dilemma rather than ſhe ſhould not receive our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire homage.</p>
               <p>I would aſk Agricola again, whence the uſe of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory article if the Treaties are not diſcordant? He would not ſurely inſinuate that ſuch was the paſſion of our Adminiſtration for treating with Great Britain, that they would treat about <hi>nothing?</hi> Paulding himſelf could not convey a more bitter ſarcaſm. The fact is, the two Treaties are hoſtile, and that the explanatory article was deſigned, inter alia, to ſecure to Great Britain the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Miſſiſippi.</p>
               <p>The river Miſſiſippi is a highway poſſeſſed in common by Spain and the United States. The uſe of this high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way is given by the United States to Great Britain. Could we transfer a right which we did not poſſeſs? If we poſſeſſed the right and made a diviſion of ſuch right to amother, we became bound to fulfil the contract; for as a Treaty is a contract between two nations, each nation obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates itſelf to fulfil its part. Under a knowledge, that we had imparted our right to Great Britain did we nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the Spaniſh Treaty. If then we meant that Great Britain ſhould not poſſeſs the right to navigate the Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi we deceived her when we declared ſhe ſhould, if we meant ſhe ſhould, and at the ſame time agreed with
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032172_0077_0FF1690ED36DC528"/>Spain, that ſhe ſhould not, we deceived Spain, and where the deception reſts I will leave to Agricola to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. In one or other of the caſes our faith is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and it will require all Agricolas talents to white waſh, the Exccutive.</p>
               <p>In caſes where ceſſions are made by Treaty, the party ceding is bound to fulfil the contract. Thus when Spain ceded to France the Spaniſh part of St. Domingo, ſhe formally put the Republic in poſſeſſion of it. We have made a formal ceſſion of the right to navigate the Miſſiſippi to Great Britain, and we are bound to give efficacy to ſuch ceſſion, and in carrying into effect ſuch ſtipulation, we expoſe ourſelves to war. Great Britain has a right to call upon us to fulfil our Treaty with her. If we refuſe we riſque a war with her, and if we comply we hazard a war with Spain! This is the wiſdom and virtue of our government.</p>
               <p>The triumphant interrogatories of your correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Sir, rather excite pity than any other ſenſation. He aſks <q>if one nation chooſes to open all her ports and rivers to another, does if follow, that any future ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of territory muſt be made equally free; and all future advatanges imparted in like manner?</q> Did not the Britiſh Treaty ſpecifically grant to Great Britain the right to navigate the Miſſiſippi? And although the Spaniſh Treaty is poſterior, does not the explanatory ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, which is poſterior to the Spaniſh Treaty confirm the ceſſion? From the complexion of this defence, as well as from its manner I ſhould be tempted to believe that the negotiator of the explanatory article had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the liſts himſelf; for it has ſtrongly imprinted upon it that ability which has manifeſted itſelf ſince he became ſucceſſor in from to his predeceſſor.</p>
