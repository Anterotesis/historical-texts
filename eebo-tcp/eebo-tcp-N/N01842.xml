            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AFTER the Great and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> Acceptance <hi>which the following</hi> SERMON <hi>met with, from ſo Numerous and Judicious an</hi> Audience <hi>in the Delivery of it from the</hi> Pulpit, <hi>I cannot but think it will be very acceptable to every one from the</hi> Preſs. <hi>I can by no means therefore comply with the deſire of the Reverend</hi> Author <hi>to me, that I would</hi> Excuſe <hi>his yielding to
<pb facs="unknown:002182_0003_10030C200E563E08"/>
the Printing of it. I think none that heard it will allow me to ſay a word on</hi> that <hi>head: And after ſuch an uncommon</hi> Attention <hi>as the</hi> Diſcourſe <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded when it was utter'd, there is no room neither left for me to</hi> commend <hi>it to them that heard it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> Author <hi>in a kind and obliging Letter to me aſcribes</hi> the unexpected <hi>and</hi> undeſerved <hi>Favour of GOD to him,</hi> unto the Prayers of a very religious People, which Heaven hath committed to his Care; <hi>upon whom he had called</hi> to ſtrive together with Him in Prayer to, GOD for him, that his Service might be accepted of the Saints. <hi>And now that it has pleaſed GOD to give a remarkable</hi> Anſwer <hi>unto their Prayers, I beſeech Him alſo to give 'em</hi> Humbleneſs of Mind, <hi>whereby they may accept aright and improve His Grace ſhown them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>IT is a peculiar</hi> Honour <hi>to any Miniſters of the Goſpel, (and thro' Grace we have not a few among us who ſhare in it) when in</hi> retir'd <hi>Places of Service; out of the way of Fame or any worldly reward, they are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in their Studies and</hi> labouring in the Word and Doctrine, to feed the Flock of
<pb facs="unknown:002182_0004_10030C232C7C8108"/>
GOD among them; Studying to ſhew themſelves approved unto GOD, Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that need not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth; <hi>that by the help of GOD they may be</hi> wiſe to win Souls, <hi>be Maſters of</hi> acceptable Words, <hi>and meet to</hi> ſtand <hi>and teach (if called of GOD thereto) before the Greateſt of Men. The</hi> Author <hi>is among us a ſhining</hi> Example <hi>of this Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Proficiency, and GOD is pleaſed to own and crown his Labours with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Succeſs: There being within theſe</hi> Three <hi>laſt Months added to the Church in</hi> Bradford <hi>no leſs than</hi> Forty <hi>and</hi> Six <hi>Perſons: May they indeed be ſo many</hi> Seals <hi>of his Miniſtry, and his Joy in the Day of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and the</hi> LORD <hi>add many more to 'em</hi> daily, ſuch as ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MAY their worthy</hi> Paſtor <hi>be long continued, a more abundant Bleſſing to them, and a diffuſive one to others: And particularly I pray GOD that this</hi> Martial Lecture Sermon <hi>may be as</hi> profitable <hi>to the Gentlemen of the ARTILLERY COMPANY, and others of us, in the Reading of it, as it was</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <hi>in the hearing: That as the</hi> Preacher <hi>was unto</hi> us as a very lovely Song of one

that has a pleaſant Voice, and can play well on an Inſtrument; <hi>So now that we have</hi> heard his words <hi>we may be of them that</hi> do 'em; <hi>And then we ſhall indeed</hi> know WHO <hi>has been among us.</hi>

the Text: or What ſort of Soldiers theſe <hi>Zebulinites</hi> were.</p>
            <p>And here,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>THEY were</hi> (what it is proper all, that profeſs themſelves Soldiers, ſhould be) <hi>Expert in War. Inſtructi ad Bellum.</hi> They were not <hi>Raw</hi> and Unacquainted with the very <hi>Rudiments</hi> of Soldiery: but were <hi>well Diſciplin'd,</hi> and like <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servants, <hi>Trained up</hi> in the Art of War.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Field-Officers,</hi> and all under <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> amongſt them, were Men of <hi>Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;</hi> knew the Buſineſs of their reſpective Poſts, how to behave themſelves, and how to govern in an Army, both in the <hi>Camp</hi> and in the <hi>Field of Battel,</hi> according to the Uſage of thoſe Ancient Times.

            <p>THE <hi>Private Soldiers</hi> were Skilful, and Dextrous in <hi>Handling their Arms,</hi> and Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Directions of their Commanders; ſo as to Defend themſelves, and Deſtroy their

            <p n="2">2. <hi>THEY were</hi> (what it's very deſirable all Soldiers ſhould be) <hi>Men that could keep Rank. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

Men of <hi>Strong Bodies,</hi> able to endure Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and perform great Exploits; <hi>Effective</hi> Men. They were alſo Men of <hi>Great Souls,</hi> that would die a Thouſand Deaths, rather than play the Coward, and baſely fly from their Colours, or deſert their Poſts: Men, that were not afraid to look their Enemy in the face; nor were they terrifyed <hi>with the Thunder of their Captains, or of their Shouting.</hi> Men, whoſe Hearts were inflam'd with a true Martial Fire, that <hi>many waters could not quench, nor the floods drown:</hi> Men, not <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd,</hi> but <hi>animated</hi> by Difficulty, and reſolved on all proper occaſions with that brave Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>Joab,</hi> 2 Sam. 10. 12. <hi>To play the men for their People, and the Cities of their God;</hi> leaving the Event to Him, <hi>whoſe is the Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVEN thus, <hi>Men, fit for Battel,</hi> are <hi>Men of Might,</hi> ver. 8. who <hi>have faces like the faces of Lions, and are as ſwift as Roes upon the Mountains,</hi> not to <hi>flic from,</hi> but to <hi>purſue</hi> their Enemy. It's deſirable, they ſhould, with <hi>David,</hi> be <hi>girded with Strength,</hi> that even <hi>the bow of Steel may be broken by their arms,</hi> Pſal. 18. 34. Then tho' (<hi>the Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battel to the ſtrong,</hi> yet) Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely ſpeaking, it may be hop'd, that <hi>from the blood of the ſlain, and from the fat of the mighty, their Bow will not turn back, nor their Sword return empty.</hi>

3. THEY were (what it's highly reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and needful all Soldiers ſhould be) Men, that were <hi>not of Double Heart. Abſque Corde &amp; Corde.</hi> They were <hi>True Men;</hi> Men of Integrity. <hi>Double-heartedneſs</hi> is oppos'd to <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> Pſal. 12. init. <hi>Help Lord for the Faithful fail—with a double Heart do they ſpeak:</hi> q. d. <q>They pretend a kind &amp; upright Heart, while their heart is really cruel and deceitful.</q> They have <hi>divers Setts</hi> of Tho'ts, and ſpeak according to the Company they're with. Such <hi>double-minded Men,</hi> don't make good Soldiers; there's no truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, no depending on ſuch <hi>Unſtable Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Men of <hi>Zebulun</hi> were not ſo: they were not govern'd by <hi>private,</hi> ſiniſter Views, like furious <hi>Jehu,</hi> pretending Zeal for the Lord of Hoſts, Zeal for <hi>the Church, the Church;</hi> whilſt his main deſign was to aggrandiſe Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Family. No, they abhor'd every thing ſo <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>little,</hi> and had ſtill the great Intereſts of their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi> very much at Heart.</p>
            <p>[<hi>THEY were not of Double Heart,</hi>] This may intend, that they were <hi>faithful to one another.</hi> The <hi>Officers</hi> were faithful to each other; not ſtriving to break one another
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002182_0017_10030C46A73790E8"/>
from Envy, Revenge or for <hi>filthy Lucre:</hi> And they were faithful to the Soldiers under them, not impoſing on them unneceſſary Burdens, nor betraying them to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (as <hi>Joab</hi> did <hi>Uriah,</hi>) not robbing them of, or detaining from 'em their Wages, or invading their Privileges; but carefully inſtructing them, by Precept and Example, in the Art of War: improving all their ſkill and intereſt for their ſafety and happineſs, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Private Soldiers</hi> (we'll hope) were alſo faithful to their Commanders, and one to another. They chearfully obſerv'd the Laws of the Camp: were at their Officer's <hi>Commandment, vers.</hi> 32. And every one <hi>minded His own Buſineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS it's needful that <hi>All</hi> military Men, whether Officers or private Soldiers, ſhould be faithful to one another. That they ſhould be <hi>of one heart,</hi> in promoting the great Ends of their Calling, (as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were of one heart, to make <hi>David</hi> King, ver. 38.) that they ſhould <hi>ſtand by</hi> one another, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>Preſerve, Aſſiſt</hi> and <hi>Encourage</hi> one another. If Soldiers are not faithful to one another, if <hi>their heart be divided</hi> one from another, they'll ſoon be found faulty: they
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002182_0018_100301C4F2836D50"/>
may eaſily miſchief, yea deſtroy one another, and it's well, if they don't do ſo.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, The <hi>Zebulunites</hi> were not of <hi>double Heart,</hi> but <hi>loyal and faithful to their King, and Country.</hi> They all (at leaſt by their Repreſentatives) readily took the Oath of Allegiance at the King's Coronation. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 3. And in taking of it, they ſware in Truth, in Judgment, and in Righteouſneſs; without any <hi>mental Reſervation;</hi> for <hi>they came with perfect heart to Hebron, to make David King,</hi> ver. 38: And <hi>there David made a League with them.</hi> Conſidered <hi>collectively, they were not of double heart,</hi> i. e., They were not ſome <hi>for</hi> David, and others ſecretly <hi>againſt</hi> him. And conſidered <hi>diſtributively,</hi> they were not of double heart: i. e. <q>They did none of them pretend to be <hi>David's</hi> Friends, while in their hearts they favour'd the Family of <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </q> In ſhort, None of them (ſays the ingenious Mr. HENRY in Loc.) <q>had any <hi>ſeperate</hi> Intereſts, but were all for the <hi>Publick</hi> Good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>EVEN ſo, <hi>All</hi> Soldiers ſhould be <hi>loyal</hi> to their rightful Sovereign, and <hi>faithful</hi> to their Country. Diſloyalty and Rebellion in Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, eſpecially in Officers, is an horrid <hi>Crime,</hi> and of wretched <hi>Conſequence.</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:002182_0019_10030C4A11975778"/>
INDEED, we don't exhort to <hi>Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> in the utmoſt Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in which thoſe Doctrines have been preach'd up by ſome, who (as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> did of old,) <hi>bind heavy Burdens</hi> on Men's ſhoulders, while they Themſelves will not <hi>touch them with one of their fingers.</hi> For (as an Excellent Divine of the Church of England obſerves) We ought not to preſs on <hi>others,</hi> what in like circumſtances <hi>we our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> are unwilling to perform.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Burket.</hi>
               </note> But we've ſufficient <hi>Warrant</hi> to put all our Hearers (and conſequently Soldiers) in mind, <hi>To ſubmit to the King, as Supreme; and to Governours, as unto them that are ſent,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. <hi>To exhort every Soul, to be ſubject to the Higher Powers,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. <hi>Not to ſpeak evil of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 10. Jude. 8. And eſpecially, <hi>not to ſpeak evil of the Ruler of their People,</hi> Act. 23. 5. but to <hi>fear God and honour the King,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 17.</p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Soldiers</hi> are thus <hi>loyal,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> was to <hi>Saul,</hi> while his Subject; and as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> Soldiers were to <hi>Him;</hi> that can ſay heartily to their Prince, as <hi>Amaſai</hi> of old, ver. 18. <hi>Thine are we David, and on thy ſide, Thou ſon of Jeſſe:</hi> The <hi>very Hearts</hi> of pious Princes and Rulers will be <hi>knit</hi> to ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,

as <hi>David's</hi> was to thoſe, that came to Him at <hi>Ziklag,</hi> ver. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ONCE more,</hi> May'nt we ſuppoſe, they were not of double heart, but <hi>faithful toward God? Some</hi> of them doubtleſs, and we hope <hi>many</hi> among <hi>fifty thouſand,</hi> were <hi>Iſraelites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> not only toward their <hi>Prince,</hi> but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their <hi>God.</hi> However, we are ſure that <hi>all</hi> Soldiers <hi>ſhould</hi> be ſo. All Men ſhould ſerve God with <hi>Uprightneſs</hi> and with <hi>Single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart.</hi> Their <hi>heart ſhould be right with God,</hi> or they ſhould be truly Religious. Soldiery is not inconſiſtent with the moſt eminent Vertue, the moſt ſhining Sanctity, the moſt elevated Piety.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe, the <hi>Sun</hi> never ſhone on Three braver Warriers, than <hi>Abraham, Joſhua</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> And yet who more Renowned for the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> than thoſe Worthies? <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a Roman Captain, was <hi>a devout Man, and one that feared God with all his houſe. And he had a devout Soldier that waited on him continually,</hi> Act. 10. 2. 7.</p>
            <p>THO' Men, in ſome ſenſe, may be ſaid to be <hi>G<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>od Soldiers,</hi> that are none of the <hi>Beſt Chriſtians;</hi> yet the <hi>Better</hi> Men are, (<hi>Coeteris Paribus,</hi>) the <hi>better Soldiers</hi> they make. And verily ſuch only are truly Religious, who
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002182_0021_10030C5319B01878"/>
are <hi>Sincere,</hi> and in whoſe Spirits there is no <hi>allowed Guile.</hi> And ſuch Soldiers may expect to have <hi>God on their ſide,</hi> (when call'd forth to Service) to <hi>cover their Heads,</hi> and <hi>fight their Battels,</hi> to help them to do <hi>valiantly,</hi> and <hi>to tread down their Enemies.</hi> And ſuch <hi>Only</hi> may expect to have the Lord of Hoſts <hi>with</hi> them and <hi>for</hi> them: and to have occaſion to call upon one another, ſaying, <hi>Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriouſly!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, Soldiers ſhould be <hi>Good</hi> Men, and <hi>True:</hi> Faithful to one another, Loyal to their Prince, and Devout toward God. And truly ſuch, as are not Upright toward God, it's to be fear'd, won't long be Loyal to their Prince. Neither do they deſerve, nor can they expect, their Prince ſhould be faithful to them: For ſuch, as we are toward God, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect others will be toward us. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 25, 26. <hi>David</hi> was an <hi>upright</hi> Man, a <hi>Man after God's own heart;</hi> and God bleſs'd Him with <hi>ſubjects,</hi> that were loyal and not of double Heart. But it's time to ſay,</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p>SOLDIERS <hi>without Weapons</hi> are but <hi>naked</hi> Men. <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> for War won't do well without <hi>Weapons of War.</hi> Indeed Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is better without Weapons of War, than Weapons of War without Wiſdom. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 18.

5. THESE <hi>Zebulunites</hi> were (and all Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhould be) Men <hi>ready,</hi> when call'd thereto, <hi>to go forth to Battel:</hi> Or to improve their military Abilities for the Service of the Publick. They came up <hi>willingly</hi> to <hi>Hebron</hi> in Arms, to attend whatever Service there was for them to do <hi>There.</hi> And no doubt they were as ready <hi>afterward</hi> to ſerve <hi>David</hi> in his Wars, or to go out to Battel againſt the common Enemies of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Thus in the days of <hi>Earak</hi> the <hi>Zebulunites</hi> were among thoſe, that are commended in the <hi>triumphant Song</hi> of <hi>Deborah,</hi> the Iſraelitiſh Virago, for <hi>offering themſelves willingly, and jeoparding their Lives unto the Death in the high Places of the Field,</hi> Jud. 5. 18.</p>
            <p>ON ſome <hi>extraordinary</hi> Occaſions Thoſe, that are <hi>not bred</hi> to War, may be call'd forth to Battel: Thus that Heroine, <hi>Deborah,</hi> took notice, that out of <hi>Zebulun</hi> came thoſe to fight againſt <hi>Siſera,</hi> that <hi>handle the Pen of the Writer:</hi> Then according to Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore's</hi> Paraphraſe,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>The Scribes of Zebulun, and Learned Men,</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>How much more ſhould thoſe, that are furniſh'd with military ſkill and courage,

chearfully improve theſe Talents, when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence gives them occaſion; <hi>and fight for their Brethren, their Sons, and their Daughters, their Wives, and their Houſes?</hi> Neh. 4.14.</p>
            <p>INDEED, Soldiers are not <hi>always</hi> (it may be but <hi>ſeldom</hi>) call'd to liſt as <hi>Voluntiers</hi> in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Service; becauſe it is reaſonable, there ſhould be an <hi>Equality:</hi> But when Soldiers are <hi>call'd</hi> forth by thoſe in <hi>Authority,</hi> they ſhould <hi>willingly</hi> engage in whatever Service, they're call'd to; and not chuſe with the <hi>Reubenites</hi> to continue in the <hi>Sheepfolds,</hi> to <hi>bear</hi> the <hi>Bleatings of the Flocks;</hi> rather than venture into the Camp, to be regal'd with the martial ſound of the Drum and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet: leſt they expoſe themſelves to the <hi>bitter Curſe,</hi> denounced of old againſt ſuch, as <hi>came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord againſt the Mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT thus I've conſidered the ſeveral.

Secondly, THE <hi>Evidence of this Truth;</hi> That the deſcribed Soldiers, or ſuch as anſwer this Character, are an <hi>uſeful and honourable Order of Men,</hi> and conſequently a <hi>Bleſſing to the Publick.</hi> Here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE may argue the Truth of our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, from <hi>the honourable mention,</hi> made <hi>expreſly</hi> or by way of <hi>alluſion,</hi> of this Order of Men and of their office and work <hi>in the Sacred Oracles.</hi> Here we find the <hi>Lord</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the <hi>Song of Moſes,</hi> (Exod. 15. 3.) ſtiled <hi>a Man of War.</hi> Here alſo we find our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>Co-eſſential</hi> &amp; <hi>Co-equal</hi> with the Father, termed <hi>a Leader and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to the People;</hi> (Iſai. 55. 4.)

            <p>IN a Word, Many of thoſe, of whom the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (in the <hi>Eleventh</hi> to the <hi>Heb.)</hi> tells us, <hi>the World was not worthy,</hi> were <hi>famous War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</hi> And theſe <hi>Scripture-Heroe's</hi> are cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, amongſt other things, for <hi>this</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, (to the Immortal Honour of <hi>good Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> who are alſo <hi>good Men,</hi>) That <hi>thro' faith they ſubdued Kingdoms; ſtopped the mouths of Lions; and waxed valiant in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the Aliens.</hi>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002182_0027_10030C61AB2EB7D0"/>
2. WE may further argue the Truth of our Doctrine, from the <hi>Judgment of the Wiſeſt and Beſt of Men;</hi> and from the <hi>Experience</hi> of the <hi>People of God</hi> in all Ages. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the days of old, and read what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, His arming his trained Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that were born in his houſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently had their military Education under him; and the uſe He made of them: And if we conſider, what is ſtoried of <hi>David,</hi> (who is Himſelf frequently ſtiled <hi>a Man of War,)</hi> How He took Care and gave Order, at his firſt coming to the Throne, that his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects might be inſtructed in the Art of War: we may be ſatisfyed, what was <hi>Their</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Caſe. And if we ſearch the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of <hi>ſucceeding</hi> Ages, we ſhall find a mighty <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes</hi> to the preſent Truth.</p>
            <p>BUT to look no further, than <hi>our own Land;</hi> The <hi>Magiſtracy &amp; Miniſtry</hi> of the Country have from the Beginning acknowledged the <hi>Valuable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of this Order of Men. The Civil Magiſtrate, by granting Commiſſions to military Officers, and making good Laws for the Obſervation and Encouragement of frequent Trainings, Annually: And by countenancing and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing for many Years, and even to this
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002182_0028_100301D34A4FA218"/>
Day, the ARTILLERY COMPANY in this Town: and the Miniſters of the Goſpel, by the many Sermons, they've Preach'd to <hi>this</hi> COMPANY, amongſt other Tokens of their Regards for good Soldiers, have amply ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified <hi>their Judgment</hi> in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>BESIDES (as I ſaid) the <hi>Experience</hi> of all Ages does alſo evince, that ſuch Soldiers, as theſe <hi>Zebulunites,</hi> are very uſeful for the preſervation and ſecurity of the People of God. They are uſeful to <hi>prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. Solomon's</hi> Life-Guard of valiant Men, had every Man his Sword on his Thigh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of fear in the Night. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 8. Again, They're uſeful to <hi>revenge Injuries,</hi> done to the Publick: to <hi>recover Captives</hi> and <hi>Spoil,</hi> taken by the Enemy. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> with his Soldiers <hi>bro't back his Brother Let, and his Goods, and the Women alſo and the People,</hi> Gen. 14. 16. <hi>David with his men, they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all, that the Amalekites had carried away: and reſcued his two Wives: there was Nothing lacking to Them—David recovered all.</hi> 1 Sam. 30. 18, 19. They're uſeful to <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> the <hi>Enemies</hi> of God's People. An <hi>Army with Banners</hi> is <hi>terrible</hi> to the Enemy. When <hi>all Nations</hi> compaſſed <hi>David, like Bees,</hi> He reſolves, <hi>that in the name of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He would deſtroy them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:002182_0029_1003020D6409BD10"/>
Finally, WE may argue, that <hi>ſuch</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as we've heard deſcribed, are a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Bleſſing, an uſeful and honourable Order of Men, from <hi>Their Contrary.</hi> However, this Conſideration will <hi>illuſtrate</hi> the Truth before us, as it is the nature of Contraries to do. Not only undiſciplin'd and cowardly, but diſloyal, treacherous and mutinous Soldiers <hi>are a Reproach, and Plague to their Prince and Country.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Contraria juxta ſe poſita, cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruis eluceſcunt.</hi>
               </note> Such Soldiers are but <hi>Armed Enemies;</hi> a moſt <hi>dangerous</hi> Sort of Men, both to Church and State. They that are not <hi>for</hi> Us, are <hi>againſt</hi> Us; and the more expert in War, the more bold and daring, the more active and ſtrong, ſo much the worſe.</p>
            <p>Too many <hi>recent</hi> Inſtances, in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire, do ſadly verify this Aſſertion. O that <hi>this</hi> might never have been <hi>to be told in Gath, and publiſh'd in the ſtreets of Aſkelon!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to mention no other Argument; I paſs to make two or three <hi>Reflections</hi> on the preceeding Diſcourſe. And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, FROM what we've heard, we may infer, Whether we <hi>are,</hi> and what we muſt <hi>be</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> if we would approve our ſelves,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002182_0030_10030C637A0AE6E8"/>
               <hi>good Soldiers of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Why; we muſt anſwer the <hi>Character</hi> of theſe <hi>Zebulu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites;</hi> be ſuch Soldiers under <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as they were under <hi>David.</hi> If we are real Chriſtians, we are liſted under Chriſt's Banner; we're all, of whatever Age, Sex, or Quality, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a <hi>Holy War.</hi> Our Enemies are very many, politick, powerful, deceitful, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and indefatigable.

            <p>Now if we <hi>are,</hi> and would <hi>approve</hi> our ſelves <hi>ſuch,</hi> we muſt be <hi>his willing People,</hi> (Pſal. 110. 3.) and ſerve Him <hi>not of conſtraint, but willingly: not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'DIVINES ſay indeed, that in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> Chriſt gives Men <hi>Preſs-Money</hi> to ſerve Him: but He would not have them do it <hi>againſt their wills. He draws his People with the Cords of a Man, and the Bands of Love,</hi> Hos. 11. 4. He directs his Embaſſadours to <hi>compel</hi> Men to ſerve Him, by <hi>force of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, </hi> not by <hi>force of Arms.</hi> All <hi>Real</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>offer themſelves willingly,</hi> to ſerve in His War againſt their <hi>Ghoſtly Adverſaries.</hi>

AGAIN, We muſt be <hi>cloathed with the whole Armour of God:</hi> of the ſeveral Parts of which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks in the 6th of <hi>Epheſ.</hi>—We muſt <hi>put</hi> on, and <hi>keep</hi> on our whole Armour, Night and Day, during Life.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, We muſt not be of <hi>double Heart.</hi> We muſt be <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> one to another. As we are <hi>One Body,</hi> we ſhould ſtudy to be of <hi>One Mind;</hi> to be ſure, of <hi>One Heart.</hi> If the Hearts of Chriſt's Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are <hi>divided,</hi> it is very lamentable.

teacheth like Him.</hi> Now theſe good Gifts are to be obtain'd <hi>in a way of Prayer, Ask, and it ſhall be he given you: for every one, that asketh, receiveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL thoſe <hi>famous Hero's</hi> of your Order, that you have read, or heard of, or ſeen. They have received all their Skill, and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from GOD. <hi>David</hi> could ſay, <hi>Thou girdeſt me with ſtrength.</hi> Pſal. 18. 39. <hi>He tencheth my hands to war.</hi> 2 Sam. 22. 35.—Go then to <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Name of Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>gives to all Men liberally, and upbraids no man;</hi> and what he ſees good, he will give unto you.</p>
            <p>BRIEFLY, <hi>Give God the glory</hi> of all your military Attainments, and Exploits; and <hi>improve</hi> them <hi>for</hi> his Glory. Thus did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 144. 1, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord my ſtrength, which teacheth my hands to war: and my fingers to fight.</hi> His is the Glory: And He is worthy to receive it; <hi>And expects that what we win by Prayer, we ſhould wear with Praiſe.</hi> This is the way to have our Gifts encreaſed, and continued with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. <hi>Let not then the ſtrong Man glory in his Strength;</hi> nor the valiant Man glory in his Courage: nor the ſkilful in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: <hi>But let him, that glorieth, glory only
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002182_0038_10030C7F7832F680"/>
in the Lord,</hi> who is the Glory of all His People, and particularly of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Order.</p>
            <p>LO <hi>theſe Things, we have ſearched them, ſo they are; hear them, and know them for your Good,</hi> Job. 5, 27.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now <hi>conclude</hi> with a brief <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs</hi> to the Ancient and Honourable <hi>Company</hi> who have called me to preach the Word at this time.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>I eaſily believe, there is no need of <hi>diſſwading</hi> Men of <hi>your</hi> Character from the horrid <hi>Vices,</hi> by which too many of the military Order in our Days have made Themſelves Infamous. And I pleaſe my ſelf, that <hi>you</hi> need no Arguments to prevail with you to <hi>continue loyal</hi> to the wiſeſt and beſt of Kings upon Earth, our rightful and gracious Sovereign, King GEORGE: or to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to <hi>His Excellency,</hi> the GOVERNOUR, whom GOD hath ſet over us: and to <hi>love your Country,</hi> and to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002182_0039_100301E8B59E1EB8"/>
be ready, if call'd thereto, to ſacrifice your Lives for it's Preſervation and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</p>
            <p>INDEED, Our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Bleſſed and the only Potentate,</hi> who has the abſolute <hi>Power</hi> of Peace and War, has for the preſent <hi>cauſed Wars to ceaſe to the Ends of the Earth.</hi> And we ſhall have great cauſe to praiſe the Name of the Lord, if there may ſtill be <hi>Truth, and Peace in our days:</hi> and to ſay, Let <hi>King</hi> GEORGE live for ever, by whoſe wiſe and powerful Influence, under GOD, <hi>we enjoy great Quietneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT alas, What <hi>Changes</hi> are <hi>in the Right Hand of the moſt High,</hi> is beyond <hi>Humane</hi> View. This we know, that it is a <hi>ſinful, contentious</hi> World, we live in: That the Time is <hi>not</hi> come, when the <hi>Nations ſhall learn War no more:</hi> That (as a grave Divine, now with God, would ſometimes ſay,) <q>
                  <hi>We can't expect any long ſettled Peace; but muſt look for frequent Tumbling and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, till the Man of Sin become a Son of Perdition; and His Kingdom come</hi> (The Lord haſten it!) <hi>wherein there ſhall be no Adverſary, nor evil Occurrent.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:002182_0040_10030C840CCC0040"/>
AND verily if we conſider, how <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty abounds,</hi> even the <hi>Iniquities</hi> foretold by the Apoſtle (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>init.</hi>) to be the Sins of the <hi>laſt Times:</hi> and ſee how the <hi>Love of Many</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, His Church, the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>waxeth cold;</hi> We may juſtly expect <hi>perillous Times,</hi> yea that a <hi>Day of Trouble is near.—Deus avertat Omen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do therefore beſeech you, (Brethren, and all the Sons of Mars amongſt us,) that you will <hi>attend</hi> your Military Exerciſes from <hi>time to time,</hi> not only as an ingenious, laudable, and manly <hi>Recreation;</hi> but as a <hi>Preparation for War.</hi> Were your Martial Exerciſes indeed only for Diverſion; yet conſidering the <hi>Nature</hi> of them; and how often the <hi>Chriſtian Life</hi> is in <hi>Scripture</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>Warfare;</hi> what <hi>Occaſion</hi> they miniſter for <hi>noble</hi> and very <hi>uſeful</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections; and eſpecially when I conſider, how often the inſpired <hi>Doctor of the Gentiles</hi> in his incomparable Epiſtles, does <hi>allude</hi> to the Grecian <hi>Games:</hi> I muſt be <hi>excus'd,</hi> if I can ſee no <hi>Reaſon</hi> to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,</hi> but rather to <hi>applaud</hi> Your Cuſtom of having a <hi>Sermon</hi> annually preach'd to you; wherein you may be minded, how you ought to govern your ſelves in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of your Exerciſes, and what <hi>ſpiritual</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:002182_0041_10030C87702B6BC0"/>
Uſe you, and others may make of them. How much more obvious is the <hi>Propriety</hi> of theſe your Anniverſary religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, if we conſider their <hi>Original,</hi> and I ſuppoſe ſtill profeſſed <hi>Deſign</hi> of upholding them?</p>
            <p>I beſeech you then, to <hi>remember what you have received and heard,</hi> from Year to Year, from many <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>eminent</hi> Miniſters of the Goſpel, who thro' the Goodneſs of GOD do ſeveral of them remain unto this preſent, but I ſuppoſe <hi>the greater part are fallen aſleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND I will only add, (for alas, what ſhall He ſay, that comes after ſo many Maſters of Reaſon and Divine Oratory!) Remember, that how ſtrong, and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and ſkilful, and well-arm'd, how rich, and honourable, and learned, how vertuous, and uſeful, and well-beloved ſoever you are, ſtill <hi>at your beſt Eſtate you are</hi> every one of you <hi>altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity.</hi> You are mortal, and <hi>muſt die like other Men.</hi> You are <hi>accountable</hi> to the <hi>Judge of all the Earth,</hi> who is <hi>no Reſpecter of Perſons,</hi> for all that is done by you on this Stage of Action. And if you are not <hi>good Chriſtians,</hi> Iſraelites indeed, as well as <hi>good Soldiers,</hi> you will be <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thro' eternal Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:002182_0042_100301EA62C98480"/>
SEE to it then, that you are not of <hi>Double Heart;</hi> but be <hi>faithful unto Death,</hi> and <hi>whatever you do,</hi> and particularly in your Military Exerciſes, <hi>Do all to the glory of GOD, and in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Verily I ſay unto you <hi>Bleſſed</hi> are thoſe Soldiers, yea Bleſſed for ever, are all they, whom the Lord, when He cometh, (<hi>and He will come quickly,</hi>) ſhall find <hi>ſo doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now <hi>the Lord of Hoſts, who is the God of Peace,</hi> and <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> be with you, and all His People. AMEN!</p>
