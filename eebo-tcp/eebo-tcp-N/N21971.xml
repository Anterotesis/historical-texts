            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>II. CHRONICLES IX.8.</bibl>
               <q>Bleſſed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to ſet thee on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God: becauſe thy God loved Iſrael to eStabliſh them forever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and juſtice.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is from God. It may be traced to the firſt viſit he made to our world after the apoſstacy. * But no particular form hath an excluſive claim to be of devine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. The firſt form was patriarchal. This nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally aroſe from the then ſtate of the world. For a time it was ſufficient. It probably contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued till the deluge; but was found too weak even before that event. The "earth was filled with violence." When the world was repeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and the life of man reduced, government gradually put on other forms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028957_0005_0FDDBBEA695D1898"/>The only political ſyſtem expreſsly inſtituted by heaven was that of the Hebrews, which was a republican theocracy; a form in many reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects diverſe from every other, and to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in general impracticable. The change which took place in their conſtitution, which in proceſs of time became a monarchy, was of themſelves; permitted indeed, but no approved of God. It was reckoned of him among their rebellions.</p>
            <p>THERE are circumſtances in which monarchy may be requiſite; and from the beginning the nations have been permitted of God to mould civil government into what form they pleaſed, in order to ſuit it to their ſtate. Nor was it any part of Chriſt's deſign to make changes in the civil eſtabliſhments of the nations. Chriſtianity was intended to be the religion of the world. The time is coming when it will embrace all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. What may then be their political ſtate doth not yet appear.</p>
            <p>DEEP depravity involves the principles of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. No people ſunk in by utalizing vice can long be free. Such was the ſtate of the Romans at the beginning of the goſpel day. Civil liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the pride and glory of their anceſtors, had expired: It's dying ſtruggles had been violent. They had turned a large of the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble globe into a feild of blood. In defence of liberty, noble, but ineffectual had been the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of virtuous individuals. Arbitrary power was eſtabliſhed. The gracious deſign of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en then opening of the world, required for ſome ages, the continuance of the empire, in all its vaſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028957_0006_0FDDBBF02091D078"/>
extenſions, that Syria in particular ſhould remain a province of it.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations enable us to account for ſubjection to the Roman government enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the firſt Chriſtians, without our thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the divine right of kings. From tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and circumſtances of every people the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of their government naturally ariſes.</p>
            <p>"THE MOST HIGH ruleth in the kingdom of men." This is intimated in the text. When the queen Sheba had ſeen the order and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Solomon's adminiſtration; and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his people, ſhe thus proclaimed her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the providence of God in the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo wiſe a prince. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, thy God, who delighted in thee, to ſet thee is throne, to be king for the Lord thy God: becauſe thy God loved Iſrael, to eſtabliſh them forever, therefore made be thee king over them, to do judgement and juſtice</hi>.</p>
            <p>THAT all power belongs to God, and is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, is doubted only by thoſe "who ſay in their hearts there is no God.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xiv.1.</note> He doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; none can ſtay his hand."<note n="†" place="bottom">Dan. iv.35.</note> He makes uſe, however, of creatures in the government of the moral world, as he doth of ſecond cauſes in the natural. Men are his vicegerents in the government of one another. But who ſhall hold the reins, and in what manner they ſhall be committed into their hands, is ordered by God's counſel and providence. Natural cauſes concur and are
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028957_0007_0FDDBBF0254BE5B8"/>
made the means of raiſing up one and putting down another; eſpecially of placing ſuch in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as are fitted to anſwer the deſigns of the MOST HIGH, whether of mercy or judgment, but all are overruled of him. Without infringing on human liberty his deſign are accompliſhed, and his purpoſes ſtand. Second cauſes ſubſerve the views of the great firſt cauſe, and eventually fulfil his pleaſure. The ſupreme ruler makes uſe of what inſtruments he pleaſes. In the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of nations be often employs the moſt abandoned of mankind. The perfection of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom in the providential government of the world will ultimately appear in overruling the wickedneſs of men, eſpecially of princes, to ſubſerve God's wiſe and holy purpoſes.</p>
            <p>THE ways of providence often appear to us dark and confuſed, "We may wonder with great admiration." But why? They are only ſome ſmall detached parts of the divine ſcheme which fall under our inſpection; and of thoſe our knowledge is partial and quite imperfect. But in God there is no darkneſs. With him all is order and harmony. When the myſtery of God is finiſhied, we ſhall ſee that there is no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in his adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>FARTHER: Good civil government is a token of God's <hi>love</hi> to a people: <hi>Becauſe thy God loved Iſrael, therefore made be thee king over them</hi>.</p>
            <p>IN the language of Scripture a king often ſignifies a form of government, or the polity of a nation. The requiſites to good government are principally a good conſtitution and a good admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:028957_0008_0FDDBBF55854F548"/>OF all national bleſſings none is more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the eſtabliſhment of a <hi>good conſtitution</hi>. Government hath generally been the reſult of neceſſity. A little attention is ſufficient to ſhew its origin; why the regal form hath been the moſt common; and how it hath almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally become oppreſſive.</p>
            <p>WHEN, from the brevity of life and increaſe of population, patriarchical authority was found too weak to reſtrain the luſts and regulate the jarring intereſts of mankind, other meaſures for ſeccurity became neceſſary. Then the weak took ſhelter under the protection of the ſtrong. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one found it neceſſary to attach himſelf to, and make a common intereſt with, ſome power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leader—unleſs where numbers had the precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to unite for mutual ſafety, electing their chiefs, and agreeing in ſome general rules and regulations for the common advantage. This produced republics. But few took precaution for ſafety beyond what the ſtrength of their fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies and immediate connections afforded, till they ſaw the neceſſity of more powerful protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then they reſorted to the neareſt chieftain, from whom they might hope for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ſecurity, in return for which they became in a manner neceſſarily the inſtruments of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their authority, and otherwiſe gratifying their ambition or ſelfiſhneſs.</p>
            <p>THUS by gradual advances have monarchies ariſen which have aimed at univerſal dominion. Hence alſo thoſe monſters called conquerors who like beaſts of prey "have devoured, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028957_0009_0FDDBBF655AA4F78"/>
broken in pieces, and ſtamped the reſidue with their feet."<note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. vii.7.</note> Never was the wrath of heaven poured on the earth by the agency of more fell deſtroyers. At the head of this race ſtands Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, a firſt born deſcendant of execrated Ham. By degrees thoſe chiefs having gained abſolute power over their followers, prevailed to hand down the ſame to their children. Dominion they conſidered as an inheritence; and unwary nations tacitly admitted their impious claims, and ſuffered the chains of deſpotiſm to be rivetted upon them. Hereditary power, that <hi>opprobrium</hi> of reaſon hath laid proſtrate the liberties of the world. This firſt took place when the ſons of Noah had ſpead themſelves abroad after the flood. It appeared again in Europe after the ſubverſion of the Roman empire by the barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the North.</p>
            <p>IN moſt nations, however, regal power was at firſt reſtrained by formal conventions between the people and their ſovereigns: but ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages were generally put into the hands of thoſe raiſed to royalty, as enabled them to burſt the mounds ſet to guard the rights of ſubjects. Theſe advantages they have ſeldom neglected. More have watched to enlarge their own power, and make themſelves and their deſcendants ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, than to make their people happy by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling their own ſolemn engagements.</p>
            <p>THE republics which have been the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned are thoſe of Greece and Rome. Theſe long flouriſhed, and roſe to great power and ſplendor. Their names are ſtill revered. But no ſooner were the people enervated by vice and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028957_0010_0FDDBBF795DB1F90"/>
luxuty, than they ſunk under the influence of craft and intrigue, and were immerſed with the reſt of the world in the gulph of regal domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>EVERY different ſpecies of government may have ſome advantages peculiar to itſelf: but <hi>which</hi> hath, in general, produced the greateſt happineſs to the ſubject, called forth moſt of the powers latent in the human mind, and to the higheſt degree ennobled the nature of man, can be doubted by ignorance alone.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore a ſtrong expreſſion of heaven's favor to a people when wiſdom is given them to adopt a good ſyſtem of government, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh wiſe and equitable regulations. Such eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments are the ſource of order and happineſs.Yea they often lengthen out the tranquility of a people, after they are ſo far corrupted that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wretchedneſs muſt have enſued, had not theſe regulations been adopted.</p>
            <p>MUCH alſo depends on the character of thoſe who are intruſted with the administration. "When the righteous are in authority, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rejoice; but when the wicked bear rule, the people mourn."<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxxix.2.</note> When government is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rutupted at it's ſource, or by want of ability or faithfulneſs thoſe who are appointed to carry it into execution, "the foundationſ of the earth are out of courſe." Confuſion and every evil work follow. As the providence of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the exaltation of thoſe who bear rule,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028957_0011_0FDDBBFCF96E02D8"/>
when the wiſe and virtuous are raiſed to places of authority, the goodneſs of God towards ſuch people appears, and demands their grateful no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. "But wo to that land whoſe king is a child, and whoſe princes eat in the morning."</p>
            <p>FURTHER: civil rulers are exalted to rule for GOD. <hi>Set thee on his throne to be king for the Lord thy God</hi>.</p>
            <p>To <hi>rule for God</hi> is to rule according to his directions, faithfully adhering to the regulations which hath given. It was required of the ruler of God's people of old to acquaint himſelf with his law, and make it the rule of his life and government. "When he ſitteth on the throne, he ſhall write him a copy of this law out of that which is before the prieſts, the Levites. And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear the Lord his God; to keep all the words of this law, and theſe ſlatutes to do them; that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren; and that he turn not aſide from the commandment, to the right hand or the left." The whole univerſe is under the divine controul. To the ſupreme ruler is every created being accountable. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any may aſpire to independence, "there is higher than they." The greateſt and moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful among men ſhould always conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſubordinate rulers, who are exerciſing only delegated powers, and exalted to rule, not for them ſelves, but for him whoſe they are, and whoſe the majeſty in which they ſhine.</p>
            <p>BUT to do juſtice in any meaſure to our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it is neceſſary to deſcend a little to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.

Here a wide field opens before us. A very partial view muſt content us.</p>
            <p>THAT rulers are exalted <hi>to rule for God by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgment and juſtice</hi> implies, firſt, an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive care to ſee that juſt laws are enacted. Laws by which human rights will be ſecured, and free courſe given to commutative juſtice. The eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment of juſtice is the primary duty of thoſe who are placed in authority. To this duty le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators are under the greateſt obligation. That there are none who can call them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or compel them to do juſtly, can tempt only the baſeſt of men to do wrong. True hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſcorns to oppreſs the poor, or to abuſe the weak and defenceleſs. Thoſe whom power ſeduces to injuſtice, and converts into oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, are loſt to all principles of honor and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>

He cannot neglect them without degrading himſelf, and ſtamping a blemiſh on the State. Every ray that beams from the throne ought to bear the character of purity, nobleneſs and grandeur. What an idea do we conceive of a people, when we ſee the ſovereign ſhew in public acts a meanneſs of ſentiment with which a private perſon would think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſhonored?

honor and probity, or adopt the principles of Machiavelian policy, their infamy deſcends to the body of which they are the head. Such rulers deſerve to be diſgracefully driven from their poſts,</p>
            <p>GOD requires "thoſe who rule over men to be juſt ruling in his fear." Rulers of a different character ſet up the ſtandard of rebellion againſt God, and may expect to be judged as thoſe who will not have him to rule over them. "If one man ſin againſt another, the judge ſhall judge him; but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?"<note n="†" place="bottom">I. Sam. ii.15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>NEXT to ſeeing that good laws are enacted, it is the rulers duty to ſee that they are carried into execution. Laws become uſeleſs, when they are neglected, and their penalties diſregarded. This is often a firſt ſymptom of decay among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have been bleſſed with a good conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It ſaps the foundations of juſtice both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private; conſequently deſtroys peace and order. To ſee that faithful men are appointed to execute the laws, and that they are duly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and enabled to act effectually, is an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty in the guardians of a State.</p>
            <p>BUT ſo imperfect is every thing human, that the compleateſt civil code cannot reach to every caſe. Legiſlators are therefore often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to act judicially, being the demier reſort where the written law fails. In ſuch caſes the character of the ruler is exchanged for that of the judge. Here in matters of right they have no diſpenſing power, but are tied up to the ſtrict
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028957_0014_0FDDBC05E4D79460"/>
rules of equity. Though ſuperior to the laws of man, they are bound by the law of God <hi>to do judgment and juſtice</hi>. In matters which reſpect the public, the public weal ſhould be their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Services done for the community ſhould be rewarded at the common expenſe, and uſeful inventions and improvements in the arts which may benefit ſociety, encouraged by ſuitable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums. But the good ruler doth not forget, that although juſtice is a public, generoſity is a private, virtue. Righteous demands on the public he diſcharges with punctuality and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. He doth not think himſelf warranted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud individuals, becauſe he acts for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; but penſions reaching to poſterity, and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of every kind from the public treaſury, he avoids with the ſcrupulous care of a guardian faithful to his truſt.</p>
            <p>As civil rulers are ſet <hi>to rule for God</hi>, their example is of great importance. Laws are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly revered while rulers themſelves obey them but ſeldom regarded when their conduct is diverſe. Rulers who maintain the dignity of character which becomes their ſtations, have in their example an influence more happily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding than all the terrors of power. This renders exceedingly intereſting the part they act. Every one's influence bears proportion to his conſideration in the eyes of men. Obſcure individuals ſtand in a good meaſure alone. To <hi>themſelves</hi> it is of importance that they refuſe the evil and chuſe the good. But different is the caſe of thoſe in high ſtations. If <hi>they</hi> are vicious, "many will follow their pernicious ways, and they will not periſh alone in their iniquity."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:028957_0015_0FDDBC0B76651C20"/>FURTHER: It is incumbent on thoſe who are <hi>ſet to rule for God</hi> to be <hi>nurſing fathers</hi> to the cauſe of God. We are aware that it is not in the power of man to compel any to be religious, and that civil rulers, by interpoſing in behalf of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have ſometimes injured the cauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to advance. This hath ariſen from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking their duty, or taking too much upon them. Rulers have often arrogated to themſelves titles which belong to God only—often taken on them to decide on articles of faith. That a large ſhare of this abſurdity hath formerly been charged on clerical influence, we do not deny; but from whatever ſource it proceeds, it argues great arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and groſs ignorance of human nature. No power, except that of light and truth, hath the remoteſt tendency to produce conviction. One might as rationally expect by force of argument to chain up the ocean, or arreſt the planets in their courſe, as to change the views of the mind by the terror of penal laws. Never was a ſoul converted to Chriſtianity by Papal <hi>anathemas</hi>, or imperial mandates or proſcriptions. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith every one hath an unalienable right to judge for himſelf: It is a right of which no one can deprive another, and for the uſe of which man is anſwerable to God alone. Each one hath alſo a right to worſhip God as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience directs, while he leaves others to enjoy the ſame liberty. Openly to proſeſs his own ſentiments, "live in all good conſcience before God," and maintain the ſame liberty for others, unawed by the reproaches of bigotry, is the rulers duty. If the evidences of religion are not ſufficient to evince it's divine original, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no ſupport. If it cannot commend itſelf
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028957_0016_0FDDBC0CA4668AE0"/>
to the conſciences of men as worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, let it fall. But the religion of Jeſus doth not fear to meet all it's adverſaries on the ground of reaſon and evidence: Its truth is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by a cloud of witneſſes: The more they are examined the better: It needs no arm of power to cruſh thoſe who deny its divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: It calls no fire from heaven to conſume thoſe who do not receive it. They know not what ſpirit they are of, who think to aid it by ſuch means: It is worſe than ſteadying the ark with unhallowed hands. It is like immolating human victims on the altar of Jehovah. Let true religion only be defended from external violence, and thoſe raiſed to power whoſe lives adorn it, and it will triumph over all the ſoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry of earth and hell, and ſpread its divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence far and wide. Thus to defend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it, is the ruler's duty.</p>
            <p>BUT while each one judgeth for himſelf reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the nature of religion, it is of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that public worſhip ſhould be kept up, and it is the duty of all, according to their ability, to contribute to its ſupport. This is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of religious liberty, while no one at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to intrude his creed upon another, or calls on him to ſupport a religious ſyſtem not his own. A compariſon of communities in which theſe regulations have been maintained with thoſe in which they have been neglected is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to evince their utility, and convince even the ſceptic of their political wiſdom. And though God is pleaſed to bleſs thoſe means, and render them effectual to ſpiritual advantages, it
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028957_0017_0FDDBC11F2710A48"/>
is on political principles that ſuch regulations call for the civil ruler's ſupport. For order, harmony and general happineſs have, from time immemorial, been found to be their fruits.</p>
            <p>I ONLY add here, faithfulneſs to God and to their conſtituents requires thoſe in authority to patroniſe the intereſts of literature. Ignorance next to vice is baleful to liberty and happineſs. Vice and ignorance often go together, and the glory of every people falls before them. But deeply ſenſible are this people of the importance of early inſtruction, and ſuch hath been the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous care of their rulers, both to encourage pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſchools and ſupport the univerſity, from which the ſtate hath long received diſtinguiſhing advantages, that the propriety of enlarging on the ſubject is precluded.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, God's end in giving a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and good rulers to a people is <hi>their eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment</hi>. "Becauſe thy God loved Iſrael <hi>to eſtabliſh them forever therefore</hi> made he thee king over them."</p>
            <p>WHEN the form of government is eſſentially defective, or the adminiſtration devoid of the qualifications which conſtitute the good ruler, numbers and reſources are of no avail: they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford neither tranquility within, nor ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt violence from without. Almoſt every age affords examples which confirm this obſervation—the preſent in particular. One of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Europe, <note n="*" place="bottom">Poland.</note> to which in nature nothing was wanting to have rendered it a match for the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028957_0018_0FDDBC13616243C0"/>
moſt powerful of its neighbors, hath long been the ſcene of anarchy and wretchedneſs from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in its polity. It was a few years ago for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally divided among ſome of the powers border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, and is now, with ſeeble, unavailing reſiſtance ſeized by the ruthleſs tool of a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern deſpot: its cities laid in aſhes, and its fields drenched in the beſt blood of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; becauſe they dared to aſſert their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted rights.</p>
            <p>THESE States, now ſo happy and reſpectable, had well nigh afforded another inſtance of a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant people ruined through the deficiency of their national government. When congreſs was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entitled to apportion and aſk the ſupplies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the common welfare, every one knows how irregular, unequal and deficient they were found, even during the ſtruggle for national ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. All thoſe evils increaſed after the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous conteſt was ended. Public credit was loſt, honeſt induſtry diſcouraged, and barefaced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and oppreſſion prevailed. We remember the well meant endeavors of our faithful ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to avert the evils, and eſtabliſh this inſant empire. But all was unavailing, till the ſource of our diſtreſs was removed in a new organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the general government.</p>
            <p>GOOD rulers are no leſs neceſſary to the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment of a nation, than good rules. When weak or wicked men are exalted, the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is in vain. Debility in the head ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the members of the body politic. Wicked, deſigning rulers are ſtill worſe than weak ones. What encroachments on the rights
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028957_0019_0FDDBC19071892F8"/>
of a people hath a ſingle reign often produced? Weak or luxurious princes have often enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the arm, and deſtroyed the ſource of national power, and yielded great and reſpectable States a prey to enemies they before deſpiſed. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones often deſtroyed their liberties, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to cry out by reaſon of thoſe who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over them. But good forms of government, and wiſe and faithful men holding the reins, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſmall States happy and ſecure: and, when continued for a few generations, generally raiſe them to national greatneſs.</p>
            <p>FEW have been permitted to chuſe, either the form of their government, or the perſons to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it. To the United States both have been refered by the diſtinguiſhing goodneſs of God. Freed from foreign dominion, it was given us, deliberately to adopt what civil conſtitution we pleaſed. In an enlightened age, with the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the whole political world before us, we have choſen for ourſelves. Hitherto we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our choice. Happily the power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment is retained. Whenever defects ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they may be rectified, without violence or tumult. With what other government is this the caſe? In ſome countries where they make their boaſts of liberty preſcription is often pleaded in juſtification of abuſes and againſt amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!</p>
            <p>AT the pride and folly of thoſe of old whoſe laws were irreverſible, the preſent age wonders. Yet ſimilar traits appear in moſt modern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Strorg clauſes to prevent improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; by which they are bound never to grow
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028957_0020_0FDDBC1A1492E438"/>
wiſer! Or if not, cuſtom hath in this reſpect all the force of law! On every emergency, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common incident, the annals of their hiſtory are ranſacked for precedent; and the deciſions of leſs enlightened, perhaps of barbarous anceſtors, give law to a thouſand generations! As though wiſdom had periſhed with the ancients; or the moderns were forbidden by penal ſtatutes, to correct any of their miſtakes, or interdicted of heaven, to think or act for themſelves in matters of government. Different are our views in this reſpect. Unfettered by cuſtom, or the opinion of leſs privileged ages, full ſcope is given for all the improvements in civil policy, which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of former times, and the wiſdom of the preſent, may ſuggeſt. This advantage is more to be valued than all the political knowledge of the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>OUR rulers are of ourſelves, and freely elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In giving our ſuffrages, we are neither aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by power, nor affected by influence. This day ſpeaks us poſſeſſed of privileges which all have deſired, but very few enjoyed. What more or better can we wiſh? <hi>Becauſe God loved our Iſrael</hi>, unworthy as we are, <hi>therefore</hi> hath he beſtowed theſe bleſſings upon us <hi>to eſtabliſh us forever</hi>.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations ſuggeſt to us the duty of a people ſo highly favored of heaven. A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proved with mercies ſhould make the returns of love and obedience. "The goodneſs of God leadeth to repentance." And as much depends on the character of rulers, it highly concerns thoſe who are permitted in providence to chuſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028957_0021_0FDDBC1FB9AFF990"/>
their own, "to provide out of all the people able men; ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs to be rulers over them."<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xviii.21.</note> If a free people "call the proud happy, and ſet up the workers of iniquity,"<note n="†" place="bottom">I Sam. viii.7.</note> they begin the revolt from God, "rejecting the Lord that he ſhould not reign over them," and implicitly declaring that they "will be like the nations." <note n="‡" place="bottom">v.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT is the great privilege of free governments, that in them neither weak nor wicked rulers are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Where hereditary power is eſtabliſhed, the caſe is different: there the fool or the man of Belial may be their king. Yea, the one or other hath generally happened. But where ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are called to office by the ſuffrages of the people, the wiſe and good may be exalted, and all the bleſſings of good government ſecured.</p>
            <p>FINALLY; the character of a free people is commonly apparent in that of their rulers. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors wiſh to promote thoſe like themſelves. Men of principle give their votes for men of principle: thoſe averſe to its reſtraints, for thoſe whoſe vicious indulgencies may keep them in countenance.</p>
            <p>THERE are times, indeed, in which, through the deceptious influence of deſigning men, thoſe of oppoſite principles unite in calling to office, men whom in other circumſtances, they would all deſpiſe or abhor. But time developes characters and views. When cool reflection ſuceeds to party heat, or the occaſion of the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028957_0022_0FDDBC20D92A3AF0"/>
moment is no more, general character is again conſidered, and thoſe advanced to power whoſe views are conſentaneous to theirs on whom their elevation depends.</p>
            <p>THE occaſion of this ſolemnity authorizes an addreſs, firſt, to the chief magiſtrate of this State.</p>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>AT a period critical and intereſting to the liberties of your country and of mankind, you was called by providence into public life. Had Britain triumphed, the cauſe of America had been deemed rebellion, and the aſſertors of her rights had died with infamy. Not ignorant of the danger, yet truſting in him who loveth our Iſrael, you joined the patriots who broke the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile yoke and raiſed us to rank among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Then was laid the foundation of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture greatneſs and felicity, and the foundation of two revolutions in Europe, both highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, which have already taken place, and perhaps the foundation of more, yet in the womb of providence.</p>
            <p>SENSIBLE that the riſe and fall of empires proceed from God, the good ruler's eye is raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him for direction, and for a bleſſing on his faithful endeavors, to ſerve God and his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. We aſſure ourſelves that your excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will never loſe ſight of republican principles, or ſet the example of forſaking republican man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. To be the firſt ſervant of a free and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people, you eſteem more honorable, than to glitter in all the tinſelled toys of royalty, or by a nod give law to myriads of ſlaves. The
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028957_0023_0FDDBC269E6B79C0"/>
pageantry of monarchy, like the infants rattle, pleaſes little minds, and is ſuitable to the capac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of moſt of thoſe who, born to empire, are ſurrounded with flatterers from their earlieſt days. Nobler objects employ the mind of him who is worthy to rule over freemen. To gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern with equity and honor, and ſeek the wealth of his people, is his higheſt ambition and the joy of his heart.</p>
            <p>WHILE the wiſe and faithful civil ruler is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, beloved and obeyed, he is not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the duties due to <hi>him</hi> who is over all. He is careful to "render unto God the things that are God's;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. xxii.21.</note> careful, by a bright example of every virtue, to recommend religion, that oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may learn of him to glorify God. Godlineſs promotes order and harmony, and gives ſtrength and honor. "Righteouſneſss exalteth a nation." It hath been the diſtinguiſhed happineſs of this State that ſuch have been her chief rulers.</p>
            <p>WE offer up prayer for your Excellency, that you may be enabled to acquit yourſelf with honor in the diſcharge of every remaining duty as a dignified chriſtian ruler—that when you ſhall have "ſerved your generation according to the will of God," you may retire with an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſcience; meet an approving judge; and receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
            <p>THE addreſs now turns to the other branches of the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:028957_0024_0FDDBC286F7B1338"/>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>INTERESTING is the truſt repoſed in thoſe who are called to defend the rights and regulate the public concerns of freemen. In their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, prudence and fidelity do the multitude of their brethren confide. To them do they look up for juſtice, order and tranquility.</p>
            <p>FROM no ſource have greater calamities ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en than from errors in the form, and abuſes in the adminiſtration of government. Many are the ways in which offended heaven hath ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the wickedneſs of men; but in few more ſeverely than in monarchical eſtabliſhments; in none more terribly than by "ſetting up over them the baſeſt of men,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. iv.17.</note> and yielding them a prey to thoſe "whoſe tender mercies are cruel."<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xii.19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>TYRANTS were foretold, under the ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal repreſentation of beaſts of prey.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Dan. vii. 3.</note> They have "turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteouſneſs into hemlock,"<note n="§" place="bottom">Amos vi.12.</note> not only among thoſe under their dominion, but alſo in ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nations. "To them it hath been given to take peace from the earth, that men ſhould kill one another."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. vi.4.</note> What is ſaid of the tongue is applicable to them—"They ſet on fire the courſe of nature, and are ſet on fire of hell." <note n="¶" place="bottom">Jam. iii.6.</note> The wars, which have depopulated the world have moſtly originated in regal pride, paſſion, and luſt of power. The end of theſe diſtreſſes is not yet.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>THAT the latter day glory, ſo often foretold in ſcripture, is to be preceded by great deſolations, eſpecially by blood wars, hath been the expectation of thoſe who have attended to the prophecies: but the occaſion of thoſe wars, we apprehend hath been miſtaken. That they will be of the religious kind, hath been the general opinion. But it might be eaſily ſhewn from the word of truth, that after the decline of Roman ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, infidelity will "run and be glorified"—the earth filled with ſcoffers, and that faith will ſcarcely be found upon it, "when the ſon of man cometh!"<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke. xviii.8.</note> The wars then, which are to depopulate the world, muſt ariſe from ſome other ſource. That they will be occaſioned by ſtruggles between power and liberty, is at preſent, the moſt probable conjecture. That "the thrones are to be caſt down,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Dan. vii.9.</note> and all birds of prey "filled with the fleſh of kings"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. xix.17.</note> and their partizans and helpers, we are taught in prophecy. The ſame is probably intimated, by "the fun and moon, being darkened, and the ſtars falling to the earth."<note n="§" place="bottom">Mat. xxiv.29. Rev. vi.13.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT monarchy ſhould contend earneſtly for the powers and prerogatives it poſſeſſed in the dark ages, when reſiſting a king was thought to be, in every inſtance, "reſiſting the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God," hath nothing in it ſurpriſing. And that ſuch are its connections and dependencies as to occaſion ſevere and bloody contentions, an acquaintance with the political world gives us reaſon to expect: and the ways of providence at this day, ſeem to confirm theſe expectations.

their more than brutal enormities. The groans of bereaved parents, the cries of helpleſs orphans, the ſhrieks of raviſhed matrons and virgins, and the wailings of oppreſſed millions who have had no helper, have aſcended to heaven and held them up as objects of horror and execration.

            <p>IN free ſtates, public truſts are honorable, they are the ſuppoſed badges of ability and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The caſe is different in hereditary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In them the loweſt ſervant is often wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and better than he who is lord of all. The meaneſt officer of a free people deſerves more reſpect, than is due to the prince who ſtruts in purple, and ſwells beneath a diadem.

            <p>To thoſe who rule well honor and obedience are due; and they are ſeldom denied to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious ruler, who makes it his concern to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the reaſonable expectations of his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.

But the multitude are much influenced in their opinion of it, by the reſpect it receives, from thoſe in high ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

The righteous are the ſalt of the earth, who preſerve the world from the putrefactions of vice, give health and ſtrength to the body politic, and draw down the bleſſing from above upon it.</p>
            <p>RULERs are in a ſenſe, federal heads to thoſe under their government. The people derive from them a relative holineſs or guilt.

            <p>HAPPILY hath God made us to differ from our brethren of other nations. Let us for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reflect upon it.</p>
            <p>FRANCE long enſlaved, hath lately broken her bands and now aſſerts her rights. What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders doth the ſpirit of liberty produce? while under a monarchy, aided by a family compact, ſhe was ſpoiled and kept under by a northern neighbor. But upon her aſſuming a republican form, ſhe hath ſingly baffled the councils, and with her ſoldiers of a day, vanquiſhed the forces of all the ſurrounding nations.</p>
            <p>HER late adoption of a mild and juſt ſyſtem has contributed to leſſen her internal convulſion and danger. While paſt atrocities are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028957_0030_0FDDBC3D11539F88"/>
much is to be attributed to the external force that ſurrounded her, and the attempts to ſeduce her citizens. Though her enemies are weakened by repeated defeats, they yet continue to break her reſt and prevent her enjoying the bleſſings of liberty in tranquility.</p>
            <p>THE Dutch united provinces have now the proſpect of happineſs. Wiſdom and moderation have marked every part of their public conduct, ſince the tyrants who oppreſſed them have been driven away. But their felicity is not yet ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Calamitous muſt be their ſituation while their country continues the theatre on which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending nations are ſtruggling for the maſtery.</p>
            <p>BRITAIN hath long made her boaſts of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.<note n="*" place="bottom">WHAT is the foundation of this boaſted liberty? <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>. What is this <hi>Magna Charta?</hi> A grant of certain privileges, made to the nation by one king John, a moſt contemptible char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. Is not the devine right of this ſame John to the plenitude of power claimed by deſpots conceded in the very acceptance of this grant? But how was this ennobling boon obtained from the ſaid John? If by force, theſe boaſted privileges are the fruit of rebellion and robbery. If by prayers and humble intreaties, acquitted of guilt it becomes a beggarly diſtinction. Should American rulers proſfer like grant to her free born ſons, they would ſpurn from office ſuch aſſuming chiefs.</note> If ſhe enjoysit may ſhe long enjoy it by us unenvied. Let her glory in the ſtrength of her conſtitution.—If ſtrong by nature, it hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption preying on its vitals, and already wears a ſickly countenance. At this day, what is her government, but intrigue and influence? Long after Roman liberty was loſt, the forms of their ancient government were kept up, and the ſimple vulgar thought themſelves free. Little different is the preſent State of our Britiſh brethren.</p>

Theſe they conſider as the bulwark of their liberty. How and by whom are they now cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen? They are but a mockery of repreſentation. The forms however, of their free government are continued, and the nation pleaſed with the name of liberty. Connected with that kingdom by a thouſand ties, ſhe might have dragged us down to ſervitude, had not her cruel policy torn theſe ties aſunder, and left her to ſink alone. While we execrate her views, and ſhudder to recollect the dangers we have eſcaped, let us ſhout the praiſes of HIM "Who doth great things and unſearchable, and marvellous things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number."<note n="†" place="bottom">Job v.9.</note>

Did they will the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of tyranny, would it not fall to riſe no more? If "they plainly ſay we love our maſters, and will not go out free," we muſt leave them to hug their chains—to lick the hand that riſies all their comforts, and is often raiſed to ſhed their blood. We muſt leave them to adore the idol their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath ſet up—the Diana of arbitrary power, "whom all Aſia and the world worſhip." May America, which is ſaid to "degenerate animal nature, and be little man," <note n="‡" place="bottom">Buſſon.</note> forever refuſe to bow to the golden image of royalty, and think herſelf happy in being free.

            <p>PERMIT me, therefore, to call up your grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the author of all good, by obſerving, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to our preſent apprehenſions, that "the lines are fallen to us in pleaſant places, and we have a goodly heritage.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xvi.6.</note> God hath not dealt ſo with any nation." <note n="†" place="bottom">cxlvii.20.</note> No people equally priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ileged is to be found on earth.

            <p>WE are bleſſed with a country productive not only of the neceſſaries, but ſweets of life. The variety of productions is greater in this, than in almoſt any other land. What was ſaid of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,

will apply to theſe States. "It is a land of hills and vallies, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: a land which thy God careth for; the eyes of the Lord thy God are upon it, from the beginning of the year, even unto the end of the year."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Deus. xi.11, 12.</note> But the crown of all is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Our poſſeſſions are our own. No proud maſter can command our perſons, or violate our property. Nor is it the leaſt of our advantages, that we are ſo far removed from thoſe who could do us eſſential injury. It was part of Iſrael's bleſſing, that they "ſhould dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the nations."<note n="§" place="bottom">Numb. xxiii.9.</note> The ſame was our ſecurity, and the means of our deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the mad rage of Britain. God grant that the ocean may forever guard us againſt the violence, and ſeparate us from the vices, follies and politics of Europe.</p>
            <p>BOTH in our national and ſtate capacities we are bleſſed with the happieſt conſtitutions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the power of making alterations, as our change of circumſtances may require. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny choſen to rule over us are found unfaithful or unſkilful, they may ſoon be removed, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers advanced to fill their places. Here no one claims <hi>a divine right to do wrong</hi>. Nor is it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that there are any <hi>who can do no wrong</hi>. <note n="‖" place="bottom">According to the maxims of a certain European kingdom, the king can do no wrong and never dies. We ſhould ſuppoſe, that Prayer, "O king live forever,"<note n="¶" place="bottom">Dan. vi.6.</note> was there heard and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.

whom they confeſs themſelves accountable for their conduct in adminiſtration. That rulers are ordained for the people, and not the people made for them, is univerſally conceded.</p>
            <p>THIS doth not derogate from the honor of thoſe who rule well. They are deſerving of double honor. To them it is given to do more for the benefit of mankind, than to moſt others; and to be uſeful is the greateſt honor—To do good is God-like.</p>
            <p>IT highly concerns us to be careful whom we raiſe to power, and to be watchful of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. The repreſentatives of the united Neth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlands, who freed that people from the yoke of Spain, became long ſince, <hi>their High Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſes, independent of the people, and for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. with an hereditary Steadholder at their head</hi>, till he was lately driven away by the victorious arms of the French republic.</p>

their continuance. The eaſtern continent, that world of ſlaves, was once inhabited by freemen. The general character and views of rulers are matters of the utmoſt importance. The wiſe, the good, the virtuous, men who fear God and love peace, whoſe benevolent minds wiſh liberty and happineſs to the whole human race, ſhould be carefully ſought out, and elected to office. When free ſtates chuſe weak or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men to rule over them, they expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the evils attendant on hereditary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. When the former are elected, the ends of government are fruſtrated: when the latter, they often faſten thoſe evils upon them, and bind them with cords which are not eaſily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Men of lax principles, men of no princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and men of vicious manners are unfit to be truſted with the concerns of the public. They who are allowedly unfaithful to God will not be faithful to men. The ties of honor are weak, where the fear of God and the ties of conſcience are loſt. To offer unprincipled men the oath of God, is trifling with religion and affronting the majeſty of heaven. "With ſuch chains can no man bind them."</p>
            <p>BEWARE the ambitious, who indecently court prommtion, who cannot contentedly wait, till thoſe who bid them, unſolicited, ſay to them, "friends go up higher;" but ſeek, by undue meaſures, to foiſt themſelves into the chief ſeats—Who artfully raiſe popular prejudices, and every one catch at every vulgar miſtake, ſaying to every one, "ſee thy matters are good and right;"<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Sam. xv.8.</note> their opinions veering with every wind. Men who
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028957_0036_0FDDBC4E6D87A3C0"/>
are fit to be intruſted with public offices, who are worthy of public confidence, are men of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and men of ſtability. Such, if called into public life, will ſteadily purſue that line of conduct, which to themſelves appears moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the public good. They are incapable of ſacrificing their own judgments to popular clamors, raiſed by the low intrigues of deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men. If their meaſures offend, they retire with dignity into private life; and leave the world to eſtimate their value, by a compariſon of their adminiſtration with that of their ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</p>
            <p>THAT the vile practice of electioneering, in all its forms, ſhould be forever excluded, is a matter of the laſt importance. It hath degraded every free ſtate into which it hath found admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and deeply wounded or deſtroyed their liberties. Should it creep in among us, it would doubtleſs draw after it like fatal effects. No principle can reſtrain the venal wretch who in any manner buys an office, from proſtituting the fame to his private emolument. Bleſſed be God, ſuch is not the character of our rulers. Should they become ſuch, our happy conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would avail us little. From the dignity of freemen, we ſhould ſink into ſervitude. But when electors are wiſe and prudent, improper perſons ſeldom make their way to power. If they chance to riſe, they commonly ſoon fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſink into deſerved contempt.</p>
            <p>WHILE we are careful to elect wiſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous rulers, we may ſafely confide in them. And to the united wiſdom of our aſſembled legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould every matter of public concern be
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028957_0037_0FDDBC4F89883368"/>
refered. In our retirements we have not thoſe means of information which they enjoy. The particular members whom we elect are ſent to participate in that information, and act under the influence of it. Unreaſonable therefore and affrontive is the practice of binding their hands by inſtructions, which reduce them to the poſt boy's inſignificance.</p>
            <p>WOULD we continue happy and reſpectable, we muſt render to all their dues—to God—to civil rulers—to all men. To this leads that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is from above. The doctrine that weakens the ties of virtue, ſaying "to thoſe who deſpiſe God, ye ſhall have peace, and to thoſe who walk in the imagination of their own heart, no evil ſhall come upon you," having a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tendency, is from beneath, and leads down to ruin.</p>
            <p>WHILE we feel ourſelves intereſted in the peace and happineſs of ſociety and the preſervation of our rights, let us not forget, that ſtill higher and more valuable intereſts demand our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal attention. This is but our entrance on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. The whole depends on the manner in which we here act our parts. We act under an omniſcient eye. Our temper and conduct, yea our views and deſires, are regiſtered in heaven, and will one day be brought into judgment.</p>
            <p>MAY ſuch conſiderations always abide with us, and may we live continually under a deep ſenſe of their reality. Nothing beſides hath an equal tendency to render us bleſſings in our generation, and train us up for eternal bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
