            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE POST-OFFICE is ſo immediately dependant on the Government, that any anonymous production iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, muſt be looked on as coming from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration itſelf; in this light I have viewed the anonymous paper which has been ſo induſtrouſly diſtrubuted through the Poſt Offices of the North, avowedly to deprive me of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhare of your confidence I might have gained, and in this light I have given it an anſwer. Had I treated it with ſilent contempt, I ſhould have hoped that its coming from an Adminiſtration which had ſo deſervedly forfeited the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of every Iriſhman who valued the liberties of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, would have inſured me from ſuffering, in your eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the falſhood and calumny with which it abounds; but my reſpect for thoſe invaluable Cenſors, the Preſs and the Public Opinion, the conſcious integrity of my own heart, and the moſt perfect reliance on the virtue of the cauſe I eſpouſe, prompt me to ſeize any occaſion which affords an opportunity of vindicating it or myſelf from the aſperſions of an Adminiſtration, whoſe heavieſt charge, in their wretched production, is, that at any time of my life I had been the advocate of them or their meaſures. As the whole of the work is one continued iſſue of miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and falſhood, a plain recital of facts will be the beſt means of giving it a full refutation. After the queſtion of Regency, that memorable diſplay of the infamy and principles of the factions of Ireland, ſome of the moſt conſiderable of them were forced into IRISH PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTARY, PATRIOTISM, by being ſtript of the wages of their proſtitution, I accepted a ſeat from my uncle Lord Longueville, in the chimerical hope that this craſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

I earneſtly entreated him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for a Reform of Parliament, and for the freedom of my Catholic countrymen. The thanks which were given me by the delegates of the Catholics of Ireland, for my defence of them and their cauſe, ſo early as 1791, and the vote which I gave for their total emancipation, againſt Lord Longueville and the Government, in the beginning of 1793, gives the lie to the aſſertion of Adminiſtration, that I was not the advocate of Catholic Freedom until my having ſpoke on that ſubject in 1795, and ſo wholly is it unfounded in truth, that I have exerted myſelf in defence of the liberties of my country, becauſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment refuſed me a Commiſſioner's place, that al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Are the people of Ireland ſo weak as to convert a threatened invaſion from France into an expiation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, the crimes and oppreſſion by which the temptation to make it was cauſed? or ſhall an invaſion from France act like magic in changing the preſent ardent affection of the people of Ireland for liberty, into an unbounded diſplay of loyalty to a ſyſtem of corruption and treaſon, by which the moſt happily gifted nation on earth has been made to contain more miſery than any country in the creation? Away with deluſion! Are the people of Ireland ſure that the factions and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who ſo earneſtly preſs them to ariſe to repel the invaſion of France, are not <hi>Invaders themſelves?</hi> Are we ſure that their maſter maker, the Miniſter of Britain, has not inveſted them with enormous funds of corruption to which our wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has been made to contribute. Are we ſure that theſe funds have not been diſtributed amongſt traitors, in the heart of our Iſland, for betraying the induſtry, manufactures and commerce of the people of Ireland, to aggrandize thoſe of Great Britain? Nay, are we not certain that every market in Great Britain is ſhut againſt every ſpecies of Iriſh induſtry, with the ſolitary exception of linen, whilſt every manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of England has free acceſs to every market in Ireland, without any exception whatever? With theſe facts in our view, what Iriſhman can doubt that to ſupport the worſt of invaſions, the invaſion of <hi>Rights and of Commerce,</hi> 15,000 Engliſh and Scotch have not been ſent to invade us already? or can we be certain that the ſhambles of Germany have not been reſorted to, to invade us with more?

But if the exiſting fraternity, my fellow citizens, be the bonds by which you wiſh a connection with Britain, I am not a delegate ſit for your choice; for though I ſtood alone in the Commons of Ireland, I would move the repeal of every law which binds us to England, on thoſe or on any ſuch terms. I will neither be conquered by England or France; nor are we any more bound to a diſadvantageous alliance to one than we are to the other; and before England, the factions of Ireland and the Adminiſtration. I ſpeak it, If it is more the true intereſt of Ireland to form an alliance with France than with England, ſhe is free to adopt it. The jargon of ſtanding or falling with Britain is falſe; in the days that are paſt, we have always been DOWN— it is time we ſhould ſeek to be UP! Rich in a population of 4,000,000 of a healthy intelligent people—rich in her fertile ſoil—rich in her harbours and navigable rivers— rich in her favourable poſition between the old and new worlds —rich in her inſular ſituation, without uſurping dominion over any people upon earth; what intereſt what cauſe, what pretext can the Adminiſtration of Ireland aſſign for the blood and the wealth they have laviſhed, in a war commenced in deſpotiſm, conducted in ignorance, and ending in ruin?
