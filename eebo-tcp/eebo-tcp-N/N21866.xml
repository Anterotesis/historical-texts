            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>IT was to have been foreſeen, that the Treaty which Mr. Jay was charged to negociate with Great-Britain, whenever it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, would have to contend with many perverſe diſpoſitions and ſome honeſt prejudices. That there was no meaſure in which the government could engage ſo little likely to be viewed according to its intrinſic merits—ſo very likely to encounter miſconception, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, and unreaſonable diſlike. For this many reaſons my be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>
               <p>It is only to know the vanity and vindictiveneſs of human nature, to be convinced, that while this generation laſts there will always exiſt among us, men irreconcilable to our preſent national conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—embittered in their animoſity, in proportion to the ſucceſs of its operation, and the diſappointment of their in uſpicious predictions. It is a natural inference from this, that ſuch men will watch with Lynx's eyes for opportunities of diſcrediting the proceedings of the government, and will diſplay a hoſtile and malignant zeal upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion, where they think there are any prepoſſeſſions of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to favor their enterprizes. A treaty with Great-Britain was too fruitful an occaſion not to call forth all their activity.</p>
               <p>It is only to conſult the hiſtory of nations to perceive, that every country at all times, is curſed by the exiſtence of men, who, actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an irregular ambition, ſcruple nothing which they imagine will contribute to their own advancement and importance.—In mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, ſupple courtiers, in republics, fawning or turbulent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues, worſhipping ſtill the idol power wherever placed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the hands of a prince, or of the people, and trafficking in the weakneſſes, vices, frailties, or prejudices of the one or the other. It was to have been expected, that ſuch men, counting more on the paſſions than on the reaſon of their fellow citizens, and anticipating that the treaty would have to ſtruggle with prejudices, would be diſpoſed to make an alliance with popular diſcontent, to nouriſh it, and to preſs it into the ſervice of their particular views.</p>
               <p>It was not to have been doubted, that there would be one or more foreign powers indiſpoſed to a meaſure which accommodated our differences with Great Britain, and laid the foundation of future good underſtanding, merely becauſe it had that effect.</p>
               <p>Nations are never content to confine their rivalſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028795_0004_0FDD499A6904F230"/>
the ſpectacle of that juſt and generous policy, whether in the cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of republics, or of kings, which would diſpoſe one nation in its intercourſes with another, ſatisfied with a due proportion of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and benefits, to ſee that others purſue freely, its true intereſt, with regard to a third; though at the expence of no engagement, nor in violation of any rule of friendly or fair procedure. It was natural that the contrary ſpirit ſhould produce efforts of foreign counteraction to the treaty, and it was certain that the partizans of the counteracting power would ſecond its efforts by all the means which they thought calculated to anſwer the end.</p>
               <p>It was known, that the reſentment produced by our revolution war with Great-Britain had never been entirely extinguiſhed, and that recent injuries had rekindled the flame with additional violence. It was a natural conſequence of this that many ſhould be declined to any amicable arrangement with Great-Britain, and that many others ſhould be prepared to acquieſce only in a treaty which ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent advantages of ſo ſtriking and preponderant a kind, as it was not reaſonable to expect could be obtained, and as under the coercion of ſuch a ſituation could have been, if obtained, but a ſhort lived pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude of a ſpeedy rupture to get rid of them.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately too the ſuppoſition of that ſituation has ſerved to foſter exaggerated expectations, and the abſurd deluſion to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prevails, notwithſtanding the plain evidence to the contrary, which is deducible from the high and haughty ground ſtill maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Great-Britain againſt victorious France.</p>
               <p>It was not to be miſtaken that an enthuſiaſm for France and her revolution throughout all its wonderful viciſſitudes has continued to poſſeſs the minds of the great body of the people of this country, and it was to be inferred, that this ſentiment would prediſpoſe to a jealouſy of any agreement or treaty with her moſt perſevering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor—a jealouſy ſo exceſſive as would give the fulleſt ſcope to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious arts to perplex and miſlead the public opinion. It was well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that a numerous party among us though diſavowing the deſign, becauſe the avowal would defeat it, have been ſteadily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make the United States a party in the preſent Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean war, by advocating all thoſe meaſures which would widen the breach between us and Great-Britain, and by reſiſting all thoſe which could tend to cloſe it; and it was morally certain, that this party would eagerly improve every circumſtance which would ſerve to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the treaty odious, and to fruſtrate it, as the moſt effectual road to their favorite goal.</p>
               <p>It was alſo known before hand that perſonal and party rivalſhips of the moſt active kind, would aſſail whatever treaty might be made, to diſgrace, if poſſible, its organ.</p>
               <p>There are three perſons prominent in the public eye, as the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of the actual Preſident of the United States in the event of his retreat from the ſtation, Mr. Adams, Mr. Jay, Mr. Jefferſon.</p>
               <p>No one has forgotten the ſyſtematic pains which have been taken to impair the well earned popularity of the firſt gentleman. Mr. Jay too has been repeatedly the object of attacks with the ſame view. His friends as well as his enemies anticipated that he could make no treaty which would not furniſh weapons againſt him—and it were to have been ignorant of the indefatigable malice of his adverſaries
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028795_0005_0FDD499BDFF39C78"/>
to have doubted they would be ſeized with eagerneſs, and wielded with dexterity.</p>
               <p>The peculiar circumſtances which have attended the two laſt elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for governor of this ſtate, have been of a nature to give the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt keenneſs to party animoſity. It was impoſſible that Mr. Jay ſhould be forgiven for his double, and in the laſt inſtance triumphant ſucceſs—or, that any promiſing opportunity of detaching from him the public confidence ſhould paſs unimproved.</p>
               <p>Trivial facts frequently throw light upon important deſigns. It is remarkable, that in the toaſts given on the 4th of July, wherever there appears a direct or indirect cenſure on the treaty, it is pretty uniformly coupled with compliments to Mr. Jerfferſon, and to our late governor Mr. Clinton, with an evident deſign to place thoſe gentlemen in contraſt with Mr. Jay, and decrying him to elevate them. No one can be blind to the finger of party ſpirit, viſible in theſe and ſimilar tranſactions. It indicates to us clearly, one powerful ſource of oppoſition to the treaty.</p>
               <p>No man is without his perſonal enemies. Pre-eminence even in talents and virtue is a cauſe of envy and hatred of its poſſeſſor. Bad men are the natural enemies of virtuous men. Good men ſometimes miſtake and diſlike each other.</p>
               <p>Upon ſuch an occaſion as the treaty, how could it happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than <hi>perſonal enmity</hi> would be unuſually buſy, enterpriſing and malignant?</p>
               <p>From the combined operation of theſe different cauſes, it would have been a vain expectation that the treaty would be generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated with candor and moderation, or that reaſon would regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the firſt impreſſions concerning it. It was certain on the contrary that however unexceptionable its true character might be, it would have to fight its way through a maſs of unreaſonable oppoſition; and that time, examination and reflection would be requiſite to fix the public opinion on a true baſis. It was certain that it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the inſtrument of a ſyſtematic effort againſt the national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and its adminiſtration; a decided engine of party to advance its own views at the hazard of the public peace, and proſperity.</p>
               <p>The events which have already taken place, are a full comment on theſe poſitions. If the good ſenſe of the people does not ſpeedily diſcountenance the projects which are on foot, more melancholy proofs may ſucceed.</p>
               <p>Before the treaty was known, attempts were made to prepoſſeſs the public mind againſt it. It was abſurdly aſſerted, that it was not expected by the people, that Mr. Jay was to make any treaty; as if he had been ſent, not to accommodate differences by negociation and agreement, but to dictate to Great-Britain the terms of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>Before it was publiſhed at large, a ſketch, calculated to produce falſe impreſſions, was handed out to the public through a medium noted for hoſtility, to the adminiſtration of the government. Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries flew through the country, ſpreading a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s were every where active to ſeize the paſſions of the citizens and pre-occupy their judgments againſt the treaty.</p>
               <p>At Boſton it was publiſhed one day, and the next a town meeting was convened to condemn it; without ever being read, without any ſerious diſcuſſion, ſentence was pronounced againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028795_0006_0FDD499EC3985190"/>Will any man ſeriouſly believe that in ſo ſhort a time, an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this nature could have been tolerably underſtood by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of thoſe who were thus induced to a condemnation of it? Can the reſult be conſidered as any thing more than a ſudden ebullition of popular paſſion, excited by the artifices of a party, which had adroitly ſeized a favourable moment to ſurprize the public opinion? This ſpirit of precipitation and the intemperance which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, prevented the body of Merchants and the greateſt part of the moſt conſiderate citizens from attending the meeting, and left thoſe who met, wholly under the guidance of a ſet of men, who, with two or three exceptions, have been the uniform oppoſers of the government.</p>
               <p>The intelligence of this event had no ſooner reached New York, than the leaders of the clubs were ſeen haranguing in every corner of the city to ſtir up our citizens into an imitation of the example of the Meeting at Boſton. An invitation to meet at the City Hall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed, not to conſider or diſcuſs the merits of the treaty, but to unite with the meeting at Boſton to addreſs the Preſident againſt its ratification.</p>
               <p>This was immediately ſucceeded by a hand bill, full of invectives againſt the treaty as abſurd as they were inflammatory, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly deſigned to induce the citizens to ſurrender their reaſon to the empire of their paſſions.</p>
               <p>In vain did a reſpectable meeting of the merchants endeavour, by their advice, to moderate the violence of theſe views, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a ſpirit favourable to a fair dicuſſion of the treaty; in vain did a reſpectable body of citizens of every deſcription, attend for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The leaders of the clubs reſiſted all diſcuſſion, and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, by their clamours and vociferations, rendered it impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, notwithſtanding the wiſh of a manifeſt majority of the citizens convened upon the occaſion.</p>
               <p>Can we believe, that the leaders were really ſincere in the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to a diſcuſſion, or that the great and mixed maſs of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens then aſſembled had ſo thoroughly maſtered the merits of the treaty, as that they might not have been enlightened by ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion.</p>
               <p>It cannot be doubted that the real motive to the oppoſition, was the fear of a diſcuſſion; the deſire of excluding light; the adherence to a plan of ſurprize and deception. Nor need we deſire any fuller proof of that ſpirit of party which has ſtimulated the oppoſition to the treaty, than is to be found in the circumſtances of that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>To every man who is not an enemy to the national government, who is not a prejudiced partizan, who is capable of comprehending the argument, and diſpaſſionate enough to attend to it with impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, I flatter myſelf I ſhall be able to demonſtrate ſatisfactorily in the courſe of ſome ſucceeding papers—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the treaty adjuſts in a reaſonable manner the points in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between the United States and Great Britain, as well thoſe depending on the inexecution of the treaty of peace, as thoſe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the preſent European war.</p>

               <p n="6">6. That it violates no treaty with, nor duty toward any foreign power.</p>

               <p n="8">8. That it contains conceſſions of advantages by Great Britain to the United States, which no other nation has obtained from the ſame power.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That it gives her no ſuperiority of advantages over other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with whom we have treaties.</p>

               <p n="11">11.

               <p>PREVIOUS to a more particular diſcuſſion of the merits of the treaty, it may be uſeful to advert to a ſuggeſtion which has been thrown out, namely, that it was foreſeen by many, that the miſſion to Great-Britain would produce no good reſult, and that the event has correſponded with the anticipation.</p>
               <p>The reverſe of this poſition is manifeſtly true.</p>
               <p>All muſt remember the very critical poſture of this country at the time that miſſion was reſolved upon. A recent violation of our rights, too flagrant and too injurious to be ſubmitted to, had filled every American breaſt with indignation, and every prudent man with alarm and diſquietude. A few hoped, and the great body of the community ſcared, that war was inevitable.</p>
               <p>In this criſis two ſets of opinions prevailed, one looked to meaſures which were to have a compulſory effect upon Great-Britain, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration of Britiſh debts, and the cutting off of intercourſe wholly or partially between the two countries; the other to <hi>vigorous prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> for war and <hi>one more effort</hi> of negociation, under the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an extraordinary miſſion, to avert it.</p>
               <p>That the latter was the better opinion, no truly ſenſible man can doubt, and it may be boldly affirmed, that the event has entirely juſtified it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:028795_0008_0FDD49A1E044BE00"/>If meaſures of coertion and repriſal had taken place, war in all human probability would have followed. National pride is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a very intractable thing. In the councils of no country does it act with greater force, than in thoſe of Great Britain. Whatever it might have been in her power to yield to negociation, ſhe could have yielded nothing to compulſion, without ſelf degradation, and without the ſacrifice of that political conſequence which, at all times very important to a nation, was peculiarly ſo to her at the juncture in queſtion. It ſhould be remembered too, that from the relations in which the two countries have ſtood to each other, it muſt have coſt more to the pride of Great Britain to have received the law from us than from any other power.</p>
               <p>When one nation has cauſe of complaint againſt another, the courſe marked out by practice, the opinion of writers, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of humanity, the object being to avoid war, is to precede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſals of any kind, by a demand of reparation. To begin with repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals is to meet on the ground of war and puts the other party in a condition not to be able to recede without humiliation.</p>
               <p>Had this courſe been purſued by us, it would not only have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered war morally certain, but it would have united the Britiſh nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the vigorous ſupport of their government, in the proſecution of it: while on our part, we ſhould have been quickly diſtracted and divided. The calamities of war wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d have brought the moſt ardent to their ſenſes, and placed them among the firſt in reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the government with precipitation, raſhneſs and folly; for not having taken every chance by pacific means to avoid ſo great an evil.</p>
               <p>The example of Denmark and Sweden is cited in ſupport of the coercive plan. Thoſe powers it is aſſerted, by arming and acting with vigour brought Great Britain to terms.</p>
               <p>But who is able to tell us the preciſe courſe of this tranſaction, or the terms gained by it? Has it appeared that either Denmark or Sweden has obtained as much as we have done—a ſtipulation of reparation for the violation of our property contrary to the laws of war?</p>
               <p>Beſides, what did Denmark and Sweden do? They armed and they negociated. They did not begin by retaliations and repriſals. The United States alſo armed and negociated, and like Denmark and Sweden, prudently forebore repriſals. The conduct of the three countries agreed in principle, equally ſteering clear of a precipitate reſort to repriſals, and contradicting the doctrines and advice of our war party.</p>
               <p>The courſe purſued by our government was then in coincidence with the example of Denmark and Sweden—and it may be added was in every view the wiſeſt.</p>
               <p>Few nations can have ſtronger inducements than the United States to cultivate peace. Their infant ſtate in general—their want of a marine in particular, to protect their commerce, would render war in an extreme degree, a calamity. It would not only arreſt our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent rapid progreſs to ſtrength and proſperity, but would probably throw us back into a ſtate of debility and impoveriſhment, from which it would require years to emerge. Our trade, navigation, and mercantile capital would be eſſentially deſtroyed. Spain being an aſſociate with Great Britain, a general Indian war might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028795_0009_0FDD49A6A718AAC0"/>
to deſolate the whole extent of our frontier—our exports obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed agriculture would of courſe languiſh; all other branches of induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would proportionably ſuffer; our public debt inſtead of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual diminution would ſuſtain a great augmentation, and draw with it a large increaſe of taxes and burthens on the people.</p>
               <p>But theſe evils however great, were perhaps, not the worſt to be apprehended. It was to be feared that the war would be conducted in a ſpirit which would render it more than ordinarily calamitous. There are too many proofs that a conſiderable party among us is deeply infected with thoſe horrid principles of Jacobiniſm which proceeding from one exceſs to another have made France a theatre of blood, and which notwithſtanding the moſt vigorous efforts of the national repreſentation to ſuppreſs it, keeps the deſtinies of that country ſuſpended by a thread. It was too probable that the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the war, if commenced would have fallen into the hands of men of this deſcription. The conſequences of this, even in imagination, are ſuch as to make any virtuous man ſhudder.</p>
               <p>It was therefore in a peculiar manner the duty of the government to take all poſſible chances for avoiding war. The plan adopted was the only one which could claim this advantage.</p>
               <p>To precipitate nothing, to gain time by negociation, was to leave the country in a ſituation to profit by any events which might turn up tending to reſtrain a ſpirit of hoſtility in Great Britain, and to diſpoſe her to reaſonable accommodation.</p>
               <p>The ſucceſſes of France which opportunely occurred, allowing them to have had an influence upon the iſſue, ſo far from diſparaging the merit of the plan which was purſued ſerve to illuſtrate its wiſdom. This was one of the chances which procraſtination gave, and one which it was natural to take into the calculation.</p>
               <p>Had the reverſe been the caſe, the poſture of negociation was ſtill preferable to that of retaliation and repriſal; for in this caſe, the triumphs of Great-Britain, the guantlet having been thrown by us, would have ſtimulated her to take it up without heſitation.</p>
               <p>By taking the ground of negociation in the attitude of preparation for war, we at the ſame time carried the appeal to the prudence of the Britiſh cabinet, without wounding its pride, and to the juſtice and intereſt of the Britiſh nation, without exciting feelings of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment.</p>
               <p>This conduct was calculated to range the public opinion of that country on our ſide, to oppoſe it to the indulgence of hoſtile views in the Cabinet, and in caſe of war, to lay the foundation of ſciſm and diſſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>But one of the moſt important advantages to be expected from the courſe purſued, was the ſecuring of unanimity among ourſelves, if, after all the pains taken to avoid war, it had been forced upon us.</p>
               <p>As on the one hand, it was certain that diſſention and diſcontent would have embarraſſed and enfeebled our exertions in a war pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by any circumſtance of intemperance in our public councils, or not endeavored to be prevented by all the milder expedients uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in ſimilar caſes. So, on the other, it was equally certain, that our having ineffectually exhauſted thoſe expedients, would cement us into a firm maſs, keep us ſteady and perſevering amidſt whatever viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicitudes might happen, and nerve our efforts to the utmoſt extent of our reſources.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:028795_0010_0FDD49A7B766C128"/>This union among ourſelves, and diſunion among our enemies, were ineſtimable effects of the moderate plan, if it had promiſed no other advantage.</p>
               <p>But to gain time was of vaſt moment to us in other ſenſes. Not a ſeaport of the United States was fortified, ſo as to be protected againſt the inſults of a ſingle frigate. Our magazines were in every reſpect too ſcantily ſupplied. It was highly deſirable to obviate theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies before matters came to extremity.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the longer we kept out of the war, if obliged to go into it at laſt, the ſhorter would be the duration of the calamities incident to it.</p>
               <p>The circumſtances of the injury of which we more immediately complained afforded an additional reaſon for preceding repriſals by negociation. The order of the ſixth of November directed neutral veſſels to be brought in for <hi>adjudication.</hi> This was an equivocal phraſe, and though there was too much cauſe to ſuſpect that it was intended to operate as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ace.</p>
               <p>To all this it may be added, that one of the ſubſtitutes for the plan purſued, the ſequeſtration of debts, was a meaſure no leſs diſhoneſt than impolitie; as will be ſhewn in the remarks which will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the tenth article of the treaty.</p>
               <p>But is it unimportant to the real friends of republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the plan purſued, was congenial with that pacific character which is aſcribed to it? Would it have been more deſirable that the government of our nation, out-ſtripping the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>However this may be, it is a well aſcertained fact, that our country never appeared ſo auguſt and reſpectable as in the poſition which it aſſumed upon this occaſion. Europe was ſtruck with the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied moderation of our conduct, and the character of our government and nation acquired a new elevation.</p>
               <p>It cannot eſcape an attentive obſerver, that the language, which in the firſt inſtance condemned the miſſion of an Envoy extraordinary to Great-Britain, and which new condemns the treaty negociated by him, ſeems to conſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To under-rate our juſt importance would be a degrading error. To over-rate it may lead to dangerous miſtakes.</p>

               <p>But the true inference is, that we ought not lightly to ſeek or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a reſort to arms; that in the differences between us and other nations we ought carefully to avoid meaſures which tend to widen the breach; and that we ſhould ſcrupulouſly abſtain from whatever may be conſtrued into repriſals till after the fruitleſs employment of all amicable means has reduced it to a certainty that there is no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative.</p>
               <p>If we can avoid war for ten or twelve years more, we ſhall then have acquired a maturity, which will make it no more than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamity, and will authoriſe us in our national diſcuſſions to take a higher and more impoſing tone.</p>

               <p>THE oppoſers of the Treaty ſeem to have put invention on the rack, to accumulate charges againſt it in a great number of caſes, without regard even to plauſibility. If we ſuppoſe them ſincere, we muſt often pity their ignorance; if inſincere, we muſt abhor the ſpirit of deception which it betrays.—Of the prepoſterous nature of ſome of their charges, ſpecimens will be given in the courſe of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks; though while nothing, which is colourable, will remain unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, it were endleſs to attempt a diſtinct refutation of all the wild and abſurd things which are and will be ſaid. It is vain to combat the vagaries of diſeaſed imaginations. The monſters they engender are no ſooner deſtroyed, then new legions ſupply their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Upon this, as upon all former occaſions, the good ſenſe of the people muſt be relied upon, and it muſt be taken for granted, that it will be ſufficient for their conviction to give ſolid anſwers to all ſuch objections as have the ſemblance of reaſon; that now, as heretofore, they will maintain their character abroad and at home, for delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reflection, and diſappoint thoſe who are in the habit of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experiments upon their credulity: who treating them as children, fancy that ſugar plumbs and toys will ſuffice to gain their confidence and attachment and to lead them blindfold, whitherſoever it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <p>In conſidering the treaty, it preſents itſelf under two principal heads; the permanent articles, which are the firſt ten, and which, with ſome ſupplementary proviſions, adjuſt the controverted points between the two countries; the temporary articles, which are all the remaining ones, and which eſtabliſh the principles of mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as to <hi>general</hi> navigation and commerce. The manner of the diſcuſſion will correſpond with this natural diviſion of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>An objection meets the treaty at the threſhhold. It is ſaid that our envoy abandoned the ground which our government had uniformly held, and with it our rights and intereſts as a nation, by acceding, in the preamble of the treaty, to the idea of terminating the differences between the two countries,
<q>in ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a manner as without reference to the merits of their reſpective complaints and pretenſions, may
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028795_0013_0FDD49AF49719A40"/>
be beſt calculated to produce mutual ſatisfaction and good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſerved in ſupport of this, that our government has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly charged the firſt breaches of the treaty upon Great-Britain, in the two particulars of carrying away the negroes, and detaining the poſts, that while the evacuation at New-York was going on, a demand of the ſurrender of the negroes was made by Congreſs, through our Commander in Chief, which not being complied with, Commiſſioners were ſent to aſcertain the number carried away, with a view to claim a compenſation; that early and repeated applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were alſo made for the ſurrender of the Weſtern Poſts, which not only was not done, but it is proved by the circumſtances, that orders were not given for it according to the true intent of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that there was, from the beginning, a deſign to intract, and a virtual infraction of the article with reſpect to this object; all this, it is alledged, has been the uniform language of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and has been demoſtrated by Mr Jefferſon to be true, in his letter to Mr. Hammond, of the 29th of May, 1792; and it is aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the ground ought not to have been given up by Mr. Jay, becauſe it was the ſtandard of the mutual rights and duties of the parties, as to the points unexecuted of the treaty of peace.</p>
               <p>A proper examination of theſe matters is therefore called for, not only by the ſpecific objection which is made to the principle which is contained in the preamble, but by the influence which a right ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is calculated to have, in giving a favorable or unfavorable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion to the whole plan of the adjuſtment.</p>
               <p>It is true, as ſuggeſted, that our government has conſtantly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as breaches of the treaty by Great-Britain, the two particulars which have been ſtated; but it is believed not to be true, that it has uniformly charged them as <hi>firſt</hi> breaches of the treaty. Individuals may have entertained this idea. The ſtate of Virginia ſeems to have proceeded upon it in ſome public acts: but as far as is recollected; that ground was never formally or explicitly taken by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States, till in the above mentioned letter from Mr. Jefferſon to Mr. Hammond, when, for the firſt time, an attempt was made to vindicate or excuſe the whole conduct of this country, in regard to the treaty of peace, contrary, I will venture to ſay, to the general ſenſe of well informed men.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſolemn act of our government on this head is an addreſs of Congreſs to the different States on the 13th of April, 1787.</p>
               <p>This addreſs admits contraventions of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he treaty on our part, and inſtead of deriving either juſtification of extenuation of them from prior infractions by Great-Britain, urges the different ſtates to a repeal of all contravening laws.</p>
               <p>But if the fact, in this reſpect, were admitted to be as ſtated by the adverſaries of the treaty, it would not authoriſe their concluſion.</p>
               <p>It would not follow, that, becauſe the ground had been taken by the government, it ought to have been pert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ouſly kept—if upon fair examination it had appeared to be not ſolid, or if an adherence to it would have obſtructed a reaſonable adjuſtment of oifferences.</p>
               <p>Nations no more than individuals ought to perſiſt in error eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the ſacrifice of their peace and proſperity; beſides, nothing is more common in diſputes between nations, than for each ſide to charge

the other with being the aggreſſor or delinquent. This mutual crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, either from the nature of circumſtances or from the illuſions of the paſſions, is ſometimes ſincere; at other times it is dictated by pride or policy—But in all ſuch caſes where one party is not pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful enough to dictate to the other, and where there is a mutual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What is to be done when the pride of neither will yield to the arguments of the other? War, or a waver of the point, is the alternative. What ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible man, what humane man will deny that a compromiſe, which ſecures ſubſtantially the objects of intereſt, is almoſt always prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to war, on ſo punctilions and unmanageable a point?</p>
               <p>Reject the principle of compromiſe, and the feuds of nations muſt become much more deadly than they have heretofore been. There would ſcarcely ever be ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From the ſituation of the thing, and of the parties, there never could be a rational doubt that the compromiſing plan was the only one on which the United States and Great Britain could ever ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate their differences without war; that the queſtion, who was the firſt delinquent, would have been an eternal bar to accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently that a diſmiſſion of that queſtion was a pre-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to agreement. Had our envoy permitted the negociation to be arreſted by obſtinacy on this head, he would have ſhewn himſelf to be the diplomatic pedant, rather than the able negociator, and would have been juſtly chargeable with ſacrificing to punctilio, the peace of his country. It was enough for him, as he did, to aſcertain by a preliminary diſcuſſion, the impoſſibility of bringing the other party to concede the point.</p>
               <p>An impartial ſurvey of the real ſtate of the queſtion, will ſatisfy candid and diſcerning men, that it was wiſe and politic to diſmiſs it. This ſhall be attempted.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, that two breaches of the treaty of peace are charged upon Great Britain; the carrying away of the negroes, and the detertion of the poſts. It remains to inveſtigate the reality of theſe breaches, and to fix the periods when they can be ſaid to have happened.</p>
               <p>As to the negroes, the true ſenſe of the article in the treaty of peace, which reſpects them is diſputed.</p>
               <p>The words of the ſtipulation are (Art. 7.) that "his Britannic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall, with all convenient ſpeed, and without cauſing any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or carrying away any negroes or other property of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, garriſons and fleets, from the United States."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:028795_0015_0FDD49B60ECD2F40"/>Theſe terms admit of two conſtructions; one, that no negroes, or other articles, which <hi>had been</hi> American property ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, the other, that the evacuations were to be made, <hi>without depredation,</hi> conſequently that no new deſtruction was to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and that negroes or other articles, which at the time of the ceſſation of hoſtilities, <hi>continued to be the property</hi> of American inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, unchanged by the operations of war, ſhould be foreborne to be carried away.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the conſtruction which was adopted by this country, the laſt is that inſiſted upon by great Britain.</p>
               <p>The arguments which ſupport her conſtruction are theſe;</p>
               <p n="1">I. The eſtabliſhed laws of war give to an enemy the <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> during the war, of <hi>real</hi> property, of which he obtains poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the abſolute ownerſhip of all <hi>perſonal</hi> property which falls into his hands. The latter is called <hi>booty,</hi> and, except ſhips, becomes veſted in the captors the moment they acquire a firm poſſeſſion. With regard to ſhips, it ſeems to be a general rule of the marine law, that condemnation is neceſſary to the complete inveſtment of the property in the captor.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Negroes, by the laws of the States, in which ſlavery is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are perſonal property. They therefore, on the principle of thoſe laws, like horſes, cattle, and other moveables, were liable to become booty—and belonged to the enemy as ſoon as they came into his hands. Belonging to him, he was free either to apply them to his own uſe, or to ſet them at liberty. If he did the latter, the grant was irrevocable, reſtitution was impoſſible. Nothing in the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or in thoſe of Great Britain, will authoriſe the reſumption of liberty, once granted to a human being.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The negroes in queſtion were ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her taken in the courſe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary operations, or they joined the Britiſh army upon invitation by proclamation. However diſhonorable to Great Britain the latter may have been as an illiberal ſpecies of warfare, there is no ground to ſay that the ſtrict rules of war did not warrant it, or that the effect was not in the one caſe as well as in the other, a change of property in the thing.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The ſtipulation relates to "negroes or <hi>other property</hi> of the <hi>American</hi> inhabitants;" putting negroes on the ſame ſooting with any other article. The characteriſtic of the ſubject of the ſtipulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>property</hi> of <hi>American</hi> inhabitants, whatever had loſt that character could not be the object of the ſtipulation. But the negroes in queſtion, by the laws of war, had loſt that character; they were therefore not within the ſtipulation.</p>
               <p>Why did not the United States demand the ſurrender of captured veſſels, and of all other moveables which had fallen into the hands of the enemy? The anſwer is, becauſe common ſenſe would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted againſt ſuch a conſtruction. No one could believe that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite ſurrender of all the ſpoils or booty of a ſeven year's war was ever intended to be ſtipulated; and yet the demand for a horſe, or an ox, or a piece of furniture, would have been as comple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly within the terms "negroes and other property," as a negroe—conſequently the reaſoning which proves that one is not included, excludes the other.</p>
               <p>The ſilence of the United States, as to every other article, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028795_0016_0FDD49B791D1A540"/>
a virtual abandonment of that ſenſe of the ſtipulation which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the ſurrender of negroes.</p>
               <p n="5">V. In the interpretation of treaties, things <hi>odious</hi> or <hi>immoral</hi> are not to be preſumed. The abandonment of negroes, who had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to quit their maſters on the faith of official proclamations, promiſing them liberty, to ſail again under the yoke of their maſters, and into ſlavery, is as <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>immoral</hi> a thing as can be conceived. It is odious, not only as it impoſes an act of perfidy on one of the contracting parties; but as it tends to bring back to ſervitude, men once made free. The general intereſts of humanity conſpire with the obligation which Great Britain had contracted toward the negroes, to repel this conſtruction of the treaty, if another can be found</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But another and leſs exceptionable conſtruction is found in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the clauſe as inſerted, for greater caution, <hi>to ſecure evacuations without depr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dation.</hi> It may be anſwered, that this was ſuperfluous, becauſe hoſtilies having ceaſed, the ſtipulation to ſurrender implied of itſelf, that it was to be done without depredation. But, to this the reply is, that a part of the clauſe man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>feſtly contemplates the caſe of new depredations, and provides a guard againſt it, in the promiſe that the evacuations ſhall be made without <hi>cauſing any deſtruction.</hi> To cauſe deſtruction is to do ſome new act of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olence. This reflection deſtroys the argument drawn from the ſuperfluouſneſs of the ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the ſenſe here given to it, and by ſhewing that it muſt have ſuch a ſenſe in one part, authoriſes the concluſion, that the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the clauſe has a ſimilar ſenſe. The connection of the two things, as parts of one ſentence, confirms this inference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe arguments certainly have great weight and do not admit of eaſy refutation. It is a fact too, that the opinions of ſome of the abl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of our country have, from the beginning correſponded with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they enforce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not enough for us to be perſuaded, that ſome of the negociators, who made the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ace, intended the article in our ſenſe. It is neceſſary that it ſhould be found in the inſtrument itſelf, and from the nature of it, ought to have been expreſſed with clearneſs and without ambiguity. If there be real ambiguity in ſuch a caſe, the odiouſneſs of the effect will incline the ſcale againſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It does not remove the difficulty to ſay, that compenſation for the negroes might have been a ſubſtitute for the thing.—When one party promiſes a ſpecific thing to another, nothing but the thing itſelf will ſatisfy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. The party to whom it is made cannot be required to accept in lieu of it an equivalent. It follows, that compenſation for the negroes would not have been a performance of the ſtipulation to forbear to carry them away, and therefore, if there be any thing odious in the ſpecific thing itſelf, the objection to the interpretation which requires it, is not done away by the idea of ſubſtituting compenſation. For the article does not admit ſuch ſubſtitution, and its ſenſe cannot be defined by what it does not admit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some colour to our ſenſe of the article reſults from theſe expreſſions in the ſame clauſe, "leaving in all the fortifications, the American artillery that may be therein." But this expreſſion is not of equivalent force to that of</hi> property of American inhabitants. <hi>For example, ſuppoſe an American ſhip to have been captured and condemned, it might ſtill be ſaid of her, in a certain ſenſe, this is an "American ſhip," alluding to the country of which ſhe had been the ſhip, but it could not be ſaid in any ſenſe of her

               <p>
                  <hi>On the other hand it may be argued, that a preliminary treaty is as much a national treaty as a definitive one both being made by an equal and the competent authority, and that there is no good reaſon why thoſe things which are ſufficiently regulated by the preliminar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Accordingly, there are examples of preliminary treaties going into mutual and full execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though never followed by definitive treaties.</hi>

               <p>

It was incumbent upon Congreſs to have notified the treaty with the proper ſolemnities to the different States and their citizens; to have made the recommendations ſtipulated in the fifth article, &amp; to have enjoined the obſervance of all thoſe things which were promiſed on our part.

               <p>AN accurate enumeration of the breaches of the treaty of peace, on our part, would require a tedious reſearch. It will ſuffice to ſelect and quote a few of the moſt prominent and early inſtances.</p>
               <p>One of the earlieſt is to be found in an act of this ſtate, for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more effectual relief in caſes of certain treſpaſſes, paſſed the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028795_0019_0FDD49D033B53E60"/>
17th of March, 1783. This act takes away from any perſon (ſubjects of Great-Britain of every deſcription included) who had, during the war, occupied, injured, deſtroyed, or received property, real or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, of any inhabitant without the Britiſh lines, the benefit of the plea of a military order: conſequently the juſtification which the laws and uſages of war give, and the immunity reſulting from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal amneſty, which expreſsly or virtually is an eſſential part of every treaty of peace. To this it may be added, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by Great Britain as a direct infraction of the 6th article of her treaty with us, which exempts all perſons from proſecution "by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the part they might have taken in the war."</p>
               <p>Mr. Jefferſon, not controverting the point that the proviſions of this act were contrary to the treaty, endeavours to get rid of the inference from it, by alledging three things.—1ſt. That it paſſed antecedently to the treaty, and ſo could not be a violation of an act of ſubſequent date.—2d. That the treaty was paramount to the laws of the particular ſtates, and operated a repeal of them.—3d. That the exceptionable principle of this act was never ſanctioned by the courts of juſtice, and in one inſtance (the caſe of Rutgers, and Wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington in the Mayor's court) was over-ruled.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt point, it is ſufficient to anſwer, that the law conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to operate, <hi>in fact</hi> from the time of the treaty till the 4th of April, 1787, when there was a repeal of the exceptionable clauſe, by an act of our legiſlature. During the period of four years, many ſuits were brought and many recoveries had; extending even to perſons who had been in the military ſervice of Great Britain.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond point, theſe obſervations may be oppoſed.</p>
               <p>The articles of confederation did not, like our preſent conſtitution, declare that treaties were <hi>ſupreme laws</hi> of the land. The United States, under that ſyſtem, had no courts of their own to expound and enforce their treaties as laws. All was to depend on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative authority of laws and treaties, in the judgment of the ſtate courts.</p>
               <p>The queſtion, whether treaties were paramount to, and a virtual repeal of antecedent laws, was a queſtion of theory, about which there was room for, and in this country did exiſt much diverſity of opinion. It is notorious, that it has been ſtrenuouſly maintained, that however a national treaty ought, in good faith, to be concluſive on a ſtate, to induce a repeal of laws contrary to it, yet its actual laws could not be controverted by treaty, without an actual repeal by its own authority. This doctrine has been emphatically that of the party diſtinguiſhed by its oppoſition to national principles.</p>
               <p>And it is obſervable that Congreſs, not relying entirely upon the force of the treaty, to abrogate contravening laws, in their addreſs already cited, urge the ſtates to a repeal of thoſe laws. It is likewiſe obſervable in reſpect to the very act under conſideration, that the legiſlature of the ſtate, in April, 1787, thought a poſitive repeal of the exceptionable clauſe neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The complaints of a power, whoſe treaty with us was, <hi>in fact,</hi> violated by the operation of a ſtate law, could never be ſatisfactorily anſwered by referring to a <hi>theoretic abſtract diſputed</hi> propoſition. Such a power might reply with irreſiſtable force. It is not for us to concern ourſelves about the ſtructure or meaning of your political
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028795_0020_0FDD49BEF44CBF88"/>
conſtitutions, or the force of the legal maxims deducible from the forms and diſtributions of power which you have adopted for your government. It is <hi>the fact</hi> in which alone we are intereſted—you have ſtipulated <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> to us—your ſtipulation in practice is contravened. It is your duty to ſee that there are no impediments from conflicting authorities within yourſelves, to an exact fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your promiſes. If you ſuffer any ſuch impediment to exiſt, you are anſwerable for the conſequences.</p>
               <p>As to the third point, it is to be obſerved that though there may have been no expreſs formal deciſion of our courts, enforcing the exceptionable principle of the treſpaſs act; yet there never was a deciſion of a ſuperior court againſt it: and it may not be amiſs to remark incidentally, that the deciſion of the Mayor's court, from which Mr. Jefferſon is glad to derive an exculpation of our conduct, was the object of a ſevere animadverſion at a popular meeting in this city, as a judiciary encroachment on the legiſlative authority of the ſtate. The truth on this point is, that according to the prevailing opinion of our bar, a defence under a military order was deſperate, and it was believed that a majority of our ſupreme court bench would overru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the plea. Hence in numerous caſes where it might have been uſed, it was waved; and the endeavour on behalf of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants was either to effect on collateral grounds, a mitigation of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, or to accompliſh the beſt compromiſes that could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; even the ſuit of Rutgers and Waddington, after a partial ſucceſs in the Mayor's court, was terminated by a compromiſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the advice of the defendant's council, owing to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of an unfavourable iſſue in the ſupreme court; and this, notwithſtanding the defendant was a Britiſh ſubject.</p>
               <p>Under theſe circumſtances which are faithfully repreſented, is it poſſible to doubt that the act in queſtion operated a breach of our treaty with Great Britain? and this from the very commencement of its exiſtence? can we reaſonably expect that the nations with whom we have treaties will allow us to ſubſtitute theoretic problems to performances of our engagements, and will be willing to accept them as apologies for actual violations?</p>
               <p>It is pertinent to remark, that the Britiſh commander in chief, very early remonſtrated againſt this act, but the remonſtrance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no effect.</p>
               <p>Another act of the ſtate of New York may be cited as a violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the treaty on our part, which muſt have been nearly cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with that of the detention of the poſts. Its date is the 12th of May, 1784: this act confirms, in expreſs terms, all confiſcations before made, notwithſtanding errors in the proceedings, and takes away the writ of error upon any judgment previouſly rendered.</p>
               <p>This was in ſubſtance, a new confiſcation; judgments which from error were invalid, were nullities. To take away the writ of error, by which their nullity might be eſtabliſhed, was to give them an efficacy which they did not before poſſeſs; and as to the operation, cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the rendering of new judgments. To make voidable acts of confiſcation, valid and concluſive, is equivalent to new acts of confiſcation. A fair execution of the treaty requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that every thing in this reſpect ſhould be left where it was, and forbade the remedying of defects, in former proceedings as much as the inſtitution of new judgments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:028795_0021_0FDD49D449561F18"/>Another, and an unequivocal breach of the treaty is found in an act of South-Carolina, of March 26, 1784. This act ſuſpends the recovery of Britiſh debts for nine months, and then allows them to be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only in four yearly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is idle to attempt to excuſe infractions of this kind, by the pleas of diſtreſs and inability. This is to make the convenience of one party the meaſure of its obligation to perform its promiſes to another. If there was really an impoſſibility of payment, as has been pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there was no need of legiſlative obſtruction; the thing would have regulated itſelf, and the very intereſt of the creditor was a pledge, that no general evil could have reſulted from a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lowing a free courſe to the laws. If ſuch impediments could be juſtified what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments might not be juſtified? What would become of the article, the only one in the treaty to be performed by us, of real conſequence to Great Britain?</p>
               <p>This infraction by South Carolina was prior to that of the detenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the poſts by Great Britain.</p>
               <p>But the caſe of Virginia is ſtill ſtronger than that of South Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. There is evidence which cannot be diſputed, that her courts, in defiance of the treaty, have conſtantly remained ſhut to the recovery of Britiſh debts, in virtue of laws paſſed during the war.</p>
               <p>An act of her general aſſembly of the 22d of June, 1784, after ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting as breaches of the treaty by Great Britain, the carrying off of the negroes, and the detention of the poſts, after inſtructing her dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates in Congreſs to requeſt a remonſtrance to the Britiſh court, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of thoſe infractions, and deſiring reparation, and after declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the national honour and intereſt of the citizens of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth obliged the aſſembly to <hi>withhold their co-operation in the complete fulfilment of the ſaid treaty</hi> until the ſucceſs of the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned remonſtrance is known, of Cong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>That <hi>ſo ſoon</hi> as reparation is made for the foregoing infraction, or Congreſs ſhall judge it indiſpenſably neceſſary, ſuch acts and parts of acts <hi>paſſed during the late war, as inhibit the recovery of Britiſh debts ought to be repealed and payment thereof made in ſuch time and manner as ſhall conſiſt with the exhauſted ſituation of the Common-wealth.</hi>"</p>
               <p>The plain language of theſe reſolutions is, that there were acts paſſed during the war, which then actually inhibited the recovery of Britiſh debts, and that for the removal of this inhibition, a repealing act by the authority of Virginia was neceſſary.</p>
               <p>However unſound this poſition may have been in theory, here is concluſive evidence that the fact in Virginia was conformable to it; that her courts had been, ever ſince the peace, then were, and until a repealing law was paſſed, were likely to continue to be ſhut againſt the recovery of Britiſh debts.—When teſtimony of this kind was urged by the Britiſh miniſter, was it poſſible for our envoy to make any ſolid reply? Who could be ſuppoſed to know better than the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of Virginia the real ſtate of the fact?

it? With what truth has it been aſſerted, that "it was at all times <hi>perfectly underſtood,</hi> that Treaties controuled the laws of the ſtates?"</p>
               <p>Additional proof of the contrary is found in the ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Virginia. On the 12th of December, 1787, that ſtate paſſed an act repealing all ſuch acts or parts of acts of the ſtate, as had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or might prevent the recovery of debts due to Britiſh ſubjects, according to the true intent of the treaty; but with this proviſo, that there ſhould be a ſuſpenſion of the repeal, 'till the governor, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of council had by proclamation, notified that Great Britain had delivered up the poſts, and was taking meaſures for the further ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of the treaty by delivering up the negroes, or by making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for them. This denotes clearly, that in the opinion of the legiſlature of Virginia, there were acts of that ſtate which <hi>had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,</hi> and <hi>might prevent</hi> the recovery of debts according to the treaty.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable too, that the reſolutions of June, 1784, do not even give the expectation of a complete repeal of the impeding laws, in the event of, <hi>or</hi> reparation of the breaches of treaty by Great Britain. They only promiſe ſuch a modification of them as would permit the payment in ſuch <hi>time and manner as ſhould conſiſt with the exhauſted ſituation of the Commonwealth</hi>; that is, not according to the true intent of the treaty, but according to the opinion of the legiſlature of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia of the abilities of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>As the infraction which theſe proceedings of Virginia admit, reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from acts paſſed during the war, it of courſe was coeval with the firſt exiſtence of the treaty of peace, and ſeems to preclude the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of any prior breach by Great Britain. It has been at leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that the detention of the Poſts was not ſuch prior breach, as there was no obligation to ſurrender, till after the exchange of the ratifications of the definitive treaty in England.</p>
               <p>I paſs by the ſerious contraventions of the treaty, in this important article, of the debts which are of later date, becauſe they do not affect the queſtion of the firſt breach, though they are of great weight to demonſtrate the obligation of the United States to make compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>The argument then, upon the whole, as to the queſtion of firſt breach, ſtands thus—It is a great doubt, whether the carrying away of the negroes was at all a breach. If it was one, the treſpaſs act of this ſtate preceded it in date, and went into operation the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was poſſible to iſſue proceſs. The detention of the poſts is ſubſequent to breaches of the article concerning the recovery of debts on our part. This, in the caſe of South Carolina, is determined by the date of her act (March 26, 1784) which is before the exchange of the ratifications of the definitive treaty could have taken place. In that of Virginia, it reſults from her own teſtimony, that impediments to the recovery of Britiſh debts, created by acts paſſed during the war, continued from the firſt moment of the peace until after the year 1787. Or if, contrary to our own interpretation, we are diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adhere to the proviſional treaty, as the act from which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance was to date, we were guilty of a breach, in not acting our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon that treaty; a breach which, being cotemporary with the exiſtence of the treaty, ſeems not to admit of any prior contravention. From all which it follows that, take what ground we will, we muſt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028795_0023_0FDD49D5755388F8"/>
be perplexed to fix the charge of the firſt breach of the treaty upon Great Britain.</p>
               <p>Let the appeal be to the underſtandings and hearts of candid men, men who have force of mind ſufficient to reſcue themſelves from the trammels of prejudice, and who dare to look even unpalatable truths in the face. Let ſuch men pronounce whether they are ſtill ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Great Britain is clearly chargeable with the firſt breaches of the treaty.—Whether they are not, on the contrary, convinced, that the queſtion is one ſo mixed and doubtful, as to render a waver of it, even on the ſcore of intrinſic merits, expedient on our part, and eſpecially whether they can entertain a particle of doubt, that it was wiſer to wave it, than to ſuffer it to prove a final obſtacle to the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a controverſy, on which the peace of their country was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. This was undoubtedly the alternative to our envoy. In the choice he made, the ultimate opinion of an enlightened country cannot fail to applaud his prudence.</p>

               <p>THE diſcuſſion in the two laſt numbers has ſhewn, if I miſtake not, that this country by no means ſtands upon ſuch good ground, with regard to the inexecution of the treaty of peace, as ſome of our official proceedings have advanced, and as many among us have too lightly credited.

Reſerve then would be a crime.—The true patriot who never fears to ſacrifice popularity to what he believes to be the cauſe of public good, cannot heſitate to endeavor to unmaſk the error, though with the certainty of incurring the diſpleaſure and cenſure of the prejudiced and unthinking.</p>
               <p>The diſpoſition to infract the treaty, which in <hi>ſeveral</hi> particulars diſcovered itſelf among us, almoſt as ſoon as it was known to have been made, was from its firſt appearance a ſource of humiliation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and apprehenſion to thoſe who could diſpaſſionately eſtimate the conſequences, and who felt a proper concern for the honour and character of the country.

the experience of extenſive evils may extort regrets which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of an enlightened people ought to avert.</p>
               <p>Citizens of United America! as you value your preſent enviable lot, rally round your own good ſenſe! expel from your confidence, men who have never ceaſed to miſadviſe you! Diſcard intemperate and illiberal paſſions! Aſpire to the glory of the greateſt triumph which a people can gain, a triumph over prejudice! Be juſt, be prudent! Liſten impartially to the unadulterated language of truth! And above all guard your peace with anxious vigilance againſt all the artful ſnares which are laid for it! Accompany me with minds open to conviction, in a diſcuſſion of unſpeakable importance to your welfare!</p>
               <p>Weigh well, as a preliminary to further inveſtigation, this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous propoſition: "Peace, in the particular ſituation of this country, is an object of ſuch great and primary magnitude, that it ought not to be relinquiſhed, unleſs the relinquiſhment be clearly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to preſerve our honour in ſome unequivocal point, or to avoid the ſacrifice of, ſome right or intereſt of material and permanent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance." This is the touchſtone of every queſtion which can come before us, reſpecting our foreign concerns.</p>
               <p>As a general propoſition, ſcarcely any will diſpute it, but in the application of the rule, there is much confuſion of ideas, much falſe feeling and falſer reaſoning. The ravings of anger and pride are miſtaken for the ſuggeſtions of honour. Thus are we told in a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium of rage, by a gentleman of South Carolina, that our envoy ſhould have demanded an <hi>unconditional</hi> relinquiſhment of the Weſtern Poſts, as a right; till which was granted, and until Lord Grenville had given orders to Lord Dorcheſter to that effect, <hi>open to be ſent to our Preſident, to be by him forwarded,</hi> he ſhould not have <hi>opened his lips about the treaty. It was proſtituting the deareſt rights of freemen, and laying them proſtrate at the feet of royalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a caſe of inconteſtible, <hi>mutual</hi> infractions of a treaty, one of the parties is to demand, peremptorily of the other, an <hi>unconditional</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance on his part, by way of preliminary, and without negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. An envoy ſent to avert war, carrying with him the cleareſt indications of a general ſolicitude of his country—that peace might be preſerved, was at the very firſt ſtep of his progreſs to render hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility inevitable, by exacting, not only what could not have been complied with, but what muſt have been rejected with indignation. The government of Great Britain muſt have been the moſt abject on earth, in a caſe ſo ſituated, to have liſtened for a moment to ſuch a demand. And becauſe our envoy did not purſue this frantic courſe; did not hold the language of an imperious Baſhaw to his trembling ſlave, he is abſurdly ſtigmatized as having <hi>proſtrated the rights of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at the feet of royalty.</hi> What are we to think of the ſtate of the mind which could produce ſo extravagant a ſally? Would a prudent people have been willing to have entruſted a negociation which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved their peace to the author of it? Will they be willing to take him as their guide in a critical emergency of their affairs?<note n="*" place="bottom">No man in the habit of thinking well either of Mr. Rutledge's head or heart, but muſt have felt at reading the paſſages of his ſpeech, which have been publiſhed, pain, ſurpriſe, and mortification.

                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:028795_0025_0FDD49D71B3F1518"/>True honour is a rational thing. It is as diſtinguiſhable from Quixotiſm as true courage from the ſpirit of a bravo. It is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for one nation to commit ſo undiſguiſed and unqualified an outrage upon another, as to render a negociation of the queſtion diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But this ſeldom, if ever happens. In moſt caſes it is conſiſtent with honour to precede rupture by negociation, and whenever it is, reaſon and humanity demand it. Honour cannot be wounded by conſulting moderation. As a general rule, it is not till after it has become manifeſt that reaſonable reparation for a clear premeditated wrong, cannot be obtained by an amicable adjuſtment, that honour demands a reſort to arms. In all the queſtions between us and Great-Britain, honour permitted the moderate courſe: in thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the inexecution of the treaty of peace, there had undoubtedly been mutual faults. It was therefore a caſe for negociation and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reparation. True honour, which can never be ſeparated from juſtice, even requires reparation from us to Great-Britain, as well as from her to us. The injuries we complain of in the preſent war were alſo of a negociable kind. The firſt was bottomed on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted point in the laws of nations. The ſecond left open the queſtion, whether the principal injury was a deſigned act of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or a miſconſtruction of its courts. To have taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the imperious ground which is recommended, in place of that which was taken, would have been not to follow the admonitions of honour, but to have ſubmitted to the impulſe of paſſion and phrenzy.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe when it is aſſerted that war is preferable to the ſacrifice of our rights and intereſts, this, to be true, to be rational, muſt be underſtood of ſuch rights and intereſts as are certain, as are impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ſuch as regard the honour, ſecurity, or proſperity of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It is not a right diſputable, or of ſmall conſequence; it is not an intereſt temporary, partial, and inconſiderable, which will juſtify, in our ſituation, an appeal to arms.</p>
               <p>Nations ought to calculate as well as individuals, to compare evils, and to prefer the leſſer to the greater; to act otherwiſe is to act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably; thoſe who counſel it are impoſtors or madmen.</p>
               <p>Theſe reflections are of a nature to lead to a right judgment of the conduct of our envoy in the plan of adjuſtment to which he has given his aſſent.</p>
               <p>Three objects, as has appeared, were to be aimed at, on behalf of the United States: 1. Compenſation for the negroes carried away. 2. Surrender of the weſtern poſts. 3. Compenſation for ſpoliations during the exiſting war.</p>
               <p>Two of theſe objects, and theſe in every view the moſt important, have been provided for—how fitly will be examined hereafter. One of them has been given up (to wit) compenſation for the negroes.</p>
               <p>It has been ſhewn, as I truſt, to the conviction of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>paſſionate men, that the claim of compenſation for the negroes, is in point of right a very doubtful one, in point of intereſt it certainly falls under the deſcription of partial and inconſiderable—affecting in no reſpect the honour or ſecurity of the nation, and incapable of having a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible influence upon its proſperity. The pecuniary value of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is, in a national ſcale, trifling.</p>
               <p>Not having before me the proper document, I can only ſpeak from
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028795_0026_0FDD49C5D58771B0"/>
memory. But I do not fear to be materially miſtaken in ſtating that the whole number carried away, ſo aſcertained as to have afforded evidence for a claim of compenſation, was ſhort of 3000 perſons, men, women, and children, of whom about 1300 were of about 16 years and upwards. Computing theſe at an average of 150 dollars per head, which is a competent price, the amount would be 450,000 dollars, and not two or three millions as has been pretended.</p>
               <p>It is a fact, which I aſſert on the beſt authority, that our envoy made every effort in his power to eſtabliſh our conſtruction of the article relating to this ſubject, and to obtain compenſation, and that he did not relinquiſh it, till he became convinced, that to inſiſt upon it would defeat the purpoſe of his miſſion, and leave the controverſy between the two countries unſettled.</p>
               <p>Finding at the ſame time, that the two other points in diſpute could be reaſonably adjuſted.—Is there any one who will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h enough to affirm, that he ought to have broken off the negociation on account of the difficulty about the negroes? Yes, there are men, who are thus inconſiderate and intemperate! But will a ſober, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting people ratify their ſentence.</p>
               <p>What would ſuch a people have ſaid to our envoy, had he returned with this abſurd tale in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I could have obtained the ſurrender of your poſts, and an adequate proviſion for the reparation of your loſſes by unjuſt captures—I could have termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated your controverſy with Great Britain, and ſecured the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your peace, but for one obſtacle, a refuſal to compenſate for the negroes carried away; on this point the Britiſh government main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a conſtruction of the treaty different from ours, and adhered to it with inflexibility. I confeſs, that there appeared to me much doubt concerning the true conſtruction: I confeſs alſo, that the object was of inconſiderable value. Yet it made a part of our claims, and I thought the hazards of war preferable to a renunciation of it."</p>
               <p>What would his adverſaries have replied to him on ſuch an occaſion? No ridicule would have been too ſtrong, no reproach too bitter.— Their triumph would have been complete: for he would have been deſervedly left without advocate, without apologiſt.</p>
               <p>It cannot admit of a ſeriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> doubt, that the affair of the negroes was too queſtionable in point of right, too inſignificant in point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to have been ſuffered to be an impediment to the immenſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which were to be promoted by an accommodation of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces acceptable in other reſpects.—There was no general principle of national right or policy to be renounced. No conſideration of honour forbid the renunciation, every calculation of intereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to it. The evils of war for one month would outweigh the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, if at the end of it there was a certainty of attainment.</p>
               <p>But was war the alternative? Yes, war or diſgrace.</p>
               <p>The United States and Great-Britain had been brought to iſſue. The recent ſpoliations of our commerce, ſuperadded to the evils of a protracted Indian War, connected with the detention of the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern poſts, and accompanied with indications of a deſign to contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct our weſtern boundaries, obſtructing the courſe of our ſettlements and the enjoyment of private rights, and producing ſerious and growing diſcontent in our weſtern country, rendered it indiſpenſable, that there ſhould be a ſettlement of old differences, and a reparation of new wrongs; or, that the ſword ſhould vindicate our rights.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:028795_0027_0FDD49D8E823D160"/>This was certainly and with reaſon, the general ſenſe of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try when our envoy left it. There are many indications that it was the opinion of our government, and it is to be inferred that our envoy underſtood the alternative to be as has been ſtated.</p>
               <p>Indeed what elſe could be contemplated? after the depredations which had been commited upon our commerce, after the ſtrong ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility which had been diſcovered upon the occaſion in and out of our public councils, after an envoy extraordinary had been ſent to terminate differences and obtain reparation; if nothing had reſulted, was there any cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e but repriſals? ſhould we not have rendered our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ridiculous and contemptible in the eyes of the whole world, by forbearing them.</p>
               <p>It is curious to obſerve the inconſiſtency of certain men. They reprobate the treaty as incompatible with our honour, and yet they affect to believe that an abortion of the negociation would not have led to war. If they are ſincere, they muſt think that national honor conſiſts in perpetually railing, complaining, bluſtering and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting. For my part, much as I deprecate war, I entertain no doubt that it would have been our duty to meet it with deciſion had the negociation failed; that a due regard to our honour, our rights and our intereſts would have enjoined it upon us. Nor would a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimous paſſiveneſs have ſaved us from it. So unſettled a ſtate of things would have led to freſh injuries and aggravations, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances too powerful to be reſiſted, would have dragged us into war. We ſhould have loſt our honor without preſerving our peace. Nations in ſimilar ſituations have no option but to accommodate differences or to fight. Thoſe which have ſtrong motives to avoid war, ſhould by their moderation, facilitate the accommodation of differences. This is a rule of good ſenſe, a maxim of ſound policy.</p>
               <p>But the misfortune is, that men will oppoſe imagination to fact. Though we ſee Great-Britain predominant on the ocean: though we obſerve her pertinaciouſly reſiſting the idea of pacification with France amidſt the greateſt diſcouragements: though we have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed a man whoſe ſagacity and integrity have been hitherto undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and of a character far from flexible, to aſcertain what was practicable: though circumſtances favored his exertions: though much time and pains were beſtowed upon the ſubject: though there is not only his teſtimony, but the teſtimony of other men who were immediately on the ſcene, and in whom there is every reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide, that all was attained which was attainable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet we ſtill permit ourſelves to imagine, that more and better could have been done, and that by taking even now a high and menacing tone, Great-Britain may be brought to our feet.</p>
               <p>Even a ſtile of politeneſs in our envoy has been conſtrued to his diſadvantage. Becauſe he did not miſtake ſtrut for dignity, and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ſpirit; becauſe he did not, by petulance and aſperity, inſiſt the pride of the Britiſh court againſt the ſucceſs of his miſſion, he is repreſented as having humiliated himſelf and his nation. It is forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that mildneſs in the manner, and firmneſs in the thing, are moſt compatible with true dignity, and almoſt always go further than harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtatelineſs.</p>
               <p>Suppoſitions that more could be done by diſplaying what is called, greater ſpirit, are not warranted by facts. It would be extremely
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028795_0028_0FDD49C771B8A340"/>
imprudent on that baſis, to truſt ourſelves to a further experiment—to the immenſe viciſſitudes in the affairs of Europe, which from moment to moment may eſſentially vary the relative ſituations of contending parties. If there ever was a ſtate of things which demanded extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary circumſpection, and forbade a ſpirit of adventure, it is that of the United States at the exiſting juncture, viewed in connection with the preſent very ſingular and incalculable poſture of Europe.</p>
               <p>But it is aſked, to avoid Sylla, may we not run upon Charibdis?— If the treaty ſhould preſerve our peace with Britain, may it not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it with France? I anſwer, that to me there appears no room for apprehenſion. It will be ſhewn in the courſe of the diſcuſſion, that the treaty interferes in no one particular with our engagements to France, and will make no alteration whatever in the ſtate of things between us and her, except as to the ſelling prizes in our ports, which not being required by treaty, was originally permitted merely becauſe there was no law to forbid it, and which being confined to France, was of very queſtionable propriety on the principles of neutrality, and has been a ſource of diſſatisfaction to other belligerent powers. This being the caſe, no cauſe of umbrage is given to France by the treaty,—and it is as contrary to her intereſt as to her inclination, want only to ſeek a quarrel with us. Proſtrate indeed were our ſituation, if we could not, without offending France, make a treaty with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power, which merely tended to extinguiſh controverſy, and to regulate the rules of commerical intercourſe, and this not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating any duty to France but without giving any preference to another. It is aſtoniſhing that thoſe who affect ſo much nicety about national honour, do not feel the extreme humilation of ſuch an idea. As to the denomination of Alliance with Great-Britain, which has been given to the treaty, it is an inſult to the underſtandings of the people, to call it by ſuch a name. There is not a tittle of it that warrants the appellation.</p>

               <p>THERE is one more objection to the treaty for what it does not do, which requires to be noticed. This is an omiſſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt the impreſſment of our ſeamen.</p>
               <p>It is certain that our trade has ſuffered embarraſſments in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and that there have been abuſes which have operated very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſively upon our ſeamen, and all will join in the wiſh that they could have been guarded againſt in future by the treaty.</p>
               <p>But it is eaſier to deſire this, than to ſee how it could have been done. A general ſtipulation againſt the impreſſment of our ſeamen would have been nugatory, if not derogatory. Our right to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption is perfect by the laws of nations, and a contrary right is not even pretended by Great Britain. The difficulty has been and is to fix a rule of evidence, by which to diſcriminate our ſeamen from theirs, and by the diſcrimination to give ours protection, without covering theirs in our ſervice It happens that the two nations ſpeak
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028795_0029_0FDD49D9F68E2FC0"/>
the ſame language, and in every exterior circumſtance cloſely reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble each other; that many of the natives of Great Britain and Ireland are among our citizens, and that others without being properly our citizens, are employed in our veſſels.</p>
               <p>Every body knows, that the ſafety of Great Britain depends upon her marine. This was never more emphatically the caſe, than in the war in which ſhe is now engaged. Her very exiſtence, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent power, ſeems to reſt on a maritime ſuperiority.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, can we be ſurpriſed that there are difficulties in bringing her to conſent to any arrangement which would enable us by receiving her ſeamen into our employment, to detain them from her ſervice? Unfortunately there can be deviſed no method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting our ſeamen which does not involve that danger to her. Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and appearance, inſtead of being a guide as between other nations, are between us and Great Britain, ſources of miſtake and deception. The moſt familiar experience in the ordinary affairs of ſociety, proves, that the oaths of parties intereſted, cannot be fully relied upon. Certificates of citizenſhip, by officers of one party, Would be too open to the poſſibility of colluſion and impoſition, to expect that the other would admit them to be concluſive. If incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, there muſt be a diſcretion to the other party which would deſtroy their efficacy.</p>
               <p>In whatever light the matter may be viewed, there will be found an intrinſic difficulty in deviſing a rule of evidence ſafe for both parties, and conſequently, in eſtabliſhing one by treaty. No nation would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily admit a rule which would make it depend on the good faith of another, and the integrity of its agents, whether her ſeamen in time of war, might be withdrawn from her ſervice, and transferred to that of a neutral power. Such a rule, as between, Great Britain and us, would be peculiarly dangerous, on account of the circumſtances, which facilitate a tranſfer of ſeamen from one party to another. Great Britain has accordingly perſeveringly declined any definitive arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the ſubject; notwithſtanding earneſt and reiterated efforts of our government.</p>
               <p>When we conſider candidly the peculiar difficulties which various circumſtances of ſimilitude, between the people of the two countries, oppoſe to a ſatisfactory arrangement, and that to the belligerent party, it is a queſtion of <hi>national ſafety,</hi> to the neutral party a queſtion of commercial convenience, and individual ſecurity, we ſhall be the leſs dipoſed to think the want of ſuch a proviſion as our wiſhes would dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, a blemiſh in the treaty.</p>
               <p>The truth ſeems to be, that from the nature of the thing, it is matter of neceſſity to leave it to occaſional and temporary expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents—to the effect of ſpecial interpoſitions from time to time, to procure the correction of abuſes; and if the abuſe becomes intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>ultima ratio</hi>; the good faith of the parties, and the motives which they have to reſpect the rights of each other, and to avo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d cauſes of offence, and vigilance in noting and remonſtrating againſt the irregularities which are committed, are probably the only peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſecurities of which the caſe is ſuſceptible.</p>
               <p>Our miniſter plenipotentiary Mr. Pinckney, it is well known, has long had this matter in charge, and has ſtrenuouſly exerted himſelf to have it placed upon ſome acceptable footing; but his endeavours
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028795_0030_0FDD49C8C9897F70"/>
have been unſucceſsful, further than to mitigate the evil by ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional checks, and by drawing the attention of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the obſervance of more caution. A more ſenſible effect of our reprenſentations, has been lately experienced; and with attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vigilance, that effect may be continued, and perhaps increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But there is reaſon to fear that it will be conſtantly found im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable to eſtabliſh an efficacious conventional guard.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to the examination of the ſeveral articles in the treaty, in the order in which they ſtand.</p>
               <p>The firſt contains merely a general declaration that there ſhall be peace and friendſhip between the contracting parties, the countries and people of each, without exception of perſons of places.</p>
               <p>One would have imagined that this article, at leaſt, would have eſcaped a formal objection; however it might have been ſecretly viewed as the moſt ſinful of all, by thoſe who pant after war and enmity between the two countries. Nothing but the fact could have led to a ſurmiſe, that it was poſſible for it to have been deemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable; and nothing can better diſplay the rage for objection, which actuates the adverſaries of the treaty, than their having invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one againſt ſo innocent a proviſion.</p>
               <p>But the committee appointed by a meeting at Charleſton (S. C.) have ſagaciouſly diſcovered, that this article permits "the uncondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional return to our country of all perſons who were proſcribed dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late war."</p>
               <p>With all, but men determined to be diſſatisfied, it would be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient anſwer to ſuch an objection to ſay, that this article to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula in almoſt every treaty on record and that the conſequence attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to it was never before dreamt of, though other nations beſides ourſelves have had their proſcriptions and their ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhments.</p>
               <p>But this is not all—our treaty of peace with Great Britain in 1783, has an equivalent ſtipulation in theſe words, (article 6) "there ſhall be a firm and perpetual peace between his Britannic majeſty and the ſaid ſtates, and between the ſubjects of the one, and the citizens of the other." In calling this an equivalent ſtipulation, I ſpeak with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the objection which is made.</p>
               <p>The argument to ſupport that objection would be to this effect; "Exiles and criminals are regarded as within the peace of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but the people of each are, by this article, placed within the peace of the other; therefore proſcribed perſons are reſtored to the peace of the United States, and ſo loſe the character of exiles and criminals. Hence the argument will turn upon the word "peace"— the word friendſhip will have no influence upon the queſtion. In other reſpects there is no difference, in ſubſtance, between the two articles. For the terms "people," "ſubjects," "citizens," as uſed in the two treaties, are ſynonimous. If therefore, the laſt treaty ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulates that there ſhall be peace between the governments, countries, and people of the two nations, the firſt ſtipulates what is equivalent, that there ſhall be peace between the two governments and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and citizens of each. The additional words, without exception of perſons and places, can make no difference, being merely ſurplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. If A ſays to B, "I give you all the money in this purſe," the gift is as complete as if he had ſaid, "I give you all the money in this purſe, without exception of a ſingle dollar."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:028795_0031_0FDD49DEAF9F7F70"/>But the object of the ſtipulation, and the ſubject of the objection, have no relation to each other. National ſtipulations are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the ſenſe of the laws of nations. Peace, in the ſenſe of thoſe laws defines a ſtate which is oppoſite to war. Peace, in the ſenſe of the municipal laws, defines a ſtate which is oppoſite to criminality. They are conſequently different things, and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Great Britain, by committing a crime, may put himſelf out of the peace of our government, in the ſenſe of our municipal laws, while there might be perfect peace with him, in the ſenſe of the laws of nations, and <hi>vice verſa,</hi> there might be war wiſh him in the ſenſe of the laws of nations, and peace in that of the municipal laws.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment of a ſubject of Great Britain as a felo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, would certainly not conſtitute a ſtate of war between the parties, nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the peace which is ſtipulated by this article; though it is declared that it ſhall be <hi>inviolable,</hi> and might as well be affirmed to prevent the puniſhment of future, as of former criminals.</p>
               <p>But who in the contemplation of the laws of the reſpective ſtates, are the proſcribed perſons? They muſt have been underſtood to have been ſubjects or citizens of the ſtates which proſcribed them—conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot be preſumed to be comprehended in an article which ſtipulates peace between the nations and their reſpective citizens.</p>
               <p>This is not a ſtipulation of peace between a nation and its own citizens; nor can the idea of expatriation be admitted to go ſo far as to deſtroy the relation of citizen as it regards amenability for a crime. To this purpoſe, at leaſt, the offender muſt remain a citizen.</p>
               <p>There can hardly have been a time when a treaty was formed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two nations, when one or the other had not exiled criminals or fugitives from juſtice, which it would have been unwilling to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Yet this was never deemed an obſtacle to the article, nor has an immunity from puniſhment ever been claimed under it, nor is there the leaſt ground to aſſert that it might be claimed under it.</p>
               <p>It follows that the objection which has been taken to this article is wholly without foundation. It is humiliating to the human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or diſreputable to the human heart, that ſimilar objections ſhould come from ſenſible men—it is diſguſtful to have to refuſe them. The regard I feel for ſome of thoſe who have brought it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, makes it a painful taſk.

               <p>THE ſecond article of the treaty ſtipulates that his Britannic majeſty will withdraw, all his troops and garriſons from all <hi>paſts</hi> and <hi>places</hi> within the boundary lines aſſigned by the treaty of peace to the United States; and that this evacuation ſhall take place on or before the firſt day June 1796; The United States in the mean time <hi>at their diſcretion,</hi> extending their ſettlements to any part within the ſaid boundary line, <hi>except within the precincts or juriſdictions</hi> of any of the ſaid poſts—that all ſettlers or traders within the precincts or juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the ſaid poſts, ſhall continue to enjoy, unmoleſted, all their property of every kind, and ſhall be protected therein; that they ſhall be at liberty to remain there, or to remove with all or any part of their effects; alſo to ſell their lands, houſes or effects, or to retain the property thereof at their diſcretion, that ſuch of them as ſhall continue to reſide within the ſaid boundary lines, ſhall not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to become citizens of the United States, but ſhall be at liberty to do ſo if they think proper, making and declaring their election within a year after the evacuation, and that thoſe who ſhould continue after the expiration of a year without having declared their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of remaining ſubjects of his Britannic Majeſty, ſhall be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as having elected to become citizens of the United States.</p>
               <p>This article which accompliſhes a primary object of our envoy's miſſion, and one of primary importance to the United States, has been as much clamoured againſt as if it had made a formal ceſſion of the poſts to Great Britain. On this point an uncommon degree of art has been exerted, and with no ſmall ſucceſs. The value of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing obtained has been put out of ſight by miſrepreſentations of incidental circumſtances.</p>
               <p>But the fact is nevertheleſs, that an object has been accompliſhed, of vaſt conſequence to our country. The moſt important <hi>deſidera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> in our concerns with foreign powers are, the poſſeſſion of the Weſtern poſts, and a participation in the navigation of the river Miſſiſſippi. More or fewer of commercial privileges are of vaſtly inferior mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The force of circumſtances will do all we can reaſonably wiſh in this reſpect, and in a ſhort time, without any ſteps that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſe our trade or endanger tranquility, will carry us to our goal.</p>
               <p>The recovery of our Weſtern Poſts will have many important ſides. It will extinguiſh a ſource of controverſy with Great Britain, which at a period, not diſtant, muſt have inevitably involved the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in war, and the thing was becoming every day, more and more urgent. It will enable us effectually to controul the hoſtilities of the northern and weſtern Indians, and in ſo doing will have a material influence on the ſouthern tribes. It will therefore tend to reſcue the country from what is at preſent its greateſt ſcourge, INDIAN WARS. When we conſider that theſe wars have, for four years paſt, taken an extra million annually from our revenue; we cannot be inſenſible of the importance of terminating that ſource of expence. This milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>The advantages of the recovery of the Poſts do not ſtop here; an extenſion of trade is to be added to the catalogue. This however need only be mentioned at this time as it will come again into view in conſidering the third article.</p>
               <p>But two conſequences, not commonly adverted to, require particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice in this place.</p>
               <p>There is juſt ground of ſuſpicion, corroborated by various concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring circumſtances, that Great Britain has entertained the project of contracting our boundaries to the Ohio. This has appeared in Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da—at the Britiſh garriſons—at the Indian towns—at Philadelphia, and at London. The ſurrender of the poſts for ever cuts up by the roots, this pernicious project. The whole of our weſtern intereſts are immediately and deeply concerned in the queſtion.</p>
               <p>The harmonious, and permanent connection of our weſtern with our Atlantic country, materially depends on our poſſeſſion of the Weſtern poſts. Already had great diſcontent been engendered in that country by their detention. That diſcontent was increaſing and rankling daily. It was actually one of the aliments of the inſurrection in the weſtern parts of Pennſylvania. While the poſts remained in the hands of Great Britain, dangerous tamperings with the inhabitants of that country were to be apprehended—a community of views be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great Britain and Spain might have taken place, and by force and ſeduction,events formidable to our general union might have been hazarded. The diſſolution or prevention of this community of views, is a point of the greateſt moment in our ſyſtem of national policy. It preſſes us to terminate differences, to extinguiſh miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with Great Britain; it urges us to improve the favourable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtamps with the charge of madneſs, the efforts to let go the hold which the treaty, if mutually ratified, would give us.</p>

To ſuch a man, the queſtion may be confidently put<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is there any thing in the treaty conceded by us to Great Britain, to be placed in competition with this ſingle acquiſition? The anſwer could not fail to be in the negative.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid by way of objection, that admitting the poſts will be ſurrendered at the time ſtipulated, it is no acquiſition by this treaty; it is only the enjoyment of a right which was ſecured by the treaty of peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:028795_0034_0FDD49CBE2778450"/>With as much good ſenſe might it be ſaid, that the ſtipulation of reparation for the ſpoilations of our property, or even immediate actual reparation, if it had been obtained, was nothing gained; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the laws of nations gave us a right to ſuch reparation; and it might in this way be proved to have been impoſſible for our envoy to have effected any thing uſeful or meritorious.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee what is the real ſtate of the caſe. Great-Britain had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by the treaty of peace, to ſurrender the Weſtern Poſts <hi>with all covenient ſpeed</hi>; but without fixing a preciſe time. For the cauſe, or on the pretext of our not having complied with the treaty on our part, eſpecially, in not removing the impediments which the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent laws of particular ſtates, oppoſed to the recovery of Britiſh debts, ſhe delayed, and afterwards refuſed to make the ſurrender; and when our envoy left this country, there was too much appearance of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention on her part to detain them indefinitely, and this, after having actually kept them ten years. The treaty of peace was conſequently in this particular ſuſpended, if not ſuperceded. It was either to be reinſtated by a new agreement, or enforced by arms. The firſt our envoy has effected; he has brought Great-Britain to abandon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and to fix a preciſe determinate time when at fartheſt the poſts are to be delivered up. It is therefore to this new agreement, that we ſhall owe the enjoyment of them, and it is of courſe, entitled to the merit of having obtained them; it is a poſitive ingredient in its value, which cannot be taken from it; and it may be added, that this is the firſt time that the merit of procuring, by negociation, <hi>reſtitution</hi> of a <hi>right witheld,</hi> was ever denied to the inſtrument which procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>But it is objected, that as much has not been done as might have been done; that reſtitution of the poſts has not been procured, but only a promiſe to reſtore them at a remote period, in exchange for a former promiſe, which had been violated. That there is no good ground of reliance upon the fulfilment of this new promiſe, for the performance of which there ought to have been ſome ſurety or gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee—that the reſtitution of the poſts ought to have been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with indemnification for the detention, and for the expences of the Indian wars which have been occaſioned by that detention, and by the inſtigations of Britiſh intrigue—that it was better to go to war than to relinquiſh our claim to ſuch indemnification; or if our preſent circumſtances did not recommend this, it was better to wait till it was more convenient to us to enforce our claim, than to give it up. Theſe are the declamations by which this part of the treaty is arraigned. Let us ſee, if they are the random effuſions of enthuſiaſm, or the rational dictates of ſound policy.</p>
               <p>As to the ſuggeſtion, that more might have been done than was done, it muſt of neceſſity be mere conjecture and imagination. If the picture given of the ſituation of Great-Britain, was better juſtified by facts, than it is, it would not follow that the ſuggeſtion is true; for the thing would depend not on the real ſituation of that country, but on the opinion entertained of it by its own adminiſtration, on the perſonal character of the prince and of his council; on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree by which they were influenced by pride and paſſion, or by reaſon. The hypotheſis, that the diſpoſitions of a government are conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with its ſituation, is as fallacious a one as can be entertained. It
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028795_0035_0FDD49E180E873D0"/>
is to ſuppoſe, contrary to every day's experience, that cabinets are always wiſe. It is on the part of thoſe who draw the inference, to ſuppoſe, that a cabinet, the moſt violent, raſh, and fooliſh, of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, is at the ſame time moderate and prudent enough to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true ſituation of the country.—Who of our enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts, reaſoning from his view of the abaſed condition of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This, if offered only to ſhew that there is no probability that the enemies of France can ſucceed in the original objects of the war againſt her, or can diveſt her of her acquiſitions on the continent, has all the force that may be deſired to be given to it, but when it is uſed to prove that the ſituation of Great Britain is ſo deſperate and humbled as to oblige her to receive from France, or the United States, any conditions which either of them may think fit to impoſe; the argument is carried infinitely too far. It is one thing for a country to be in a poſture not to receive the law from others, and a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing for her to be in a ſituation which obliges others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the law from her, and what is ſtill ſtronger, from all her friends. France evidently cannot annoy Ruſſia—ſhe can, with great difficulty, from their geographical poſition, make any further acquiſitions upon the territories of Auſtria.—Britain and her poſſeſſions are eſſentially ſafe, while ſhe maintains a decided maritime ſuperiority.—As long as this is the caſe, even ſuppoſing her abandoned by all her allies, ſhe never can be in the ſituation which is pretended by the oppoſers of the treaty.</p>
               <p>But in deſcribing the ſituation of France, only one ſide of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal is preſented.—There is another ſide far leſs flattering, and which in order to a juſt concluſion, muſt be impartially viewed.</p>
               <p>If the allies of Great Britain are fatigued and exhauſted, France cannot be in a better condition. The efforts of the latter, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to intrinſic reſources, have no doubt been much greater than thoſe of the former. It is a conſequence from this, phyſically certain, that France muſt be ſtill more fatigued and exhauſted even than her adverſaries. Her acquiſitions cannot materially vary this concluſion; the low countries, long the theatre of the war, muſt have been pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well emptied before they fell into her hands. Holland is an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial power—her life and ſtrength were in her credit—this periſhed with her reduction. Accordingly the ſuccours extracted from her compared with the ſcale of the war, have been inſignificant.</p>
               <p>As to the true poſition of France, we are not left to mere infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>All the official reports, all the private accounts from thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a ſtate of extreme embarraſſment and diſtreſs: an alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing derangement of the finances, and a ſcarcity not diſtant from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. To this are to be added, a continuance of violent and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conflicts of parties, and the unextinguiſhed embers of inſurrection.</p>
               <p>This fair compariſon of the relative ſituation of the contending parties will, I know, be ſtigmatized as blazoning the ſtrength and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of Great-Britain, and depreciating the advantages of France.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028795_0037_0FDD49E32B7C2FD8"/>
But the cant phraſes of party cannot alter the truth—nor will they prevent the people of the United States from liſtening impartially to it, or from diſcerning that it is a mark of fidelity to their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts to counteract miſrepreſentation, by placing facts fairly before them, and a duty which they cannot omit to perform without betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own intereſts, to receive them candidly, and weigh them maturely.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is, that all thoſe highly charged declamations which deſcribe Great-Britain to us as vanquiſhed and humbled; as ready to paſs under the yoke at our command, and to ſubmit to any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we may think fit to preſcribe, are either the chimeras of over heated imaginations, or the fabrications of impoſture; and if liſtened to, can have no other effect than to inſpire a deluſive preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a dangerous temerity.</p>
               <p>But to judge the better of the extravagance of theſe declamations, it will be uſeful to go back to the periods when the negociation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and ended. Our envoy arrived in England and entered upon the buſineſs of his miſſion, at the moment when there was a general ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on account of the naval victory gained by Lord Howe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to thoſe important ſucceſſes which have terminated in the conqueſt of Holland; and the treaty was concluded by the 19th of Nov. laſt, prior to the laſt mentioned event, and to the defection of the king of Pruſſia. The poſture of things at the time it was in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, and not at this time, is the ſtandard by which to try its merits; and it may be obſerved, that it is probable the negociation received its firſt impreſſion, and even its general out line anterior to the principal part of the diſaſters ſuſtained by the coaleſced powers in the courſe of the laſt campaign.</p>
               <p>It may not be improper to add, that if we credit the repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our envoy Great Britain manifeſted ſimilar diſpoſitions with regard to the treaty at the commencement as at the cloſe of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation: whence it will follow, that too much has been attributed, in this country to the victories of France.</p>

               <p>The fact was, that our envoy preſſed an early evacuation of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028795_0038_0FDD49CEC6801FA0"/>
Poſts; but there was an inflexible adherence on the other ſide to the term limited in the treaty. The reaſons underſtood to have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for it, were to this effect, viz. That according to the courſe of the Indian trade, it was cuſtomary to ſpread thro the nations, goods to a large amount, the returns for which, could not be drawn into Canada, in a ſhorter period than was propoſed to be fixed for the evacuation; that the impreſſion which the ſurre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is ground to believe that there were repreſentations on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Canada traders, alledging a longer term than that which was adopted in the treaty, to be neceſſary to wind up and adapt their arrangements to the new ſtate of things; and that the term ſuggeſted by them was abridged ſeveral months. And it may not be uſeleſs to obſerve, as explanatory of the reaſons given, that in fact it is the courſe of the trade to give long credits to the Indians, and that the returns for goods furniſhed in one year, only come in the next year.</p>
               <p>What was to be done in this caſe? Was the negociation to break off o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The conſequence of breaking off the negociation has been ſtated. No reaſonab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e man will doubt that delay was preferable to war if there be good ground of reliance, that the ſtipulation will be fulfilled at the appointed time.—Let us calmly examine this point.</p>
               <p>The argument againſt it is drawn from the breach of the former promiſe. To be authoriſed to preſs this argument, we ought to be ſure that all was right on our part.—After what has been offered on this ſubject, are we ſtill convinced that this was the caſe? Are we able to ſay that there was nothing in our conduct which furniſhed a ground for that of Great Britain? Has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t not been ſhewn to be a fact that, from the arrival of the proviſional articles in this country, till after the ratification here of the definitive treaty, acts of ſtates inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the recovery of Britiſh debts and other acts militating againſt the treaty, continued in operation? Can we doubt that ſubjects of Great Britain, affected by theſe acts, carried complaints to the ears of their government? Can we wonder if they made ſerious impreſſions there, if they produced diſſatisfaction and diſtruſt? Is it very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary if they excited the idea of detaining the poſts as a pledge, till there were better indications on our part? Is it ſurpriſing if the continuance of theſe acts and the addition of others which were new and poſitive breaches of the treaty, prolonged the detention of the Poſts?—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:028795_0039_0FDD49E4C716F100"/>In fine, was the delay in ſurrendering ſo entirely deſtitute of cauſe, ſo unequivocal a proof of a perfidious character, as to juſtify the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that no future dependance can be made on the promiſes of the Britiſh government? Diſcerning men will not haſtily ſubſcribe to this concluſion.</p>
               <p>Mutual charges of breach of faith are not uncommon between na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: yet this does not prevent their making new ſtipulations with each other, and relying upon their performance. The argument from the breach of one promiſe, if real, to the breach of every other, is not ſupported by experience, and if adopted as a general rule would multiply, infinitely the impediments to accord and agreement among nations.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that though nations will too often evade their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes on colourable pretexts, yet few are ſo profligate as to do it without ſuch pretexts. In clear caſes, ſelf intereſt dictates a regard to the obligations of good faith: nor is there any thing in the hiſtory of Great Britain which warrants the opinion that ſhe is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful than other nations of her character for good faith.</p>
               <p>Yet ſhe muſt be ſo, and in an extreme degree, if ſhe be capable of breaking, without real cauſe, a <hi>ſecond</hi> promiſe on the <hi>ſame</hi> point, after the termination by a new treaty of an old diſpute concerning it, and this too on the baſis of mutual reparation. It would indicate a deſtitution of principle, a contempt of character, much beyond the uſual meaſure, and to an extent which it may be affirmed is entirely improbable.</p>
               <p>It is a circumſtance of ſome moment in the queſtion, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond promiſe is free from the vagueneſs of the firſt, as to the time of execution—It is not to be perfomed <hi>with all convenient ſpeed,</hi> but by a day certain, which cannot be exceeded. This would give point to violation and render it unequivocal.</p>
               <p>Another argument againſt the probability of performance has been deduced from the ſuppoſed deficiency of good reaſons for the delay, which is repreſented as evidence of want of ſincerity in the promiſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides the reaſons which were aſſigned for that delay, there are others that may be conjectured to have operated, which it would not have been equally convenient to avow, but which ſerve to explain the delay different from the ſuppoſition of its having been calculated for ultimate evaſion. If, as we have with too much cauſe ſuſpected, Great-Britain, or her Repreſentative in Canada, whether with or without orders, has really countenanced the hoſtilities of the Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern Indians, it was to be expected that ſhe would think it incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon her to give them ſufficient time to make peace before an evacuation of the Poſts ſhould put them entirely in our power. She might otherwiſe have provoked them to hoſtilities againſt her own ſettlements, and have kindled in their minds, inextinguiſhable reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It was not certain how ſoon a peace would be brought about, and it might be ſuppoſed, that the diſpoſition to it on our part might be weakened or ſtrengthened by the proximity or remoteneſs of the period of the ſurrender. Moreover, ſome conſiderable time might be requiſite to prepare theſe eſtabliſhmments for the ſecurity of Canada, which the relinquiſhment of the Poſts would be deemed to render neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The latter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> not juſtly objectionable: the former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028795_0040_0FDD49E62A891D48"/>
an embarraſſment reſulting from a culpable policy, which was intitled to no indulgence from us, but which, nevertheleſs, muſt have had a pretty imperious influence on the conduct of the other party, and muſt have created an obſtacle to a ſpeedy ſurrender not eaſy to be ſurmounted. Taken together, we find in the reaſons aſſigned, and in thoſe which may be preſumed to have operated, a ſolution of the pertinacity of Great Britain on the ſubject of time, without impeaching on that account, the ſincerity of the promiſe to ſurrender.</p>
               <p>But we have very ſtrong holds for the performance of this promiſe upon the intereſt of Great Britain: 1ſt. The intereſt which every nation has in not entirely forfeiting its reputation for honor and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. 2d. The intereſt which reſults from the correlative ſtipulation with regard to the indemnification for the Britiſh debts, a point upon which there will be no inconſiderable mercantile ſenſibility. 3d. The intereſt of pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rving peace with this country, the interruption of which, after all that has paſſed, could not fail to attend the non-ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the Poſts at the ſtipulated time.</p>
               <p>It is morally certain that circumſtances will every day add ſtrength to this laſt motive.—Time has already done much for us and will do more. Every hour's continuance of the war in Europe muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arily add to the inconveniences of a rupture with this country, and to the motives which Great Britain muſt feel to avoid an increaſe of the number of her enemies, to deſire peace, and if obtained, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
               <p>The enemies of the treaty, upon their own calculations, can hardly diſpute, that if the war continues another year after the preſent the probable ſituation of Great Britain will be a complete ſecurity for her compliance with her promiſe to ſurrender the poſts. But let us ſuppoſe that a general peace takes place in Europe this winter, what may then be the diſpoſition of Great Britain in June next, as to war or peace with this country?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that the ſituation will be of all others that which is moſt likely to indiſpoſe her to a war with us. There is no juncture, at which war is more unwelcome to a nation, than immediately after the experience of another war, which has required great exertions, and has been expenſive, bloody and calamitous. The minds of all men then dread the renewal of ſo great an evil, and are diſpoſed rather to make ſacrifices to peace than to plunge afreſh into hoſtilities. The ſituation of Great Britain at the end of the war in which ſhe is now engaged, is likely to be the moſt diſcouraging that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to the provocation of new wars. Here we may diſcover a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ſecurity for the performance of her ſtipulations.</p>
               <p>As to the idea of a guarantee or ſurety for the fulfilment of the promiſe, it cannot be ſeriouſly believed that it was obtainable. It would have been an admiſſion of the party that there was a well founded diſtruſt of its faith. To conſent to it, therefore, would have been to ſubſcribe to its own humiliation and diſgrace, the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of which has been ſhewn to be ridiculous.</p>
               <p>But why was there not equally good reaſon that we ſhould have given a guarantee or ſurety for the performance of our new promiſe with regard to the debts? And if there was to have been reciprocity, where ſhould we have conveniently found that guarantee or ſurety?
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028795_0041_0FDD4A1D77642148"/>
Should we have thought it very reputable to ourſelves to have been obliged to furniſh it?</p>
               <p>The arguments of the oppoſers of the treaty are extremely at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with each other. On the one hand they repreſent it as fraught with advantages to Great Britain, without equivalents to the United States—as a premeditated ſcheme to ſacrifice our trade and navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her's—as a plan dictated by her for drawing the two countries into cloſe connection and alliance, and for making our intereſts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to her's; on the other hand, they tell us, that there is no ſecurity for the ſurrender of the poſts, according to ſtipulation. How is the one thing to be reconciled with the other? If the treaty be ſuch an immenſe boon to Great Britain, if it be ſuch a maſter piece of political craft on her ſide, can there be any danger that ſhe will deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy her favorite work, by not performing the conditions on which its efficacy and duration muſt depend? There is no poſition better ſettled, than that the breach of any article of a treaty by one party, gives the other an option to conſider the whole treaty as annulled. Would Great Britain give us this option, in a caſe in which ſhe had ſo much to loſe by doing it?</p>
               <p>This glaring colliſion of arguments proves how ſuperficially the adverſaries of the treaty have conſidered the ſubject, and how little reliance can be placed on the views they give of it.</p>
               <p>In eſtimating the plan which the treaty adopts for the ſettlement of the old controverſy, it is an important reflection, that, from the courſe of things, there will be nothing to be performed by us before the period for the reſtitution of the poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We ſhould then be where we were before the treaty, with the advantage of having ſtrengthened the juſtice of our cauſe, by removing every occaſion of reproach, which the infractions of the treaty of peace may have furniſhed againſt us.</p>
               <p>Two other particulars, in which this part of the treaty is ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be defective, regard the want of indemnification for the deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poſts, and for the expences of Indian wars.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who make the objection, may be ſafely challenged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce precedents of ſimilar indemnifications, unleſs impoſed by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering</hi> powers on the vanquiſhed, or by powers of overbearing ſtrength upon-thoſe which were too weak to diſpute the logic of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior force. If this were the relative ſituation of the United States and Great Britain, then is the treaty inexcuſably faulty; but if the parties were to treat and agree as equal powers, then is the pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extravagant and impracticable. The reſtitution of the ſpecific thing detained, is all that was to be expected, and, it may be added, it is all that was ever really expected on the part of this country, ſo far as we may reaſon either from official acts or informal expreſſions of the public opinion.</p>
               <p>In caſes where clear injuries are done, affecting objects of known or eaſily aſcertainable values, pecuniary compenſation may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be obtained by negociation: but it is beleived that it will be impoſſible to cite an example of ſuch compenſation ſo obtained, in a caſe in which territory has been withheld on a diſpute of title, or as a hoſtage for ſome other claim (as in the preſent inſtance, for

ſecuring the performance of the 4th article of the treaty of peace.) The recovery of the territory withheld is the uſual ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The want of a rule to adjuſt conſequential damages, is, in ſuch caſes, a very great difficulty. In the inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ce under diſcuſſion, this difficulty would be peculiarly great.—The poſts are, for the moſt part, in a wilderneſs. There are but two of them which have any adjacent ſettlements; Point-au-fer, or Dutchman's point, to one of which a part of a tract of land, called Caldwell's Manor, with a few inhabitants, has been claimed as appurtenant. Detroit, which has a ſettlement in the town and neighbourhood of between two and three thouſand ſouls. In the vicinity of the other poſts, on our ſide, there is ſcarcely an inhabitant. It follows, that very little damage could be predicated either upon the loſs of revenue from, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the profits of trade with the ſettlements in the vicinity of the poſts. The trade of the Indians within our limits would conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be the baſis of the claim of compenſation.—But here the ignorance or ſpirit of exaggeration of the opponents of the treaty has been particularly exemplified. The annual loſs from this ſource has been ſtated, by a very zealous writer againſt the treaty, who ſigns himſelf <hi>Cato,</hi> at 800,000 dollars.</p>
               <p>Now it is a fact well aſcertained, that the mean value of the whole exports from Canada in peltries (which conſtitute the returns of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian trade) in the years 1785 and 1787, was ſomething ſhort of 800,000 dollars.

is not more than about one eighth of that which furniſhes the peltry exported from Canada. Hence the total product of our Indian trade could not be computed at more than 100,000 dollars. What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of this may be profit, is not eaſy to be determined; but it is certain, that the profits of that trade, from the decreaſe of wild animals, and the inferiority of their kinds, are not conſiderable.—

               <p>Thus we ſee how erroneous the data which ſerve to magnify claims in themſelves inſignificant, and which, from the great uncertainty of their quantum, are expoſed to ſerious objections. Are claims like theſe proper ſubjects on which to ſtake the peace of the United States?</p>
               <p>The reaſonableneſs of indemnification for the expences of Indian wars, independent of the unuſual nature of the claim, might have been matter of endleſs debate. We might have been told, that the Indians aſcribe thoſe wars to pretenſions upon their lands, by virtue of treaties with the former government of the United States, impoſed by violence, or contracted with partial and inadequate repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their nation—that our own public records witneſs, that the proceedings of our agents, at ſome of thoſe treaties, were far from unexceptionable—that the wars complained of are to be attributed to errors in our former policy, or miſmanagement of our public agents, not to the detention of the poſts—that this detention was merely an incidental circumſtance of diſadvantage, in carrying on the wars not a cauſe of them—that it muſt be problematical how much of the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or expences of thoſe wars are chargeable upon that detention, that the poſts having been detained by way of ſecurity for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the article reſpecting debts, there was no reſponſibility for collateral and caſual damages: and finally, that it is without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to claim indemnification of one nation for the expences of wars with another. Had we reſorted to the charge of their having inſtigated or prompted thoſe wars, they would have demed the charge, as they have repeatedly done before; and, tho' we might have been able to adduce circum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tances of ſuſpicion againſt them, they would have conteſted their validity and force, and whether guilty or not, would have thought their honour concerned in avoiding the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant conceſſion of having participated in ſo improper a buſineſs.</p>
               <p>In every view, therefore, the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aim for indemnification was a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one; and to inſiſt upon it could have anſwered no other purpoſe than to render an amicable adjuſtment impoſſible. No Britiſh miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would have dared to go to a Britiſh parliament to aſk proviſion for ſuch an expenditure. What, then, was to be done? Were we now or hereafter to go to war to enforce the claim? ſuppoſe this done, and fifty or a hundred millions of dollars expended in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, what certainty is there that we ſhould at laſt accompliſh the object?</p>
               <p>Moreover, the principle of ſuch a war would require, that we ſhould ſeek indemnification for the expences of the war itſelf, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to our former claim. What proſpect is there, that this alſo
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028795_0044_0FDD49ECCF3301A8"/>
would be effected? yet if not effected, it is evident that we ſhould have made a moſt wretched bargain.</p>
               <p>Why did we not inſiſt on indemnification for the expences of our revolution war? Surely not becauſe it was leſs reaſonable, but becauſe it was evident that it could not have been obtained, and becauſe peace was neceſſary to us as well as to our enemy. This likewiſe would be the end of a war undertaken to enforce the claim of indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification for the detention of the poſts. We ſhould at length be glad to make peace either without the indemnification ſought, or at beſt at an expence to carry on the the war, without a chance of reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſement, with which the thing gained would bear no compariſon.</p>
               <p>The idea which has been thrown out of leaving the poſts in the hands of the Britiſh, till we might be better able than at preſent to go to war for indemnification, is a notable political expedient. This would be to poſtpone of choice the poſſeſſion of an object which has been ſhewn to be demanded by very urgent and important general conſiderations, to ſubmit to certain and great inconveniences from that privation, including probably the continuance or renewal of Indian hoſtilities, and to run the riſk, from the growth of the Britiſh ſettlements in the neighbourhood of the poſts, and various unforeſeen caſualties, of their ultimate acquiſition becoming difficult and preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: For what? why, to take at laſt the chances of war, the iſſue of which is ever doubtful, to obtain an object which, if obtained, will certainly coſt more than it is worth. The expences of war apart, pecuniary indemnification upon any poſſible ſcale, would ill compenſate for the evils of the future detention, till the more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time for going to war ſhould arrive. What ſhould we think of this policy, if it ſhould turn out that the poſts and the indemnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation too were to be finally abandoned?</p>

                  </gap>re, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of but one conſtruction, namely, that thoſe who recommend it, with our envoy to have acted, not as if he had been ſent <hi>to make peace,</hi> but as if he had been ſent <hi>to make war,</hi> to blow and ſpread the deſolating flames of diſcord and contention.</p>
               <p>There is a marked diſingenuouſneſs running through the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are made to the prejudice of the treaty: they endeavor conſtantly to have it underſtood that our envoy abandoned, without effort, the claims which have not been eſtabliſhed? Whence is this inferred? Is it from the ſilence of the treaty? Surely we can only expect to find there what was <hi>agreed upon,</hi> not what was <hi>diſcuſſed</hi> and <hi>rejected.</hi> The truth is, that as well on this point of indemnification, for the detention of the poſts, as on that of compenſation for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes carried away, our envoy urged our pretenſions, as far, and as long as he could do it, without making them final obſtacles to the progreſs of the negociation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now enumerate and anſwer the remaining objections, which have appeared againſt this article. They are theſe:—1. That the poſts to be ſurrendered inſtead of being deſcribed in general terms, ſhould for greater certainty, have been ſpecifically enumerated; that now the uncertainty of a part of the boundary line, may furniſh a pretext for detaining ſome of them. 2. That the expreſſions, "pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts and juriſdictions," which are excepted from our right of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement previous to the ſurrender are ſo vague and indeterminate, as to be capable of being made to countenance encroachments. 3. That it was improper to have ſtipulated, for the inhabitants, the option of reſiding and continuing Britiſh ſubjects, or of becoming American citizens; that the firſt was to eſtabliſh by treaty, a Britiſh colony, within our limits; the laſt to admit without the power of exception bitter enemies of the country, to the privileges of citizens. 4. That the ſecuring to thoſe inhabitants, the enjoyment of their property is exceptionable as being "aſceſſion without equivalent of an <hi>indefinite extent of territory.</hi>" This is the character given to it by the meeting at Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>The anſwer to the firſt objection is, that the enumeration propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might have included the very danger which is objected to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion as it ſtands, and which is completely avoided by it. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal poſts occupied by the Britiſh are known and might eaſily have been enumerated; but there is a poſſibility of there being others not known, which might have eſcaped. Laſt year there ſtarted up a poſt which had not been before heard of, on the preſence of an old trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhment. Who knows with abſolute certainty, how many ſimilar caſes may exiſt in the vaſt extent of wilderneſs, as far as the lake of the Woods, which for ſeveral years paſt has been inacceſſible to us? If our envoy's information could have been perfect, at the time of his laſt advices from America; between that period and the ſigning of the treaty, changes might have taken place, that is, trading houſes might have grown into military poſts, as they did in the caſe referred to; a caſe, which in fact, happened after the departured of our envoy from the United States. Was it not far better than to hazard an imperfect ſpecification to uſe terms ſo general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, as could not fall in any circumſtances, to embrace every caſe; Certainly it was; and the terms "<hi>all poſts and places,</hi>" which
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028795_0046_0FDD49EE50D53828"/>
are thoſe uſed in the article, are thus comprehenſive. Nothing can eſcape them.</p>
               <p>Neither is there the leaſt danger that the uncertainty<note n="*" place="bottom">This uncertainty is to be obſerved, reſults not from the late treaty, but from the treaty of peace. It is occaſioned by its being unknown whether any part of the Miſſiſippi extends far enough north to be interſected by a due weſt line from the lake of the Woods.</note> of a part of the boundary line, can be made a pretext for detaining any poſt which it was poſſible to enumerate. This will appear from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the map. The only uncertain part of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ix, which is on a ſide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected with the poſition of the Poſts) is that which is to run from the lake of the Woods to the Miſſiſippi. The moſt weſtern of our known poſts is at Michillimacnac, at or near the junction of the lakes Huron and Michegan, eaſtward near eleven degrees of longitude of the lake of the Woods, and about ten degrees of longitude of that point, on the Miſſiſippi, below the fails of St. Anthony, where a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, in order to a ſettlement of the line is to begin. Moreover our line by the treaty of peace, is to paſs through the middle of lake Huron, and the water communication between that lake and lake Superior, and through the middle of lake Superior, and thence weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward through other waters to the lake of the Woods; that is about half a degree of latitude more northward, and about eight degrees of latitude more weſtward, than any part of lake Michegan.—Whence it is manifeſt, that any cloſing line, to be drawn from the lake of the Woods to the Miſſiſippi, muſt paſs at a diſtance of ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles from Michillimacnac. If the Britiſh therefore, ſhould be diſpoſed to evade the ſurrender, they will ſeek for it ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, more plauſible than one which involves a palpable geographical abſurdity. Nor can we deſire a better proof of the diſingenuouſneſs of the objectors to the treaty, than their having contrived one of this nature.</p>
               <p>The general terms uſed were to be preferred, for the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that there was a doubt about the courſe of a part of the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary line; for if there ſhould chance to exiſt any poſt, now unknown, ſo near that line as to render it queſtionable, in the firſt inſtance, on which ſide it may fall; the moment the line is ſettled, the obligation to ſurrender will be ſettled with it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond obligation loſes all force, when it is conſidered that the exception can only operate till the 1ſt of June next, the period for the ſurrender of the poſts; and that in the mean time, there is ample ſpace for ſettlement, without coming to diſputable ground. There was beſides real difficulty in an accurate definition. What the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts and juriſdiction of the poſts are, is a queſtion of fact. In ſome inſtances, where from there being no ſettlements, over which an actual juriſdiction had been exerciſed, a good rule might have been the diſtance of gun ſhot from the fortifications, which might have been ſettled at a certain extent in miles, ſay three or four.— But in ſome caſes, an actual juriſdiction has been exerciſed under circumſtances which created obſtacles to a preciſe definition.— The caſe of Caldwell's manor in the vicinity of Dutchman's point is an example. There a mixed juriſdiction has been ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028795_0047_0FDD4A21C9793778"/>
by the Britiſh and by the ſtate of Vermont, connected with a diſputed title to that manor; one party claiming under an ancient French grant, the other under the ſtate of Vermont. Detroit and its vicinity would alſo have occaſioned embarraſſment. From the ſituation of the ſettlements, and of a number of diſperſed trading eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments, a latitude was likely to have been required, to which it might have been inexpedient to give a ſanction. In ſuch ſituations, where a thing is to laſt but a ſhort time, it is commonly the moſt eligible courſe to avoid definition. It is obvious, that no ill can reſult from the want of one, if the poſts are ſurrendered at the time agreed; if not, it is equally plain that it can be of no conſequence, becauſe the whole article will be void.</p>
               <p>The third objection becomes inſignificant, the moment the real ſtate of things is adverſed to. This has been deſcribed in a former number for another purpoſe, but will now be recapitulated with one or two additional facts. The firſt poſts beginning eaſtward are point Aufer, and Dutchman's point on lake Champlain. The whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons in this vicinity, over whom juriſdiction has been claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Britiſh, may amount to an hundred families. But the claim of juriſdiction here, has been only occaſionally and feebly urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it is aſſerted, in addition, by well informed perſons, that the above mentioned families have been, for ſome time, regularly repreſented in the legiſlature of Vermont, the ordinary civil juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which ſtate, has, with little interruption, extended over them. At neither of the other poſts, to wit: Oſwego, Niagara, the Miami Detroit, Michillimacnac; is there any ſettlement except at Detroit, where, and in the vicinity of which, there may be between two and three thouſand perſons, chiefly French Canadians, and their deſcendants. It will be underſtood, that I do not conſider as a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, two or three log-houſes for traders.</p>
               <p>It follows, that the number of perſons who can be embraced by the privileges ſtipulated is too inconſiderable to admit of attaching any political conſequence whatever to the ſtipulation. Of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can it poſſibly be to the United States, whether two or three thouſand perſons, men, women, and children, are permitted to reſide within their limits, either as Britiſh or American ſubjects, at their option? If the thing was an object of deſire to Great Britain for the accommodation of the individuals concerned, could it have merited a moments heſitation on our part? As to reſidence, it is of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary curteſy of nations at peace to permit the mutual reſidence of the citizens of each other within their reſpective territories. Britiſh ſubjects are now free by our laws, to reſide in all parts of the United States. As to the permiſſion to become citizens, it has been the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral policy and practice of our country to facilitate the naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of foreigners. And we may ſafely count on the intereſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and on that deſire to enjoy equal rights which is ſo deeply implanted in the human breaſt, that all who reſolve to make their permanent reſidence with us will become citizens.</p>
               <p>It is true, that there may be a few obnoxious characters (though I do not recollect to have heard of more than two or three) among the number of thoſe who have acquired by the ſtipulation a right to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come citizens of the United States. But would it ever have been worthy of the dignity of the national wrath, to have launched its

                  </gap>d have been thought worth the while to make a ſpecial exception of their caſes out of the operation of our general laws of naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And if this had not been done, would they not have found means, if they deſired it, after the lapſe of a ſhort period, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the rights of citizens? It is to be obſerved, that citizens of our own, who may have commited crimes againſt our laws, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the treaty of peace, would find no protection, under this article.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the ſtipulation had not been made, what would have been the probable policy of the United States? Would it not have been to leave the handful of ſettlers undiſturbed, in quiet enjoyment of their property, and at liberty, if Britiſh ſubjects, to continue ſuch, or become American citizens, on the uſual conditions? A ſyſtem of depopulation, or of coercion to one allegiance or another, would have been little congenial with our modes of thinking, and would not, am perſuaded, have been attempted.</p>
               <p>If then, the treaty only ſtipulates in this reſpect, what would have been the courſe of things without it; what cauſe for ſerious objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>n can there be on this account?</p>
               <p>The matter of the fourth objection can only derive a moment's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance from miſapprehenſion. It ſeems to have been imagined, that there are large tracts of land held under Britiſh grants, made ſince the peace, which are confirmed by the part of the article that gives the inhabitants the right of removing with, ſelling, or <hi>retaining</hi> their property.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, it is to be obſerved, that if ſuch grants had been made, the ſtipulation could not be deemed to confirm them, becauſe our lands muſt determine the queſtion, what is the property of the inhabitants, and they would rightfuly decide, that the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſince the treaty of peace could make no valid grants of land, within our limits. Upon the ground even of its own pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it could not have made ſuch grants. Nothing more was claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than a right to detain the poſts as a hoſtage. The right to grant lands pre-ſuppoſes much more, a full right of ſovereignty and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory.</p>
               <p>But in the ſecond place, it has always been underſtood, and upon recent and careful enquiry is confirmed, <hi>that the Britiſh government has never, ſince the peace made a ſingle grant of lands within our limits.</hi> It appears, indeed, to have been its policy to prevent ſettlements in the vicinity of the poſts.</p>
               <p>Hence the ſtipulation as it affects lands, does nothing more than confirm the property of thoſe which were holden at the treaty of peace; neither is the quantity conſiderable; and it chiefly, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, depends on titles acquired under the French government while Canada was a province of France.</p>
               <p>In giving this confirmation, the treaty only purſues what is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant rule among civilized nations. When territory is ceded or yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by one nation to another it is a common practice, if not a ſpecial condition, to leave the inhabitants in the enjoyment of their property. A contrary conduct would be diſgraceful to a nation; nor is it very reputable to the objectors to the treaty, that they have
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028795_0049_0FDD4A26EB164DD0"/>
levelled their battery againſt this part of it. It is a reflection upon them too, that they employ for the purpoſe, terms which import more than is true, even on their own ſuppoſition, and are, therefore, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to deceive; for the confirmation of property to individuals, could be at moſt a ceſſion only of the right of ſoil, and not of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which term has a technical ſenſe including juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>Let it be added, that the treaty of peace in the article which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, "that there ſhould be no future confiſcations nor proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt any perſon or perſons, by reaſon of the part which he or they might have taken in the war; and that no perſon ſhould, on that account, ſuffer any future loſs or damage, either in his perſon, liberty or property, did ſubſtantially what is made an objection to the treaty under conſideration. It will not, I believe, be diſputed, that it gave protection to all property antecedently owned, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated. Indeed, it is a queſtion, whether the ſtipulations cited would not have effected, with regard to other rights than thoſe of property, a great part of what is regulated by the laſt treaty. Its proviſions, in this particular, were perhaps in the main, unneceſſary, further than to obviate a doubt which might have ariſen from the ſuſpenſion of the treaty by the withholding of the poſts.</p>
               <p>Thus have I gone through every objection to the ſecond article, which can be deemed is colourable, and I flatter myſelf have ſhewn not only that the acquiſition made by it is of great and real value, but that it ſtands as well as circumſtances permitted, and is defenſible in its details. I have been the more particular in the examination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the aſſailants of the treaty have exerted all their ingenuity to diſcredit this article, from a conſciouſneſs, to doubt, that it is a very valuable item of the treaty; and that it was important to their cauſe to envelope it in as thick a cloud of objections as they were able to contrive. As an expedient of party, there is ſome merit in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but a ſenſible people will ſee that it is merely artifice. It is a falſe calculation, that the people of this country can ever be ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately deceived.</p>

               <p>THE object of the 3d article is connected with that of the 2d. The ſurrender of the poſts naturally drew with it an arrangement with regard to inland trade and navigation. Such an arrangement, conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in ſeveral reſpects, appears to be in ſome reſpects neceſſary. To reſtrain the Indians on either ſide of the line, from trading with the one party or the other, at diſcretion, beſides the queſtionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the right, could not be attempted without rendering them diſguſted and hoſtile. The truth of this ſeems to have influenced the conduct of Great-Britain and France, while the latter was in poſſeſſion of Canada. The 15th art. of the treaty of peace of Utrecht, in the year 1713, allows free liberty to the Indians on each ſide, to reſort for trade to the Britiſh and French colonies. It is to be obſerved too, that the Indians not only inſiſt on a right of going to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e with
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028795_0050_0FDD49F3C6BE8830"/>
whom they pleaſe, but of permitting whom they pleaſe to come to trade with them, and alſo to reſide among them for that purpoſe. Thus the ſouthern and ſouth weſtern Indians within our limits, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a conſtant intercourſe with Spain, eſtabliſhed on the baſis of treaty; nor has their right to do it, been hitherto conteſted by the United States—indeed, on what clear principle of juſtice could this natural right to trade of a people not ſubject to our ordinary juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction be diſputed? This claim on their part, gives a correſponding claim to neighbouring nations to trade with them.—Spain would think the pretenſion to exclude her inadmiſible—And Great-Britain would have thought the ſame, if ſhe had found it her intereſt to aſſert the right of intercourſe; views which would always be ſeconded by the Indian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> from regard to their own intereſt and independence. It was a point, therefore, which it much concerned the preſervation of good underſtanding between the parties and with the Indians, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late on ſome equitable plan; and the more liberal the plan, the more agreeable to a natural courſe of things, and to the free participation of mutual advantages, the more likely was it to promote and prolong that important benefit.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, the expediency of ſome arrangement was indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the circumſtance of the boundary line, between the parties, running for an extent of ſixteen hundred miles through the middle of the ſame rivers, lakes and waters. It may be deemed impoſſible from the varying courſe of winds and currents, for the veſſels of one party to keep themſelves conſtantly within their own limits, without paſſing or tranſgreſſing thoſe of the other. How, indeed, was the preciſe middle line of thoſe great lakes to be always known.</p>
               <p>It appears evident, that to render the navigation of theſe waters uſeful to, and ſafe for both parties, it was requiſite that they ſhould be common. Without this, frequent forfeitures to enforce inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of intercourſe might be incurred—and there would be conſtant danger of interference and controverſy. It is probable too, that when thoſe waters are better explored in their whole extent, it will be found that the beſt navigation of the lakes is ſometimes on the one ſide, ſometimes on the other, and that common convenience will, in this reſpect alſo, be promoted by community of right.</p>
               <p>Again, it is almoſt always mutually beneficial for bordering terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories to have free and friendly intercourſe with each other. This relates not only to the advantages of an interchange of commodities, for the ſupply of mutual wants and to thoſe of the reciprocal reacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of induſtry, connected with that interchange, but alſo to thoſe of avoiding jealouſy, colliſion, and conteſt, of preſerving friendſhip and harmony. Proximity of territory invites to trade—the border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inhabitants, in ſpite of every prohibition, will endeavour to carry it on—If not allowed, illicit adventurers take place of the regular operations of legaliſed commerce—individual intereſt, leads to collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to evade reſtraining regulations—habits of infracting the laws are produced—morals are perverted—ſeverities neceſſarily great in proportion, as they counteract the natural courſe of things, lay the foundation of diſcontents and quarrels. Perhaps it may be ſafely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that, freedom of intercourſe or violent hatred and enmity, are the alternative in every caſe of contiguity of territory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:028795_0051_0FDD4A27F639E988"/>The maxims of the United States have hitherto favoured a free intercourſe with all the world. They have conceived that they had nothing to fear from the unreſtrained competition of commercial enterpriſe, and have only deſired to be admited to it on equal terms. Hence not only the communication by ſea has been open, with the adjacent territories, on our continent, as well as with more diſtant quarters of the globe, but two ports have been erected on lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain for the convenience of interior commerce with Canada. Theſe arrangements have excited neither blame nor criticiſm.</p>
               <p>Our envoy, therefore, in agreeing to a liberal plan of intercourſe with the Britiſh territories in our neighbourhood has conformed to the general ſpirit of our country, and to the general policy of our laws. Great Britain, in acceding to ſuch a plan, departed from her ſyſtem of colonial monopoly, a departure which ought to be one recommendation of the plan to us; for every relaxation of that ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem payes the way for other and further relaxations. It might have been expected alſo, that a ſpirit of jealouſy might have proved an obſtacle on the part of great Britain, ſince, eſpecially if we conſider the compoſition of thoſe who inhabit, and are likely to inhabit Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, it is morally certain that there muſt be, as the reſult of a free intercourſe a far greater momentum of influence of the United States upon Canada, than of Canada upon the United States.—It would not have been ſurpriſing, if this jealouſy had ſought to keep us at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, &amp; had counteracted the wiſer policy of limiting our deſires by giving us poſſeſſion of what is alone to us truly deſireable, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of commerce, rather than of ſuffering our wiſhes to be ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and extended by privation and reſtraint.</p>
               <p>New ideas ſeem of late to have made their way among us. The extremes of commercial jealouſy are inculcated.—Regulation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, excluſion, are now with many the favourite topics—Inſtead of feeling pleaſure, that new avenues of trade are opened, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dangers and miſchiefs are pourtrayed when the occaſion occurs. Free trade with all the world ſeems to have dwindled into trade with France and her dominions.—The love ſick partizans of that country appear to regard her as the epitome of the univerſe, and to have adopted for their motto, "All for love, and the world well loſt."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe new propenſities towards commercial jealouſy have been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably exemplified with reſpect to the article immediately under conſideration. Truly eſtimated, it is a valuable in gredient in the treaty; and yet there is perhaps, no part of it which has been more ſeverely reprobated—It will be eaſy to ſhew that it has been extremely miſrepreſented, and that what have been deemed very exceptionable features, do not exiſt at all.</hi>

particularly that it does not reach at all our atlantic ports. An inſtance of one of the ſpecial proviſions alluded to, will be cited in the further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this article.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In oppoſition to this conſtruction, much ſtreſs is laid upon the proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which immediately ſucceed the clauſes that have been quoted. They are in theſe words: "But it is underſtood that this article does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the admiſſion of veſſels of the United States into the ſeaports, harbours, bays or creeks of his majeſt's ſaid territories, nor into ſuch parts of the rivers in his ſaid territories, as are between the mouth thereof, and the higheſt port of entry from the ſea, except in ſmall veſſels trading bona fide between Montreal and Quebec: nor to the admiſſion of Britiſh veſſels from the ſea, into the rivers of the United States, beyond the higheſt ports of entry for foreign veſſels from the ſea." The laſt, it is ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an implication that under this article, Britiſh veſſels have a right to come to our higheſt ports of entry for foreign veſſels from the ſea while we are excluded from the ſea ports of the Britiſh territories on this continent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this is altogether an erroneous inference. The clauſes laſt cited are inſerted for greater caution, to guard expreſsly againſt any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the article, by implications more or leſs remote; contrary to the actual regulations of the parties, with regard to external commerce and navigation. Great Britain does not now permit a trade by ſea to Nova Scotia and Canada. She therefore declares that the article ſhall not be deemed to contravene this regulation. The United States now permit foreign veſſels to some to certain port of entry from the ſea, but exclude them from other more interior parts of entry, to which our own veſſels may come.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">An example of this is found in the ſtate of New-York. Foreign veſſels can only enter and unlade at the city of New-York; veſſels of the United States may enter at the city of Hudſon, and unlade there and at Albany.</note>
                  <hi>It is therefore declared on their part, that the article ſhall not be conſtrued to contravene this regulation. This was the more proper, as the right of inland navigation might have given ſome color to the claim of going from an outer to an inner port of entry. But this negative of an implication, which might have found ſome color in the principal proviſion, can never be conſtrued into an affirmative grant of a very important privilege, foreign to that principal proviſion. The main object of the article it has been ſeen, is trade b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> land, and inland navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Trade and navigation by ſea, with our ſea ports, is an entirely different thing. To infer a poſitive grant of this privilege, from a clauſe which ſays, that the right of inland navigation ſhall not be conſtrued to permit veſſels coming from the ſea, to go from the ports of entry, to which our laws now reſtrict them, to more interior ports, would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon, and to every rule of ſound conſtruction. Such a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege could never be permitted to be founded upon any thing leſs than a poſitive and explicit grant. It could never be ſupported by an implication drawn from an article relative to a local and partial object; much leſs by an implication drawn from the negative of another implication. The pretenſion, that all our ports were laid open to Great Britain by a covert and ſide wind proviſion, and this without reciprocity, without a right of acceſs to a ſingle ſea-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ort of the other party in any part of the world,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028795_0054_0FDD49F686C73EA8"/>
would be too monſtrous to be tolerated for an inſtant. The principles of equity between nations, and the eſtabliſhed rules of interpretation would unite to condemn ſo great an inequality, if any other ſenſe could poſſibly be found for the terms from which it might be pretended to be deduced. It would be in the preſent caſe the more inadmiſſible, becauſe the object is embraced and regulated by other parts of the treaty on terms of recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The different mode of expreſſion, in the clauſe laſt cited, when ſpeaking of the Britiſh territories, and when ſpeaking of the United States, has furniſhed an argument for the inference which has been ſtated. But this difference is accounted for by the difference in the actual regulations of the parties as deſcribed above. The object was on each ſide to OUST an implication interfering with thoſe regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The expreſſions to effect it were commenſurate with the ſtate of the fact on each ſide; and conſequently do not warrant any col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral or ſpecial inference.</p>
               <p>The only poſitive effect of theſe clauſes is to eſtabliſh, that naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Montrealto Quebec, ſhall be carried on in what are called "ſmall veſſels trading bona fide between Montreal and Quebec." In determining their ſenſe, it merits ſome obſervation, that they do not profeſs to except from the operation of the general proviſions of the article, the ſea ports, &amp;c. of the Britiſh territories; but declare, that it is underſtood that thoſe proviſions do not extend to them. This is more a declaration that the antecedent proviſions were not ſo broad as to comprehend the caſes, than an exception of the caſes from the operation of thoſe proviſions.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are not familiar with laws &amp; treaties may feel ſome difficulty about the poſition, that particular clauſes are introduced, only for greater caution, without producing any new effect; but thoſe who are familiar with ſuch ſubjects, know, that there is ſcarcely a law or a treaty which does not offer examples of the uſe of ſimilar clauſes, and it not unfrequently happens, that a clear meaning of the principal proviſion is rendered obſcure by the exceſs of explanatory precaution.</p>
               <p>The next clauſe of this article is an exception to the general deſign of it, confirming the conſtruction I have given. "The river Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi, ſhall, however, according to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its eaſtern ſide, to which ſoever of the parties belonging, may freely be reſorted to and uſed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his majeſty in Great Britain."</p>
               <p>If the general proviſion gives acceſs to all our ports, which muſt be the doctrine, if it gives acceſs to our Atlantic ports, then it would equally have this effect with regard to the Miſſiſippi. But this clauſe clearly implies the contrary, not only by introducing a ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the ports of the Miſſiſippi, but by introducing it expreſsly, as a further or additional agreement; the words are "it is further agreed, &amp;c." and theſe ports are to be enjoyed by each party "in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, or any of the ports or places of his majeſty in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain." This reference to our Atlantic ports, coupling them with the ports of Great Britain, ſhews that the Miſſiſippi ports are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028795_0055_0FDD4A2AF5FF49B8"/>
by a rule or ſtandard different from the ports for that inland navigation, which is the general object of the article; elſe, why that ſpecial reference? why not have ſtopped at the words "uſed by both parties?" If it be ſaid, that the reference to our Atlantic ports implies, that they are within the purview of the article, let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the ſame argument would prove that the ports of Great Britain are alſo within its purview, which is plainly erroneous, for the main proviſions are expreſsly confined to the territories of the parties on this continent. The concluſion is, that the reference is to a ſtandard out of the article, and depending on other parts of the treaty.</p>
               <p>It may be uſeful to obſerve here, that the Miſſiſippi ports being to be uſed only in as ample, and not in a more ample manner, than our Atlantic ports and the ports of Great Britain will be liable at all times to all the regulations, privileges and reſtrictions of the ports with which they are aſſorted.</p>
               <p>The next clauſe is a ſtill further refutation of the conſtruction which I oppoſe. "All goods and merchandize, whoſe importation into his Majeſty's ſaid territories in America ſhall not be entirely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, may freely, for the purpoſes of commerce, be carried into the ſame in the manner aforeſaid, by the citizens of the United States; and ſuch goods and merchandize ſhall be ſubject to no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or other duties than would be payable by his Majeſty's ſubjects on the importation of the ſame from Europe into the ſaid territories: And in like manner, all goods and merchandize, whoſe importation into the United States ſhall not be wholly prohibited, may freely, for the purpoſes of commerce, be carried into the ſame in the manner aforeſaid, ſubject to no higher or other duties than would be paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the citizens of the United States, on the importation of the ſame in American veſſels into the Atlantic ports of the ſaid States: and all goods not prohibited to be exported from the ſaid territories reſpectively, may, in like manner, be carried out of the ſame by the two parties reſpectively paying duty as aforeſaid."</p>
               <p>The words, "in the manner a foreſaid," occur twice in theſe clauſes, and their equivalent, "in like manner" once. What is the meaning of this ſo often repeated phraſe? it cannot be preſumed that it would have been inſerted ſo frequently without having to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſome office of conſequence. I anſwer, that it is evidently the ſubſtitute for theſe other words of the main proviſion, "by land and inland navigation." This is "the manner aforeſaid."—This is the channel, through which goods and merchandizes paſſing, would be ſubject to no other or higher duties than would be payable in the Britiſh territories by Britiſh ſubjects, if imported from Europe, in the territories of the United States, by citizens of the United States, if brought by American veſſels into our Atlantic ports. No other reaſonable uſe can be found for the terms. If they are denied this ſenſe, they had much better been omitted, as being not only uſeleſs, but as giving cauſe to ſuppoſe a reſtriction of what, it is pretended, was deſigned to be general—a right of importing in every way, and into all parts of the United States, goods and merchandize, if not intirely prohibited, on the ſame duties as are payable by our own citizens when brought in our own veſſels.</p>
               <p>The words," whoſe importation into the United States ſhall not
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028795_0056_0FDD49F81EAA99E8"/>
be <hi>entirely</hi> prohibited," is a further key to the true ſenſe of the article. They are equivalent to theſe other words, "whoſe importation <hi>into all parts</hi> of the United States ſhall not be prohibited."—The deſign of this clauſe is to prevent importation, thro' the particular channels contemplated by the article, being obſtructed by a partial or by any other than a general prohibition. As long as certain goods may be introduced into the United States through the Atlantic ports, they may alſo be brought into them through the channels deſignated by this article, that is, by land and inland navigation. The making a prohibition in the given caſe to depend on a general prohibition, is concluſive to prove, that the article contemplates only <hi>particular chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.</hi> On any other ſuppoſition the clauſe is nonſenſe. The true reading, then, of this part of the article muſt be as follows:—"Goods and merchandize, whoſe importation <hi>into all parts</hi> of the United States ſhall not be prohibited, may freely, for the purpoſe of commerce, be carried into the ſame by <hi>land and inland navigation,</hi> from the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of his Majeſty on the continent of America."</p>
               <p>There are ſtill other expreſſions in the article, which are likewiſe an index to its meaning. They are theſe, "<hi>would be payable</hi> by the citizens of the United States on the <hi>importation of the ſame in American veſſels into the Atlantic ports of the ſaid States.</hi>" This reference to a rate of duties, which would be payable on importation into the Atlantic ports, as a rule or guide for the rate of duties, which is to prevail in the caſe meant to be comprehended in the article, is full evidence that importation into the Atlantic ports is not included in that caſe. The mention of importation in American veſſels confirms this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, as it ſhews that the article itſelf contemplates that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination made by our exiſting laws may continue.</p>
               <p>But the matter is put out of all doubt by thoſe parts of the fifteenth article which reſerve to the Britiſh government the right of impoſing ſuch duty as may be adequate to <hi>countervail the difference</hi> of the duty <hi>now payable</hi> on the importation of European and Aſiatic goods, when imported in the United States in Britiſh and in American veſſels. And which ſtipulate that "the United States will not ENCREASE <hi>the now ſubſiſting difference</hi> between the duties payable on the importation of any articles in Britiſh or in American veſſels."</p>
               <p>This is demonſtration, that the treaty contemplates, as conſiſtent with it, a continuance of the preſent difference of duties on impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in American and Britiſh veſſels, and conſequently that the third article, which ſtipulates equal duties, as to the caſes within it, does not extend to importations into our Atlantic ports, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to importations by land and inland navigation. Though this article be of temporary duration yet as an evidence of the ſenſe of parties, it will always ſerve as a rule of conſtruction for every part of the inſtrument.</p>
               <p>Theſe different views of the article eſtabliſh beyond the poſſibility of doubt, that, except with regard to the Miſſiſippi, inland trade and navigation are its ſole objects—that it grants no right or privilege whatever in our Atlantic ports—and that with regard to the ports of the Miſſiſippi, it only eſtabliſhes this principle, that Great Britain ſhall always enjoy there the ſame privileges which by treaty or law ſhe is allowed to have in our Atlantic ports.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:028795_0057_0FDD4A2FD36F4FB0"/>I remark incidentally, for a purpoſe which will appear hereafter, that as far as this article is concerned, we are free to prohibit the importation into the United States at large of any Britiſh article what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever though we cannot prohibit its importation <hi>partially,</hi> that is merely from her territories in our neighbourhood by land or inland navigation, but we may prohibit the importation by ſea from thoſe territories; <hi>nor is there any other part of the treaty by which this is prevented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The remaining clauſes of this article eſtabliſh the following points." That no duty of entry ſhall be levied by either party on pehries brought by land or inland navigation, into the reſpective territories;" that Indians paſſing and repaſſing with their own goods, ſhall pay no impoſt or duty upon them, but goods in bales, or other large packages, unuſual among Indians, ſhall not be conſidered as their goods, that tolls and rates of ferriage ſhall be the ſame on both ſides as are paid by natives—that no duties ſhall be paid by either party on the mere tranſit of goods acroſs portages and carrying places from one part to another of the territory of the ſame party, that the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective governments will promote friendſhip, good neighbourhood and amicable intercourſe, by cauſing ſpeedy and impartial juſtice to be done, and neceſſary protection to be extended to all who may be concerned therein.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this paper with an obſervation or two on the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the terms, inland navigation. Theſe terms have no technical meaning defined in the laws of either country, nor have they any preciſe meaning aſſigned by the law of nations. They however <hi>exvi termini,</hi> exclude navigation from the ſea; and as a general rule, I ſhould ſay, that inland navigation begins there, where ſea navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ends. Where is this? I anſwer, at the ports of entry from the ſea. By the laws of Great Britain and of the United States, all rivers are arms of the ſea, as far as the ordinary tides flow—It would be a conſequence of this principle, that ſea navigation would reach to the head of tide water. But ſome more obvious and notorious rule ought to govern the interpretation of national compacts. The ports of entry from the ſea are conceived to be the proper rule.</p>
               <p>In the caſe under conſideration, the general ſpirit of the article may require that all the waters which divide the territories of the parties ſhould be in their whole extent common to both—As to other communicating waters acceſſible under the article, the reciprocal limit of the right will be the ports of entry from the ſea. This is to be underſtood with the exception of the Miſſiſippi, to the ports of which acceſs from the ſea is granted under the qualification which has been pointed out.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="part">
               <head>No. XI.</head>
               <p>THE foregoing analyſis of the third article, by fixing its true meaning, enables us to detect ſome groſs errors, which have been principal ſources of prejudices againſt it.—One of theſe is,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028795_0058_0FDD49F9906E0A18"/>
that the article gives to the other party a right of acceſs to all our ports, while it excludes us from the ports of the Britiſh territories in our neighbourhood. It has been clearly ſhewn, that it gives no right of acceſs to any one of our atlantic ports, and that it gives only a qualified and conditional acceſs to the ports which we may have on the Miſſiſippi to be regulated by the privileges at any time allowed by law or compact in our atlantic ports, and liable to ceaſe with the ceſſation of thoſe privileges. The charge therefore of want of reciprocity in this particular vaniſhes, and with it all the exceptionable conſequences which have been the fruit of the error. Such is the aſſertion of Decius, that a Britiſh trader may ſet out for Canada, traverſe our lakes, rivers and waters to New-York, and thence to Philadephia, while we are precluded from the navigation of the St. Lawrence, and other Britiſh rivers lower than the higheſt ports of entry from the ſea. It would be an indulgent conſtruction of the article not to ſtop the Britiſh trader at Hudſon, as the higheſt port of entry from the ſea, and the boundary of inland navigation, but he could certainly have no claim of right under it, to go from New-York to Philadelphia, becauſe he muſt neceſſarily go by ſea to arrive at the firſt place, and no ſuch permiſſion is ſtipulated by the article. Such alſo is the aſſertion of Cato, that Great Eritain is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all the advantages of which our atlantic rivers are ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. The rivers upon which no part of their territory borders, and which their veſſels can only approach by ſea, are certainly excepted.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>Another of the errors referred to is this, that goods and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize may, under this article, be imported into any <hi>part</hi> of the United States, upon the ſame duties as are now payable when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by citizens of the United States, and in veſſels of the United States. It has been clearly proved that there is no pretence for this poſition, and—that equality of duties only applies to importations from the Britiſh territories, in our neighbourhood, by land and inland navigation.</p>
               <p>Cato, Decius, and other writers againſt the treaty, have fallen into this ſtrange error, and have founded upon it much angry declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The firſt however, embarraſſed in his conſtruction, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which reſerves to Great Britain the right of laying conter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing duties, endeavours to eſcape from it by diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween goods imported for Indian trade, and thoſe imported for other uſes. Whatever may be the caſe with regard to the latter, the former, he is convinced, are certainly entitled to admiſſion into our atlantic ports, on the privileged rates of duty; though he is very naturally perplexed to ſee how the diſcrimination could be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in prac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e. But where does he find room for this diſtinction? Not in the proviſion reſpecting countervailing duties, for that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral —not in the clauſe of third article, to which he gives the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, for that is directly againſt his diſtinction. The goods and merchandize for the priviledged importation of which it provides, are reſtricted to no particular object—have no ſpecial reference to Indian more than to other trade: on the contrary, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly to be imported for "the purpoſes of commerce" at large; ſo that in the caſes in which they are priviledged, they are equally ſo, whether it be for a trade with our citizens, or with Indians.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028795_0059_0FDD4A30F3E30908"/>
The diſtinction therefore, only proves the embarraſſment of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor, without ſolving the difficulty. A curious aſſertion has been made on this article of duties. It has been ſaid, that while we are obliged to admit Britiſh goods on the ſame duties with thoſe paid by our own citizens, on importation in our own veſſels, G. Britain, under the right to lay <hi>countervailing</hi> duties may incumber us with an additional <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct. Can any thing be more abſurd than the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the right to lay countervailing duties exiſts in a caſe where there is no difference of duty to <hi>countervail?</hi> The term is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a relative one, and can only operate where there is ſomething on our ſide to be countervailed or counterbalanced, and in an exact ratio to it. If it be true that a very high law character is the writer of Cato, we cannot but be ſurpriſed at ſuch extreme inaccuracy.</p>
               <p>Other errors no leſs conſiderable will appear in the progreſs of the examination, but it will facilitate the detection of theſe and tend to a more thorough underſtanding of the article, to ſtate in this place ſome general facts, which are material in a compariſon of the advantages and diſadvantages of the article, to the reſpective parties.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The fur trade within our limits is to the fur trade within the Britiſh limits, as one to ſeven nearly: that is, the trade with the Indians, on the Britiſh ſide of the boundary line, is about ſeven times greater than the ſame trade on our ſide of that line. This fact is ſtated at the reſult of repeated enquiry from well informed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſeveral years paſt. It will not appear extraordinary to thoſe who recollect how much the indians on our ſide are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in their hunting grounds, and to what a degree they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in numbers by the frequent wars, in which they have been engaged with us: while the tribes on the Britiſh ſide of the line are not only far more numerous, but enjoy an immenſe undiſturbed range of wilderneſs. The more rapid progreſs of ſettlement on our ſide than on the other, will faſt increaſe the exiſting diſparity.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. Our communication with the ſea is more eaſy, ſafe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious, than that of Canada, by the St. Laurance. Accordingly, while our veſſels ordinarily make two voyages in a year, to and from Europe, the Britiſh veſſels in the Canada trade are, from the courſe of the ſeaſons, and the nature of the navigation, confined to one voyage in a year. Though hitherto, from temporary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, this difference has not made any ſenſible difference in the price of tranſportation, yet in its permanent operation, it is hardly poſſible that it ſhould not give us a material advantage in the competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſupply of European goods to a large part of Canada, eſpecially that which is denominated Upper Canada. The city of Hudſon, diſtant 124 miles from the city of New-York, is as near to the junction of the river Cataraquay and Lake Ontario as Montreal, which laſt is near four hundred miles diſtant from the mouth of the St. Lawrance. When the canals, now in rapid execution, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, there will be water communication the whole way from the city of Hudſon to Ontario.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. The ſupply of Eaſt-India goods to Canada is likely to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eaſier and cheaper through us, than in any other way. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent Britiſh ſyſtem, Canada is ſuppplied through Britain. It is obvious how much the charges of this double voyage muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028795_0060_0FDD49FE90120F38"/>
the prices of the articles when delivered in Canada. A direct trade between the Eaſt-Indies and Canada, would ſuppoſe a change in the Britiſh ſyſtem, to which there are great obſtacles; and even then, there are circumſtances which would ſecure to us an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous competition. It is a fact which ſerves to illuſtrate our advantages that Eaſt-India articles, including teas, are upon an average, cheaper in the United States than in England.</p>
               <p>Theſe facts demonſtrate that a trade between us and the Britiſh territories in our neighbourhood, upon equal terms as to privilege, muſt afford a balance of advantages on our ſide. As to the fur trade, for a participation in one eighth of the whole which we can cede, we gain a participation in 7-8hs which is conceded to us. As to the European and Eaſt-India trade, we acquire the right of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition upon equal terms of privilege with real and conſiderable advantages of ſituation.</p>
               <p>The ſtipulation with regard to equal duties was eſſential to the preſervation of our ſuperi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rity of advantages in this trade, while it could not interfere with the general policy of our regulation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the difference of duties on goods imported in our own and in foreign bottoms; becauſe the ſupplies which can come to us through Canada, for the reaſons already given muſt be inconſiderable —becauſe, alſo, diſtance would ſoon countervail, in expences of tranſportation, the effect of the difference of duties in our market —and becauſe, in the laſt place, this difference is not very ſenſible, owing to the large proportion of goods which are imported in the names of our own citizens. I ſay nothing here of the impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility on general grounds of long maintaining with effect this regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>Is it not wonderful, conſidering the real ſtate of the trade as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on locality, that the treaty ſhould be charged with ſacrific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fur trade to the Britiſh? If there be any ſacrifice, is it not on their ſide? when the fact is, that the quantity of trade in which they admit us to equal privileges is ſeven times greater than that in which we admit them to equal privileges.</p>
               <p>The arguments againſt the treaty on this point, are not only full of fallacy, but they are in contradiction with each other</p>
               <p>On the one hand, it is argued that our communication from the ſea, with the Indian country, being much eaſier than by the St. Lawrence, we could furniſh Engliſh goods cheaper, and of courſe, could have continued the Indian trade in its uſual channel, even from the Britiſh ſide of the lakes, nor could they have prevented it without giving ſuch diſguſt to the Indians as would have made them dangerous neighbours. On the other hand, it is argued, that from ſuperiority of capital, better knowledge of the trade, a better eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed connection of cuſtomers, the Britiſh will be able to ſupplant us, even in our own territories, and to acquire a monopoly of the whole fur trade.</p>
               <p>Propoſitions ſo oppoſite cannot all be true. Either the ſuppoſed faculty of ſupplying Engliſh goods cheaper, which it is ſaid, would give us a command of the Indian trade, even on the Britiſh ſide of the lakes, not in the power of the Britiſh to prevent, overbalances the advantages which are ſpecified on the other ſide, or it does not —If it does not, then is it not true that it could draw to us the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028795_0061_0FDD4A328188BEF8"/>
trade from the Britiſh ſide of the lakes—If it does, then is it not true that the Britiſh can ſupplant us in the trade on either ſide of the lakes; much leſs that they can obtain a monopoly of it on both ſides.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if it be true that the Britiſh could not prevent our trading with the Indians on their ſide, without giving them ſuch diſguſt as to make them dangerous neighbours, why is it not equally true that we could not prevent their trading with the Indians on our ſide, without producing a ſimilar effect? And if they have really a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of advantages, why would they not, on the principle of this argument, attract and divert the trade from us, though a mutual right to trade with the Indians in each others territories had not been ſtipulated?</p>
               <p>The difficulty of reſtraining the Indians from trading at pleaſure, is an idea well founded, as has been admitted in another place. But there reſults from it, ſtrong arguments in favour of a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of privileges in the Indian trade by treaty. One of them, its tendency to preſerve peace and good underſtanding, has been already noticed: another ariſes from the conſideration that it will probably be the policy of the Britiſh to maintain larger military eſtabliſhments on their frontier, than we ſhall think eligible on ours, which will render it proportionably more eaſy to them to reſtrain their Indians, than it will be to us to reſtrain ours. This greater difficulty of executing reſtraints on our ſide, is a powerful reaſon for us to agree, mutually to throw open the door.</p>
               <p>It will not be ſurprizing, if upon ſome other occaſion the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the treaty ſhould abandon their own ground, and inſtead of ſaying the treaty is faulty, for what it ſtipulates on this point ſhould affirm merely that it has no merit on this account, ſince it only does what the diſpoſitions of the Indians would have brought about without it.—But it is always a merit to diveſt an advantageous thing of cauſe of diſpute, and to fix by amicable agreement, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which otherwiſe would be liable to litigation, oppoſition and interruption.</p>
               <p>As to relative advantages for carrying on the trade, the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to be made with caution. That which has been ſtated on our ſide, namely, greater facility in conveying the materials of the trade from Europe, to the ſeene where it is to be carried on is a real one, and in proceſs of time may be expected to make itſelf to be felt; yet hitherto, as before obſerved, it has had no ſenſible effect.</p>
               <p>Of the advantages which have been ſtated as belonging to the other ſide, there is but one which has ſubſtance, and this is previous poſſeſſion of the ground. But even this from the very nature of it is temporary—With our uſual ente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſite for the whole trade is ſmall.—From a hundred to a hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling would be a high ſtatement. The whole of this, if we were to monopolize the entire trade, could not create a moment's embarraſſment to find it, in the opinion of any man who attends to the great pecuniary
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028795_0062_0FDD4A004E0635C0"/>
operations which are daily going on in our country. But that very capital which is repreſented as our rival, could be brought into action for our benefit in this very trade. The ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ution is ſimple: Our credit will command it in obtaining the foreign articles neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the trade upon as good terms as the merchants who now carry it on.

                  </gap>ther branch of trade between us and Great Britain. Why does it not give her a monopoly of the direct trade between her European dominions and the United States? The argument, if valid, would prove that we ought to have no commerce, not only with Great Britain, but with any nation which has more capital than ourſelves.</p>
               <p>As to ſuperior knowledge of the particular branch of buſineſs, there is ſtill leſs force in that argument. It is not a caſe of abſtruſe ſcience or complicated combination. And we are in no want of perſons among us who are experimentally acquainted with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>As to cuſtomers for the proceeds of the trade, we ſhould ſtand upon as good a footing as the Britiſh merchants. What we did not want for our own conſumption might be ſent upon equal terms to the very market to which they ſend theirs; and to others which might be found preferable, becauſe leſs well ſupplied with the kind of articles.</p>
               <p>As to whatever may depend on enterprize, we need not fear to be outdone by any people on earth. It may almoſt be ſaid that enterprize is our element.</p>

               <p>THE remaining allegations in diſparagement of the third article, are to this effect: 1. That the exception of the country of the Hudſon's Bay company, owing to its undefined limits, renders the ſtipulations in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the articles which will be brought from Europe into Canada, coming duty free, can be afforded cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the ſame articles going th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the population of Canada, which, by a cenſus in 1784, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to 123082 ſouls, is too ſmall to render the ſupply of Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean and Aſiatic commodities through us of ſo much importance as to bear any compariſon with the loſs by the ſacrifice of the fur trade. 6 That the intercouſe to be permitted with the Britiſh ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories will facilitate ſmuggling, to the injury of our revenue. 7. That the much greater extent of the United States than of the Britiſh territories deſtroys real reciprocity in the privileges granted by the article, giving in fact far greater advantages than are received. Theſe ſuggeſtions will be diſcuſſed in the order in which they are here ſtated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is true that the country of the Hudſon's Bay Company is not well defined.—Their charter, granted in 1670, gives them "the ſole trade and commerce of and to all the ſeas, bays, ſtreights, creeks,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028795_0065_0FDD4A37FB4A9AA8"/>
lakes, rivers, and ſounds, in whatſoever latitude they ſhall be, that lie within the entrance of the ſtreight, commonly called Hudſon's Streights, together with all the lands countries, and territories upon the coaſts and confines of the ſaid ſeas, ſtreights, bays, &amp;c. which are now actually poſſeſſed by any of our ſubjects, or by the ſubjects of any other Chriſtian prince or ſtate."</p>
               <p>To aſcertain their territorial limits, according to charter, it would be neceſſary to know what portion of country, at the time of the grant, was actually poſſeſſed by the ſubjects of Great-Britain, or of ſome other Chriſtian prince or ſtate: but though this be not known, the general hiſtory of the country, as to ſettlement, will demonſtrate that it could not have extended far weſtward, certainly not to that region which is the ſcene of trade in furs, commonly called the North Weſt Trade, carried on by the Canada company from Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da; the poſſeſſion of which, as far as poſſeſſion exiſts, is recent.— We learn from a traveller who has lately viſited that region, that one of this company's eſtabliſhments is in lat. 56.9. N. long. 117.43. W. that is, about twenty degrees of longitude weſtward of the Lake of the Woods; and it is generally underſtood, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſcene of the trade of this company is weſtward of the limits of the Hudſon's Bay Company.</p>
               <p>Canada, on the north, is bounded by the territories of the Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Bay Company. This is admitted by the treaty of Utrecht, and eſtabliſhed by the act of parliament in 1774, commonly called the Quebec act. The treaty of Utrecht provides for the ſettlement of the boundary by commiſſaries. I have not been able to trace whether the line was ever actually ſo ſettled, but ſeveral maps lay down a line as the one ſettled by the treaty of Utrecht, which runs north of the Lake of the Woods.</p>
               <p>In a caſe thus ſituated, the United States will juſtly claim, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the article, acceſs to all that country, the trade of which is now carried on through Canada. This will reſult both from the certainty that there were no actual poſſeſſions, at the date of the charter, ſo far interior, and from the fact of the trade being carried on through a different channel, by a different company, under the ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and protection of a different government, that of Canada. It may be aſked, why was the article embarraſſed by the exception of the country of the Hudſon's Bay Company? The anſwer is this, That the charter of this company gives it a monopoly within its limits, and therefore, a right to trade there could not have been granted with propriety, to a foreign power by treaty. It is true that it has been queſtioned, whether this monopoly was valid againſt Britiſh ſubjects, ſeeing that the charter had not been confirmed by act of parliament. But beſides that this doubt has been confined to Britiſh ſubiects, it would appear that in fact, the company has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the monopoly granted by its charter, even againſt them, and with at leaſt the implied approbation of parliament. In the year 1749, petitions were preferred in the Houſe of Commons, by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent trading towns in England, for reſcinding the monopoly and opening the trade. An enquiry was inſtituted by the houſe. The report of its committee was favourable to the conduct and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the company, and againſt the expediency of opening the trade; and the buſineſs terminated there.</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:028795_0066_0FDD4A034464C180"/>This circumſtance of there being a monopoly, confirms the argument drawn from the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Though it will be partly a digreſſion, I cannot forbear, in this place, to notice, ſome obſervations of Cato in his 10th number.— After ſtating, that in 1784 the peltry from Canada ſold in London for 230,000l. ſterling, he proceeds to obſerve, that, excluding the territories of the Hudſon's Bay Company, 9 tenths of this trade is within the limits of the United States; and though with ſtudied am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of expreſſion, he end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>avours to have it underſtood, that nine-tenths of the trade which yielded the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ltry, that ſold for 230,000l. ſterling in 1784, was within our territories. It is natural to aſk how he has aſcertained the limits of the Hudſon's Bay Company (which, at other times, is aſſerted by way of objection to the article, to be altogether indefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctneſs as to be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce what proportion, if any, of the trade carried on through Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, may have come from that country, towards the calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which has led to the concluſion that nine-tenths of the whole lie within our limits? The truth is, indub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tably and notoriouſly, that whether any or whatever part of the peltry exported from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada may come from the country of the Hudſon's Bay Company, ſeven eighths <note n="*" place="bottom">Some ſtatements rate it at between 6-8ths and 7-8ths.</note> of the whole trade which furniſhes that peltry, has its ſource on the Britiſh ſide of the boundary line. It follows, that if it were even true, that only one tenth of the whole lay in that part of the Britiſh territory, which is not of the Hudſon's Bay Company, inaſmuch as only one ſeventh of it lies within our limits, the reſult would be, that the trade in which we granted an equal privilege was to that in which a like privilege was granted to us, as one ſeventh to one tenth, and not, according to Cato, as nine to one. This Legerdemain, in argument and calculation, is too frivolous for ſo ſerious a ſubject: or, to ſpeak more properly, it is too ſhocking, by the ſpirit of deception which it betrays.</p>
               <p>Cato has a further obſervation with regard to the trade with the Indians in the vicinity of the Miſſiſſippi, and, from that river into the Spaniſh territories—The product of all this trade, he ſays, muſt go down the Mſſiſſippi, and, but for the ſtipulation of the 3d article, would have been excluſively ours; becauſe, "by the treaty of Paris, though the Britiſh might navigate the Miſſiſſippi, yet they did not own a foot of land upon either of its banks; whereas the United States, poſſeſſing all the Indian country in the vicinitity of that river and the eaſt bank for many hundred miles, could when t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y pleaſed eſtabliſh factories and monopolize that commerce." This aſſertion, with regard to the treaty of Paris, is in every ſenſe of the word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct; for the ſeventh article of that treaty eſtabliſhes as a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary between the dominions of France and his Britannic majeſty "a line drawn along the middle of the river Miſſiſſippi, from its ſource to the river Iberville, and from thence by a line drawn along the middle of this river and the lakes Maurepas and Pont Chartraim to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028795_0067_0FDD4A399D771358"/>
the ſea," and cedes to his Britannic majeſty all the country on the eaſt ſide of the Miſſiſippi. By the treaty of Paris, then, his Britannic majeſty owned all the territory on the eaſt ſide of the Miſſiſippi, (except the town and Iſland of New Orleans) inſtead of not having a foot of land there.</p>
               <p>Whether a part of this territory does not ſtill belong to him, is a point not yet ſettled. The treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain ſuppoſes that part will remain to Great Britain; for one line of boundary between us and her, deſignated by that treaty, is a line due weſt from the lake of the woods to the Miſſiſippi. If in fact this river runs far enough north to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected by ſuch a line, according to the ſuppoſition of the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned treaty, ſo much of that river, and the land upon it, as ſhall be north of the line of interſection, will continue to be of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Great Britain. The treaty lately made, not abandoning the poſſibility of this being the caſe, provides for a ſurvey to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the fact: and in every event, the intent of the treaty of peace will require that ſome cloſing line, more or leſs direct, ſhall be drawn from the lake of the Woods to the Miſſiſſippi. The Poſition, therefore, that Great-Britain has no land or ports on the Miſſiſſippi, takes for granted what is not aſcertained, and of which the contrary is preſumed by the treaty of peace.</p>
               <p>The trade with the Indian country on our ſide of the Miſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi, from the Ohio to the lake of the Woods (if that river extends ſo far north) ſome fragments excepted, has its preſent direction through Detroit and Michillimacnac, and is incl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ded in my calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, heretofore ſtated, of the proportion which the Indian trade within our limits bears to that within the Britiſh limits. Its eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated amount is even underſtood to embrace the proceeds of a clandeſtine traffic with the Spaniſh territories; ſo that the new ſcene ſuddenly explored by Cato is old and trodden ground, the ſpecial reference to which cannot vary the reſults that have been preſented. It is ſtill unqueſtionably true, that the fur trade within our limits bears no proportion to that within the Britiſh limits. As to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigent traffic with the territories of Spain, each patry will purſue it according to right and opportunity; each would have independent of the treat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the facility of bordering territories.</p>
               <p>The geography of the beſt regions of the fur trade, in the Spaniſh territories, is too little known to be much reaſoned upon; and if the Spaniards, according to their uſual policy, incline to exclude their neighbours, their precautions along the Miſſiſſippi will render the acceſs to it circuitous; a circumſtance which makes it problematical, whether the poſſeſſion of the oppoſite bank is, as to that object, an advantage or not; and whether we may not find it convenient to be able, under the treaty, to take a circuit through the Britiſh territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is upon the ſuggeſtion of Great-Britain having no ports on the Miſſiſippi, that the charge of want of reciprocity in the privileges granted, with regard to the uſe of that river is founded. The ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been ſhewn to be more peremptory than is juſtified by facts. Yet it is ſtill true, that the ports on our ſide bear no proportion to any that can exiſt on the part of the Britiſh according to the preſent ſtate of territory. It will be examined in a ſubſequent place, how
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028795_0068_0FDD4A08361CE3D8"/>
far this diſproportion is a proper rule in the eſtimate of reciprocity. But let it be obſerved in the mean time, that in judging of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocity of an article it is to be taken collectively. If upon the whole, the privileges obtained are as valuable as thoſe granted, there is a ſubſtantial reciprocity; and to this teſt, upon full and fair examination of the article, I freely refer the deciſion.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the ſituation of Great Britain did not permit in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, a preciſe equivalent, it will not follow that the grant on our part was improper, unleſs it can be ſhewn, that it was attended with ſome inconvenience, injury or loſs to us; a thing which has not been, and I believe cannot be ſhewn. Perhaps there is a very importantly beneficial ſide to this queſtion. The treaty of peace eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and Great Britain a common intereſt in the Miſſiſippi, the preſent treaty ſtrengthens that common intereſt. Every body knows that the uſe of the river is denied to us by Spain, and that it is an indiſpenſible outlet to our weſtern country. Is it an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient thing to us, that the intereſt of Great Britain has in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular been more completely ſeparated from that of Spain, and more cloſely connected with ours?</p>
               <p>The agreement to forbear to lay duties of entry on peltries, is completely defenſible on the following grounds, viz. It has been the general policy of commercial nations, to exempt raw materials from duty. This has likewiſe been the uniform policy of the United States, and it has particularly embraced the article of peltries, which by our exiſting laws may be imported into any part of the United States <hi>free from duty.</hi> The object of this regulation is the encouragement of manufactures, by facilitating a cheap ſupply of raw materials. A duty of entry therefore, as to ſuch part of the article as might be worked up at home, would be prejudicial to our manufacturing intereſt, as to ſuch part as might be exported, if the duty was not drawn back, would injure our commercial intereſt. But it is the general policy of our laws, in conformity with the practice of other commercial countries, to draw back and return the duties which are charged upon the importation of foreign commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. This has reference to the advancement of the export trade of the country; ſo that with regard to ſuch peltries as ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exported, there would be no advantage to our revenue from having laid a duty of entry.</p>
               <p>Such a duty then being contrary to our eſtabliſhed ſyſtem and to true principles, there can be no objection to a ſtipulation againſt it. As to its having the effect of making our country the channel of the Britiſh trade in peltries, this if true, and it is indeed probable, could not but promote our intereſt. A large proportion of the profits would then neceſſarily remain with us to compenſate for tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and agencies. It is likely too that to ſecure the fidelity of agents, as is uſual, co-partnerſhips would be formed, of which Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh capital would be the principal inſtrument, and which would throw a ſtill greater proportion of the profits into our hands. The more we can make our country the <hi>Entrepot,</hi> the <hi>Emporium</hi> of the trade of foreigners, the more we ſhall profit. There is no commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial principle more obvious than this, more univerſally agreed, or more generally practiſed upon, in countries where commerce is well underſtood.</p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:028795_0069_0FDD4A3AC31DA350"/>4. The fourth of the above enumerated ſuggeſtions is anſwered in its principal point by the practice juſt ſtated, of drawing back the duties on importation when articles are re-exported. This would place the articles, which we ſhould ſend into the Britiſh terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, exactly upon the ſame footing as to duties with the ſame articles imported there from Europe. With regard to the addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al expence of tranſportation, this is another inſtance of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of an argument, which has been relied upon by both ſides, that taking the voyage from Europe in conjunction with the interior tranſportation the advantage, upon the whole, is likely to be in our favour. And it is upon this aggregate tranſportation that the calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ought to be made. With reſpect to India or Aſiatic articles, there is the circumſtance of a double voyage.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As to the ſmall population of Canada, which is urged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the advantages of the trade with the white inhabitants of thoſe countries, it is to be obſerved, that this population is not ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary. If the date of the cenſus be rightly quoted, it was taken eleven years ago, when there were already 123,082 ſouls. It is preſumeable that this number will ſoon be doubled; for it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that ſettlement has proceeded for ſome years with conſiderable rapidity in Upper Canada, and there is reaſon to believe that the future progreſs will not be ſlow. In time to come the trade may grow into real magn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tude, but be it more or leſs beneficial, it is ſo much gained by the articles, and ſo much clear gain, ſince it has been ſhewn not to be true that it is counterbalanced by a ſacrifice in the fur trade.</p>
               <p n="6">6. With regard to the ſuppoſed danger of ſmuggling in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe permitted by this article, it is very probable it will be found leſs than if it were prohibited. Intirely to prevent trade between bordering territories, is a very arduous, perhaps an impracticable taſk. If not authoriſed, ſo much as is carried on muſt be illicit, and it may be preſumed, that the extent of illicit trade will be much greater in that caſe, than where an intercourſe is permitted under the uſual regulations and guards. In the laſt caſe, the inducement to it is leſs, and ſuch as will only influence perſons of little character or prin-ciple while every fair trader is from private intereſt a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel to the laws; in the other caſe, all are intereſted to break through the barriers of a rigorous and apparently unkind prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This conſideration has probably had its weight with our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in opening a communication through Lake Champlain with Canada; of the principle of which regulation the treaty is only an extenſion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The pretended inequality of the article, as ariſing from the greater extent of the United States than of the Britiſh territories, is one of thoſe fanciful poſitions which are ſo apt to haunt the brains of viſionary politicians. Traced through all its conſequences, it would terminate in this, that a great empire could never form a treaty of commerce with a ſmall one, for to equalize advantages according to the ſcale of territory, the ſmall ſtate muſt compenſate for its deficiency in extent by a greater <hi>quantum</hi> of poſitive privilege in proportion to the difference of extent which would give the larger ſtate the monopoly of its trade. According to this principle what wretched treaties have we made with France, Sweden, Pruſſia, and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028795_0070_0FDD4A09364D0428"/>
Holland? for our territories exceed in extent thoſe of either of theſe powers. How immenſe the ſacrifice in the caſe of Holland; for the United States are one hundred times larger than the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
               <p>But how are we ſure, that the extent of the United States is greater than the territories of Great Britain on our continent? We know that ſhe has pretenſions to extend to the pacific ocean and to embrace a vaſt wilderneſs, incomparably larger than the United States, and we are told as already mentioned, that her trading eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments now actually extend beyond the 56th degree of north latitude, and 117th degree of weſt longitude.</p>
               <p>Shall we be told (ſhifting the original ground) that not extent of territory, but extent of population i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the meaſure? Then how great is the advantage which we gain in this particular, by the treaty at large? The population of Great Britain is to that of the United States, about two and a half to one; and the comparative conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by her in the trade between her European dominions and the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, muſt be in the ſame ratio. When we add to this the great population of her Eaſt India poſſeſſions, in which privi-leges are granted to us, without any return how prodigiouſly will the value of the treaty grow upon us according to this new and extraordinary rule?</p>
               <p>But the rule is in fact, an abſurd one, and only merits the notice which has been taken of it, to exhibit the weak grounds of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the treaty. The great ſtandard of reciprocity is equal privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. The adventitous circumſtances which may render it more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to one party than the other, can ſeldom be taken into the account, becauſe they can ſeldom be eſtimated with certainty—the relative extent of country or population, is of all others, a fallacious guide.</p>
               <p>The comparative reſources and facilities for mutual ſupply, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the relative utility of a commercial privilege; and as far as population is concerned, it may be laid down as a general rule, that the ſmalleſt population graduates the ſcale of the trade on both ſides, ſince it is at once the principal meaſure of what the ſmaller ſtate can furniſh to the greater, and of what the former can take from the latter, or in other words, of what the greater ſtate can find a demand for from the ſmaller ſtate. But this rule too, like moſt general ones, admits of numerous exceptions.</p>
               <p>In the caſe of a trade by land and inland navigation, the ſphere of the operation of any privilege can only extend a certain diſtance. When the diſtance to a given point, through a particular channel, is ſuch that the expence of tranſportation would render an article dearer than it could be brought through another channel to the ſame point, the privilege to carry the article through that particular channel to ſuch point, becomes of no avail. Thus the privilege of trading by land or inland navigation, from the Britiſh territories on this continent, can procure to that country no advantage of trade with Princeton, in New-Jerſey, becauſe ſupplies can come to it on better terms from other quarters. Whence we perceive, that the abſolute extent of territory or population of the United States, is no meaſure of the relative value of the privileges reciprocally grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028795_0071_0FDD4A3C56FB58B8"/>
by the article under conſideration, and conſequently no criteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the real reciprocity of the article.</p>
               <p>The objectors to the treaty have marſhalled againſt this article a quaint figure, of which from the uſe of it, in different quarters, it is preſumable they are not a little enamoured; it is this, that the article enables Great-Britain to draw a <hi>line of circumvallation</hi> round the United States. They hope to excite prejudice, by preſenting to the mind, the image of a ſiege or inveſtment of the country. If trade be war, they have choſen a moſt apt figure; and we cannot but wonder, how the unfortunate iſland of Great Britain, has been able ſo long to maintain her independence amidſt the beleaguering efforts of the number of nations with whom ſhe has been impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough to form treaties of commerce; and who, from her inſulated ſituation, have it in their power to beſet and hem her in on all ſides. How lucky it is for the United States, that at leaſt one ſide is covered by Spain, and that this formidable line of circumvallati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be completely perfected! or rather how! and driven muſt thoſe be, who are obliged to call to their aid, auxiliaries ſo prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous!</p>
               <p>Can any good reaſon be given, why one ſide of a country ſhould not be acceſſible to foreigners for purpoſes of trade equally with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Might not the cultivators on the ſide from which they were excluded, have cauſe to complain, that the carriage of their produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was ſubject to an increaſed charge, by a monopoly of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal navigation; while the cultivators in other quarters enjoyed the benefit of a competition between that and foreign navigation? and might not all the inhabitants have a right to demand a reaſon, why their commerce ſhould be leſs open and free, than that of other parts of the country? Will privileges of trade extend the line of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorial circum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>allation? Will not the extent of contiguous Britiſh territory remain the ſame, whether the communications of trade are open or ſhut? By opening them, may we not rather be ſaid to make ſo many breaches in the wall, or intrenchment of this newly invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed circumvallation? If indeed it be not inchanted!</p>
               <p>The argument upon this article, has hitherto turned, as to the trade with the white inhabitants of the Britiſh territories, on Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean and Eaſt India goods. But there can be no doubt that a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beneficial commerce in native commodities ought to be included in the catalogue of advantages. Already there is a uſeful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of certain commodities, which time and the progreſs of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; reſources cannot fail to extend. It is moſt probable too, that a conſiderable part of the productions of the Britiſh territories will find the moſt convenient channel to foreign markets thro' us; which as far as it regards the intereſts of external commerce will yield little leſs advantage than if they proceeded from our own ſoil or induſtry. It is evident in particular, that as far as this ſhall be the caſe, it will prevent a great part of the competition with our commodities which would exiſt, if thoſe productions took other routs to foreign markets.</p>
               <p>In conſidering the ſubject on the ſide of a trade in home commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, it is an important reflection, that the United States are much more advanced in induſtrious improvement, than the Britiſh territories. This will give us a material and a growing advantage. While their articles of exchange with us will eſſentially conſiſt in the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028795_0072_0FDD4A0AB5A49EC8"/>
products of agriculture and of mines, we ſhall add to theſe manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of various and multiplying kinds, ſerving to increaſe the balance in our favour.</p>
               <p>In proportion as the article is viewed on an enlarged and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſeale, its importance to us magnifies. Who can ſay how far Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh colonization may ſpread ſouthward and down the weſt ſide of the Miſſiſſippi, northward and weſtward into the vaſt interior regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards the pacific ocean? Can we view it as a matter of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fference, that this new world is eventually laid open to our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, to an enterprize ſeconded by the immenſe advantage already mentioned, of a more improved ſtate of induſtry? Can we be inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the precedent furniſhes us with a cogent and perſuaſive argument, to bring Spain to a ſimilar arrangement? And can we be bind to the great intereſts we have in obtaining a free communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all the territories that environ our country from the St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's to the St. Croix.</p>
               <p>In this large view of the ſubject, the fur trade which has made a very prominent figure in the diſcuſſion, becomes a point ſcarcely viſible. Objects of great variety &amp;magnitude, ſtart up in perſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, eclipſing the little atoms of the day, and promiſing to grow and mature with time.</p>
               <p>The reſult of the whole is, that the United States make by the 3d art. of the treaty a good bargain—that with regard to the fur trade, with equality of privileges and ſuperior advantages of ſiuation, we ſtake one againſt ſeven, or at moſt one againſt ſix—that as to the trade in European and Eaſt India Goods and in home productions, we make an equal ſtake, with ſome advantages of ſituation—that we open an immenſe field of future enterprize—that we avoid embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments and dangers ever attendant on an artificial and prohibito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry policy, which in reference to the Indian nations was particularly difficult and hazardous—and, that we ſecure thoſe of a natural and liberal policy, &amp; give the faireſt chances for good neighbourhood between the United States and the bordering Britiſh territories, and conſequently of good underſtanding with Great-Britain, conducing to the ſecurity of our peace. Experience, no doubt, will demonſtrate that the horrid ſpectres which have been conjured up are fictions and if it ſhould even be ſlow to realize the predicted benefits (for time will be requiſite to give permanent cauſes their due effect in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling temporary circumſtances) it will at leaſt prove, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted evils are chimeras and cheats.</p>

to make a joint ſurvey of that river, from a degree of latitude below the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ls of St. Anthony, to the principal ſource or ſources thereof, and of the parts adjacent thereto, and that if in the reſult it ſhould appear that the ſaid river would not be interſected by ſuch a line as above mentioned, the two parties will proceed by amicable negociation, to regulate the boundary line in that quarter as well as all other points to be adjuſted between them, according to juſtice and mutual convenience, and the intent of the treaty of peace. The fifth, reciting that doubts have ariſen, what river was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix, mentioned in the treaty of peace, and forming a part of the boundary therein deſcribed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides that the aſcertainment of the point ſhall be referred to three commiſſioners, to be appointed thus: one to be named by his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic Majeſty, another by the Preſident of the United States, with the advice and conſent of the Senate, the third by theſe two if they can agree in the choice; but if they cannot agree, then each of them to name a perſon, and out of the perſons named, one drawn by lot in their preſence to be the third commiſſioner.—Theſe commiſſioners are to meet at Hallifax, with power to adjourn to any place or plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es they may think proper—are to be ſworn to examine and decide the queſtion according to the evidence which ſhall be la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d before them by both parties—and are to pronounce their deciſion which is to be concluſive, by a written declaration under their hands and ſeals, containing a deſcription of the river and particularly the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and longitude of its mouth and of its ſource.</p>
               <p>Theſe articles, though they have been adjuſted with critical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, have not eſcaped cenſure. They have even in one inſtance been ſeverely reprobated, as bringing into queſtion, things about which there was no room for any—and which a bare inſpection of the map was ſufficient to ſettle.</p>
               <p>With regard to the Miſſiſſippi, there is no ſatisfactory evidence that it has ever been explored to its ſource. It is even aſſerted, that it has never been aſcended beyond the 45th degree of north latitude, about a degree above the falls of St. Anthony. <hi>Faden's</hi> map in 1793, will ſerve as a ſpecimen of the uncertainty which attends this matter. It notes that the river had not been aſcended beyond the degree of latitude juſt mentioned and exhibits three ſtreams, one connected with the <hi>Marſhy Lake</hi> in that latitude, another with the <hi>White Bear Lake</hi> near the 46th degree, and the third with the <hi>Red Lake</hi> in the 47th degree; denominating each of the two firſt, "the Miſſiſippi by conjecture," and the laſt, "Red Lake River, or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hontan's Miſſiſippi,"—all of them falling conſiderably ſhort in their northern extent of the Lake of the Woods, which is placed as high as the fifteenth degree of north latitude. Thus ſtands this very clear and certain point which we are told it was diſgraceful on the part of our envoy to have ſufferred to be brought into queſtion.</p>
               <p>There is however, a ſpecific topic of blame of the article which has greater plauſibility. It is this, that it does not finally ſettle the queſtion, but refers the adjuſtment of the cloſing line to future ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, in caſe it ſhould turn out that the river does not ſtretch far enough north to be interſected by an eaſt and weſt line from the Lake of the Woods. I anſwer, that the arrangement is preciſely ſuch as it ought to have been. It would have been premature to
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028795_0074_0FDD4A0C3A65D440"/>
provide a ſubſtitute till it was aſcertained that it was neceſſary— This could only be done by an actual ſurvey—A ſurvey is there-fore provided for and will be made at the joint expence of the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>That ſurvey will not only determine whether a ſubſtitute be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite or not, but it will furniſh data for judging what ſubſtitute is proper, and moſt conformable to the true intent of the treaty.— Without the data which it will afford, any thing that could have been done, would have been too much a leap in the dark. National acts, eſpecially on the important ſubject of boundary, ought to be bottomed on a competent knowledge of circumſtances. It ought to be clearly underſtood how much is retained, how much is relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Had our envoy proceeded on a different principle, if what he had agreed to had turned out well, it would have been regarded as the lucky reſult of an act of ſupererogation.—If it had proved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous, it would have been ſtigmatized as an act of improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and imprudence.</p>
               <p>The ſtrong argument for having ſettled an alternative is the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of future diſpute. But what alternative could have been agreed upon, which might not have bred controverſy? The cloſing line muſt go directly or indirectly to the Miſſiſippi—which of the ſtreams re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted or conjectured to be ſuch, above the falls of St. Anthony, is beſt entitled to be ſo conſidered? to what known point was the line to be directed? How was that point to be identified with adequate certainty? The difficulty of anſwering theſe queſtions will evince, that the danger of controverſy might have been encreaſed by an impatience to avoid it, and by anticipating, without the neceſſary lights, an adjuſtment, which they ought to direct.</p>
               <p>The facts with regard to the river St. Croix, are theſe—the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, which of two rivers is the true St. Croix. The diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it is as old as the French poſſeſſion of Nova Scotia. France ſet up one river; Great Britain another. The point was undecid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the ſurrender of Nova Scotia by the former to the latter, put an end to the queſtion as between thoſe parties—It was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards renewed between the colonies of Nova Scotia and Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts Bay, which laſt, in the year 1762, appointed commiſſioners to aſcertain, in conjunction with commiſſioners which might be appointed by the Province of Nova Scotia, the true river, but no final ſettlement of the matter enſued.</p>
               <p>The treaty of peace gives us for one boundary, the river St. Croix, but without defining it. Hence it has happened, that not long after the peace was concluded, the queſtion which had before been agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated between France and Great Britain, and between the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Maſſachuſetts and Nova Scotia, was revived between the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts and that province, and it has ever ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a ſubject of debate. A mode of ſettling the diſpute was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conſideration of Congreſs in the year 1785, and powers were given to our then miniſter at the court of London, to adjuſt the affair, but nothing was concluded.

urgency," and that it had before been the ſubject of applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the United States to the government of Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>It is natural to ſuppoſe, that a diſpute of ſuch antiquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch different parties, is not without colourable foundation on either ſide; at any rate, it was eſſential to the preſervation of peace that it ſhould be adjuſted.</p>
               <p>If one party could not convince the other by argument of the ſuperior ſolidity of its pretenſions, I know of no alternative but <hi>Arbitration or War.</hi> Will any one pretend that honour required us in ſuch a caſe to go to war, or that the object w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No rational man will anſwer this queſtion in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative. It follows that an arbitration was the proper courſe, and that our envoy acted rightly in acceeding to the expedient. It is one too, not without precedents among nations, though it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the credit of human moderation, that they were more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
               <p>Is there any good objection to the mode of the arbitration? It ſeems impoſſible that any one more fair or convenient could have been deviſed, and it is recommended by its analogy to what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among individuals.</p>
               <p>What the mode is, has been already detailed, and need not be repeated here. It is objected that too much has been left to chance, but no ſubſtitute has been offered which would have been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with leſs caſualty. The fact is, that none ſuch can be offered. Conſcious of this, thoſe who make the objection have not thought fit to give an opportunity of compariſon by propoſing a ſubſtitute. What is left to chance? Not that there ſhall be a final deciſion; for this is moſt effectually provided for. It is not only poſitively ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that commiſſioners, with full and definitive power, ſhall be appointed, but an ultimate choice is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If this be not rather a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of the fairneſs of the plan, how was it to be remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Could it have been expected of either of the parties, to leave the nomination to the other? Certainly not. Would it have been adviſable to have referred the ultimate choice to ſome other ſtate or government?—where would one have been found in the opinion of both parties, ſufficiently impartial? On which ſide would there have been the greateſt danger of a ſucceſsful employment of undue influence? Is it not evident that this expedient would have added to equal uncertainty, as to character and diſpoſition, other caſualties and more delay? Should it have been left to the two commiſſioners appointed by the parties to agree at all events?

               <p>But theſe were not all the inſtances; there were other laws of South Carolina prolonging the inſtalments, and obliging the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to receive in payment the property of debtors at appraiſed va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe very ſerious and compulſory interferences with the rights of the creditors, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Decius, the ſoft appellation of a modification of the recovery of Britiſh debts.—Does he expect to make us believe by this ſmooth phraſe, that the right to recover the <hi>full value</hi> of a debt in ſterling money is ſatisfied by the obligation to take as a ſubſtitute, one half, one third, or one fourth of the real value in paper?</p>
               <p>It muſt neceſſarily have happened that Britiſh creditors have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, from the operation of the different acts alluded to loſſes more or leſs extenſive, which the more removal of the legal impediments that occaſioned them could not repair: in many inſtances the loſſes muſt have actually accrued and taken their full effect: in others, where no proceedings may have been had, the lapſe of ſo many years muſt have created inabilities to pay, in debtors who were originally competent, and who might have been made to pay, had there been a free courſe of juſtice.</p>
               <p>The removal of the impediments, therefore, by opening of the courts of juſtice, was not an adequate ſatisfaction. It could not ſupercede the obligation of compenſation for loſſes which had irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievably accrued by the operation of the legal impediments, while they continued in force. The claim for this was ſtill open on the part of Great-Britain, and ſtill to be adjuſted between the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The excuſe that theſe laws were retaliations for prior infractions of treaty by Great Britain, was in no view an anſwer to the claim. <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <p>It may not be improper to obſerve, that this excuſe implies a palpable violation of the then conſtitution of the United States. The confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:028795_0079_0FDD4A4560DDC5C8"/>In the firſt place, as has been proved, the fact of ſuch prior in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions was too doubtful to be finally inſiſted upon, and was, after a fruitleſs effort to obtain the acquieſcence of the other party, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and neceſſarily waved; ſo that it could not ſerve as a plea againſt reparation.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, if that fact had been indubitable, the ſpecies of retaliation was unwarrantable. It will be ſhewn when we come to diſcuſs the tenth article, that the debts of private individuals are in no caſe a proper object of repriſals; that independent of the treaty, the meddling with them was a violation of the public faith and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that conſequently, it was due as much to our own public faith and integrity, as to the individuals who had ſuffered, to make repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was an act demanded by the juſtice, probity, and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the nation.</p>
               <p>In the third place, it was eſſential to reciprocity in the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſputes which had exiſted concerning the treaty of peace. When we claimed the reinſtatement and execution of the article with regard to the poſts; it was juſt that we ſhould conſent to the reinſtatement and execution of the article with regard to debts.

The dilemma was to be content with the equivalent, and abandon the thing; or to recover the thing and abandon the equivalent: to have both was more than we could rightly pretend.—The reinſtatement of the article, with regard to the debts, neceſſarily included two things, the removal of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Did our envoy reply that the reinſtatement of the article with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the poſts included likewiſe compenſation for their detention? Was it an anſwer to this, deſtitute of reaſon, that our loſs by the detention of the poſts, which reſolved itſelf eſſentially into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain profits of a trade that might have been carried on, admitted of no ſatisfactory rule of computation; while the principal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of private debts afforded a familiar ſtandard, for the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of loſſes upon them: that nevertheleſs, while this was the uſual, and muſt be the admitted ſtandard, it is an inadequate one in caſes where payment is protracted beyond the allowed term of credit; ſince the mere intereſt of money does not countervail among mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, the profits of its employment in trade, and ſtill leſs the derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of credit and fortune, which frequent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It was, therefore, to have been foreſeen that whenever our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with Great-Britain was adjuſted, compenſation for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the recovery of debts wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d make a part of the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The option lay between compenſation, relinquiſhment of the poſts, or war. Our envoy is entitled to the applauſe of all good men, for preferring the firſt. The extent of the compenſation can on no poſſible ſcale compare with the immenſe permanent value of the poſts, or with the expences of the war. The ſphere of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terferences has been too partial to make the ſum of the compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in any event, a very ſerious object, and as to war, a conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or virtuous mind could never endure the thoughts of ſeeing the country involved in its calamities, to get rid of an act of juſtice to individuals, whoſe rights in contempt to public faith, had been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
               <p>Having reviewed the general conſiderations which juſtify the ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of compenſation, it will be proper to examine if the plan upon which it is to be made is unexceptionable.</p>
               <p>This plan contains the following features—1. The caſes provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for are thoſe, "where loſſes and damages occaſioned by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of lawful impediments (which ſince the peace have delayed the full recovery of Britiſh debts, bona fide contracted before the peace, and ſtill owing to the creditors, and have impaired and leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the value and ſecurity thereof) cannot now, for whatever reaſon, be actually obtained in the ordinary courſe of juſtice. 2. There is an expreſs exception out of this proviſion of all the caſes in which loſſes and damages have been occaſioned by ſuch inſolvency of the debtors, or other cauſes, as would equally have operated to produce them, if no legal impediments had exiſted, or by the manifeſt delay, or negligence, or wilful omiſſion, of the claimants. 3. The amount of the loſſes and damages for which compenſation is to be made, is to be aſcertained by five commiſſioners to be appointed as follows: two by his Britannic majeſty, two by the Preſident with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, the fifth by the unanimous voice of theſe four, if they can agree, if they cannot agree, then to be taken by
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028795_0081_0FDD4A46D52F2820"/>
lot out of two perſons, one of whom to be named by the two Britiſh commiſſioners, the other by the two American commiſſioners. 4. Theſe five commiſſioners thus appointed, are before they proceed to the execution of their truſt to take an oath for its faithful diſcharge, Three of them to conſtitute a board; but there muſt be preſent one of the two commiſſioners named on each ſide, and the fifth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner. Deciſions to be made by majority of voices of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. They are firſt to meet at Philadelphia, but may adjourn from place to place as they ſee cauſe. 5. Eighteen months after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners make a board are aſſigned for receiving applications, but the commiſſioners in particular caſes may extend the term not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding 6 months. 6. The commiſſioners are empowered to take into conſideration all cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their award is to be concluſive; and the United States are to cauſe the ſum awarded in each caſe to be paid in ſpecie to the creditor without de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uction, and at ſuch time and place as ſhall have been awarded; but no payment to be required ſooner than twelve months from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty</p>
               <p>This proviſion for aſcertaining the compenſation to be made, while it is ample, is alſo well guarded.</p>
               <p>It is confined to debts contracted before the peace, and ſtill owing to the creditors. It embraces only the caſes of loſs or damage in conſequence of legal impediments to the recovery of thoſe debts which will exclude all caſes of voluntary compromiſe, and can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude none where the laws have allowed a free courſe to juſtice. It can operate in no inſtance where, at preſent, the ordinary courſe of juſtice is competent to full relief, and the debtor is ſolvent, nor in any, where inſolvency or other cauſe would have operated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the loſs or damage, if no legal impediment had exiſted, or where it has been occaſioned by the wilful delay negligence or omiſſion of the creditor.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that the commiſſioners have nevertheleſs much lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of diſcretion, and that in the exerciſe of it they may tranſgreſs the limits intended, the anſwer is, that the United States, though bound to perform what they have ſtipulated with good faith, would not be bound to ſubmit to a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nifeſt abuſe of authority by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners. Should they palpably exceed their commiſſion, or abuſe their truſt, the United States may juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fiably, though at their peril, refuſe compliance. For example, if they ſhould undertake to award upon a debt contracted ſince the peace, there could be no doubt that their award would be a nullity. So likewiſe there might be other plain caſes of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſconduct, which in honor and conſcience would exonorate the United States from performance. It is only incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon them to act bona fide, and as they act at their peril to examine well the ſoundneſs of the ground on which they proceed.</p>
               <p>With regard to the reference to commiſſiſioners to ſettle the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum of the compenſation to be made, this courſe was dictated by the

nature of the caſe. The t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is for this very reaſon of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of the ordinary tribunals to do complete juſtice, that a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſtipulation of compenſation, and a ſpecial mode of obtaining it became neceſſary. In c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nſtituting a tribunal to liquidate the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum of reparation in the caſe of a breach of treaty, it is natural and juſt to diviſe one likely to be more certainly impartial than the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed courts of either party. Without impeaching the integrity of thoſe courts, it was morally impoſſible that they ſhould not feel a bias towards the nation to which they belonged, and for that very reaſon they were unſit arbitrators. In the caſe of the ſpoliations of our property, we ſhould undoubtedly have been unwilling to leave the adjuſtment in the laſt reſort to the Britiſh courts; and by parity of reaſon, they could not be expected to refer the liquidation of compenſation in the caſe of the debts to our courts. To have preſſed this would have been to weaken our argument for a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent courſe in regard to the ſpoliations. We ſhould have been puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled to find a ſubſtantial principle of diſcrimination.</p>
               <p>If a ſpecial and extraordinary trib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> fair and equitable plan for it, than that which has been adopted. The remarks on the mode of determining the queſtion reſpecting the river St. Croix, apply in full force here, and would render a particular comment ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>To the objection of the Charleſton committee, that the article erects a tribunal unknown to our conſtitution, and transfers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners the cognizance of matters appertaining to American courts and juries, the anſwer is ſimple and concluſive. The tribunals eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the conſtitution do not contemplate a caſe between n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and nation ariſing upon a breach of treaty, and are inadequate to the cognizance of it.—Could either of them hold plea of a ſuit of Great-Britain plaintiff aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nſt the United States defendant? The caſe therefore required the erection or conſtitution of a new tribunal and it was moſt likely to promote equity to paſs by the Courts of both the parties.</p>
               <p>The ſame principle contradicts the poſition that there has been any transfer of jur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſdiction from American courts and juries to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners. It is a queſtion not between individual and individual, or between our government and individuals, but between our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the Britiſh government. Of courſe, one in which our courts and juries, have no juri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>diction. There was a neceſſity for an extraordinary tribunal to ſupply the defect of ordinary juriſdiction, and ſo far is the article from making the transfer imputed to it, that it expreſsly excepts the caſes in which effectual relief can be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ordinary courſe of juſtice.</p>
               <p>Nations acknowledging no common judge on earth, when they are willing to ſubmit the queſtons between them to a judicial deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt of neceſſity conſtitute a ſpecial tribunal for the purpoſe. The mode by commiſſioners, as being the moſt unexceptionable, has been repeatedly adopted.</p>
               <p>I proceed to reply to ſome other objections which have been made againſt the proviſion contained in this article.</p>
               <p>It is charged with fixing a ſtigma on the national character by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028795_0083_0FDD4A483ABAFD08"/>
reparation for an infraction, which, if it ever did exiſt, has been done away, there being now a free courſe to the recovery of Britiſh debts in the Courts of the United States.</p>
               <p>An anſwer to this objection has been anticipated by ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions heretofore made. The giving a free courſe to juſtice in favour of Britiſh creditors, which has been effected by the new conſtitution of the United States, though it obviates the future operation of legal impediments, does not retroſpectively repair the loſſes and damages which may have reſulted from their paſt operation. In this reſpect the effects continued and reparation was due. To promiſe it, could fix no ſtigma on our national character. That was done by the acts which created the cauſe for reparation. To make it, was as far as poſſible to remove the ſtigma.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that the promiſe of compenſation produces injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to thoſe ſtates which interpoſed no legal impediments to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of debts, by ſaddling them with a part of the burthen ariſing from the delinquencies of the tranſgreſſing ſtates. But the burden was before aſſumed by the treaty of peace. The article of that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which engaged that there ſhould be no lawful impediments to the recovery of debts, was a <hi>guarantee</hi> by the United States of juſtice to the Britiſh creditors. It charged them with the duty of taking care that there was no legal obſtacle to the recovery of the debts of thoſe creditors, and conſequently with a reſponſibility for any ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle which ſhould happen, and with the obligation of making repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it. We muſt therefore refer to the treaty of peace, not to the laſt treaty, the common charge which has been incurred by interference in the recovery of Britiſh debts. The latter only carries into execution the promiſe made by the former. It may be added that it is a condition of the ſocial compact that the nation at large ſhall make retribution to foreign nations for injuries done to them by its members.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, that Mr. Jefferſon has clearly ſhewn, that intereſt in caſes like that of the Britiſh debts, is liable, during the period of the war, to equitable abatements and deductions: and that, therefore, the diſcretion given to the commiſſioners on this head, ought not to have been as large as it appears in the article.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſon has no doubt, offered arguments of real weight to eſtabliſh the poſition that judges and juries have, and exerciſe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng reaſons for abatements of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. But it was foreign to his purpoſe and accordingly he has not attempted to particulariſe the rules which ought to govern in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this principle to the variety of caſes in which the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may ariſe—and he has himſelf noted that the practice, in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtates and in different courts, has been attended with great diverſity. Indeed, admitting the right to abate intereſt under ſpecial circumſtances, in caſes in which it is the general rule to allow it, the circumſtances of each caſe, are, perhaps, the only true criterion of the propriety of an exception. The particular nature of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, the circumſtances under which it was entered into, the relative ſituation of parties, the poſſibility or not of mutual acceſs; theſe and other things would guide and vary the exerciſe of the diſcretion to abate. It was, therefore, right to leave the commiſſioners, as they
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028795_0084_0FDD4A191F7705F0"/>
are left, in the ſame ſituation with judges and juries; to act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true equity of the ſeveral caſes, or of the ſeveral claſſes of caſes.</p>
               <p>Let it be remembered, that the government of Great-Britain has to conſult the intereſts and opinions of its citizens, as well as the government of the United States thoſe of their citizens. The only ſatisfactory courſe which the former could purſue, in reference to its merchants was to turn over the whole queſtion of intereſt as well as principal, to the commiſſioners. And as this was truly equitable, the government of the United States could make no well founded oppoſition to it.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſt object is thus provided for: 1. It is agreed, that in all caſes of irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of the veſſels and other property of citizens of the United States, under colour of authority or commiſſions from his Britannic Majeſty, in which ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate compenſation for the loſſes and damages ſuſtained, cannot, for whatever reaſon, be actually obtained in the ordinary courſe of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, full and complete compenſation for the ſame will be made by the Britiſh government to the claimants; except where the loſs or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage may have been occaſioned by the manifeſt delay, or negligence, or willful omiſſion of thoſe claimants. 2. The amount of the loſſes and damages to be compenſated is to be aſcertained by five commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, who are to be appointed in exactly the ſame manner as thoſe for liquidating the compenſation to Britiſh creditors. 3. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

The ſame term of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months is allowed for the reception of claims, with a like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to extend the term as in the caſe of Britiſh debts. 5. The award of theſe commiſſioners, or of three of them, under the like guards as in that caſe, is to be final and concluſive, both as to the juſtice of the claim and the amount of the compenſation. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Brittannic Majeſty is to cauſe the compenſation awarded, to be paid to the claimants in ſpecie, without deduction, at ſuch times and places, and upon the condition of ſuch releaſes or aſſignments, as the commiſſioners ſhall preſcribe.</p>
               <p>Maturely and diſpaſſionately examined, it is impoſſible not to be
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028795_0085_0FDD4A49D65C0F60"/>
convinced, that this proviſion is ample, and ought to be ſatisfactory. The courſe of the diſcuſſion will exhibit various proofs of the diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſneſs of the clamours againſt it, but it will be pertinent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce here one or two ſamples of it.</p>
               <p>It has been alledged, that while the article preceding and this article provide effecttually for every demand of Great Britain againſt the United States, the proviſion for this important and urgent claim of ours is neither explicit, nor efficient, nor co-extenſive with the object, nor bears any proportion to the <hi>ſummary method,</hi> adopted for the ſatisfying of Britiſh claims.</p>
               <p>This ſuggeſtion is every way unfortunate. The plan for ſatisfying our claim, except as to the deſcription of the ſubject which varies with it, is an exact copy of that for making compenſation to Britiſh creditors. Whoever will take the pains to compare, will find, that in the leading points, literal conformity is ſtudied, and that in others, the proviſions are aſſimilated by direct references; &amp; will diſcover alſo, this important diſtinction in favour of the efficiency and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marineſs of the proviſion for our claim—that while the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners are expreſsly reſtricted from awarding payment to Britiſh creditors, to be made ſooner than one year after the exchange of ratifications of the treaty, they are free to award it, to be made the very day of their deciſion, for the ſpoliations of our property. As to the compenſation for Britiſh property, captured within our limits, or by veſſels originally armed in our ports and not reſtored, which is the only other Britiſh claim that has been provided for, it happens that this forming a part of the very article we are conſidering, is ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the identical mode of relief, which is inſtituted for making ſatisfaction to us.</p>
               <p>So far then is it from being true, that a compariſon of the modes of redreſs provided by the treaty, for the complaints of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parties, turns to our diſadvantage, that the real ſtate of the caſe exhibits a ſubſtantial ſimilitude with only one material difference, and that in our favour; and, that a ſtrong argument for the equity of the proviſions on each ſide, is to be drawn from their cloſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of each other.</p>
               <p>The other ſuggeſtion alluded to, and which has been ſhameleſsly reiterated, is, that Denmark and Sweden, by purſuing a more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted conduct, had obtained better terms than the United States. It is even pretended, that one or both of them had actually recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Great Britain a groſs ſum on account—in anticipation of an ultimate liquidation. In my ſecond number, the erroneouſneſs of the ſuppoſition, that thoſe powers had obtained more than the United States was intimated, but the ſubſequent repetition of the idea, more covertly in print, and very openly and confidently in converſation, renders expedient an explicit and peremptory denial of the fact.

                  </gap>quiſite to advert to a colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral meaſure which was alſo a fruit of the miſſion to Great Britain, and which ought to be taken in conjunction with the ſtipulation in this article. I refer to the order of the Britiſh king in council, of the 6th of Auguſt, 1794, by which order, the door before ſhut by lapſe of time, is opened to appeals from the Britiſh Weſt India courts of admiralty, to be brought at any time which ſhall be judged reaſonable by the lords commiſſioners of appeals in prize cauſes. This of itſelf was no inconſiderable ſtep to wards the redreſs of our grievances, and it may be hoped, that with the aid which the government of the United States has given to facilitate appeals, much relief may enſue from this meaſure. It will not be wonderful if it ſhould comport with the pride and policy of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by pronouncing juſtice in their courts, to leave as little as poſſible to be done by the commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>A cavil has been raiſed on the meaning of the word, colour, which it is pretended would not reach the caſes deſigned to be entraced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſpoliations complained of, were made, not merely by <hi>colour,</hi> but actually by <hi>virtue</hi> of inſtructions from the Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tiſh government.</p>
               <p>For the very reaſon, that this ſubtil and artificial meaning aſcribed to the term, would tend to defeat the manifeſt general intent of the main proviſion of the article, which is plainly to give reparation, for regular or illegal captures or condemnations of American pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, contrary to the laws of nations—that meaning muſt be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inadmiſſible.</p>
               <p>But in fact, the expreſſion is the moſt accurate that could have been uſed, to ſignify the real intent of the article. When we ſay a thing was done by colour of an authority or commiſſion, we mean one of three things; that it was done on the pretence of a <hi>ſufficient</hi> authority or commiſſion <hi>not validly</hi> imparted, or on the pretence of <hi>ſuch</hi> an authority or commiſſion <hi>validly</hi> imparted but <hi>abuſed</hi> or <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied,</hi> or on the pretence of an <hi>inſufficient</hi> authority or commiſſion regularly, as to form imparted and exerciſed.—It denotes a defect of rightful and juſt authority, whether emanating from a wrong ſource, or improperly from a right ſource; whereas the phraſe, "by virtue of," is moſt properly applicable to the valid exerciſe of a valid authority. But the two phraſes are not unfrequently uſed as ſynonimous. Thus in the proclamation of the Britiſh king, of the 25th of May, 1792, he among other things forbids all his ſubjeſts, by <hi>virtue</hi> or under <hi>colour</hi> of any foreign commiſſion or letters of or repriſals to diſturb, infeſt, or damage the ſubjects of France.</p>
               <p>In whoſe mouths does the article put the expreſſion? In thoſe of citizens of the United States? What muſt they be preſumed to have meant? Clearly this; that by colour of inſtructions or commiſſions of his Brittannie majeſty, either exerciſed erroneouſly, or iſſued er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly, as being contrary to the laws of nations; the citizens of the United States had ſuffered loſs and damage by irregular or illegal

The great ſource of grievance, intended to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed by the article, proceeded from the inſtruction of the 6th No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1793. That inſtruction directs the commanders of ſhips of war and privateers, to ſtop and detain all ſhips laden with goods, the produce of any colony belonging to France, or carrying proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and other ſupplies for the uſe of ſuch colony, and to bring the ſame with their cargoes to <hi>legal adjudication</hi> in the Britiſh courts of admiralty. Theſe terms "<hi>legal adjudication</hi>" were certainly not equivalent, upon any rational conſtruction to <hi>condemnation.</hi> Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication means ſimply a judicial deciſion, which might be either to acquit or condemn.

               <p>The Britiſh cabinet have diſavowed this conſtruction of the Weſt India courts, and have as we have ſeen, by a ſpecial act of interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, opened a door which was before ſhut to a reverſal of their ſentences, by appeal to the courts in England. We find alſo that the term adjudication is uſed in the XVIIth article of our late treaty as ſynonimous only with judicial d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ciſion, according to its true import. This if any thing were wanting, would render it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the commiſſioners to refuſe redreſs on the ground of the condemnations, if otherwiſe illegal, being warranted by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſenſe of the words legal adjudication. But in reality, as before obſerved, their commiſſion will be to award compenſation in all caſes in which they are of opinion, that according to the eſtabliſhed laws of nations, captures or condemnations were irregular or illegal, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever otherwiſe authoriſed; and this in contempt of the quibbling criticiſm which has been ſo cunningly deviſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. The proviſion under conſideration, obliges the Britiſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in all caſes of illegal captures or condemnations, in which adequate compenſation cannot, for whatever reaſon, be actually had in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, to make full and complete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to the claimants which is to be paid in ſpecie to themſelves without deduction at ſuch times and places as ſhall be awarded.</p>
               <p>They are not ſent for redreſs to the captors, for obliged to take any circuitious courſe for their payment, but are to receive it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the treaſury of Great Britain.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. The amount of the compenſation in each caſe is to be fixed by five commiſſioners, two appointed by the United States, two by Great Britain; the fifth by theſe four, or in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:028795_0088_0FDD4A1BF8228F48"/>It ſeems impoſſible, as has been obſerved and ſhewn in the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous caſes, to imagine a plan for organizing a tribunal more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely equitable and impartial than this—while it is the exact coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart of the one which is to decide on the claims of Britiſh creditors. Could it have been believed that ſo palpable an error could have been impoſed on a town meeting in the face of ſo plain a proviſion, as to induce it to charge againſt this article, that in a national concern of the United States, redreſs was left to Britiſh courts of admiralty? yet, ſtrange as it may appear, this did happen even in the truly enlightened town of Boſton—The juſt pride of that town will not quickly forget that it has been ſo compromitted.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that according to the common uſage of nations, the courts of admiralty of the belligerent parties are the channels through which the redreſs of injuries to neutrals is ſought. But Great Britain has been brought to agree to refer all the caſes in which juſtice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained through thoſe channels, to an extraordinary tribunal —in other words to arbitrators mutually appointed.</p>
               <p>It is here, that we find the reparation of the natitional wrong which we had ſuffered. In admitting the principle of compenſation by the government itſelf, in agreeing to an extraordinary tribunal, in the conſtitution of which the parties having an equal voice to liquidate that compenſation.—Great Britain has virtually and effectually acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the injury which had been done to our neutral rights, and has conſented t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> make ſatisfaction for it. This was an apology in fact, however it may be in form.</p>
               <p>As it regards our honour, this is anadequate, atonement, and the only cies uſual in ſimilar caſes between nations; pecuniary compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the true reparation in ſuch caſes—governments are not apt to go upon their knees to aſk pardon of other governments—Great Britain, in the recent inſtance of the diſpute with Spain, about Nootha Sound, was glad to accept of a like reparation. It merits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, incidentally, that the inſtrument which ſettles this diſpute expreſsly waves, like our treaty, reference to the merits of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and pretenſions of the reſpective parties. Is our ſituation ſuch as to authoriſe us to pretend to impoſe humiliating conditions on other nations?</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between injuries and inſults, which we are too apt to confound. The ſeizures and ſpoilations of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty fall moſt truly under the former head. The acts which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, embraced all the neutral powers, were not particularly levelled at us, bore no mark of an intention to humble us by any peculiar indignity or outrage.</p>
               <p>Theſe acts are of June 8th, and of November 6th, 1793. The ſeizure of our veſſels going with proviſions to the dominions of France, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt was put on the double ground of a war extraordinary in its principle<note n="*" place="bottom">Though this country has viewed the principle of the war fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, it is certain that Europe generally, the neutral powers not wholly excepted, has viewed it in a different light, ſo that this wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

opinion, ill founded. It was accompanid alſo by compenſation for what was taken, and other circumſtances that evinced a deſire to ſmooth the act. The indiſcriminate confiſcation of our property, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the order of the 6th November, which was the truly flagrant inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was certainly unwarranted by that order (and no ſecret one has appeared)—and the matter has been ſo explained by the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It is clear that evils ſuffered under acts ſo circumſtanced are injuries rather than inſults—and are ſo much the more managea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to the ſpecies and meaſure of redreſs. It would be quiox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to aſſert that we might not honourably accept in ſuch a caſe the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and immediate indemnification, or at leaſt a payment upon account.</p>
               <p>A little calm reflection will convince us that neither of the two laſt things was to be expected. There was abſolutely no criterion, either for a full indemnification, or for an advance upon account. The value of the property ſeized and condemned (laying out of the caſe, damages upon captures where condemnation had not enſued) was not aſcertained, even to our own government, with any tolerable accuracy. Every well informed man will think it probable, that of this a proportion not inconſiderable was covered French property. There were, therefore, no adequate data, upon which our government could demand, or the Britiſh government pay a determinate ſum. Both governments muſt have acted eſſentially by gueſs.—Ours could not in honour or conſcience have made even an eſtimate but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on evidence. It might have happened that a ſum which appeared upon the evidence that had been collected ſufficient, might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on further evidence inſufficient.—Too little as well as too much, might have been demanded and paid. But it will perhaps be ſaid, that ſome groſs eſtimate might have been formed; and that of this, ſuch a part might have been advanced upon account, as was within the narroweſt probable limit, liable to eventual adjuſtment. Let us for a moment ſuppoſe this done—What good end would it have anſwered? How could the United States have diſtributed this money among the ſufferers till it was aſcertained which of them was truly entitled, and to how much? Is it not evident, that if they had made any diſtribution before the final &amp; perfect inveſtigation of the right of each claimant, it would be at the riſk of making miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payments, and of being obliged to replace the ſums miſpaid, perhaps at a loſs to the United States, for the benefit of thoſe who ſhould be found to be better entitled? Would it have been expedient for our government to have incurred this riſk to its conſtituents?—And if the money was to be held undiſtributed till an inveſtigation of claims was completed, to what purpoſe the haſte about an advance?</p>
               <p>On the other hand; is it in this looſe groſs way that nations tranſact affairs with each other? Do even individuals make indemnificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to one another in ſo lumping a manner? Could it be expected of Great-Britain, that ſhe would pay till it was fairly aſcertained what was to be paid; eſpecially when ſhe had too much cauſe to ſuſpect, that a material proportion of the property claimed might turn out to be French? Would it have been juſtifiable on our part, to
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028795_0090_0FDD4A90426A58E0"/>
make her compliance with ſuch a demand, the <hi>ſine qua non</hi> of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation and peace? Whoever will believe that ſhe would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled with ſo humiliating a requiſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt be perſuaded that we were in a condition to dictate, and ſhe in a condition to be obliged to receive any terms that we might think fit to preſcribe? The perſon who can believe this muſt be, in my opinion, under the influence of a delirium, for which there is no cure in the reſources of reaſon and argument.</p>
               <p>If it muſt be admitted that it was matter of neceſſity that inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould precede p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ment; then I ſee not what more ſummary mode could have been deviſed? Who more capable of proceeding with diſpatch than arbitrators untrammeled with legal forms; veſted with powers to examine parties and others, on oath, and to command and receive all evidence in their own way? Here are all the means of expedition diveſted of every clog.</p>
               <p>Eighteen months are allowed for preferring claims, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners are at liberty to adjuſt them as faſt as they are preferred. In every caſe in which it appears to them <hi>bona fide,</hi> that the ordinary courſe of juſtice is inadequate to relief, they may forthwith proceed to examine and decide. There is no impediment, no cauſe of delay whatever, more than the nature of a due inveſtigation always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>The meeting of the commiſſioners at London was recommended by the circumſtance, that the admiralty courts were likely to concenter there, a conſiderable part of the evidence on which they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; which upon the whole might favour diſpatch as well as more complete juſtice. In many caſes the deciſions of thoſe courts may come under their review.</p>
               <p>As to uncertainty of the event, this, as far as it may be true, was inſeparable from any plan, bottomed on the idea of a previous inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of claims; and it has been ſhewn, that ſome ſuch plan was reaſonable and inevitable.</p>
               <p>It may be alſo added, that the plan affords a moral certainty of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial juſtice, which is all that can rationnally be expected in ſimilar affairs. Compenſation where due is explicitly ſtipulated: A fair and adequate mode of deciding and liquidating it has been ſettled. All the arguments which were adduced to prove the probability of good faith, in regard to the poſts, apply equally to this ſubject. The inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt which every nation has in the preſervation of character, and which the moſt profligate dare not entirely diſregard. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of defeating the fulfilment of the ſtipulations on our part, —the ſize of the object, certainly not of great magnitude—the very diſcouraging ſituation for replunging ſuddenly into a new war, in which the preſent war will in every event leave Great Britain. Theſe are reaſons which afford ſolid ground of aſſurances that there will be no evaſion of performance.</p>
               <p>As to the commiſſioners, two of the five will certainly be of our choice, a third may be ſo likewiſe; but ſhould it prove otherwiſe, it will be ſurpriſing if one of the other three, all acting under oath, and having character at ſtake, ſhall not be diſpoſed to do us reaſonable juſtice.</p>

in each caſe is to be concluſive, and the rules which are to govern it, as preſcribed by the article, are the merits of each caſe, juſtice, equity, and the laws of nations.

               <p>The general and unqualified reference to the laws of nations diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes all pretence to ſubſtitute arbitrary regulations of G. Britain as rules of deciſion. Her inſtructions or orders, if incompatible with thoſe laws, are nullities.</p>

Theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are in ſubſtance, that the compenſation promiſed is of great and indefinite extent and amount; that an enormous expence is likely to be incurred; and that it is difficult to prove, that a neutral nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is under an obliga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It does not extend to a ſingle caſe where the property, if taken within our juriſdiction, was immediately carried out of our reach—or where, if taken without our juriſdiction, it was never brought within our reach, or where if at any time within our reach due means were employed without ſucceſs to effect reſtitution.</p>
               <p>It will follow from this, that the caſes within the purview of the ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticle muſt be very few—for, except with regard to three prizes made in the firſt inſtance, where ſpecial conſiderations reſtrained the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from interpoſing, there has been a regular and conſtant effort of the executive, in which our courts have efficaciouſly co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, to reſtore prizes made within our juriſdiction, or by veſſels armed in our ports. The extent or amount, therefore, of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to be made, can by no poſſible means be conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Let us, however, examine if the conſtruction I give to the clauſe be the true one.</p>
               <p>It is in theſe words:—"It is agreed that in all ſuch caſes where <hi>reſtitution</hi> ſhall not have been made <hi>agreeably</hi> to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jefferſon to Mr. Hammond, dated September 5th, 1793, a copy of which is annexed to this treaty, the complaints of the parties ſhall be and hereby are referred to the commiſſioners to be appointed by virtue of this article, who are hereby authoriſed and required to proceed in the like manner relative to theſe as to the other caſes committed to them, and the United States undertake to pay to the complainants in ſpecie, without deduction, the amount of ſuch ſums as ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The letter of Mr. Jefferſon, by this reference to it and its annexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the treaty, is made virtually a part of the treaty. The caſes in which compenſation is promiſed are expreſsly thoſe in which <hi>reſtitution</hi> has not been made <hi>agreeable to the tenor of that letter.</hi>

The additional caſes of which an expectation of compenſation is given in this part of the letter, muſt ſtand on <hi>ſimilar ground with thoſe before deſcribed</hi>—that is they muſt be characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the two circumſtances of a <hi>bringing within our ports</hi> and a <hi>neglect to uſe all the means in our power</hi> for their reſtitution.

               <p>The reſidue of the letter merely contains ſuggeſtions for giving effect to the foregoing aſſurances.</p>
               <p>This analyſis leaves no doubt that the true conſtruction is ſuch as I have ſtated.—Can there be any greater doubt that the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given by the Preſident in the firſt inſtance, and which have been only ratified by the treaty were in themſelves proper, and have been properly ratified?</p>

               <p>And our courts have adopted in its fulleſt latitude, as conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their opinion with thoſe laws, the principle of reſtitution of property, when either captured within our juriſdiction, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where by veſſels armed in our ports. The ſupreme court of the United States has given to this doctrine by ſolemn dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſions the moſt complete and comprehenvſie ſanction.</p>
               <p>It is, therefore, undoubtedly the law of the land, determined by the proper conſtitutional tribunal in the laſt reſort, that <hi>reſtitution is due</hi> in the abovementioned caſes.</p>
               <p>And it is a direct and neceſſary conſequence from this, that where it is not made by reaſon of the neglect of the government to uſe the means in its power for the purpoſe.—There reſults an obligation to make reparation. For between nations, as between individuals, wherever there exiſts a perfect obligation to do a thing, there is a
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028795_0095_0FDD4A7D759767F8"/>
concomitant obligation to make reparation for omiſſions and neglects.</p>
               <p>The Preſident was, therefore, moſt ſtrictly juſtifiable, upon princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the opinion which he communicated, that in the caſes of ſuch omiſſions or neglects, compenſation ought to be made. And in point of policy, nothing could be wiſer; for had he not done it, there is the higheſt probability that war would have enſued.</p>
               <p>Our treaty with France forbids us expreſsly to permit the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers of the enemy to arm in our ports, or to bring or ſell there the prizes which they have made upon her. We could not, for that reaſon, have made the privilege of arming in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ports if it had been allowed to France reciprocal—The allowance of it to her would conſequently have been a clear violation of neutrality, in the double ſenſe of permitting a military aid, and of permitting it to the one and refuſing it to the other. Had we ſuffered France to equip privateers in our ports to cruize thence upon her enemies, and to bring back and vend there the ſpoils or prizes taken, we ſhould have become by this the moſt miſchievous foe they could have: For while all our naval reſources might have augmented the force of France, our neutrality, if tolerated, would in a great degree have ſheltered and protected her cruiſers. Such a ſtate of things no nation at war could have acquieſced in.—And as well to the efficacy of our endeavours to prevent equipments in our ports, as to the proof of the ſincerity of thoſe endeavours, it was eſſential that we ſhould reſtore the prizes which came within our reach, made by veſſels armed in our ports. It is known, that notwithſtanding the utmoſt efforts of the government to prevent it, French privateers have been clandeſtinely equipped in ſome of our ports ſubſequent to the aſſurances which were given that the practice would be diſcountenanced. If prizes made by ſuch veſſels were ſuffered to be brought into our ports and ſold there, this would be not only a very great encouragement to the practice, but it would be impoſſible that it ſhould be regarded in any other light than as a connivance. In ſuch circumſtances can we blame our chief magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate? Can we even deny him praiſe for having diverted an imminent danger to our peace, by incurring the reſponſibility of giving an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of compenſation? The conjuncture we may remember was critical and urgent. Congreſs were at the time in receſs. A due notice to convene them in ſo extenſive a country, can hardly be rated at leſs than three months.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation our envoy found the buſineſs. It is not true, in the ſenſe in which it has been advanced, that he was to be governed by the fitneſs of the thing, unmindful of the opinion of the Preſident. An opinion of the chief magiſtrate of the Union, was to a diploma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic agent an authority and a guide, which he could not juſtifiably have diſregarded.—The claim of compenſation on the other ſide was greatly fortified by that opinion. Nor was it a matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to our national delicacy and dignity, that the expectation given by it ſhould be fulfilled.—It would have been indecent in our Envoy to have reſiſted it. It was proper in him, by acceding to it, to refer the matter to the ultimate deciſion of that authority, which by our conſtitution is charged with the power of making treaties. It was the more proper, becauſe the thing was intrinſically right. Every candid man, every good citizen, will rejoice that the Preſident
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028795_0096_0FDD1CAF0D88A150"/>
acted as he did in the firſt inſtance—that our envoy acted as he did in the ſecond, and that the conduct of both has received the final conſtitutional ſanction.</p>
               <p>The opinions of Mr. Jefferſon, when they can be turned to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of the treaty are with its adverſaries oracular truths— When they are to ſupport it, they loſe all their weight. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pment had been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated by our government. This toleration was to be inferred, as well from a forbearance to ſuppreſs thoſe veſſels when they came within our power, as from an original permiſſion. Had compenſation been ſtipulated on this ſcale, it is not certain that it would not have amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to as much more than that which has been promiſed, as would counterbalance our claims for negroes carried away, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the poſts. But, inſtead of this, it is narrowed down by the treaty to ſuch prizes of thoſe veſſels as were brought within our ports, and in reſpect to which we fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e eſtates and titles therein; and may grant, ſell, or deviſe the ſame to whom they pleaſe, in like manner as if they were natives; and that neither they nor their heirs or aſſigns, ſo far as may reſpect the ſaid lands, and the legal remedies incident thereto, ſhall be regarded as aliens.</p>
               <p>The miſapprehenſion of this article, which was firſt uſhered into public view, in a very incorrect and inſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ious ſhape, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to amount to the grant of an indefinite and permanent right to Britiſh ſubjects to hold lands in the United States, did more it is believed to excite prejudices againſt the treaty than any thing that is really contained in it. And yet when truly underſtood, it is found to be nothing more than a confirmation of thoſe rights to lands, which, prior to the treaty, the laws of the ſeveral ſtates allowed Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to hold; with this inconſiderable addition, that the heirs and aſſigns of thoſe perſons, though aliens, may hold the ſame lands: but no right whatever is given to lands of which our laws did not permit and legaliſe the acquiſition.</p>
               <p>Theſe propoſitions will now be elucidated.</p>
               <p>The term, HOLD, in the legal code of G. Britain, and of theſe ſtates, has the ſame, &amp; that a preciſe technical ſenſe. It imports a capacity legally and rightfully to have and enjoy real eſtate, and is contra-diſtinguiſhed from the mere capacity of taking or purchaſing, which is ſometimes applicable to the acquiſition of a thing, that is forfeited by the very act of acquiſition. Thus an alien may take real eſtate by purchaſe, but he cannot hold it. <hi>Holding</hi> is ſynonimous with <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure</hi> which in the feudal ſyſtem implies <hi>fealty,</hi> of which an alien is incapable. Land, therefore, is forfeited to the government the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant it paſſes to an alien. The Roman law nullifies the contract en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, ſo that nothing paſſes by the grant of land to an alien:—but our law, derived from that of England, permits the land to paſs for the purpoſe of forfeiure to the ſtate. This is not the caſe with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to deſcent, becauſe the ſucceſſion or tranſmiſſion there, being an act of law, and the alien being diſqualified to hold, the law conſiſtent with itſelf, caſts no eſtate upon him.</p>
               <p>The following legal authorities, ſelected from an infinite number of ſimilar ones, eſttabliſh the above poſitions, viz. Coke on Littleton, p. 2.3. "Some men have capacity to <hi>purchaſe</hi> but <hi>no</hi> ability to <hi>hold.</hi> Some capacity to <hi>purchaſe,</hi> and ability to <hi>hold</hi> or not to <hi>hold,</hi> at the election of themſelves and others. Some capacity to <hi>take</hi> and <hi>hold.</hi>—Some neither capacity to <hi>take</hi> nor to <hi>hold.</hi> And ſome are ſpecially diſabled to <hi>take</hi> ſome particular thing. If an alien chriſtian or infidel purchaſe houſes, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, to him and his heirs, albeit he can have no heirs, yet he is of capacity to <hi>take</hi> a fee ſimple, but not to <hi>hold.</hi>" The ſame, p. 8. "If a man,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028795_0098_0FDD4A51514C11F0"/>
ſeized of lands in fee, hath iſſue an alien, he cannot be heir <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per defectum ſubjectiouis.</hi>" Blackſtone's Commentaries, book III. chap. xviii. § 2, "Alienation to an alien is a cauſe of forfeiture to the crown of the lands ſo alienated, not only on account of his inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to <hi>hold</hi> them, but likewiſe on account of his preſumption in attempting by an act of his own to acquire real property." Idem, chap. xix. § 1. "The caſe of an alien born, is alſo peculiar, for he may <hi>purchaſe</hi> a thing, but after purchaſe he can <hi>hold</hi> nothing, except a leaſe for years of a houſe for the convenience of merchandize."</p>
               <p>Thus it is evident, that by the laws of England, which it will not be denied, agree in principle with ours, an alien may <hi>take,</hi> but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>hold</hi> lands.</p>
               <p>It is equally clear, the laws of both countries, agreeing in this particular, that the word <hi>hold</hi> uſed in the article under conſideration, muſt be underſtood according to thoſe laws, and therefore can only apply to thoſe caſes in which there was a legal capacity to <hi>hold,</hi> in other words, thoſe in which our laws &amp; thoſe of Great Britain permitted the ſubjects &amp; citizens of the two parties to hold lands in the territories of each other. Some of theſe caſes exiſted prior to the treaty of peace, and where confiſcations had not taken place, there has never been a doubt that the property was effectually protected by that treaty. Others have ariſen ſince that treaty under ſpecial ſtatutes, of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtates. Whether there are any others depending on principles of common law, need not be enquired into here, ſince the late treaty will neither ſtrengthen nor impair the operation of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>Whatever lands, therefore, may have been purchaſed by any Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubject ſince the treaty of peace, which the laws of the ſtate wherein they were purchaſed did not permit him to acquire and hold, are entirely out of the protection of the article under conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; the purchaſe will not avail him; the forfeiture which was incurred by it is ſtill in full force. As to thoſe lands which the laws of a ſtate allowed him to purchaſe and hold, he owes his title to them, not to the treaty.</p>
               <p>Let us recur to the words of the article, "Britiſh ſubjects who <hi>now hold</hi> lands, ſhall continue to <hi>hold</hi> them <hi>according to the nature and tenure of their reſpective eſtates and titles therein.</hi>" But it has been ſeen, that to hold lands is to own them in a legal and competent capacity, and that an alien has no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch capacity. The lands, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which by reaſon of the alienage of a Britiſh ſubject, he could not, prior to the treaty, leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lly purchaſe and hold—he cannot under the treaty continue to hold. As if it was deſigned to render this concluſion palpable, the proviſion goes on to ſay, "<hi>According to the nature and tenure of their reſpective ſtates and titles therein.</hi>" This is equivalent to ſaying they ſhall continue to hold as they before held. If they had no valid eſtate or title before, they will of courſe continue to have none. The expreſſions neither give any new, nor enlarge any old eſtate.</p>
               <p>The ſucceeding clauſes relate only to deſcents or alienation of the land originally legally holden. Here the diſability of alienage is taken away from the heirs and aſſſigns of the primitive proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. While this will conduce to private juſtice, by enabling the families and friends of the individuals to enjoy their property by
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028795_0099_0FDD4A82A31D2E78"/>
deſcent or deviſe, which it is preſumable, was the main object of the proviſion, there is no conſideration of national policy that weighs againſt it. If we admit the whole force of the argument, which oppoſes the expediency of permitting aliens to hold lands (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I ſhall barely remark here that it is contrary to the practice of ſeveral of the States, and to a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>actice from which ſome of them have hitherto derived material advantages) the extent to which the principle is affected by the preſent Treaty, is too limited to be felt; and in the rapid mutations of property, it will every day dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. Every alienation of a parcel of the privileged land to a citizen of the United States, will, as to that land, by interrupting the chain, put an end to the future operation of the privilege; and the lapſe of no great number of years may be expected to make an entire revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the property, ſo as to diveſt the whole of privilege.</p>
               <p>To manifeſt the unreaſonableneſs of the loud and virulent clamour, which was raiſed againſt this article, it has been obſerved by the friends of the inſtrument, that our treaty with France not only grants a much larger privi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ege to the citizens of France, but goes the full length of removing univerſally and perpetually from them the diſability of alieniſm, as to the ownerſhip of lands. This poſition has been flatly denied by ſome of the writers on the other ſide Decius, in particular, after taking pains to ſhew that it is erroneous; that the terms, "Goods moveable and immoveable," in the article of our treaty with France, mean only chattels real and perſonal in the ſenſe of our law, and exclude a right to the freehold and inheritance of lands, triumphantly plumes himſelf on a detection of the fallacy of the writer of certain "Candid Remarks on the Treaty," who gave the interpretation above ſtated to that article.</p>
               <p>The error of Decius' interpretation, proceeds from a miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the term Goods in the Engliſh tranſlation of the article, to which he annexes the meaning aſſigned to that term in our law, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reſorting as he ought to have done, to the French laws, for the true meaning of the correſpondent term biens, which is that uſed in the French original. Goods, in our law, no doubt mean chattel intereſts; but goods, or "biens," in the French law, mean all kinds of property, real as well as perſonal. It is equivalent to, and derived from, the term "bona" in the Roman law, anſwering moſt nearly to "eſtates," in our law, and embracing inheritances in land, corporeal and incorporeal hereditaments, as well as property in moveable things. When it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh one ſpecies from another, it is done by an adjective; <hi>biens meubles et immeubles,</hi>" an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to <hi>bona</hi> or <hi>res mobilia, et immobilia,</hi> things moveable and immoveable, eſtates real and perſonal.

Sect. 1.</note> will ſhew the analogy of theſe different terms in the three differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent languages; but for fixing the preciſe ſenſe of thoſe uſed in the treaty; I have ſelected and ſhall quote two authorities from French books, which are clear and concluſive on the point.

In our treaty with France they are tranſlated goods; but it is evidently a great miſtake to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the expreſſion in the limited ſenſe of our law. Being a mere word of tranſlation, it muſt be underſtood according to the meaning of the French text: for it is declared in the concluſion of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it was originally compoſed and concluded in the French Tongue. Moreover, the term goods, when uſed in our langu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having now eſtabliſhed the true meaning of the terms, "goods, moveable and immoveable," let us proceed with this guide to a review of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e article.</p>
               <p>Its firſt and principal feature is, "that the ſubjects and inhabitants of the United States, or any of them, ſhall not be reputed Aubains in France. This is the ſame as if it had been ſaid, "they ſhall not be reputed Aliens." For the definition of Aubains, as given in the work before firſt cited, is this, "Aubains are perſons not born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of the King;" the exact equivalent of the defi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nition of Alien in the Engliſh law. If our citizens are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>puted Aliens in France, it follows, that they muſt be exempted from alien diſabilities, and muſt have the ſame rights with natives, as to acquiring, conveying, and ſucceeding to real and other eſtate. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the article, having pronunced that our citizens ſhall not be reputed aliens in France, proceeds to draw certain conſequences. The firſt is, that they ſhall not be ſubject to the droit d'aubaine. The droit d'aubaine was under the monarchy, one of the regalia; it was the right of the prince to ſucceed to all eſtates or property ſituate in the kingdom, belonging to foreigners, who died without legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate children born in the kingdom.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that the laws of France permitted foreigners to acquire and hold even real eſtates, ſubject to this right of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, in caſe of demiſe without iſſue born under his allegiance. But this right of the ſovereign, as to American citizens, is abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the treaty; ſo that their legal repreſentatives, wherever born, may ſucceed to all the property, real or perſonal, which they may have acquired in France.</p>
               <p>And in conformity with this, it is further declared, that they may by teſtament, donation or otherwiſe, diſpoſe of their goods, move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and immoveable (that is, as we have ſeen, their eſtates, real and perſonal) in favour of ſuch perſons as to them ſhall appear good, and that their heirs, ſubjects of the United States, whether reſiding in France or elſewhere, may ſucceed to them, ab inteſtato, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to obtain letters of naturalization.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſtipulations on the part of France; and they a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mount to a removal from the citizens of the United States of alien diſabilities in that country, as to property. I ſay as to property, becauſe as to civil and eccleſiaſtical employments, it ſeems to have
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028795_0102_0FDD4A5433352568"/>
been a principle of the French law, that the incapacity of foreigners could only be removed by ſpecial diſpenſations, directed to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular object.</p>
               <p>What are the correlative ſtipulations on the part of the United States? They are in theſe terms "the ſubjects of the moſt Chriſtian King ſhall enjoy on their part, in all the dominions of the ſaid States, an entire and perfect reciprocity relative to the ſtipulations contained in this article. But it is at the ſame time agreed, that its contents ſhall not affect the laws made or that may be made hereafter in France againſt emigrations, which ſhall remain in all their force and vigour, and the United States on their part, or any of them ſhall be at liberty to enact ſuch laws relative to that matter as to them ſhall appear proper."</p>
               <p>Since then the article removes from our citizens the diſabilities of aliens as to property in France, and ſtipulates for her citizens, an entire and perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It appears, that the ſenſe both of the French and of the American go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, has correſponded with this conſtruction.</p>

               <p>The fixing the true ſenſe of the article in the treaty with Great-Britain is alone a refutation of moſt of the objections which have been made to it, by ſhewing, that they apply not to what really exiſts, but to a quite different thing. It may be uſeful, however, to paſs them briefly in review with ſome curſory remarks.</p>
               <p>The article, it is ſaid, infringes the rights of the ſtates, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the obligation of private contracts, permits aliens to hold real eſtates againſt the fundamental policy of our laws, and at the hazard
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028795_0103_0FDD4A85B3E0CEB8"/>
of introducing a dangerous foreign influence; is unequal, becauſe no American has been hardy enough ſince the peace to purchaſe land in England, while millions of acres have been purchaſed by Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in our country with knowledge of the riſk—is not warranted by the example of any other treaty we have made? for if even, that with France ſhould contain a ſimilar proviſion (which is denied) ſtill the difference of circum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tances would make it an in appoſite prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſince this was a treaty made flagrante bello, in a ſituation which juſtified ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>Theſe objections have been formally made and explicitly urged. One writer, afraid of riſking a direct aſſertion, but infidiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to inſinuate miſconception, contents himſelf with putting a queſtion. What, ſays he, will be the effect of this article as to the revival of the claims of Britiſh ſubjects, traitors or exiles?</p>
               <p>As to the infraction of the rights of the States, this it is preſumed, muſt relate to the depriving them of forfeitures of alien property. But as the article gives no right to a Britiſh ſubject to hold any lands which the laws of a ſtate did not previouſly authoriſe him to hold —it prevents no forfeiture to which he was ſubject by them, and conſequently deprives no ſtate of the benefit of any ſuch forfeiture. With regard to eſcheats for want of qualified heirs, it depended on every proprietor to avoid them by alienation to citizens.</p>
               <p>As to impairing the obligation of private contracts, it is difficult to underſtand what is meant. Since land, purchaſed by an alien, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the former proprietor, and becomes forfeited to the ſtate, can it be afterwards the ſubject of a valid private contract? If the effect of the artic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e was to confirm a defective title derived from the alien, how could this impair <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he obligation of any other private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract concerning it? But whatever may be intended, it is enough to ſay, that the article does not confirm the title to any land which was not before good. So that the ground of the objection fails.</p>
               <p>As to permitting aliens to hold land contrary to the policy of our laws, it has been ſhewn, that on a true conſtruction, it only applies to the very limited caſe of the alien heirs and aſſigns of perſons who before right fully he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d lands, and is confined to the identical lands ſo previouſly holden. that its greateſt effect muſt be inſignificant, and that this effect will continually decreaſe.</p>
               <p>As to the millions of acres ſaid to have been purchaſed by Britiſh ſubjects ſince the peace, it has been ſhewn that if by the laws of the States in which the purchaſes were made, they were illegally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, they ſtill remain in the ſituation in which they were before the treaty.</p>
               <p>As to there being no precedent of a ſimilar ſtipulation with any other country; it has been proved that with France we have one much broader. The idea that this was a ſacrifice to the neceſſity of our ſituation, flagrante bello, is new. Are we then to underſtand that we are in this inſtance gave to France, as the price of her aſſiſtance, a privilege in our country which leads to the introduction of a foreign influence, dangerous to our independence and proſperity! For to this reſult tends the argument concerning the policy of the excluſion of aliens. Or is it that no privilege granted to France can be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous?</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are not orthodox enough to adopt this laſt poſition,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028795_0104_0FDD4A55DE00D110"/>
may nevertheleſs tranquilize themſelves about the conſequences. This is not the channel through which a dangerous foreign influence can aſſail us. Notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps bear a ſerious argument, whether the permiſſion to foreigners to hold lands in our country, might not, by the operation of private intereſt, give us more influence upon foreign countries, than they will ever acquire upon us from the holding of thoſe lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be this as it may, could we not appeal to ſome good patriots, as they ſtire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by way of eminence, for the truth of the obſervation, that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign governments have more direct and powerful means of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than can ever reſult from the right in queſtion?</p>
               <p>Moreover, there was a peculiar reaſon for the proviſion which has been made in our laſt treaty, not applicable to any treaty with another country. The former relative ſituation of the United States and Great Britain led to the poſſeſſion of lands by the citizens of each in the reſpective territories. It was natural and juſt to ſecure by treaty their free tranſmiſſion to the heirs and aſſigns of the parties.</p>
               <p>As to the revival of the claims of traitors or exiles; if property con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated and taken away, is property holden by thoſe who have been deprived of it, then may there be ground for alarm on this ſcore. How painful is it to behold ſuch groſs attempts to deceive a whole people on ſo momentous a queſtion? How <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The virulence with which this article has been attacked, cannot fail to excite very painful ſenſations in every mind duly impreſſed with the ſanctity of public faith, and with the importance of national credit and character; at the ſame time that it furniſhes the moſt cogent reaſons to deſire, that the preſervation of peace may obviate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text and the temptation to fully the honour, and wound the intereſts of the country, by a meaſure which the truly enlightened of every nation would condemn.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge, without reſerve, that in proportion to the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of the oppoſition againſt this part of the treaty, is the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I derive from its exiſtence, as an obſtacle the more to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of a thing, which, in my opinion, beſides deeply injuring

our real and permanent intereſt, would cover us with ignominy.— No power of language, at my command, can expreſs the abhorrence I feel of the idea of violating the property of individuals, which, in an authoriſed intercourſe in time of peace, has been confided to the faith of our government and laws, on account of controverſies between na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nation. In my view, every moral and every political ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent unite to conſign it to execration.</p>
               <p>Neither will I diſſemble, that the dread of the effects of the ſpirit which patronizes that idea, has ever been with me one of the moſt perſuaſive arguments for a pacific policy on the part of the United States. Serious as the evil of war has appeared at the preſent ſtage of our affairs, the manner in which it was to be apprehended it might be carried on, was ſtill more formidable, in my eyes, than the thing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

               <p>The earneſt and extenſive clamours againſt the part of the treaty under conſideration, confirm that anticipation; and while they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the merit of the proviſion, they alſo inſpire a wiſh that ſome more effectual barrier had been erected againſt the poſſibility of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary practice being ever, at any ill-fated moment, obtruded upon our public councils.

This poſition is founded on the ſolid ground that the confiſcation or ſequeſtration of the debts of an enemy is a high act of repriſal and war, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and excluſively incident to the power of making war, which was always in the federal government.</note>; that even in a revolutionary war, a war of liberty againſt uſurpation, our national councils were too magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to be provoked or tempted to depart ſo widely from the path of rectitude; by every man, in fine, who, though careful not to exaggerate for raſh and extravagant projects, can nevertheleſs fairly eſtimate, the real reſources of the country, for meeting dangers which prudence cannot avert.</p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:028795_0107_0FDD4A8ADF028D88"/>What is the conſequence of the favourite doctrine, that the confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or ſequeſtration of private debts is our moſt powerful, if not our only weapon of defence? Great Britain is the ſole power againſt whom we could wield it, ſince it is to her citizens alone that we are largely indebted. What are we to do, then, againſt any other nation which might think fit to menace us? Are we, for want of adequate means of defence, to crouch beneath the uplifted rod, and with abject deſpondency, ſue for mercy? Or has Providence guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teed us ſpecially againſt the malice or ambition of every power on earth, except Great Britain?</p>
               <p>'Tis at once curious and inſtructive to mark the inconſiſtencies of the diſorganizing ſect. Is the queſtion to diſcard a ſpirit of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation and ruſh into war with Great Britain? Columns are filled with the moſt abſurd exaggerations to prove that we are able to meet her, not only on equal but upon ſuperior terms—Is the queſtion, whether a ſtipulation againſt the confiſcation or ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of private debts ought to have been admitted into the treaty? Then are we a people deſtitute of the means of war, with neither armies, nor fleets, nor magazines—then is our beſt, if not our only weapon of defence, the power of confiſcating or ſequeſtrating the debts which are due to the ſubjects of Great Britain; in other words, the power of committing fraud, of violating the public faith, of ſacrificing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of commerce, of proſtrating credit. Is the queſtion, whether free ſhips ſhall make free goods, whether naval ſtores ſhall or ſhall not be deemed contraband? Then is the appeal to what is called the <hi>modern</hi> law of nations, then is the cry that recent uſage has changed and mitigated the rigour of ancient maxims. But is the queſtion, whether private debts can be rightfully confiſcated or ſequeſtered? Then ought the utmoſt rigour of the ancient doctrine to govern, and modern uſage and opinion to be diſcarded. The old rule or the new is to be adopted or rejected juſt as may ſuit our convenience.</p>
               <p>An inconſiſtency of another kind, but no leſs curious, is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a poſition repeatedly heard from the ſame quarter, namely, that the ſequeſtration of debts is the only <hi>peaceable</hi> mean of doing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſtice and avoiding war. If we trace the origin of the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right to confiſcate or ſequeſter debts, we find it in the very au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, principally relied on to prove it, to be this (Bynherſhoeck, queſtiones juris publici l. 1. b. 2) "ſince it is the <hi>condition</hi> of war that enemies may be deprived of all their rights, it is reaſonable that every thing of an enemy's found among his enemies, ſhould change its owner and go to the treaſury." Hence it is manifeſt, that the right itſelf, if it exiſts, preſuppoſes, as the <hi>condition</hi> of its exerciſe, an <hi>actual ſtate</hi> of war, the <hi>relation</hi> of enemy to enemy. Yet are we faſtidiouſly and hypocritically told, that this high and explicit act of war, is a <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> mean of doing ourſelves juſtice and avoiding war. Why are we thus told? Why is this ſtrange paradox attempted to be impoſed on us? Why, but that it is the policy of the conſpirators againſt our peace to endeavour to diſguiſe the hoſtilities into which they wiſh to plunge us with a ſpecious outſide, and to precipitate us down the precipice of war, while we imagine we are quietly and ſecurely walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along its ſummit.</p>

               <p>THE objects protected by the 10th article, are claſſed under four heads:—1. Debts of individuals to individuals—2. Property of individuals in the public funds—3. Property of individuals in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic banks.—4. Property of individuals in private banks. Theſe, if analiſed, reſolve themſelves, in principle, into two diſcriminations, viz. private debts and private property in public funds. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of private property prevails throughout.—No property of either government is protected from confiſcation or ſequeſtration by the other. This laſt circumſtance merits attention, becauſe it marks the true boundary.</p>
               <p>The propriety of the ſtipulation will be examined under theſe ſeveral aſpects: the right to confiſcate or ſequeſtrate private debts or private property in public funds, on the ground of reaſon and principle—the right as depending on the opinion of juriſts and on uſage—the policy and expediency of the practice—the analogy of the ſtipulation with ſtipulations in our other treaties and in treaties between other nations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as to the right on the ground of reaſon and principle.</p>
               <p>The general propoſition on which it is ſupported, is this, "That every individual of a nation, with whom we are at war, whereſoever he may be, is our enemy, and his property of every kind in every place, liable to capture by right of war."</p>
               <p>The only exception to this rule, reſpects property within the juriſdiction of a Neutral State, but the exemption is referred to the right of the neutral nation, not to any privilege which the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gives to the enemy proprietor.</p>
               <p>Reaſon, if conſulted, will ſuggeſt another exception—This regards all <hi>ſuch property as the laws of a country permit foreigners to acquire within it or to bring into it.</hi> The right of holding or having property in a country, always implies a duty on the part of its government
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028795_0109_0FDD4A8C2FCD6958"/>
to protect that property, and to ſecure to the owner the full enjoyment of it. When ever, therefore, a government grants permiſſion to foreigners to acquire property within its territories, or to bring and depoſit it there, it tacitly promiſes protection and ſecurity. It muſt be underſtood to engage, that the foreign proprietor, as to what he ſhall have acquired or depoſited, ſhall enjoy the rights, privileges, and immunities of a native proprietor, without any other exceptions than thoſe which the eſtabliſhed laws may have previouſly declared. How can any thing elſe be underſtood? Every ſtate, when it has entered into no contrary engagement, is free to permit or not to permit foreigners to acquire or bring property within its ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, but if it grant the right, what is there to make the tenure of the foreigner different from that of the native, if antecedent laws have not pronounced a difference?—Property as it exiſts in civilized ſociety, if not a creature of, is at leaſt regulated and defined by, the laws. They preſcribe the manner in which it ſhall be uſed, alienated, or tranſmitted; the conditions upon which it may be held, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, or forfeited. It is to them we are to look for its rights, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations and conditions. No condition of enjoyment, no cauſe of forfeiture, which they have not ſpecified, can be preſumed to exiſt.— An extraordinary diſcretion to reſume or take away the thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any perſonal fault of the proprietor, is inconſiſtent with the notion of property. This ſeems always to imply a contract between the ſociety and the individual; that he ſhall retain and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in the poſſeſſion and uſe of his property ſo long as he ſhall obſerve and perform the conditions which the laws have annexed to the tenure. It is neither natural nor equitable to conſider him as ſubject to be deprived of it for a cauſe foreign to himſelf; ſtill leſs for one which may depend on the volition or pleaſure, even of the very government to whoſe protection it has been confided: for the propoſition, which affirms the right to confiſcate or ſequeſter, does not diſtinguiſh between offenſive or defenſive war; between a war of ambition on the part of the power, which exerciſes the right, or a war of ſelf preſervation againſt the aſſaults of another.</p>
               <p>The property of a foreigner placed in another country, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of its laws, may juſtly be regarded as a depoſit, of which the ſociety is the truſtee. How can it be reconciled with the idea of a truſt, to take the property from its owner, when he has perſonally given no cauſe for the deprivation.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe two families in a ſtate of nature, and that a member of one of them had by permiſſion of the head of the other, placed in his cuſtody ſome article belonging to himſelf, and ſuppoſe a quarrel to enſue between the two heads of families in which the member had not participated by his immediate councilor conſent, would not natural equity declare the ſeizure and confiſcation of the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted property to be an act of perfidious rapacity?</p>
               <p>Again, ſuppoſe two neighbouring nations, which had not had intercourſe with each other, and that one of them opens its ports and territories for the purpoſe of commerce to the citizens of the other, proclaiming free and ſafe ingreſs and egreſs; ſuppoſe afterwards a war to break out between the two nations and the one which had granted that permiſſion, to ſeize and convert to its own uſe the goods and credits of the merchants of the other, within its dominions.

               <p>Nor can we diſtinguiſh either caſe, in principle, from that which conſtantly takes place between nations, that permit a commercial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with each other, whether with or without national com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact. They equally grant a right to bring into and carry out of their territories the property which is the ſubject of the intercourſe, a right of free and ſecure ingreſs and egreſs; and in doing this they make their territories a ſanctu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the latter caſe there is no confidence whatever repoſed in us; no claim upon our hoſpitality, juſtice or good faith; there is the ſimple character of enemy with an entire liberty to oppoſe force to force—The right of war conſequently to attack and ſeize whether to obtain indemnification for an injury received; to diſable our enemy from doing us further harm, to force him to reaſonable terms of accommodation, or to repreſs an overbearing ambition, exiſts in full vigour, unreſtrained and unqualified by any truſt or duty on our part—In purſuing it though we may inflict hardſhip we do not commit injuſtice.</p>
               <p>Moreover the property of foreigners within our country may be regarded as having paid a valuable conſideration for its protection and exemption from forfeiture; that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch is brought in, commonly enriches the revenue by a duty of entry. All that is within our terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, whether acquired there or brought there is liable to contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the treaſury, in common with other ſimilar property. Does there not reſult an obligation to protect that, which contributes to the expence of its protection? Will juſtice ſanction upon the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a war, the confiſcation of a property, which during peace, ſerves to augment the forces and nouriſh the proſperity of a ſtate?</p>
               <p>The principle of the propoſition gives an equal right to ſubject the perſon as the property of a foreigner to the rigours of war. But what ſhould be thought of a government, which ſhould ſeize all the ſubjects of its enemy found within its territory, and commit them to durance, as priſoners of war? would not all agree that it had violated an aſylum which ought to have been ſacred? That it had trampled upon the laws of hoſpitality and civilization? That it had diſgraced itſelf by an act of cruelty and barbariſm? Way
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028795_0111_0FDD4A8D3A980000"/>
would it not be equally reprehenſible to violate the aſylum which had been given to the property of thoſe foreigners? Reaſon, left to its own lights, would determine all theſe queſtions in one way, and ſeverely condemn the moleſtation, on account of a national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, as well of the property as the perſon of the foreigner found in our country, under the licence and guarantee of the laws of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious amity.</p>
               <p>The caſe of property in the public funds, is ſtill ſtronger than that of private debts. To all the ſanctions which apply to the latter, adds that of an expreſs pledge of the public faith to the foreign holder of ſtock.</p>
               <p>The conſtituting of a public debt or fund, transferable without limitation or diſtinction, amounts to a promiſe to all the world, that whoever, foreigner or citizen, may acquire a title to it, ſhall enjoy the benefit of what is ſtipulated. Every transferee becomes by the act of transfer, the immediate proprietor of the promiſe. It inures directly to his uſe, and the foreign promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, no more than the native, can be deprived of that benefit, except in conſequence of ſome act of his own, without the infraction of a poſitive engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Public debt has been truly defined, "A property ſubſiſting in the faith of government." Its eſſence is promiſe. To confiſcate or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter it, is emphatically to reſcind the promiſe given, to revoke the faith plighted; it is impoſſible to ſeparate the two ideas of a breach of faith, and the confiſcation or ſequeſtration of a property ſubſiſting only in the faith of the government by which it is made.</p>
               <p>When it is conſidered, that the promiſe made to the foreigner is not made to him in the capacity of member of another ſociety, but in that of citizen of the world, or of an individual in a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture —the infraction of it towards him, on account of the fault real or pretended of the ſociety to which he belongs, is the more obviouſly deſtitute of colour. There is no real affinity between the motive and the conſequence. There is a confounding of relations. The obligation of a contract can only be avoided by the breach of a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expreſs or implied, which appears or can be preſumed to have been within the contemplation of both parties, or by the perſonal fault or crime of him to whom it is to be performed. Can it be ſuppoſed that a citizen of one country would lend his money to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another, in the expectation that a war between the two countries, which without or againſt his will, might break out the next day, could be deemed a ſufficient cauſe of forfeiture?</p>
               <p>The principle may be teſted in another way. Suppoſe one gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indebted to another in a certain ſum of money, and ſuppoſe the creditor government to borrow of a citizen of the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an equal ſum of money. When he came to demand payment, would juſtice, would good faith, permit the oppoſing to his claim, by way of ſet off, the debt due from his government? Who would not revolt at ſuch an attempt? Could not the individual creditor anſwer with concluſive force, that in a matter of contract he was not reſponſible
<note n="*" place="bottom">All that can rightfully be done is to oblige the foreigners, who are ſubjects of our enemy, to quit our country.</note>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:028795_0112_0FDD4A5EBA3CD810"/>
for the ſociety of which he was a member, and that the debts of the Society were not a proper ſet off againſt his private claim?</p>
               <p>With what greater reaſon could his claim be refuſed on account of an injury, which was a cauſe of war, received from his Sovereign, and which had created on the part of the Sovereign a <hi>debt</hi> of repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It were certainly more natural and juſt to ſet off a debt due <hi>by contract</hi> to the citizen of a foreign country againſt a debt due <hi>by contract</hi> from the ſovereign of that country, than to ſet it off againſt a vague claim of indemnification for an injury or aggreſſion of which we complain, and of which the reality or juſtice is ſeldom undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>The true rule which reſults from what has been ſaid, and which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſanctions, with regard to the right of capture, is this—"It may be exerciſed every where except within a neutral juriſdiction<note n="‡" place="bottom">There are exceptions to this exception; but they depend on ſpecial circumſtances which admit the principal exception, and need not be particularized.</note>, or where the property is under the protection of our own laws," and it may perhaps be added that it always ſuppoſes the poſſibility of rightful combat, of attack, and defence. Theſe exceptions involve no refinement, they depend on obvious conſiderations, and are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to common ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE point next to be examined is, the right of confiſcation or ſequeſtration, as depending on the opinion of juriſts and on uſage.</p>
               <p>To underſtand how far theſe ought to weigh, it is requiſite to conſider what are the elements or ingredients which compoſe what is called the law of nations.</p>
               <p>The conſtituent parts of this ſyſtem are, 1. The neceſſary or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal law, which is the law of nature applied to nations; or that ſyſtem of rules for regulating the conduct of nation to nation, which reaſon deduces from the principles of natural right, as relative to poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cal ſocieties or ſtates. 2. The voluntary law, which is a ſyſtem of rules reſulting from the ineqality and independence of nations, and which, in the adminiſtration of their affairs, and the purſuit of their pretentions, proceeding on the principle of their having no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon judge up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Thus captures in war are as valid when made by the party in the wrong, as by he party in the right.—3. The pactitious, or conventional
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028795_0113_0FDD4A8ECE083190"/>
law, or that law which reſults from a treaty between two or more nations. This is evidently, a particular, not a general law, ſince a treaty on pact can only bind the contracting parties: Yet when we find a proviſion univerſally pervading the treaties between nations for a length of time, as a kind of formula, it is high evidence of the general law of nations. 4. The cuſtomary law, which conſiſts of thoſe rules of conduct that in practice are reſpected and obſerved among nations: Its authority depends on uſage implying a tacit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and agreement. This alſo, is a particular, not a general law, obligatory only on thoſe nations whoſe acquieſcence has appeared, or from circumſtances may fairly be preſumed. Thus the cuſtomary law of Europe may not be that of a different quarter of the globe. The three laſt branches are ſometimes aggregately denominated the poſitive law of nations</p>
               <p>The two firſt are diſcoverable by reaſon; the two laſt depend on proof, as matter of fact. Hence the opinion of juriſts, though weighing as the ſentiments of judicious or learned men who have made the ſubject a particular ſtudy, are not concluſive as authorities —In regard to the neceſſary and voluntary law, eſpecially, they may be freely diſregarded, unleſs they are found to be adopted and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the practice of nations: For where REASON is the guide, it cannot properly be renounced for mere OPINION, however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable. As witneſſes of the cuſtomary law, their teſtimony, the reſult of careful reſearches, is more particularly entitled to attention.</p>
               <p>If, then, it has been ſatisfactorily proved as the dictate of ſound reaſon, that private debts and private property in public funds are not juſtly liable to confiſcation or ſequeſtration, an oppoſite opinion of one or more juriſts could not controul the concluſion in point of principle. So far as it may atteſt a practice of nations, which may have introduced a poſitive law on the ſubject, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may be different. It will remain to examine, upon their own and other teſtimony, whether that practice be ſo general as to be capable of varying a rule of reaſon, by the force of uſage; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſtill continues to bear the ſame character, or has been weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or done away by more recent or modern uſage.</p>
               <p>I will not avail myſelf of a poſition advanced by writers, that uſage, if derogating from the principles of natural juſtice, is null, further than to draw this inference, that a rule of right, deducible from them, cannot be deemed to be altered by an uſage partial, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, fluctuating.</p>
               <p>With theſe guides, our futher enquiries will ſerve to confirm us in the negative of the pretended right to confiſcate or ſequeſtrate in the caſes ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>The notion of this right is evidently derived from the ROMAN law. It is ſeen there in this peculiar form, "Thoſe things of an enemy which are among us, belong not to the ſtate but to the firſt occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant,<note n="*" place="bottom">Digeſt xii. chap. 1. "Eaquae res hoſtiles apud nos, &amp;c."</note>" which ſeems to mean, that the things of an enemy, at the commencement of the war, found in our country, may be ſeized by any citizen, and will belong to him who firſt gets poſſeſſion. It is known that the maxims of the Roman law are extenſively incorporated

               <p>On the very queſtion of the right to confiſcate or ſequeſter private debts, his opinion, as far as it appears, ſeems to be at variance with his premiſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>eering a kind of middle courſe. His expreſſions (L.III.C.XX. Sec. XVI.) are theſe, "Thoſe debts which are due to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, at the beginning of the war, are not to be accounted
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028795_0115_0FDD1CAA900EFE10"/>
for given (that is, when peace is made) for theſe are <hi>not acquired</hi> by the right of war, but only <hi>forbidden to be demanded</hi> in time of war therefore, the <hi>impediment</hi> being removed, that is, the war ended, they retain their full force." His idea appears from this paſſage to be, that the right of war is limited to the arreſting of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of private debts during its continuance, and not to the confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or annihilation of the debt.—Nor is it clear whether he means that this areſtation is to be produced by a ſpecial act of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, or by the operation of ſome rule of law which denies to an alien enemy a right of action. This feeble and hetergeneous opinion may be conceived to have proceeded from a conflict between a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for ancient maxims and the impreſſion of more enlightened views, inculcated by the principles of commerce and civilization.</p>
               <p>Bynkerſhoeck is more conſiſtent—Adopting with Grotius, the rule of the Roman law in its full rigor, he is not frightened at the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, but follows them throughout. Hence he beſtows a chapter upon the defence of the propoſition, quoted in a former number (to wit) that<note n="‡" place="bottom">Qaeſtionum Juris Public, lib. i. c· 7. "Cum ea ſit belli condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ut hoſtes ſint omni jure ſpoliati proſcriptique rationis eſt quaſcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que res hoſticum apud hoſtes, inventas, dominum mutare et Fiſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In confirmation of his doctrine, he adduces a variety of examples which embrace a period of ſomething more than a century beginning in the year 1556, and ending in the year 1667, and which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend as actors on the principle he eſpouſes, France, Spain, the States General, Denmark, the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he acknowledges that the right has been queſtioned, and notes parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that when the king of France and the Biſhops of Munſter and Cologne in the year 1673 confiſcated the debts which their ſubjects owed to the confederate Belgians, the States General, by an edict of the 6th of July of that year, cenſured the proceeding and decreed that thoſe debts could not be paid but to the true creditors, and that the exaction of them whether by force or with conſent, was not to be eſteemed valid.</p>
               <p>If from the great pains which appear to have been taken by this learned writer to collect examples in proof of his doctrine, we are to conclude that the collection is tolerably complete, we are warranted in drawing this inference, that he has not cured any defect, which reaſon may diſcern in his principle, by any thing like the evidence of ſuch a general uniform and continued uſage as is requiſite to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>a rule</hi> of the poſitive law of nations, in derogation from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
               <p>A minority only of the powers of Europe are ſhewn to have been implicated in the practice, and among the majority not included, are ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable and reſpectable. One of theſe, Great Britain, is repreſented as having acquieſced in it in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

of peace between her and ſome of the powers, who went into the practice to her detriment, by relinquiſhing the claim of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion —But war muſt at length end in peace, and the ſacrifices a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes to the latter is a ſlight argument of her conſent to the principle of the injury which ſhe may have ſuſtained.—I have not been able to trace a ſingle inſtance, in which Great Britain has herſelf ſet the example of ſuch a practice; nor could ſhe do it as has elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where appeared, without contravening an article of Magna Charta unleſs by way of repriſal for the ſame thing done towards her. The ſuggeſtion of an inſtance in the preſent war with France will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be examined. In ſuch a queſtion, the practice of a nation which has for ages figured pre-eminently in the commercial world, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to particular notice.</p>
               <p>It is not unworthy of remark, that the common law of England, from its earlieſt dawnings, contradicted the rule of the Roman law. It exempted from ſeizure, by a ſubject of England, the property of a foreigner brought there before a war, but gave to the firſt ſeizer, or occupant, the property which came thereafter the breaking out of the war. The noble principles of the common law, cannot ceaſe to engage our reſpect, while we have before our eyes ſo many monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their excellence in our own juriſprudence.</p>
               <p>It alſo merits to be dwelt upon, that the United Netherlands, for ſometime the firſt, and long only the ſecond in commercial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, formerly diſputed the right, and condemned the practice of confiſcating private debts, though themſelves, in ſome inſtances, guilty of it.</p>
               <p>And it is likewiſe a material circumſtance, that Bynckerſhock, who ſeems to have written in the year 1737, does not adduce any precedent later than the year 1667, 70 years before his publication.</p>
               <p>The ſubſequent period will, it is believed, be found, upon ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, equally barren of ſimilar precedents.—The exceptions are ſo few,<note n="§" place="bottom">The caſe of Pruſſia and the Sileſia Loan is the only one I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The former uſage, as being partial and with numerous exceptions, was inſufficient to eſtabliſh a rule. The contrary uſage, or the renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former uſage, as being general, as attended with few or no exceptions, is ſufficient even to work a change in the rigour of an ancient rule, if it could be ſuppoſed to have been eſtabliſhed.

The ſovereign has naturally the ſame right over what his ſubjects may be indebted to his enemies, therefore he may confiſcate debts of this nature, if the term of payment happen in the time of war, or at leaſt he may prohibit his ſubjects paying while the war laſts. But at preſent, in regard to the advantage and ſafety of commerce, all the ſovereigns of Europe have departed from this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. And as this cuſtom has been generally received, he who ſhould act contrary to it, would injure the public faith; for ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers truſted his ſubjects, only from a firm perſuaſion, that the general cuſtom would be obſerved.

               <p>The firſt propoſition of the above paſſage amounts to this, that a "ſovereign naturally, that is according to the law of nature, may confiſcate debts which his ſubjects owe to his enemies, if the term of payment happen in the time of war, or at leaſt he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit his ſubjects from paying while the war laſts."</p>
               <p>So far as this goes, it agrees with the principle which I combat, that there is a natural right to confiſcate or ſequeſter private debts in time of war: ſo far Vatel accords with the Roman law and with Bynkerſhoek.</p>
               <p>But he annexes a whimſical limitation "If the term of payment happen in the time of war"—and there is a marked uncertainty and heſitation—the ſovereign "may confiſcate, or at leaſt he may prohibit his ſubjects from paying while the war laſts"—'Tis evident that the circumſtance of the time of payment can have no influence upon the right. If it reaches to confiſcation, which takes away the ſubſtance of the thing, the mere incident of the happening of payment muſt be immaterial. If it is confined to the arreſting of payment during the war, the reaſon of the rule, the object being to prevent ſupplies going to the enemy, will apply it as well to debts which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come payable before the war, as to thoſe which became payable in the war.

                  </gap>o important a point, as whether the pretended right extends to confiſcation or ſimply to ſequeſtration? They muſt be accounted for, as in another caſe by the conflict between reſpect for ancient maxims and the impreſſions of juſter views, ſeconded by the more enlightened policy of modern times.</p>
               <p>But while Vatel thus countenances in the firſt part of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage the opinion, that the natural law of nations authoriſes the confiſcation or ſequeſtration of private debts, in what immediately follows, he moſt explicitly and unequivocally informs us, that the rule of that law in this reſpect has been derogated from by modern uſage or cuſtom—in other words, that the modern cuſtomary law has changed in this particular the ancient natural law.—Let his own

words be conſulted—At preſent (ſays he) in regard to the advantage and ſafety of commerce, all the ſovereigns of Europe have departed from this rigour—And as this cuſtom has been generally received, he who would act contrary to it would injure the public faith; for ſtrangers truſted his ſubjects only from the firm perſuaſion that the general cuſtom would be obſerved."</p>
               <p>The teſtimony is full, that there is a GENERAL CUSTOM received and adopted by all the ſovereigns of Europe, which obviates the rigour of the ancient rule; the non obſervance of which cuſtom would violate the public faith of a nation—as being a breach of an implied contract, by the virtue of the cuſtom, upon the ſtrength of which foreigners truſt his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Language cannot expreſs more clearly a rule of the cuſtomary law of nations, the eſſence of which, we have ſeen, is general uſage, implying a tacit agreement to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onform to the rule—The one cited is denominated a CUSTOM generally received a GENERAL CUSTOM; all the ſovereigns of Europe are ſtated to be parties to it, and it is repreſented as obligatory on the public faith, ſince this would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by a departure from it.</p>
               <p>The conſequence is, that if the right pretended did exiſt by the natural law, it has given way to the cuſtomary law, for it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to call that a right which cannot be exerciſed without breach of faith. The reſult is, that by the preſent cuſtomary law of nations, within the ſphere of its action, there is no right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate or ſequeſter private debts in time of war, The reaſon or motive of which law is the advantage and ſafety of commerce.</p>
               <p>As to private property in public funds, the right to meddle with them is ſtill more emphatically negatived. "The ſtate does not <hi>ſo much as touch</hi> the ſums it owes to the enemy. <hi>Every where</hi> in caſe of war, funds credited to the public are exempt from confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and SEIZURE." Theſe terms manifeſtly exclude ſeque ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well as confiſcation.</p>
               <p>In another place the author gives the reaſon of this poſition, book ii. chap. xviii. "In repriſals, the goods of a ſubject are ſeized in the ſame manner as thoſe of the ſtate or the ſovereign. Every thing that belongs to the nation is liable to repriſals as ſoon as it can be ſeized, <hi>provided it be not a depoſit truſted to the public faith.</hi>—This DEPOSIT is found in our hands, only in conſequence of that <hi>confidence,</hi> which the proprietor has put in our good faith, and it ought to be reſpected, even in caſe of open war. Thus it is uſual to behave in France, England, and elſewhere, with reſpect to the money which foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have placed in the public funds." The ſame principle, if he had reflected without bias, would have taught him, that repriſals could rightfully extend to nothing that had been committed with their permiſſion, to the cuſtody and guardianſhip of our laws, during a ſtate of peace; and conſequently, that no property of our enemy, which was in our country before the breaking out of the war, is juſtlyfiable to them. For is not all ſuch property <hi>equally a depoſit, truſted to the public faith?</hi> What foreigner would acquire property in our country, or bring and lodge it there, but in the <hi>confidence,</hi> that in caſe of war it would not become an object of repriſals? Why then reſort to cuſtom for a denial of the right to confiſcate or ſequeſter
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028795_0119_0FDD4A964D174D98"/>
private debts? Why not trace it to the natural injuſtice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy of taking away in war, what a foreigner is permitted to own and have among us in peace? Why ever have conſidered, that as a natural right which was contrary to good faith tacitly pledged? This is evidently the effect of too much deference to ferocious maxims or antiquity, of undue complaiſance to ſome precedents of modern rapacity.</p>
               <p>He had avoided the error, by weighing maturely the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his own principle in another caſe: "He who declares war, ſays he, does not confiſcate the <hi>immoveable</hi> goods poſſeſſed in his country by his enemy's ſubjects: <hi>in permitting them to purchaſe and poſſeſs thoſe goods,</hi> he has in this reſpect admitted them into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his ſubjects," that is, he has admitted them to a like privilege with his ſubjects, as to the real property they were permitted to acquire and hold.

                  </gap> advances in this and in the paſſage quoted immediately before it, the true principles which ought to govern the queſtion, tho' he does not purſue them in their conſequences; elſe he would not have deduced the exemption of private debts, from confiſcation or ſequeſtration, from the cuſtomary law of nations, but would have traced it to the natural or neceſſary law; as founded upon the obligations of good faith; upon the tacit promiſe of ſecurity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the permiſſion, to acquire property within or bring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty into our country; upon the protection which every govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment owes to a property of which it legalizes the acquiſition, or the depoſit within its juriſdiction: and in the caſe of <hi>immoveable</hi> goods or real eſtate, of which he admits a right to ſequeſter the <hi>income,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its being remitted to the enemy, he would have perceived the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of leaving this effect to be produced by the obſtructions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically incident to a ſtate of war; ſince there is no reaſon why the income ſhould be leſs privileged than the ſubſtance of the thing.</p>
               <p>It appears then, that the doctrine of Vatel, collectively taken, amounts to this, that there is a natural right of war in certain caſes to confiſcate or ſequeſter an enemy's property found within our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but that, on motives relative to commerce and public credit, the cuſtomary law of Europe has reſtrained that right as to <hi>private debts,</hi> and <hi>private property</hi> in public funds. His opinion, therefore, favours the principle of the article of the treaty under examination, as conſonant with the preſent European law of nations—and it is an opinion of greater weight than any that can be cited; as well on account of the capacity, diligence, information and the preciſion of ideas, which characteriſe the work in which it is contained, as on account of the recency of that work<note n="*" place="bottom">It appears to have been written about the year <hi>1760.</hi>

It is a precedent that can have little weight not only from its ſingularity, but from the character of its author. Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick was a conſummate General, a profound ſtateſman; but he was very far from being a ſevere moraliſt.

The preſent war of Europe is of ſo extraordinary a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and has been conducted in all reſpects, upon ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary principles, that it may truly be regarded as an exception to all general rules, as a precedent for nothing. It is rather a beacon, warning mankind to ſhun the pernicious example, than a model inviting to imitation. The human paſſions, on all ſides, appear to have been wrought up to a pitch of frenzy, which has ſet reaſon, juſtice, and humanity, at defiance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have nevertheleſs thought fit to appeal to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this very anomalous war, have not detailed to us the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe nature or courſe of the tranſactions to which they refer, nor do I know that ſufficient documents have appeared in this country to gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The imperfect evidence which has fallen under my obſervation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects France and Great Britain, and ſeems to exhibit theſe facts.</p>
               <p>France paſſed a decree ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>queſtering the property of the ſubjects of the powers at war with her, and in the ſame or another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree obliged all thoſe of her citizens, who had mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ies owing to them in foreign countries, to draw bills upon their debtors, and to furniſh thoſe bills to the government by way of loan, or upon certain terms of payment.</p>
               <p>The government of Great Britain, in conſequence of this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, paſſed two different acts, the objects of which were to prevent the payment of thoſe bills, and to ſecure the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ums due for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the original creditors. Theſe acts appoint certain commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to whom reports are to be made of all French property in the hands of Britiſh ſubjects, and who are empowered to receive and ſell goods and other effects—to collect debts, and to depoſit the proceeds in the bank of London, or in other ſafe keeping if prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or required by parties intereſted. The monies depoſited are to be inveſted in the purchaſe of public ſtock, together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or dividends ariſing from time to time, to be eventually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for to the proprietors. The commiſſioners have likewiſe
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028795_0122_0FDD4A6A1EDDDB00"/>
a diſcretion, upon demand, to deliver over their effects and monies to ſuch of the proprietors as do not reſide within the French do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not enter into a diſcuſſion of the propriety of theſe acts of Great Britain.—It is ſufficient to obſerve, that they are attended with circumſtances which very eſſentially diſcriminate them from the thing for which they are quoted. The act of the French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in ſubſtance a compulſory aſſumption of all the property of its citizens in foreign countries This extraordinary meaſure preſented two options to the governments of theſe countries.—One to conſider the transfer as virtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lly effected, and to confiſcate the property as being no longer that of the individuals, but that of the government of France—the other to defeat the effect of her plan by tying up the property for the benefit of the original creditors, in excluſion of the drafts which they were compelled to draw. Great Britain appears to have elected the latter courſe. If we ſuppoſe her ſincere in the motive, and there is fairneſs and fidelity in the execution, the iſſue will be favourable rather than detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the rights of private property.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid, that there was an option to confiſcate. A govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may rightfully confiſcate the property of an adverſary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No principle of juſtice or policy occurs to forbid repriſals upon the public or national property of an enemy. That caſe is foreign in every view to the principles which protect private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. The exemption ſtipulated by the 10th article of the treaty is accordingly reſtricted to the latter.</p>
               <p>It appears that the government of France convinced by the effect of the experiment, that the ſequeſtration of the property of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of her enemies was impolitic, thought fit to reſcind it.—Hence, on the 19th of December 1794, the Convention decreed as follows:</p>
               <p>"The decree concerning the ſequeſtration of the property of the ſubjects of hoſtile powers is annulled. Such ſums as have been paid by French citizens into the Treaſury in conſequence of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees will be reimburſed."</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the debates upon this decree, it was declared, that the decrees which it was to repeal, <hi>had prepared the ruin of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi> and had ſevered, <hi>againſt the right of nations,</hi> the obligations of merchants in different ſtates. This is a direct admiſſion that the ſequeſtration was contrary to the law of nations.</p>
               <p>As far as reſpects France, then, the precedent upon the whole is a ſtrong condemnation of the pretended right to confiſcate or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter.</p>
               <p>This formal renunciation of the ground, which was at firſt taken, is a very emphatical proteſt againſt the principle of the meaſure It ought to ſerve us too as an inſtructive warning againſt the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of ſo miſchievous and diſgraceful an expedient. And as to England, as has been ſhewn, the precedent is foreign to the queſtion.</p>
               <p>Thus we perceive that <hi>opinion</hi> and <hi>uſage,</hi> far from ſupporting the right to confiſcate or ſequeſter private property, on account of rational wars, when referred to the <hi>modern</hi> ſtandard, turn againſt that right and coincide with the principle of the article of treaty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der examination.</p>

               <p>SINCE the cloſing of my laſt number I have accidentally turned to a paſſage of VATEL, which is ſo pertinent to the immediate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that paper that I cannot refrain from interrupting the progreſs the diſcuſſion to quote it; it is in theſe words (b. 3. ch. 4. ſect. 63) "The ſovereign declaring war, can neither detain thoſe <hi>ſubjects</hi> of the enemy who are within his dominions at the time of the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>nor their effects.</hi> They came in his country on the public faith. By permitting them to enter his territories and continue there, he tacitly promiſed them liberty, and ſecurity for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn." This paſſage contains, explicitly, the principle which is the general baſis of my argument, namely, that the permiſſion to a foreigner to come with his effects into, and acquire others within, our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in time of peace virtually pledges the public faith for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of his perſon and property in the event of war. How can this be reconciled with the natural right (controuled only by the cuſtomary law of nations) which this writer admits, to confiſcate the debts due by the ſubjects of a ſtate to its enemies? I aſk once more, can there be a natural right to do that which includes a violation of faith?</p>
               <p>It is plain to a demonſtration, that the rule laid down in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which is ſo juſt and perſpicuous as to ſpeak conviction to the heart and underſtanding, unites the natural with the cuſtomary law of nations, in a condemnation of the pretenſion to confiſcate or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter the private property of our enemy found in our country at the breaking out of a war.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to examine the policy and expediency of ſuch a pretenſion.</p>
               <p>In this inveſtigation I ſhall aſſume, as a baſis of argument, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing poſition, <hi>That it is advantageous to nations to have commerce with each other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Commerce it is manifeſt, like any other object of enterprize or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, will proſper in proportion as it is ſecure. Its ſecurity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently promoting its proſperity extends its advantages. Security is indeed eſſential to its having a due and regular courſe.</p>
               <p>The pretenſion of a right to confiſcate or ſequeſter the effects of foreign merchants in the caſe in queſtion, is in its principele fatal to that neceſſary ſecurity. Its free exerciſe would deſtroy external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; or, which is nearly the ſame thing, reduce it within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted limits of a game of hazard, where the chance of large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, accompanied by great riſks would tempt alone the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous and the deſperate. Thoſe enterprizes, which from circui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous or long voyage, flowneſs of ſales, incident to the nature of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028795_0124_0FDD4A6B817801D0"/>
commodities, the neceſſity of credit, or from other cauſes, demand conſiderable time for their completion, muſt be renounced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Credit indeed muſt be baniſhed from all operations of foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; an engine, the importance of which to its vigorous and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful proſecution will be doubted by none, who will be guided by experience or obſervation.</p>
               <p>It cannot need amplification to elucidate the truth of theſe poſitions. The ſtorms of war occur ſo ſuddenly and ſo often, as to forbid the ſuppoſition, that the merchants of one country would truſt their property to any extent, or for any duration in another country, which was in the practice of confiſcating or ſequeſtrating the effects of its enemies found within its territories at the commencement of a war.</p>
               <p>That practice therefore would neceſſarily paralize and wither the commerce of the country in which it obtained. Accordingly, nations attentive to the cultivation of commerce which were betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by temporary conſiderations into particular inſtances of that atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious practice, have been led by the experience of its miſchiefs, to abſtain from it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n later times. They ſaw that to have perſiſted in it, would have been to abandon competition on equal terms, in the lucrative and beneficial field of commerce.</p>
               <p>It is no anſwer to this to ſay, that the exerciſe of the right might be ordinarily ſuſpended, though the right itſelf might be maintained for extraordinary and great emergencies.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, as the ordinary forbearance of its exerciſe would be taken by foreigners for evidence of an intention never to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe it, by which they would be enticed into large depoſits that would not otherwiſe have taken place; a departure from the general courſe would always involve an act of treachery and cruelty.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place; the poſſibility of the occaſional exerciſe of ſuch a right, if conceived to exiſt, would at leaſt be a ſlow poiſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to a ſickly habit of commerce; and in a ſeries of time would be productive of much more evil than could be counterbalanced by any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ood which it might be poſſible to obtain in the contemplated emergency, by the uſe of the expedient.</p>
               <p>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> experience decide—Examples of confiſcation and ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been given—When did the dread of them prevent a war? when did it cripple an enemy, ſo as to diſable him from exertion, or forced him into a ſubmiſſion to the views of his adverſary? When did it even ſenſibly conſpire to either of theſe ends? If it has ever had any ſuch effect, the evidence of it has not come within my knowledge.</p>
               <p>It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rue, that as between Great Britain and the United States, the expectation of ſuch effects is better warranted than perhaps in any other caſes that have exiſted, becauſe we commonly owe a larger debt to that country, than is uſual between nations, and there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative ſtate of things, which tends to a continuation of this ſituation.</p>
               <p>But how has the matter operated hitherto? In the late war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two countries, certain ſtates confiſcated the debts due from their citizens to Britiſh creditors, and theſe creditors actually ſuffered great loſſes—The Britiſh cabinet muſt have known that it
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028795_0125_0FDD4A9AD918BE60"/>
was not impoſſible the ſame thing might happen in another war, and on a more general ſcale: yet the appearances were extremely ſtrong, at a particular juncture, that it was their plan, either from ill-will, from the belief that popular opinion would ultimately drag our government into the war, from the union of theſe two, or from other cauſes to force us into hoſtilities with them. Hence the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of acts of confiſcation, or ſequeſtration, was not ſufficient to deter from hoſtile views, or to inſure pacific diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>It may be pretended, that the menace of this meaſure had a reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence on the ſubſequent conduct of Great Britain. But if we aſcribe nothing to the meaſures which government actually purſued under the preſſure of the provocations received, we at leaſt find, in the courſe of European events, a better ſolution of a change of policy in the cabinet of Great Britain, than from the dread of a legiſlative piracy on the debts due their merchants.</p>
               <p>The truth unfortunately is, that the paſſions of men ſtifle calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that nations the moſt attentive to pecuniary conſiderations eaſily ſurrender them to ambition, to jealouſy, to anger, or to revenge.</p>
               <p>For the ſame reaſon, the actual experiment of an exerciſe of the pretended right, by way of repriſal for an injury complained of, would commonly be as inefficacious, as the menace of it, to arreſt general hoſtilities. Pride is rouſed—reſentment kindled; and where there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> even no previous diſpoſition to thoſe hoſtilities, the probability is, that they follow. Nations, like individuals, ill brook the idea of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from their pretenſions under the rod, or of admitting the juſtice of an act of retaliation or repriſal, by ſubmitting to it. Thus we learn from the king of Pruſſia himſelf, that the ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the Sileſia debt, inſtead of procuring the reſtoration for which it was deſigned, was on the point of occaſioning an open rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between him and Great-Britain, when the ſupervention of a quarrel with France diverted the ſtorm, by rendering him neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as an ally.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it may be imagined, that the practice of confiſcation or ſequeſtration would be more efficacious to wound and diſable Great-Britain, in caſe of war, than to prevent it—But this alſo, is a vain chimera! A nation, that can at pleaſure raiſe by loan, twenty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſterling, would be in little danger of being diſconcerted or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled in her military enterprizes, by the taking away or arreſting of three or four millions due to her merchants. Did it produce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and diſorder among thoſe whom it affected and their connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions? If that diſorder was ſufficient to threaten a general derangement of mercantile credit, and with it of the public finances, the pending war affords an example, that the public purſe or credit could be brought ſucceſsfully into action for the ſupport of the ſufferers. Three or four millions of exchequer bills applied in loans, would be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuffice to prevent the partial evil from growing into a national calamity.</p>
               <p>But we forget, that as far as the interruption of the payment of the debts due to her merchants could be ſuppoſed to operate upon Great-Britain, war itſelf would eſſentially anſwer the purpoſes of confiſcation or ſequeſtration—By interrupting trade &amp; intercourſe, it
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028795_0126_0FDD4A6CF5489060"/>
is in fact, in a great degree a virtual ſequeſtration. Remittances to any extent become impracticable. There are few ways in which, on account of the ſtate of war, it is lawful to make them; and debtors are for the moſt part enough diſpoſed to embrace pretexts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtination.</p>
               <p>The inconvenience of deferred payment would, therefore, be felt by Great-Britain, with little mitigation from the bare exiſtence of war; without the neceſſity of our government incurring the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit and reſponſibility of a ſpecial interference.</p>
               <p>Indeed, as far as dread of eventual loſs can operate, it ought, in a great meaſure to have its effect excluſive of the idea of confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Great-Britain muſt want reflection not to be ſenſible, that in making war upon us, ſhe makes war upon her own merchants; by the depredations upon our trade deſtroying thoſe reſources from which they are to be paid. If ſhe be indifferent to this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, it will be becauſe ſhe is governed by ſome motive or paſſion powerful enough to diſpoſe her to run the riſk of the entire loſs— in the reliance of obtaining indemnification, by the acquiſitions of war, or in the terms of peace.</p>
               <p>Will it be ſaid, that the ſeizure of the debts would put into the hands of our government a valuable reſource for carrying on the war?— This upon trial would prove as fallacious as all the reſt. Various inducements would prevent debtors from paying into the treaſury.— Some would decline it from conſcientious ſcruples, from a doubt of the rectitude of the thing—others with intent to make a merit with their creditors of the concealment, and to favour their own future credit and advantage—others from a deſire to retain the money in their own employment, and a great number from the apprehenſion that the treaty of peace might revive their reſponſibility to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, with the embarraſſment to themſelves of getting back, as well as they could, the monies which they had paid into the treaſury. Of this, our laſt treaty of peace, in the opinion of able judges, gave an example. Theſe cauſes and others, which do not as readily occur, would oppoſe great obſtacles to the execution of the meaſure.</p>
               <p>But ſevere laws, inflicting heavy penalties might compel it—Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience does not warrant a ſanguine reliance upon this expedient, in a caſe in which great opportunity of concealment is united with ſtrong motives of inclination or intereſt—It would require an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, juſtly intolerable to a free people—penalties which would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the due proportion between crime and puniſhment, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect or deter from concealment and evaſion, and to execute the law —Probably no means leſs efficacious than a <hi>revolutionary tribunal</hi> and a <hi>guillotine</hi> would go near to anſwer the end.—There are but few, I truſt, to whom theſe would be welcome means.</p>
               <p>We conclude, therefore, that the law would be evaded to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which would diſappoint the expectations from it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource. Some monies no doubt would be collected but the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is, that the amount would be inſignificant even in the ſcale of a ſingle campaign.—But, ſhould the collection prove as complete, as it ordinarily is, between debtor and creditor, it would little, if at all, exceed the expence of a campaign.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:028795_0127_0FDD4A9C34F2DEE0"/>Hence we perceive, that regarding the meaſure, either as a mean of diſabling our enemies or as a reſource to ourſelves, its conſequence dwindles upon a cloſe ſurvey; it cannot pretend to a magnitude, which would apologize, either for a ſacrifice of national honour or candour, or for a deviation from the true principles of commerce and credit.</p>
               <p>But let us take a further view of its diſadvantages.</p>
               <p>A nation, in caſe of war, is under no reſponſibility for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linqencies or frauds of its citizens, who are debtors to thoſe of its enemy, if it does not ſpecially interfere with the payment of the debts which they owe. But if it interpoſes its authority to prevent the payment, it gives a claim of indemnification to its adverſary, for the intervening loſſes which thoſe delinquencies or frauds may occaſion. Whether, on the making of peace, this would be inſiſted upon or waved, might depend much on the good or ill ſucceſs of the war; but every thing which adds to the catalogue of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's juſt pretenſions, eſpecially when the fortune of war has been pretty equal, is an evil, either as an additional obſtacle to ſpeedy peace, or as an ingredient to reader the terms of it leſs advantageous to ourſelves. And it is therefore unwiſe in a government to increaſe the liſt of ſuch pretenſions, by a meaſure, which, without utility to itſelf, adminiſters to the indolence of negligent, and to the avidity fraudulent, individuals.</p>
               <p>Further—Every ſpecies of repriſal or annoyance, which a power at war; employs contrary to liberality or juſtice, of doubtful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in the eſtimation of the law of nations, departing from that moderation, which, in latter times, ſerves to mitigate the ſeverities of war; by furniſhing a pretext or provocation to the other ſide, to reſort to extremities, ſerves to embitter the ſpirit of hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to extend its ravages. War is then apt to become more ſanguinary, more waſting, and every way more deſtructive. This is a ground of ſerious reflection to every nation, both as it regards humanity and policy; to this country it preſents itſelf, accompanied with conſiderations of peculiar force. A vaſtly extended ſea coaſt, overſpread with defenceleſs towns, would offer an abundant prey to an incenſed and malignant enemy, having the power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſea. The uſages of modern war forbid hoſtilities of this kind; and though they are not always reſpected, yet, as they are never violated, unleſs by way of retaliation for a violation of them on the other ſide, without exciting the reprobation of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial part of mankind, ſullying the glory, and blaſting the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the party which diſregards them, this conſideration has in general force ſufficient to induce an obſervance of them. But the confiſcation or ſequeſtration of private debts, or private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in public funds, now generally regarded as an odious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable meaſure, would, as between us and Great Britain, contain a poignant ſting. Its effect to exaſperate, in an extreme degree, both the nation and government of that country cannot be doubted. A diſpoſition to retaliate, is a natural conſequence; and it would not be difficult for us to be made to ſuffer beyond any poſſible degree of advantage to be derived from the occaſion of the retaliation. It were
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028795_0128_0FDD4A715C37B588"/>
much wiſer to leave the property of Britiſh ſubjects an untouched pledge for the moderation of its government, in the mode of proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the war.</p>
               <p>Beſides (as if requiſite might be proved from the records of hiſtory) in national controverſies, it is of real importance to conciliate the good opinion of mankind; and it is even uſeful to preſerve or gain that of our enemy.—The latter facilitates accommodation and peace; the former attracts good offices, friendly interventions, ſometimes direct ſupport from others. The exemplary conduct, is general, of our country, in our conteſt for independence, was probably not a little ſervicable to us this way; it ſecured to the intrinſic goodneſs of our cauſe, every collateral advantage, and gave it a popularity among nations unalloyed and unimpaired, which even ſtole into the cabinets of Princes. A contrary policy tends to contrary conſequences. Though nations, in the main, are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what they ſuppoſe their intereſt, he muſt be imperfectly verſed in human nature, who thinks it indifferent whether the maxims of a ſtate tend to excite kind or unkind diſpoſitions in others, or who does not know that theſe diſpoſitions may inſenſibly mould or bias the views of ſelf intereſt. This were to ſuppoſe that rulers only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; do not feel; in other words, are not men.</p>
               <p>Moreover the meaſures of war ought ever to look forward to peace. The confiſcation of the private property of an enemy, muſt always be a point of ſerious diſcuſſion when intereſt or neceſſity leads to negociations for peace. Unleſs when abſolutely proſtrate by the war, reſtitution is likely to conſtitute an ultimatum of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party. It muſt be agreed to, or the war protracted, and at laſt it is probable it muſt ſtill be agreed to. Should a refuſal of reſtitution prolong the war for only one year, the chance is, that more will be loſt than was gained by the confiſcation. Should it be neceſſary finally to make it, after prolonging the war, the diſadvantage will preponderate in a ratio to the prolongation. Should it be, in the firſt inſtance, aſſented to, what will have been gained? The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary uſe of a fund of inconſiderable moment in the general iſſue of the war, at the expence of juſtice, character, credit, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of having ſharpened the evils of war.</p>
               <p>How infinitely preferable to have drawn an equal fund from our own reſources, which with good management is always practicable!—If the reſtitution includes damages, on account of the interference, for the failures of individuals, the loan will have been the moſt coſtly that could have been made. It has been elſewhere obſerved, that our treaty of peace with Great Britain gives an example of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The late one between France and Pruſſia gives another; one which has ſince appeared between France and the Landgrave of Heſſe, gives another. This muſt become every day more and more a matter of courſe, becauſe the immunity of mercantile debts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes every day more and more important to trade, better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be ſo, and more clearly conſidered as enjoined by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the law of nations.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that in reference to the ſimple queſtion of war and peace, the meaſure of confiſcation or ſequeſtration is marked with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ery feature of impolicy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:028795_0129_0FDD4AA059799370"/>We have before ſeen that the pretenſion of a right to do the one or the other has a moſt inimical aſpect towards commerce and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Let us reſume this view of the ſubject.—The credit, which our merchants have been able to obtain abroad eſſentially in Great Britain, has from the firſt ſettlement of our country to this day been the animating principle of our foreign commerce. This every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant knows and feels; and every intelligent merchant is ſenſible that for many years to come the caſe muſt continue the ſame. This, in our ſituation, is a peculiar reaſon of the utmoſt force, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the pretenſion in queſtion.</p>
               <p>The exerciſe of it, or the ſerious apprehenſion of its exerciſe, would neceſſarily have one of two effects. It would deprive our merchants of the credit, ſo important to them or it would oblige them to pay a premium for it proportioned to the opinion of the riſk. Or to ſpeak more truly, it would combine the two effects; it would cramp credit, and ſubject what was given to a high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium. The moſt obvious and familiar principles of human action eſtabliſh, that the conſideration for money or property, lent or credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is moderate or otherwiſe, according to the opinion of ſecurity or hazard, and that the quantity of either to be obtained, on loan or credit, is in a great degree contracted or enlarged by the ſame rule.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhould we, in the operations of our trade, pay exorbitantly for a pretenſion, which is of little value, or rather which is pernicious even in the relations to which its utility is referred. What folly to cheriſh it? How much greater the folly ever to think of exerciſing it. It never can be exerciſed hereafter in our coun-try, without great and laſting miſchief.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of cheriſhing ſo odious a pretenſion as "our beſt, our only weapon of defence"—Wiſdom admoniſhes us to be eager to caſt it from us, as a weapon moſt dangerous to the wearer, proſcribed by the laws of nations, by the laws of honour, and by every principle of ſound policy.</p>
               <p>Every merchant ought to deſire that the moſt perfect tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity on this point in foreign countries, ſhould facilitate to him on the beſt and cheapeſt terms the credit for which he has occaſion. And every other citizen ought to deſire, that he may be thus freed from a continual contribution in the enhanced price of every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported commodity he conſumes, towards defraying the premium which the want of that tranquillity is calculated to generate.</p>

                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:028795_0132_0FDD4A74918002D0"/>Our treaty with Pruſſia, the 23d article of which has been cited, is indeed a model of liberality for the principles it contains, does honour to the parties, and has been in this country a ſubject of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and unqualified admiration. It contradicts, as if ſtudiouſly, thoſe principles of reſtriction and excluſion which are the foundation of the mercantile and navigating ſyſtem of Europe. It grants perfect freedom of conſcience and worſhip to ſubjects and citizens, with <hi>no other reſtraint</hi> than that they ſhall not inſult the religion of others: adopting the rule, that free ſhips ſhall make free goods, it extends the protection to the perſons as well as to the goods of enemies. Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating, as contraband, only arms, ammunition and military ſtores," it even provides that contraband articles ſhall not be confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, but may be taken on the condition of paying for them. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides againſt embargoes of veſſels and effects. It expreſsly exempts women, children, ſcholars of every faculty, cultivators of the earth, artizans, manufacturers, and fiſhermen, unarmed and inhabiting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortified towns, villages and places,—and in general, all others, whoſe occupations are for the common ſubſiſtence and benefit of mankind, their houſes, fields and goods, from moleſtation in their perſons and employments and from burning, waſting, and deſtruction, in time of war; and ſtipulates payment at a reaſonable price for what may be neceſſarily taken from them for military uſe. It likewiſe protects from ſeizure and confiſcation, in time of war, veſſels em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in trade, and inhibits the granting commiſſions to private armed veſſels, empowering them to take or deſtroy ſuch trading veſſels, or to interrupt their commerce; and it makes a variety of excellent proviſions to ſecure to priſoners of war, a humane treatment.</p>
               <p>Theſe particulars are ſtated as evidence of the temper of the day, and of a policy, which then prevailed, to bottom our ſyſtem with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to foreign nations upon thoſe grounds of moderation and equity by which reaſon religion and philoſophy had tempered the harſh maxims of more early times. It is painful to obſerve an effort to make the public opinion, in this reſpect retrogade, and to infect our councils with a ſpirit contrary to theſe ſalutary advances towards improvement in true civilization and humanity.</p>
               <p>If we paſs from our own treaty to thoſe between other nations, we find that the proviſions, which have been extracted from ours, have very nearly become formulas in the Conventions of Europe. As ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this may be conſulted, the following articles of treaties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great-Britain and other powers (towit) the xvii. article of a treaty of peace and commerce with Portugal, in 1642; the xxxvi. article of a treaty of peace, commerce and alliance, with Spain, in 1667; the xix. article of a treaty of peace, and the ii. of a treaty of commerce with France both in 1713, and the xii. article of a treaty of commerce and navigation with Ruſſia, in 1766.</p>
               <p>The article with Portugal provides, that if difficulties and doubts ſhall ariſe between the two nations, which give reaſon to <hi>apprehend</hi> the interruption of commerce <hi>public notice</hi> of it ſhall be given to the ſubjects on both ſides, and after that notice, <hi>two years</hi> ſhall be allowed to carry away their merchandizes and goods, and in
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028795_0133_0FDD4AA30DD35A38"/>
the mean time there ſhall be no injury or prejudice done to any perſons or goods on either ſide.</p>
               <p>The articles with France, in addition to the proviſions common in other caſes, particularly ſtipulate, that during the term of the protection (ſix months) "ſubjects on each ſide ſhall enjoy good and <hi>ſpeedy</hi> juſtice, ſo that during the ſaid ſpace of ſix months, they may be able to <hi>reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> their <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> entruſted as well to the PUBLIC as to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons."</p>
               <p>The article with Ruſſia, beſides ſtipulating an exemption from confiſcation for one year, with the privilege to remove and carry away in ſafety, provides additionally, that the ſubjects of each party "ſhall be further permitted either at or before their departure, to conſign the effects which they ſhall not yet have diſpoſed of, as well as the debts that ſhall be due to them to ſuch perſons as they ſhall think proper, in order to diſpoſe of them <hi>according to their deſire and for their benefit, which debts the debtors ſhall be obliged to pay in the ſame manner as if no ſuch rupture had happened.</hi>"</p>
               <p>All theſe articles are, with thoſe in our treaties, analagous in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as heretofore particularly explained to the 10th article of the treaty under diſcuſſion. That of the Britiſh treaty with France de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignates expreſsly debts due from the public as well as thoſe due from private perſons. That with Ruſſia goes the full length of our tenth article; empowering the creditors on each ſide to aſſign the debts, which they are not able to collect within the term of their reſidence to whomſoever they think fit, for their own benefit, and declaring that theſe debts ſhall be paid to the aſſignees in the ſame manner as if no rupture had happened.</p>
               <p>There is a document extant, which may fairly be ſuppoſed to expreſs the ſenſe of the government of France, at the period to which it relates, of the foundation of theſe ſtipulations. It is a memorial of Mr. Buſſy, miniſter from the Court of France to that of London, for negotiating peace, dated in the year 1761, and contains theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages. "As it is impracticable for two Princes, who make war with <hi>each other, to agree between them which is the aggreſſor with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the other</hi>†, equity and humanity have dictated theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions that where an unforſeen rupture happens ſuddenly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous declaration, foreign veſſels, which, navigating <hi>under the ſecurity of peace,</hi> and of treaties happen, at the time of the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be in either of the reſpective ports, ſhall have time and full liberty to withdraw themſelves.</p>
               <p>"This wiſe proviſion ſo agreeable to the rules of good faith, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes a part of the law of nations,</hi> and the article of the treaty, which ſanctifies theſe precautions, ought to be faithfully executed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the breach of the other articles of the treaty, which is the natural conſequence of the war."</p>
               <p>"The Courts of France and Great-Britain uſed this ſalutary precaution in the treaties of Utrecht and Aix la Chapelle."</p>
               <p>Theſe paſſages place the ſecurity ſtipulated in the treaties for the perſons and property of the ſubjects of one party found in the country of another, at the beginning of a war, upon the footing of its <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting a part of the law of nations</hi> which may be conſidered as a formal

                  <hi>at ſea,</hi> prior to a declaration of war, it may be regarded as a reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony of the law of nations on the principal point.</p>
               <p>If the law of nations confers this exemption from ſeizure upon veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which at the time of the rupture, happen to be in the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ports of the belligerent parties, it is evident that it muſt equally extend its protection to debts contracted in a courſe of lawful trade. Veſſels are particularly mentioned, becauſe the diſcuſſion turned upon veſſels ſeized at ſea. But the reference to the treaties of Utrecht and Aix la Chapelle, ſhews that the miniſter in his obſervation, had in view the whole ſubject matter of the articles of thoſe treaties, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſecurity of merchants and their effects in time of war.</p>
               <p>This conformity, in principle, of the article under examination, with the proviſions in ſo many treaties of our own and of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, taken in connection with the comment of Mr. Buſſy, brings a very powerful ſupport to the article. It is additional and full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that our Envoy, in agreeing to it, did not go upon new and untrodden ground; that on the contrary, he was in a beaten tract; that in purſuing the dictates of reaſon, and the <hi>better opinion</hi> of writers as to the rule of the law of nations reſpecting the point, he was at the ſame time purſuing the examples of all the other treaties which we had ourſelves made, and of many of thoſe of other countries.</p>
               <p>It is now incumbent upon me to perform my promiſe of replying to ſuch objections to the Article as may remain unanſwered by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding remarks. It is with pleaſure I note that the field is very narrow—that indeed there ſcarcely remains any thing which is not ſo frivolous and unimportant as almoſt to forbid a ſerious replication—It will therefore be my aim to be brief.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid there is only an apparent reciprocity in the article, millions being due on our ſide, and little or nothing on the other.</p>
               <p>The anſwer to this is, that no right being relinquiſhed on either ſide, no privilege granted, the ſtipulation amounting only to a recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a rule of the law of nations, to a promiſe to abſtain from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and breach of faith, there is no room for an argument about reciprocity further than to require that the promiſe ſhould be mutual as is the caſe—This is the only equiva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent which the nature of the ſubject demands or permits.—It would be diſhonourable to except a boon merely for an engagement to fulfil a moral obligation—Indeed, as heretofore intimated, the true rule of reciprocity in the ſtipulations of treaties is equal right, not equal advantage from each ſeveral ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>But it has been ſhewn that the ſtipulation will be beneficial to us, by the confidence which it will give on the other ſide, obviating and avoiding the obſtructions to trade, the injuries to and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances upon credit, naturally incident to the diſtruſt and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, which after the queſtion had been once moved, were to be expected—Here, if a compenſation were required, there is one—Let me add as a truth, which perhaps has no exception, however incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial with the faſhionable patriotic creed, that in the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is alſo ſaid, that having bound ourſelves by Treaty, we ſhall hereafter loſe the credit of moderation which would attend a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance to exerciſe the right. But it having been demonſtrated that no ſuch right exiſts, we only renounce a claim to the negative me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of not committing injuſtice, and we acquire the poſitive praiſe of exhibiting a willingneſs to renounce explicitly a pretenſion which might be the inſtrument of oppreſſion and fraud—It is always ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to give proof of upright intention.</p>

               <p>Shall I treat this rhapſody with ſeriouſneſs or with ridicule?</p>
               <p>The capital of the bank of the United States is ten millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, little ſhort at the preſent market price, of three millions of pounds ſterling—but from the natural operation of ſuch a demand in raiſing price, its not probable that much leſs than four millions ſterling would ſuffice to complete the monopoly. I have never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that the private purſe of his Britannic majeſty, if it be true as aſſerted, that he has already witneſſed a reliſh for ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our funds (a fact however from which it was natural to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a more pacific diſpoſition towards us) was ſo very ample as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently to ſpare an item of ſuch ſize for a ſpeculation acroſs the atlantic. But perhaps the national purſe will be brought to his aid As this ſuppoſes a parliamentary grant, new taxes and new loans, it does not ſeem to be a very manageable thing, without diſcloſure of the object, and if diſclo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For let it be remembered, that the article does not protect the public proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a foreign government, prince, or ſtate, independent of the obſervation juſt made, that ſuch a caſe would be without the reach of ordinary rules. It may be added, that an attempt of this kind, from the force of the pecuniary capital of Great Britain, would as a precedent threaten and alarm all nations.—Would conſequences like theſe be incurred?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:028795_0136_0FDD4A7776F65000"/>But let it be ſuppoſed, that the inclination ſhall exiſt and that all difficulties about funds have been ſurmounted—ſtill to effect the plan there muſt be in all the ſtockholders a willingneſs to ſell to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh king or his agents, as well as the will and means on his part to purchaſe. Here too ſome impediment might be experienced—There are perſons who might chooſe to keep their property in the ſhape of bank ſtock, and live upon the income of it, whom price would not readily tempt to part with it. Beſides, there is an additional ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to complete ſucceſs. The United States themſelves are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of two millions of the bank ſtock.</p>
               <p>Of two things, one, either the monopoly of his Britannic majeſty would be known (and it would be a pretty arduous taſk to keep it a ſecret eſpecially if the ſtock was to ſtand as ſuggeſted in the name of his <hi>ambaſſador</hi>) or it would be unknown and concealed under unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed names—In the former ſuppoſition, the obſervations already made cur. There would be no protection to it from the article—and the extraordinary nature, of the caſe would warrant any thing—Would his majeſty or the parliament chooſe to truſt ſo large a property in ſo perilous a ſituation?</p>
               <p>If to avoid this, the plan ſhould be to keep the operation unknown, the moſt effectual method would be to place the ſtock in the names of our own citizens. This it ſeems would be attended with no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſince even our ſenators would be ambitious of the honour; and if they ſhould have qualms and fears, others more compliant could no doubt be found amongſt the numerous ſectaries or adherents of Great Britain in our country.—probably ſome of the patriots would not be inexorable if properly ſolicited. Or in the laſt reſource perſons might be ſent from Great Britain to acquire naturalization for the expreſs purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In this ſuppoſition too, the article would be at the leaſt innocent:</p>
               <p>For its prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſions are entirely foreign to the caſe of ſtock ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the names of our own citizens. It neither enlarges nor abridges the power of the government in this reſpect.</p>
               <p>Further, how will the article work the miracle, of placing the bank under the management of <hi>Britiſh Directors?</hi> It gives no new rights, no new qualifications:</p>
               <p>The conſtitution of the bank (ſections 5 and 7 of the act of incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) has provided with ſolicitude theſe important guards, againſt foreign or other ſiniſter influence—1. That none but a <hi>Citizen of the United States</hi> ſhall be <hi>eligible</hi> as a DIRE<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That none but a ſtockholder <hi>actually reſident within the United States,</hi> ſhall vote in elections <hi>by proxy.</hi> 3: That one fourth of the <hi>directors,</hi> who are to be elected annually, muſt every year go out of the direction. 4. That a <hi>director</hi> may at any time be removed and replaced by the ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders at a gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hence it is impoſſible, that the bank can be in the management of <hi>Britiſh directors</hi>— A Britiſh ſubject being <hi>incapable</hi> of being a <hi>director.</hi> It is alſo next to impoſſible that an undue Britiſh influence could ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the choice of directors, out of the number of our own ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028795_0137_0FDD4AAA37126B50"/>
The Britiſh king, or Britiſh ſubjects out of the United States, could not even have a vote by attorney in the choice. Scheme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A ſmall number, no one of whom could have more than thirty votes, would be eaſily over-ruled by the more numerous proprietors of ſingle or a ſmall number of ſhares; with the addition of the votes of the United States.</p>
               <p>But here again it is to be remembered, that as to combinations with our own citizens, in which they were to be oſtenſible, for any pernicious foreign project—the article under conſideration is perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly nugatory —It can do neither good nor harm, ſince it merely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, as to the exemption from confiſcation and ſeizure on our part, to the known property of Britiſh ſubjects.</p>
               <p>It follows, therefore, that the dangers pourtrayed to us from the ſpeculating enterprizes of his Britannic majeſty are the vagaries of an overheated imagination—or the contrivances of a ſpirit of decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion —and that ſo far as they could be ſuppoſed to have the leaſt colour, it turns upon circumſtances, upon which the treaty can have no influence whatever. In taking pains to expoſe their futility, I have been principally led by the deſire of making my fellow citizens ſenſible, in this inſtance as in others, of the extravagancies of the oppoſers of the treaty.</p>
               <p>One artifice to render the article unacceptable has been to put caſes of extreme miſconduct, on the other ſide, of flagrant violations of the law of Nations, of war, of juſtice and of humanity; and to aſk whether under ſuch circumſtances the confiſcation or ſequeſtration of debts, would not be juſtifiable—To this the anſwer is, that if circumſtances ſo extraordinary ſhould ariſe as, without the treaty, would warrant ſo extraordinary an act, they will equally warrant it under the treaty. For caſes of this kind are exceptions to all general rules. They would excuſe the violation of an expreſs or poſitive, as well as of a tacit or virtual pledge of the public faith: which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the whole difference between the exiſtence and non-exiſtence of the article in queſtion. They reſemble thoſe caſes of extreme neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity (through exceſſive hunger for inſtance) which in the eye of the law of nature will excuſe the taking of the property of another, or thoſe caſes of extreme abuſe of authority in rulers, which amounting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocally to tyranny, are admitted to juſtify forcible reſiſtance to the eſtabliſhed authorities.—Conſtitutions of government, laws, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties all give way to extremities of ſuch a deſcription—the point of obligation is to diſtinguiſh them with ſincerity, and not to indulge our paſſions and intereſts in ſubſtituting pretended for real caſes.</p>
               <p>A writer, who diſgraces by adopting the name of CICERO, makes a curious remark by way of objection. He affirms that the article is nugatory, becauſe a treaty is diſſolved by a ſtate of war, in which ſtate the proviſion is deſigned to operate. If this be true, the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is at leaſt harmleſs, and the trouble of painting it in ſuch terrific colours might have been ſpared. But it is not true. Reaſon, writers, the practice of all nations accord in this poſition, that thoſe ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which contemplate the ſtate of war, in other words which are

               <p>The articles, which adjuſt the matters of controverſy between the two countries, all thoſe which are permanent, have now been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed. Let me appeal to the conferences of thoſe who have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me in the review—if theſe articles were all that compoſed the treaty, would it be better, that they ſhould exiſt—or that all the ſources of rupture and war with Great-Britain ſhould have ſurvived

the negociation to extinguiſh them, and ſhould ſtill actually ſubſiſt in full vigour? If every enlightened and honeſt man muſt prefer the former—then let me make another obſervation and put another queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The remaining articles of the treaty, which, conſtituting its commercial parts, expire by their own limitation at the end of <hi>twelve</hi> years. It is in the power of either party conſiſtently with the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to terminate them at the end of the expiration of <hi>two</hi> years after the preſent war between France and Great-Britain.</p>
