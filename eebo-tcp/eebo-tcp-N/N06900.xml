            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REMARKS ON THE LETTER ADDRESSED TO TWO GREAT MEN.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I SHALL not inquire who is the Author of the Piece on which I am going to remark. Your Opinions, and your Arguments, are all that I ſhall conſider. Whether you are, or ever have been <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. P. 2. of the Letter.</note> penſioned and employed, whether you are merely a private Man, or a Perſon diſtinguiſhed in Rank and Fortune, you are to me, and to the Public, on this Occaſion, only the Author of the Letter to Two Great Men; and you will give me Leave to addreſs you in that, and in no other Light. It is indeed a Light in which you cannot be viewed to your Diſadvantage; your Piece is animated with the Spirit of true Patriotiſm; it diſcovers political and hiſtorical Knowledge; and is written through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with Fire and Energy.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, that Animation of Language and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, which is allowed to the Orator in political Conflicts <hi>in pulvere et in ſole,</hi> has no Place in a ſober Diſcuſſion. I write not to the Ear or to the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008751_0004_102FDA9DCCEA84C0"/>
I aim at no Seduction of Judgment; and I aſk for no Approbation but what a Calm Reflection and unprejudiced Reaſon may afford me. My End is, rather to examine the Juſtneſs of your Plan, than to enforce any Plan of my own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I ſhall not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Flow, nor the Pomp, nor the high-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of parliamentary Declamation. If I can deliver a plain Argument in plain Language, it is all I aim at: For this I ſhall make no Apology; that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with which you warn the Miniſtry againſt fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Miſtakes in the enſuing Treaty of Peace, will juſtify me to you, and to the World, if I ſhould attempt to point out ſome of thoſe Miſtakes, into which I imagine you are yourſelf fallen.</p>
            <p>You cannot be ignorant in what Manner Succeſs operates upon the Minds of Men; with what a blind and haughty Confidence it inſpires them; and in the inſolent Elation of Victory, how little they attend to Reaſon or Juſtice, and often to their own moſt important Intereſts. People of all Nations imagine, that when they are worſted, Succeſs gives their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy very little Right to preſcribe ſevere Terms; and conceive when they are themſelves ſucceſsful, that there are no Bounds to their own Pretenſions. If this Diſpoſition ſhould happen at this Time to prevail amongſt us, it may be attended with very pernicious Conſequences. It may raiſe ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Expectations, or excite ſuch wrong-placed Deſires, as will render a Negotiation for Peace a Work of infinite Difficulty. A virtuous and able Miniſtry may, in ſome Sort, find their Virtue and Ability brought to act againſt themſelves; they may find that their Victories and Succeſſes have excited ſo much Arrogance in thoſe who had [no Share in acquiring them, as to deſtroy all their Effects; they may find their Virtue and Moderation over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the Madneſs of the People, and be thus
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008751_0005_102FDA9F557028C0"/>
diſabled from availing themſelves of a ſucceſsful War, in the Attainment of an advantageous Peace.</p>
            <p>I am afraid, Sir, that your Letter tends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and inflame this improper Diſpoſition. You are not to be blamed for delivering your Sentiments openly. The Liberty of an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and your own Abilities, give you a Right to do ſo. What I blame is your exceſſive Attachment to certain Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſo exceſſive, that if they ſhould not be inſiſted upon by the Miniſtry, with a Warmth equal to your own, you heſitate not to declare to the People, <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. P. 29. of the Letter.</note> 
               <hi>that we ſhall have a treacherous and deluſive Peace.</hi> This, Sir, is ſurely a moſt unjuſtifiable Method of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is to ſow the Seeds of general Diſcontent in Favour of your particular Opinions; Opinions, which, if they are not ill founded, are at leaſt very problematical: I cannot help obſerving, that your Reſentment againſt the Perfidy of the Enemy, has made you ſeem much more intent upon affronting <hi>France,</hi> than providing deliberately for the Intereſts of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſet forth, with great Strength of Fact and Reaſon, the Treachery of <hi>France,</hi> and her frequent Violations of the moſt ſolemn Treaties. You inſiſt particularly on the Caſe of <hi>Dunkirk:</hi> and I admit that you could not have choſen a more proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But I am ſorry to ſee that you are even here guided more by old Prejudices than by the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things; and that you have propoſed ſuch a <hi>Manner</hi> of acting, that, whilſt we are in Reality only demanding our honeſt and unqueſtionable Rights, we may have all the Appearance of acting with the moſt wanton Inſolence, with the moſt hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>You propoſe to the Two great Men, that,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008751_0006_102FDAA186211B68"/>
               <q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Vid. P. 24, 25.</hi>
                  </note> before they enter upon any new Treaty, or liſten to any plauſible Propoſal whatever, they ought to inſiſt that Juſtice may be done with Regard to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treaties; ſhew <hi>France</hi> the ſolemn Engagements ſhe entered into at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> to demoliſh <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> Demand</q>
ſay you,
<q>immediate Juſtice on that Article, as a preliminary Proof of her Sincerity in the enſuing Negotiation. Tell them, with the Firmneſs of wiſe Conquerors, that the Demolition of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is what you are intitled to by Treaties made long ago and violated, and that it ſhall not be ſo much as mentioned in the enſuing Negotiation, but complied with before that Negotiation ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though this is a Sort of Language hitherto, I believe, unheard in <hi>Europe,</hi> why you confine it to <hi>Dunkirk</hi> I cannot imagine. Why would you not have them in the ſame <hi>previous</hi> Manner renounce all Right to the diſputed Parts of <hi>America?</hi> You will, I hope, allow, that the <hi>French</hi> Encroachments there, are as much againſt the Faith of Treaties, as the Reſtoration of <hi>Dunkirk</hi>; and that we have full as good a Right to expect every Reparation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Honour with Regard to the one as to the other. But if all Points wherein the Violation of Treaties is charged, ought not, according to your Doctrine, to be ſo much as mentioned in the enſuing Negotiation, but ought to be ſettled before that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation ſhall commence, the Buſineſs of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will be ſo very ſhort, and ſo very eaſy, as to require no wonderful Share of that Knowledge, that Adroitneſs, and all that Combination of Talents, and Virtues, which you demand in a Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but which you are almoſt in Deſpair of finding among our Nobility. To ſpeak and to act to the Letter of the Inſtructions which you give him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008751_0007_102FDAA3B7F3C2D0"/>
of all thoſe Qualifications, he need only aſſume a deciſive and dictatorial Tone; to rail abundantly at thoſe employed by the Enemy to treat with him; to remind <hi>them of their amazing Perfidy</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 24.</note>; to tell them <hi>that he owes them a Diſgrace</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 25.</note>; to tell them <hi>that he can have no Dealings with ſuch a People</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. ib.</note>; and thus to go through the little that is left to be done with as great Airs of Arrogance and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority as he can poſſibly aſſume. Theſe are Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments indeed not difficult to be found, and which we need not deſpair to meet with at <hi>Arthur's, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r on the Turf.</hi>
               <note n="**" place="bottom">P. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I do not, Sir, mean to inſinuate, that the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is not an Object worthy of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. It is indeed probably not of quite ſo much Importance, as you think it, and as formerly it was thought, whilſt in the Continental Wars of King <hi>William,</hi> and Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> we neglected our Naval Strength, and the due Protection of our Trade. However, as it is ſtill an Object, there is no Doubt but in the enſuing Negotiation our Miniſtry will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with proper Care to have it demoliſhed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Tenor of former Treaties. This, Sir, we may ſay with ſome Aſſurance, will be done. But that this be done before we condeſcend to treat, that it is to be a Preliminary to the Preliminaries of Peace, is an Idea altogether extravagant, and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle juſtified by Precedent as by Reaſon. That thoſe very Matters for which War was declared ſhould not be ſo much as mentioned in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation for Peace, is a Principle entirely your own, and to which all the Writers on Politics have to this Day been entirely Strangers. You ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed aware of this, and therefore aſſert, that ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as you propoſe <note n="††" place="bottom">Vid. P. 9. of the Letter.</note>
               <q>cannot be looked upon
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008751_0008_102FDAA5ECA96D08"/>
as the Inſolence of a Conqueror, but as the wiſe Foreſight of a People, whom dear-bought Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath taught the proper Way of doing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Justice.</q>
For you obſerve ſome few Lines before that we ought
<q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. P. 9. of the Letter.</note> to take every Method in our Power to <hi>ſecure</hi> the Obſervance of thoſe Conceſſions they may make; and to inſiſt upon their giving us ſuch <hi>Proofs of their Sincerity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Negotiation is entered upon, as may give us ſome <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> that they <hi>mean to be more faithful</hi> to their <hi>future Engagements.</hi>

The Way you propoſe, then, of doing ourſelves Juſtice, is to inſiſt upon theſe Demands, as the Compliance with them by the <hi>French</hi> is ſuppoſed to be a Security for their adhereing to the Treaty.</p>
            <p>I ſhould, Sir, moſt willingly concur with you in recommending any Method which might ſecure their Adherence to ſuch Conceſſions as they ſhall make; which might draw from them any <hi>real Proof of their Sincerity,</hi> or which would give us <hi>ſome Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that they mean to be more faithful to their future Engagements:</hi> But I have conſidered your Demand in every Light which I was capable of putting it, and, after all, I am utterly unable to diſcover, if <hi>France</hi> ſhould ſubmit to the humiliating Step you propoſe, what additional Security this will, or can give us, that ſhe will keep the Peace that is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, whenever ſhe ſhall find it her Intereſt to break it. This Step may indeed be a mortifying Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her preſent Weakneſs, but can be no Sort of Security for her future Faith.</p>
            <p>So far from having any ſuch Operation, there is all the Reaſon in the World to expect that it would produce quite the contrary Effect. A Nation which, through the Neceſſity of its Affairs, ſubmits to Terms impoſed, for no other Purpoſe than to inſult
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008751_0009_102FDAA7838E1090"/>
her, ſeeks the firſt Opportunity to wipe off the Stain. She will not look upon ſuch Engagements as a Treaty, but as an Oppreſſion; and ſhe will find a Sort of Excuſe for the Infidelity of her Conduct in the Inſolence of ours. Nations, like Men, often reſent an Inſult more than an Injury.</p>
            <p>Unreaſonable as this Demand may be, you how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeem fond of it; for you again aſk,
<q>Can you have any Dealings with a Power, who, if he refuſes this, at the very Time that he is treating, affords you ſuch a manifeſt Proof that his Word is not to be relied upon, and that you cannot truſt to the Execution of any Promiſes ever ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made?</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. P. 25. of the Letter.</note> Why not? You may, Sir, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, have Dealings with ſuch a Power, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch a Refuſal; becauſe he only does what is extremely natural, and extremely reaſonable, in refuſing to deſtroy a Place which is of Uſe to him in War, before his Enemy has condeſcended to treat for Peace. You do not ſure, imagine, that any Nation is ſo ignorant and ſottiſh as not to know, that the voluntary weakening its Hands before a Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for Peace, is not the Way to ſecure it good Terms in that Negotiation; and that they may well refuſe to comply with this ignominious and unſafe Condition, without manifeſting any Intention of ſwerving from their Engagements. If it could be ſuppoſed for a Moment, that our Adminiſtration would adopt your Syſtem, might not <hi>France,</hi> in her Turn, aſk, and very reaſonably too, What Security we propoſe to give, if ſhe ſhould ſubmit to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary previous Preliminary, that we ſhall, even then, conſent, on our Side, to an equitable Peace? Or that this firſt unreaſonable Demand may not be followed by others ſtill more unreaſonable, whilſt we have any Thing to aſk, or ſhe any Thing left to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008751_0010_102FDAAA56430920"/>
give? to anſwer, <hi>Vae victis,</hi> would ſound ſtrangely. To anſwer otherwiſe, with Conſiſtency, is impoſſible. And it muſt be allowed, that ſo extraordinary a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, previous to a Treaty, would be a very bad Omen of our Moderation in the framing it. A Compliance with it would indeed mortify the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; but it would add nothing to our real Strength, whilſt it would alarm every Nation near us, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <hi>France</hi> in exciting that Jealouſy of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> naval Power, which ſhe has for a long Time been labouring, with great Induſtry, and ſome Succeſs, to infuſe into all the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly into the maritime States. You have very well obſerved upon the Terror which was excited by the Power of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. and upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Confederacy againſt him, which was the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this Power: But you have forgot to add, that the inſolent Uſe he made of his Greatneſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed as much, and provoked much more, than that enormous Power itſelf. It was indeed the true Cauſe of his Fall. Other Nations alſo may be thought too powerful; and they will be thought ſo, whenever they exerciſe their Power with Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Without having Recourſe to a <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 38.

            <p>The utmoſt rational Aim of our Ambition ought to be, to poſſeſs a juſt Weight and Conſideration in <hi>Europe</hi>; and that the Power of the Nation ſhould be rather reſpectable than terrible.

diſcreetly and quietly; then it will be happily felt in its Effects, while it is little ſeen in violent Exertions. The Genius and Diſpoſition of Nations, as well as Men, is beſt diſcerned by the Uſe they make of Power. And therefore, my great Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Part of your Plan, does not ariſe from the Nature of the Thing which you deſire; my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is to the Time and Manner in which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on having it done; which is, as I apprehend, to ourſelves of no Kind of Uſe, and therefore arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and unreaſonable towards the Enemy.</p>
            <p>After the Propoſal concerning <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> you lay before the two great Men the other Parts of your Plan. And here you recommend it to them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play their Moderation, by giving up <hi>Guadaloupe, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negal,</hi> and <hi>Goree</hi>; and their Wiſdom, by keeping the Poſſeſſion of every Part of <hi>Canada.</hi> To keep <hi>Canada</hi> is the Point you have principally at Heart:

               </note> 
               <hi>Views of Ambition,</hi> no Nation can poſſibly claim more.</p>
            <p>This admitted, Sir, I aſk, upon the firſt Head, Whether the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Canada,</hi> properly ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ever one of thoſe Objects for which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the War? Was it ever mentioned as ſuch in any of our Memorials or Declarations, or in any national or public Act whatſoever?</p>
            <p>The true Cauſe of the War, our real and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Right, is well known. Our Claims were large enough for Poſſeſſion, and for Security too. And will you ſay, Sir, that if, in the Beginning of theſe Troubles, <hi>France,</hi> influenced by a Dread of the Exertion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Power, had acknowledged theſe Claims, had given up <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> or <hi>Acadia,</hi> with its ancient and true Boundaries, had demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Fort in the Province of <hi>New York,</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved themſelves from the <hi>Ohio,</hi> and renounced all Claim to that Territory, and that, on thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, the Miniſtry had then ceaſed from Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, without acquiring, or even claiming <hi>Canada,</hi> will you ſay, that we ſhould have had a treacherous and deluſive Peace? You will hardly venture to aſſert, that we ſhould. And is a Peace made after <hi>France</hi> has felt the Force of <hi>Britain,</hi> and ſubmitted to that Force, to be more treacherous and deluſive than if ſhe had made it from an Apprehenſion only of the Conſequences? Is a Peace to be treacherous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive, if we do not get, on that Peace, what we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver claimed as our Right before the War? Is a Peace treacherous and deluſive, that puts us in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a Territory larger than ſeveral flouriſhing
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008751_0013_102FDAB05D5E8A18"/>
Mornachies? Is a Peace deluſive and treacherous, only becauſe ſomething is left to the Enemy?</p>
            <p>But you do not aſſert, that we have any original Right to <hi>Canada</hi>; nor do you ſay, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of thoſe Boundaries which we have claimed, do not give us a vaſt Territory, and an advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Barrier. You go upon another, which is indeed the only Principle which you make Uſe of, but which you are of Opinion is ſo ſtrong, <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 3. of the Letter.</note>
               <q>as to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all <hi>Europe</hi> of the Juſtice of your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Aſk the <hi>French</hi> what Security they can give you, if we reſtore <hi>Canada,</hi> however reſtrained in its Boundaries, that they will not again begin to extend them at our Expence?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries, Sir, muſt be very extraordinary Advocates to be ſilenced, and <hi>Europe,</hi> as extraordinary a Judge to be convinced by ſuch an Argument. <hi>France,</hi> Sir, might anſwer, That ſhe can give no ſuch Security. No Nation, whilſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, can give it. And therefore, no ſuch Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity ſhould be deſired. To deſire the Enemy's whole Country, upon no other Principle, but that otherwiſe you cannot ſecure your own, is turning the Idea of mere Defence into the moſt dangerous of all Principles. It is leaving no Medium between Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Conqueſt. It is never to ſuppoſe yourſelf ſafe, whilſt your Neighbour enjoys any Security. Indeed, ſuch a Queſtion, after the Matters diſputed in the War have been adjuſted, is an Avowal of ſuch an unreaſonable Ambition, that I truſt you will never be ſeconded in it by any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, or <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Miniſter. For it is a Queſtion that extends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely in its Conſequences; extends (for any Thing I can ſee to the contrary), to the utter Deſtruction
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008751_0014_102FDAB336097348"/>
of Mankind. For whilſt ever we have <hi>France,</hi> or any other Nation on our Borders, either in <hi>Europe</hi> or in <hi>America,</hi> we muſt, in the Nature of Things, have frequent Diſputes and Wars with them; and we muſt ſuppoſe, at leaſt, as often as we are ſucceſsful, that the Enemy is in Fault; that is, we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Enemy had provoked us to take Arms, by the Violation of ſome Treaty, or by the Invaſion of ſome undoubted Right. The Buſineſs of a Peace is, to adjuſt and to determine theſe Diſputes: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Enemy has agreed to our original Demands, if we go on to demand Security for the Preſervation of Peace, what leſs do we demand, than that they ſhould yield themſelves, bound Hand and Foot, up to our Mercy? Let our Borders be ever ſo extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as long as we have any Nation near us, we muſt have the ſame Diſputes, the ſame Wars, and we muſt demand, upon your Principle, the ſame Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity at the Concluſion of a Peace.</p>
            <p>There was a Nation indeed, which I am ſure we reſemble more in Courage than in Ambition and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, which frequently uſed to demand ſuch a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And ſuch a Caution they actually did require from the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> when they intended it as a Preliminary to the utter Deſtruction of that People, and to the moſt notorious Breach of Faith upon their own Side. Their Pretence was exactly yours; that the Enemy was a Nation perfidious to a Proverb; a People whom no Treaty could bind. They uſed the <hi>Punica,</hi> in the ſame Manner that you do the <hi>Gallica fides.</hi> I need not inform you, Sir, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: And indeed it was impoſſible that ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Pretenſions could end in any Thing but the total Deſtruction of the vanquiſhed.</p>
            <p>I do not ſee why the Arguments you employ concerning a Security for a peaceable Behaviour in <hi>Canada,</hi> would not be equally cogent for calling for the ſame Security in <hi>Europe.</hi> They are our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008751_0015_102FDAB59B606088"/>
and dangerous ones, here as well as there. The <hi>Low Countries, Lorrain, Alſace,</hi> ſhew us that the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy has been, at leaſt, as intent upon extending its Dominion in <hi>Europe,</hi> as it can be in <hi>America.</hi> We know that they have tried all the Methods of War, of Treaty, and of Marriages, to inlarge their dangerous Empire. But ſtill, dreaded as they are in <hi>Europe,</hi> (and much more to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than ever they were in <hi>America</hi>), if we could be ſo happy to ſee, what I fear we never ſhall ſee, a Confederacy to reclaim their Uſurpations, what would we ſay to the Inſolence of thoſe who, on your Principle, ſhould demand all <hi>France</hi> as a Security, that they ſhould not make the like Uſurpations for the future?</p>
            <p>But, Sir, our real Dependence for keeping <hi>France,</hi> or any other Nation, true to her Engagements, muſt not be in demanding Securities, which no Nation, whilſt independent, can give, but on our own Strength, and our own Vigilance.</p>
            <p>To ſay the Truth, we owe our Loſſes in <hi>America</hi> as much to our own Supineneſs as to the <hi>French</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy. Our Miniſters have heretofore acted in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>America,</hi> as if they expected, from a Magic in the Contract, that it would perform itſelf. They took no Steps to enforce it. But from the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Vigour of our preſent Adminiſtration, I ſhould expect another Conduct. As ſoon as <hi>France</hi> is happily reduced to cede us ſuch Boundaries as may be thought proper to demand, the ſame Spirit that has conducted the War, will maintain the Terms of the Peace. Inſtead of leaving <hi>France</hi> at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to build Forts at her Diſcretion, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forts will be raiſed at ſuch Paſſes, as may at once make us reſpectable to the <hi>French,</hi> and to the <hi>Indian</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. God forbid that we ſhould depend on the Sincerity of our Enemy. Every wiſe Nation will rely on its own Watchfulneſs, and on its own
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008751_0016_102FDAB72464E500"/>
Strength, to maintain the Terms they oblige their Enemy to give them; and whoever expects any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dependence, will find himſelf the Dupe.</p>
            <p>To ſupply any Defect that may be in your own Authority to perſuade this Meaſure, your favourite Meaſure of retaining <hi>Canada,</hi> you call in the Aid of our <hi>American</hi> Colonies; and tell us,
<q>Though Care ſhould be taken to keep all that we have claimed, ſomething more muſt be done, or our <hi>American</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies will tell you, you have done nothing.</q>
On what Authority this is ſo poſitively aſſerted to be the Language of our <hi>American</hi> Colonies, you have not told us. I hope and believe that you have been miſinformed. But if our <hi>American</hi> Colonies ſhould be ſo abſurd and ungreatful to tell us, after all the Blood and Treaſure expended in their Cauſe, that we do nothing, if we do not make Conqueſts for them, they muſt be taught a Leſſon of greater Moderation. If, with a Superiority of at leaſt ten to one, with a vaſt and advantageous Barrier, with the proper Precautions to ſtrengthen it, under the Protection of a great Naval Power, they cannot think themſelves ſecure, they muſt blame their own Cowardice or Ignorance, and not the Meaſures of their Mother Country; who is bound to provide for their Happineſs and Security, and not for their vain Ambition, or groundleſs Fears.</p>
            <p>The Idea of ſecuring yourſelf, only by having no other Nation near you, is, I admit, an Idea of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> Extraction. It is the genuine Policy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages; and it is owing to this Policy, that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> are able at this Day to diſpute the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of Deſerts in <hi>America</hi>; to which neither of us would otherwiſe have had any Right.</p>
            <p>As we pretend no original Right to <hi>Canada,</hi> that we can very rationally ſecure ourſelves in <hi>North A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> without the Poſſeſſion of it, will, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, need very few Arguments to demonſtrate.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008751_0017_102FDABA148B8198"/>
I have already obſerved upon the vaſt Superiority of Men that we have there; ſuch a Superiority, that I am always aſtoniſhed when I think on the unaccountable Conduct that has ever made <hi>France</hi> an Enemy to be apprehended on that Continent. We are in <hi>North America</hi> not only a greater Naval, but a far greater Continental Power. Our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in Point of Situation is no leſs viſible. If, added to theſe Advantages, we acquire on a Peace all thoſe important Poſts and Communications, by which alone <hi>Canada</hi> became in any Degree dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to us, I cannot ſee why <hi>Canada,</hi> weakened, ſtripped, confined, and I may ſay, bound down, will not be infinitely in more Danger, in Caſe of any Rupture between the two Nations, from our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, than ours can be from it.</p>
            <p>I cannot help obſerving, that among all your I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas of Security, and that in particular anxious as you are for the Security of <hi>North America,</hi> you ſhew little Regard to that of the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> Our <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbee</hi> Iſlands muſt be ever infinitely in greater Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> than our <hi>North American</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies can be from <hi>Canada</hi> circumſcribed as it ought, and as it is preſumed it will be. The <hi>French</hi> have a real Superiority in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and they have once made it to be ſeverely felt.</p>
            <p>If, as it has been ſhewn, we may, beyond any rational Fear, ſecure ourſelves without the intire Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Canada,</hi> we can deſire it in Preference to our other Conqueſts only on Account of its ſuperior Value. Though you have not at all inſiſted on this, yet, leſt this may be thought one of your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to that great Preference, and it is, ſure the beſt Motive you could have had, we will conſider the Point ſomewhat at large, and this will bring us to the ſecond of thoſe leading Ideas, that ought to guide a Nation in a Treaty of Peace; that is, to acquire a proper Indemnification for the Expences of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008751_0018_102FDABCE86BB3B8"/>
War. You are not one of the Number of thoſe who think we ought to give up nothing in a Peace. You do not claim <hi>Canada</hi> on a Principle of Right. We have examined it on the Principle of Security; the only Queſtion that now remains to be diſputed between us is, Whether <hi>Canada</hi> be a better Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for the Expences of the War, than all our other Conqueſts put together? for you give up all the Reſt with great Eaſe, and inſiſt on this only.</p>
            <p>Before we enter into a Compariſon between the Value of our Acquiſitions in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Canada,</hi> I muſt beg leave to take ſome Notice of your Reaſon, your only Reaſon, for giving up the Iſland of <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 33.
<q>The Poſſeſſion of <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> an additional Sugar Iſland, when we have ſo many of our own, ought not to be inſiſted upon ſo ſtrenuouſly as to make it a neceſſary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Peace; and though <hi>Senegal</hi> and <hi>Goree</hi> are of real Importance in the Slave and Gum Trades, our own <hi>African</hi> Settlements have hitherto ſupplied us with Slaves ſufficient for our <hi>American</hi> Purpoſes.</q>
               </note>,
<q>that we have already ſo many Sugar Iſlands of our own.</q>
If any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could poſſibly be drawn from our having A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Territory, ſurely its holds much more ſtrongly with Regard to <hi>North America,</hi> where one of our Provinces alone has more Land than ours, and all the <hi>French</hi> Sugar Lands put together. If we have in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> Land enough for Sugar, ſurely we have Land enough in <hi>North America</hi> for the far leſs valuable Commodities, which are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on that vaſt Continent. On what Grounds you are pleaſed to think the keeping a great Sugar Iſland an Acquiſition of little Conſequence, I am unable to comprehend. You know, ſurely, that in one of our Iſlands, the greateſt of them, we labour under a Sort of Monopoly, and under other Diſadvantages, hard, if not impoſſible to be remedied. You know that another Iſland, I mean <hi>Barbados,</hi> formerly
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008751_0019_102FDABEAE012150"/>
one of our beſt, is at preſent much exhauſted; ſo that the Produce, and the Profit made on that Produce, diminiſhes daily; and that the Reſt, except perhaps <hi>Antigua,</hi> are quite inconſiderable; ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, that the Iſlands, which as Dependents on <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> are ſcarce mentioned, are much more valuable. It was no ſooner found that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was intent on ſettling the Iſland of <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> than ſome conſiderable Planters immediately removed thither, and it is now almoſt wholly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Many have actually Intereſts in <hi>Martinico</hi>; and <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> was ſcarce taken, when our Planters flocked thither, and immediately made conditional <note n="†" place="bottom">I ſay <hi>conditional,</hi> becauſe the Capitulation has rendered it impoſſible to make an abſolute Purchaſe; but they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made Contracts to purchaſe, if the Iſland remains to us, and have taken Poſſeſſion of Plantations by Virtue of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</note> Purchaſes, ſenſible of the Superiority of this Iſland, and the Defects of our own.</p>
            <p>In Conſequence of thoſe Wants, and Diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, our Sugar Iſlands produce little more than what ſerves the Home-conſumption; and that too at a very advanced Price. From the foreign Market we have, before this War, been almoſt wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. <hi>France</hi> ſupplied all the Markets of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſupplied them in a great Meaſure from the Produce of this very Iſland, which you eſteem ſo lightly. When we conſider Things in a commercial Light, it is the foreign Market which ought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to have the greateſt Influence. Thoſe who ſupply the Home-conſumption purvey to our Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury: Thoſe who ſupply the foreign Market admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to our Wealth, and to our Power.</p>
            <p>To ſhew you, Sir, how much the Sugar-trade might contribute to the Wealth and Power of any Nation, by what it formerly did contribute to ours, and what for a long Time paſt it has contributed to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008751_0020_102FDAC0372B0430"/>
that of <hi>France,</hi> I will lay before you ſome Facts, which are, Sir, of a Nature infinitely more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing than the warmeſt Sallies of the moſt lively Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. About the Time of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> we ſupplied the greateſt Part of the Sugar-conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughout <hi>Europe. France,</hi> far from contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us in the foreign Market, took from us a great Part of what they uſed at home. From the Year 1715 to 1719, we exported, one Year with another, 18,580 Hogſheads of Sugar; but from 1719 to 1722, we fell to leſs than half; for we ſent abroad but 9064 <hi>communibus annis.</hi> We continued regularly on the Decreaſe to 1739, in which Year our Sugar-export had fallen to 4078 Hogſheads. Since that Time, it has fallen almoſt to nothing. Now, let us turn the other Side, and view the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-trade of <hi>France</hi> ſince the ſame Period, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> At that Time the <hi>French</hi> exported no Sugars. But mark, Sir, the Revolution in 1740, when the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Trade in that Article was in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner annihilated: <hi>France,</hi> after ſerving her Home-conſumption at a very eaſy Rate, exported no less than 80,000 Hogſheads of Sugar, which, with the Gains of the Commiſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was reputed to be worth to <hi>France</hi> more than a Million <hi>Sterling,</hi> to employ 40 Ton of Shipping, and 4000 Seamen, ſolely in bringing from the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> to <hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe, Sir, are Facts to proclaim loudly the Advantage of thoſe Iſlands to <hi>France</hi> whilſt they were in her Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and declare no leſs ſtrongly the Advantages which muſt accrue to <hi>Britain,</hi> if ſhe could attain the Poſſeſſion of one of the very beſt of them. Facts theſe that ought not to be paſſed lightly, until you can ſhew ſomething like them in Favour of the Plan you ſo warmly embrace; which cannot, I believe, be done. I therefore, Sir, cannot help thinking, that your Reaſons for rejecting <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> on the Principle <hi>of our having Sugar-land enough,</hi> are not
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008751_0021_102FDAC288F3A428"/>
near ſo ſtrong, or the Matter ſo well weighed, as the Importance of the Queſtion deſerves.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee what the Value of this <hi>Canada</hi> is, in Compariſon of which you reject all our other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions.</p>
            <p>Unluckily for your Argument, you yourſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 30 and 33.</note> at your ſetting out, that the <hi>French</hi> ſet very little Value upon this Poſſeſſion; and that they have even deliberated, whether it ſhould not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely abandoned.</p>
            <p>If, in the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> who have no other Northern Colony, from whence to ſupply their Iſlands with Lumber, Corn, and Proviſion, <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> was of ſo very little Importance, what is it like to prove in ours, who have ſuch immenſe Tracts ſo much more conveniently ſituated for that Trade; and who can eaſily ſupply Five Times the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ours, theirs, and all the other <hi>Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> Iſlands put together; and that too at a much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier Rate than they can poſſibly have theſe Things at from <hi>Canada?</hi> But I do not inſiſt upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, though it is ſtrong againſt you; becauſe I do not believe that <hi>France</hi> has ſuch a Diſregard for this their only conſiderable Poſſeſſion in <hi>North America.</hi> It is a great While ſince they thought of giving it up; and they are long convinced that it is of ſome Uſe to them, independent of their Hopes of incroaching on our Poſſeſſions. Aſk thoſe, Sir, who lately ſaw <hi>Canada,</hi> if it had the Face of a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which the Mother-country was weary of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? I believe, Sir, they will tell you, that the Cultivation of the Lands, the Number and Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Houſes, the warm Condition of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, by no Means ſeemed to imply, that they were neglected by <hi>France</hi>; but evinced rather, that this Colony was the Object of her very tender Concern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:008751_0022_102FDAC4192BC190"/>There are, independent of the Opinion or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of <hi>France,</hi> many Reaſons why we ſhould not think <hi>Canada</hi> a valuable Exchange for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in the <hi>Weſt Indies. Canada,</hi> ſituated in a cold Climate, produces no Commodity, except Furs and Skins, which ſhe can exchange for the Commodities of <hi>Europe</hi>; and conſequently ſhe can have little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to make the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant. We know what trifling Returns we have from ſome of our own very flouriſhing Colonies in <hi>America.</hi> The whole Trade of Furs and Skins, which <hi>Canada</hi> carried on with <hi>France,</hi> fell ſhort, in its moſt flouriſhing State, of 140,000 a-year. The Reſt of their Produce, with regard to the Market of <hi>Europe,</hi> is as nothing. A very great Part of the Value of thoſe Furs was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>France</hi> in the Article of Brandy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, the Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> for their Beaver and Deer Skins could not be carried on. But, as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantation, <hi>Canada</hi> muſt ſupply itſelf, as all the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations do, with Rum; elſe they will be obliged entirely to relinquiſh the Fur and Peltry Trade, which is the only valuable Trade they have. But let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, how they can come to the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket from the Bottom of the River <hi>St. Laurence,</hi> with the groſs and cheap Article of Lumber and Corn, on a Footing with our Colonies, many of which are not three Weeks Sail from the <hi>Leeward</hi> Iſlands. They could neither Trade with <hi>Europe,</hi> nor with the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> with any tolerable Advantage; not with the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> becauſe they muſt be underſold in that Market; not with <hi>Europe,</hi> becauſe, being ſo underſold, they cannot have the Rum that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, which keeps up their Commerce with <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, whilſt <hi>Canada</hi> is in the Hands of <hi>France,</hi> the Skin-trade may be kept up ſo as to be an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008751_0023_102FDAC799D05A48"/>
becauſe the Return for thoſe Commodities, brings back the Brandy with which they are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed: And thus the Trade is kept alive by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Circulation. The bulkier Articles of Corn and Lumber may likewiſe continue a Branch of their Trade; becauſe it is their Intereſt to ſupport, by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Method, the Vent of theſe Articles in their <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> in Preference to Foreigners. But <hi>Canada,</hi> in our Hands can have no ſuch Preference; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from its Situation, cannot be on an Equality in the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Market; and from which Market a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone it is that they, as a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Poſſeſſion, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the Spirits, or thoſe Materials for Spirits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Fur and Peltry, their only Trade, muſt certainly periſh. Theſe Principles appear to me ſo well grounded, that I think it no Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to propheſy,
<q>if that Place ſhould ever be ours, the Fur-trade of <hi>Canada</hi> muſt inevitably come to little or nothing in a few Years.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But let us extend our View a little farther; let us ſuppoſe, that if, inſtead of aiming at the entire Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>North-America,</hi> we confine ourſelves to thoſe Limits which we have always claimed there; and that <hi>Canada</hi> is reſtored to <hi>France,</hi> curtailed in ſuch a Manner as to ſecure the <hi>Ohio</hi> Country, and the Communication of the Lakes. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the Southward of Lake <hi>Erie,</hi> and near the <hi>Ohio,</hi> is the greateſt <hi>Indian</hi> hunting Country in <hi>North America.</hi> If this Territory ſhould remain with us on a Peace, it naturally draws to us all that Trade which depends upon the hunting of Deer and Beaver; and if this Country ſhould be further ſecured to us, by the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Niagara,</hi> which is a Poſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Importance, and entirely commands the great Lakes of <hi>Erie</hi> and <hi>Ontario,</hi> I cannot ſee how it is poſſible to keep the far greater Part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of <hi>North America</hi> out of our Hands. The <hi>Indians</hi> muſt every where be intercepted before they
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008751_0024_102FDAC9D67D81E0"/>
can arrive at the <hi>French</hi> Colony, even ſuppoſing (what can never be) that the <hi>French</hi> could entice them thither by ſelling cheaper than our Dealers.</p>
            <p>Thus, without aiming at the total Poſſeſſion of <hi>Canada,</hi> by eſtabliſhing proper Limits, and by ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them properly, we may draw to ourſelves a great Part of that Trade which muſt give <hi>Canada</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any Value, in the Eyes of a commercial Nation.</p>
            <p>So that the Queſtion, Sir, is not, Whether <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> extended to the Ocean, by a Poſſeſſion of the River <hi>St. John,</hi> and a great Part of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon, and menacing <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New England,</hi> commanding excluſively all the Lakes and Rivers, whether ſuch a Country ought to be kept in Preference to <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> and our other Conqueſt? but, Whether <hi>Canada,</hi> ſtripped of theſe Advantages, and confined to its proper Bounds, confined to the <hi>Northward</hi> of thoſe Lakes and Rivers, be a better Acquiſition than our rich Conqueſt in the <hi>Weſt Indies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we compare the Value of the Returns of <hi>Canada,</hi> even whilſt it flouriſhed moſt by its Incroachments upon us, with thoſe of <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> we ſhall find them in no Degree of Competition. The Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade, whoſe Value is before mentioned, is its whole Trade to <hi>Europe.</hi> But <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> beſides the great Quantities of Sugars, Cotton, Indigo, Coffee, and Ginger, which it ſends to Market, carries on a Trade with the <hi>Carraccas</hi> and other Parts of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Main, which is a Trade wholly in the Manufactures of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Returns for which, are almoſt wholly in ready Money. Without eſtimating the Land, the Houſes, the Works, and the Goods in the Iſland, the Slaves, at the loweſt Valuation, are worth upwards of one Million two hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Pounds <hi>Sterling.</hi> It is a known Fact, that they make more Sugar in <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> than in any of our Iſlands, except <hi>Jamaica.</hi> This Branch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008751_0025_102FDACB60493688"/>
beſides the Employment of ſo much Shipping, and ſo many Seamen, will produce clear 300,000 <hi>per Annum</hi> to our Merchants. For, having ſufficient from our own Iſlands, to ſupply our Home-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, the whole Sugar-produce of <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> will be exported; and will conſequently be ſo much clear Money to <hi>Great Britain.</hi> And, Sir, the whole Produce of <hi>Canada,</hi> though it were all exported from <hi>England,</hi> and exported compleatly <hi>manufactured,</hi> would not amount to the Value of that ſingle Article <hi>unmanufactured</hi>; nor would it employ the one twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Part of the Shipping, and the Seamen. But this, though the largeſt, is not the only Produce of <hi>Guadaloupe</hi>; Coffee, which in our Iſlands is none, or a very inconſiderable Object, is there a very great one. They raiſe beſides, great Quantities of Indigo and Cotton, which ſupply Materials for our beſt and moſt valuable Manufactures, and which employ ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Hands than the Increaſe of the Hat-trade, propoſed by the keeping <hi>Canada,</hi> can do. This iſland is capable, in our Hands, of being improved to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble its preſent Value; whereas <hi>Canada,</hi> in our Hands, would not probably yield half what it did to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is, Sir, one Argument I would uſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to you, who are ſo ſtrongly ſenſible of the Inconvenience <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is to us from its Situation. Surely there is not a ſingle Word you ſay, in Reſpect to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> that does not hold as ſtrongly in Regard to <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> ſituated in the very Heart of our <hi>Leeward</hi> Iſlands, and there infeſting one of the moſt advantageous Branches of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Commerce. It is not to be denied but that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſter and the <hi>London</hi> Trader has ſuffered by the <hi>Dunkirk</hi> Privateers; but their Loſſes this War have not been near ſo conſiderable as that of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and above all of the <hi>North American</hi> Traders, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, I believe, you will not diſpute to be of ſome Importance. Aſk, Sir, the <hi>North American</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008751_0026_102FDACE9101F548"/>
aſk the People of the <hi>Leeward</hi> Iſlands, what a vaſt Security they thought it to their Trade, that <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> ſhould be in our Hands? Our Iſlands were ſo annoyed from thence, that they ſcarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it in any other Light than as a Neſt of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers: They were ſurpriſed on going there, to find a People richer than in any of our own Iſlands; and Land ſo much better than their own, that many of our rich Planters have already made <note n="†" place="bottom">I ſay <hi>conditional,</hi> becauſe the Capitulation rendered it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to make abſolute Purchaſes; but they have poſſeſſed themſelves of Plantations, by Contract, to purchaſe them if the Iſland remains to <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
               </note> conditional Purchaſes there.</p>
            <p>Not to confine our Views ſolely to a commercial Point, give me Leave to mention one great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that, in a political Light, may ariſe from our Poſſeſſion of <hi>Guadaloupe.</hi> It is very well known, that the Hand of Government is heavy on the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi>; many of theſe People are already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in this Iſland, and they have Connections of every Kind with thoſe of their own Perſuaſion at home; and may we not hope and expect that this may be an Inducement to many others to make this their Retreat, and that the Colony may be enriched by them?</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Sir, in whatever Light you view the Iſland of <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> you will find it a moſt valuable and a moſt deſirable Object. Do you aſk to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive your Enemy of an advantageous Poſt, from whence he might materially moleſt your Trade in Time of War? Do you wiſh to extend your Trade in Time of Peace, and to have a new Market for all your Manufactures? From being ſcarce able to ſupply the Home-Conſumption with Sugar, do you deſire to be foremoſt at the foreign Market? This Iſland, Sir, of <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> that you eſteem ſo little, will anſwer all theſe Ends; Ends ſo material, that I
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008751_0027_102FDAD0BAEFB908"/>
truſt, Sir, that the Stone you have rejected, will be made the Corner Stone in the Temple of Peace.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Sir, I muſt repeat it, that I am not a little ſurpriſed that you ſhould paſs over, in a Manner ſo careleſs, and with ſuch extreme Superficiality, a Point ſo very material and intereſting as this, to tell us, that <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 33.</note>
               <q>
                  <hi>the Poſſeſſion of</hi> Guadaloupe, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Sugar Iſland, when we have ſo many of our own, ought not to be ſo ſtrenuouſly inſiſted upon, as to make it a neceſſary Condition of the Peace.</q>
Had you taken the Pains to inform yourſelf of the Facts neceſſary for making a Judgment on this Matter, or had you duly attended to them, you could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have ſaid, that it was not to be inſiſted upon, and in the ſame Breath aſſert, that, without <hi>Canada,</hi> we ſhould have a treacherous and deluſive Peace.</p>
            <p>You ſay a great Deal, and with Reaſon, upon the Value of our <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <q>If, notwithſtanding our having loſt ſeveral Branches of Commerce we formerly enjoyed in <hi>Europe</hi> and to the <hi>Levant,</hi> we have ſtill more Commerce than ever, a greater Demand for our Manufactures, and a vaſt Increaſe of our Shipping, what can this be owing to but to the Trade of our own <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Colonies?</q> Vid. the Letter.</note> 
               <hi>North-American</hi> Colonies, and the great Increaſe of our Trade has had from that Quarter. But you paſs by, with very little Notice, how much both the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and the Trade of theſe very <hi>North-American</hi> Colonies, owes to the Iſlands.</p>
            <p>You look upon theſe Iſlands only as an inferior dependent Part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations, which you ſcarce think worth While to mention: But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think you are under ſome Miſtake in this Point, in addition to thoſe Reaſons which have been given to ſhew the Preference of <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to <hi>Canada,</hi> there are ſome Facts which I beg Leave to ſubmit to your Obſervation, concerning
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008751_0028_102FDAD249C167F0"/>
               <hi>Settlements</hi> on the Continent of <hi>North America</hi> and Plantations in the <hi>Weſt Indian</hi> Iſlands. Though it may be a new Idea, I ſhall not heſitate to ſay, that an <hi>Iſland Colony</hi> is always more advantageous than a continental one, for the Mother-country.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Iſlands never conſider themſelves as at home there: They ſend their Children to the Mother-country for Education; they themſelves make many Trips to the Mother-country to recover their Health, or enjoy their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. If they have Ambition, it is hither they come to gratify it. I need not, I ſuppoſe, obſerve to you, how many Gentlemen of the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> have Seats in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Houſe of Commons. I might, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, venture to ſay, there are very few who have inherited Plantations in any of our Iſlands, who have not had an <hi>European</hi> Education, or at leaſt have not ſpent ſome Time in this Kingdom. Many who have Plantations, receive and ſpend the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of them here, without ever having even ſeen the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> If the Commerce with the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Iſlands had even been, in ſome Reſpects, againſt us, this Circumſtance alone would turn the Balance in our Favour. But this, in Truth, is very far from being the Caſe. The Trade we carry on with that Part of the World is as happily circumſtanced as Imagination could form it. The <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands lie in a Climate different totally from ours. The natural Produce, therefore, interferes, in no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect with that of <hi>England.</hi> Their Produce is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as the Taſte and Turn of our Manners call for; but demand ſo ſtrongly, that if we had them not from our own Colonies, we muſt purchaſe from Strangers. The Commerce between the Mother-country and a <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Iſland is natural and eaſy. It needs, in no Reſpect, to be forced or managed: They are mutually formed for each other: Neither is there any Sort of Fear, that the Iſlands in that Part
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008751_0029_102FDAD4788FA128"/>
of the World ſhall ever make this Commerce leſs eaſy or leſs advantageous. The extreme Dearneſs of Proviſion will never ſuffer them, how much ſoever they may be inclined, to ſet up any ſort of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture which may interfere with our Fabrics. So that theſe Colonies, by their very Nature, Situation, and Products, by what they have, and by what they want, are kept neceſſarily connected with and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon <hi>England,</hi> and muſt ever be ſo, as long as we are able to protect them. Let us now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Sir, whether the greateſt Part of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which we poſſeſs or deſire in <hi>North America,</hi> can come in Competition with the Iſlands, either in the Advantages we derive from them, or in the Certainty of holding thoſe Advantages for the Future. With regard to the Eſtates in <hi>North America</hi> ſpent in <hi>England,</hi> I may affirm, that from <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> there are abſolutely none; yet in this Tract are the four Provinces of <hi>New England,</hi> the great Countries of <hi>New York, Penſylvania,</hi> and the two <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> Places highly flouriſhing in Commerce, and abounding with People: Even to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this Line, there are few Eſtates either in Number or Value ſpent in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>North America,</hi> the Climate is not in general unfavourable to an <hi>European</hi> Conſtitution, and it is ſuch in which Men fond of rural Diverſions may paſs their Time agreeably. The Truth is, tho' their Eſtates ſupply them with Plenty to live at home, they do not furniſh Mony enough to ſend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Excepting Proprietaries, I do not remember that this vaſt Continent ſupplies our Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons with one ſingle Member.</p>
            <p>To view the Continent of <hi>America</hi> in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial Light, the Produce of all the Northern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies is the ſame as that of <hi>England,</hi> Corn, and Cattle; and therefore, except for a few naval Stores, there is very little Trade from thence directly to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008751_0030_102FDAD6E0CEB268"/>
               <hi>England.</hi> Their own Commodities bear a very low Price; Goods carried from <hi>Europe</hi> bear a very high Price; and thus they are of neceſſity driven to ſet up Manufactures ſimilar to thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> in which they are favoured by the Plenty and Cheapneſs of Proviſions. In fact, there are Manufactures of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kinds in theſe Northern Colonies, that promiſe in a ſhort Time to ſupply their Home-conſumption. From <hi>New England</hi> they begin even to export ſome things manufactured, as Hats, for inſtance. In theſe Provinces they have Colleges and Academies for the Education of their Youth; and as they increaſe daily in People and in Induſtry, the Neceſſity of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with <hi>England,</hi> with which they have no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Intercourſe by a Reciprocation of Wants, will continually diminiſh. But as they recede from the Sea, all theſe Cauſes will operate more ſtrongly; they will have nothing to expect, they muſt live wholly on their own Labour, and in Proceſs of Time will know little, inquire little, and care little about the Mother-country.</p>
            <p>If, Sir, the people of our Colonies find no Check from <hi>Canada,</hi> they will extend themſelves, almoſt without Bounds, into the Inland Parts. They are invited to it by the Pleaſantneſs, the Fertility, and the Plenty of that Country; and they will increaſe infinitely from all Cauſes. What the Conſequence will be, to have a numerous, hardy, independent People, poſſeſſed of a ſtrong Country, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting little, or not at all with <hi>England,</hi> I leave to your own Reflections. I hope we have not gone to theſe immenſe Expences, without any Idea of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Fruits of them to Poſterity. If we have, I am ſure we have acted with little Frugality or Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. This is indeed a Point that muſt be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Object of the Miniſters Attention, but is not a fit Subject for a Diſcuſſion; I will therefore expatiate no farther on this Topic: I ſhall only obſerve, that
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008751_0031_102FDAD9BAA6A9E8"/>
by eagerly graſping at extenſive Territory, we may run the Riſque, and that perhaps in no very diſtant Period, of loſing what we now poſſeſs. The Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Canada,</hi> far from being neceſſary to our Safety, may in its Conſequence be even danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. A Neighbour that keeps us in ſome Awe, is not always the worſt of Neighbours. So that far from ſacrificing <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> to <hi>Canada,</hi> perhaps, if we might have <hi>Canada</hi> without any Sacrifice at all, we ought not to deſire it. And, beſides the Points to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered between us and <hi>France,</hi> there are other Powers who will probably think themſelves intereſted in the Deciſion of this Affair. There is a Balance of Power in <hi>America</hi> as well as in <hi>Europe,</hi> which will not be forgotten; and <hi>this is a Point I ſhould have expected would ſomewhat have engaged your Attention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to <hi>Senegal</hi> and <hi>Goree,</hi> I concur with you in not making them the principal Object of our Negotiations at the Congreſs <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 33. <q>
                     <hi>Senegal</hi> and <hi>Goree,</hi> though of real Importance in the Slave and Gum Trades, our own <hi>African</hi> Settlements have hitherto ſupplied us with Slaves ſufficient for our <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Purpoſes; and the Gum Trade is not perhaps of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence enough to make us Amends for the annual Mortality which we already lament of our brave Countrymen, to guard our <hi>African</hi> Conqueſts.</q>
               </note> for a Peace; but it is upon Principles very different from yours. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the <hi>African</hi> Trade, and that conſiſtently enough, becauſe you ſeem to lay little Weight on that of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> which is ſupported by it; but the Reduction of the Price of Slaves, the whole Trade of Gum thrown into our Hands, and the Increaſe of thoſe of Gold and Ivory, would make even thoſe Places a far better Purchaſe than <hi>Canada,</hi> as might, I think, be ſhewn without much Difficulty. But I do not inſiſt upon it; becauſe I think we ought to be as moderate in the Terms of Peace, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a reaſonable Indemnification, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe too I know, in the Nature of Things, that it
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008751_0032_102FDADBF921E678"/>
is impoſſible to retain all. In one word, I will not venture, Sir, to ſay, <hi>we have a treacherous and deluſive Peace,</hi> unleſs the Peace is made in Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to my Ideas; for there may be Reaſons that neither you, or I, Sir, can poſſibly be acquainted with, which may make this not proper to be inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon; but I will take upon me, Sir, to ſay, that if by this War we gain <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> we gain as great an Acquiſition as ever this Nation gained by any Treaty or any War; and if it is poſſible to retain this, we need not aſk for more.</p>
            <p>At a Congreſs, Sir, in the Face of that Auguſt Aſſembly, formed by the Repreſentatives of the Chriſtian World, we ſhall there exhibit ourſelves in our real Character, and ſhew all the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> what they are to expect from us, and how far they ought to wiſh the Continuance and Increaſe of our Greatneſs. Therefore any ſhew of arrogant Superiority, any unmeaſurable Claim, any avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Graſping, though they may ſeem immediately to fall upon <hi>France,</hi> are in effect Menaces to every other Power. But if Moderation is neceſſary there, when the War is ended, and when we act as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how much more neceſſary is it to private Men, whilſt the War ſtill continues with that Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which muſt always attend the moſt proſperous Fortune. You cannot forget, in this very Year, what an Aſpect our Affairs in <hi>Germany</hi> wore, before the glorious Battle of <hi>Minden</hi>; and you cannot be ignorant how much this muſt have affected in a Negotiation for Peace. Things are not yet decided there; they look indeed favourable, but not favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough, either with Regard to his Majeſty's Army, and ſtill leſs with Regard to the King of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> to entitle you to preſcribe Terms in the Stile of a <hi>Roman</hi> Dictator, even if any Fortune could intitle you to do it. Let us, Sir, uſe a little Moderation in our happy Hour, that we may at
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008751_0033_102FC9D305767000"/>
all Events preſerve an Uniformity of Conduct, and not act meanly, if, contrary to our Wiſhes, any reverſe of Fortune ſhould oblige us to be moderate. I ſhould indeed think it the more neceſſary in you to have been ſo, as you have not, in my humble Opinion, choſen your Objects very properly. <hi>France,</hi> Sir, though beaten in all Quarters of the World, worſted both by Sea and Land; though the Credit of her Arms and her Finances are impaired, ſhe is not yet totally ruined; nor, as I conceive, brought ſo low as ſhe was in the War of Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> Yet, Sir, you will be pleaſed to remember, that by the haughty Demeanor, the unreaſonable Expectations, the arrogant, I may ſay, ridiculous Demands of the Allies, the happy Hour for making Peace on the moſt advantageous Conceſſions was ſuffered to eſcape; until Faction had Time to raiſe its Head in <hi>England,</hi> the Poſture of Affairs to change Abroad, and the Fortune of the War to vary in ſo many Particulars, that the Reſult of all our Succeſs and Arrogance was—the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> The M. <hi>de Torcy</hi>'s Memoirs are a lively Picture of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and its Conſequences.</p>
            <p>I have, Sir, attentively, and I hope it will be allowed fairly, examined your principal Arguments. You will give me Leave now to obſerve a little upon ſome Things of leſs Conſequence, which lie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from one another here and there in your Performance.</p>
            <p>I reſpect the Zeal which you ſhew for the Intereſt of your Country; but I think that Zeal has tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported you much too far in your Reflections on the Conduct and Capacities of our Nobility. If the Eaſineſs of their Fortunes hurries many of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Life of Diſſipation and Pleaſure, that has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been the Caſe, becauſe it is the natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Youth and Affluence. This, if we may
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008751_0034_102FDADFBAB5C130"/>
truſt our Writers, was the Grievance of other Ages and other Countries as well as ours.</p>
            <p>This War is principally, with Regard to us at leaſt, it is an <hi>American</hi> War. When I conſider this, I own my Eyes are involuntarily led, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe of moſt Perſons are, to the few who from their Inclinations, their Studies, their Opportunities, and their Talents, are made Perfectly Maſters of the State and Intereſts of our Colonies. There cannot be many; therefore we cannot eaſily be miſtaken. Nor can we, when we caſt our Eye on the noble Perſon to whom we owe the judicious Settlement of that Frontier Colony, whoſe Capital gratefully bears the Title of its Founder, by any Means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of an able Plenipotentiary at a Congreſs, where, for the firſt Time, our own national Intereſt will be the principal Object of Negotiation.</p>
            <p>I admire, Sir, with you, the noble Struggle which that great Prince, our Ally in this War, has made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a Combination of great Powers as meant to deſtroy him. I could wiſh for his Virtues, and profeſs I almoſt expect from his Abilities, that he will ſtill extricate himſelf from all the Toils that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him.</p>
            <p>It muſt, however, be remembered, that it is not to his Connection with us, that he owes his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. He has not, like the unhappy Prince of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> loſt his Country twice, by adhering firmly to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in a Quarrel entirely <hi>Britiſh.</hi> We found him beſet with Enemies, our Intereſts coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we made an Alliance, and I am ſure he has already found in <hi>Great Britain</hi> a moſt uſeful Ally; and I believe he always will find in her an Ally faithful to her Engagements. But, Sir, there is a Bound to every Thing, <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 42.</note> 
               <hi>Let us, in your own Words, learn for the future to perfer our own Intereſt to that of others; to proportion our Expences on the Continent
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008751_0035_102FDAE38A364200"/>
to the immediate Expences of our own Country, and never to aſſiſt a New Ally without remembering how much we did for our Old one, and what Return we have had.</hi> We ſee plainly, Sir, by the Conduct of <hi>Great Britain</hi> at this Hour, that the Miniſtry is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to let this Prince fall for Want of a due Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but, ſure, while we aſſiſt him ſo materially in <hi>Europe,</hi> we are not bound to ſacrifice our Intereſts in other Parts of the World. It may be a popular Doctrine; but I hope, it is not a Doctrine that will be received.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 40, 41.
<q>I would inculcate <hi>a Doctrine</hi> which, I think, will not be <hi>unpopular,</hi> and which therefore, I hope, will not be oppoſed by our Miniſters, that <hi>whatever Conqueſt</hi> we have made, and whatever Conqueſt we may ſtill make upon the <hi>French,</hi> except <hi>North America, which muſt be kept all our own,</hi> ſhould be looked upon as given back to <hi>France</hi> for a valuable Conſideration, <hi>if it can be the Means of extricating the King of Pruſſia from</hi> any unforeſeen Diſtreſſes.</q>
               </note> Enthuſiaſm, Sir, is a noble Principle of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but good Senſe and Knowledge only muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the ſole Buſineſs of a Negotiation. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cauſe maintained itſelf before the King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> was conſidered as its Protector; and I truſt it will ſtill be able to ſupport itſelf independent of him; it will indeed always find a ſurer Support in the jarring Intereſt of the ſeveral Powers of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> which will certainly never ceaſe, than in the Faith of any Prince, which will be always ſubject to Change.</p>
            <p>The Circumſtances of that famous <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 41. P. 35. Vide Note.
<q>The true Hiſtory of this Tranſaction here alluded to, may poſſibly ſome Time or other appear; though, as yet, we are perſuaded that the World knows very little of it.</q>
               </note> Oppoſition in our Parliament, to which you allude, are indeed but little known. It is however, a Period about which no Man is uninquiſitive. Your Deſcription
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008751_0036_102FDAE5139E8988"/>
of the Medley which compoſed that Oppoſition, is ſpirited, lively, and I doubt not, juſt: If you were yourſelf engaged in that Struggle, <hi>when you had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the common Enemy to the Wall,</hi> whether you found it convenient at that Time to quit your Friends, or Whether you thought yourſelf deſerted by them, Time enough is now elapſed to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten political Friendſhips, and perhaps too, to have worn out Party-reſentments; and in an Age ſo fond of Anecdotes, and ſo curious in Characters, aſſuredly nothing will be more acceptable than a true Hiſtory of that whole Tranſaction.</p>
            <p>It was indeed no undeſirable Time to have lived, when a Field was opened for every Man to diſplay his Abilities, and exert his Talents; if we give the Reins to our Ambition, we ſhould, Sir, regret that where <hi>ſo many ſkillful Champions uſed formerly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and ſtruggle for Victory, one Man ſhould at this Day remain ſingle in the Field of Battle.</hi> But, alas! Sir, however mortifying this may be to us as Men, ſurely as Citizens we muſt rejoice that the great Man, to whoſe active Spirit we in a great Meaſure owe all our Glory, our Succeſs, I had almoſt ſaid our very Safety, can employ his whole Time againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Country, without giving a Moment's Care to provide for his own Safety. If we conſider it in this Light, Sir, ſure it muſt be a moſt pleaſing Contemplation to think, that <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 2.</note>
               <q>the Extinction of factious Oppoſition, the Unanimity of every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Acquieſcence of every Connection, in whatever Scheme is propoſed by his Majeſty's Servants,</q>
ſuffer <hi>the Speaker without the leaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate or Oppoſition to take the Chair, only to vote Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and levy Thouſands</hi>; <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vid. the Letter.</note> but theſe Millions are voted, and theſe Thouſands are levied, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Enemies of our Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:008751_0037_102FDAE69DECA118"/>Have a little Patience however; we ſhall ſoon, I truſt, Sir, have beat all our Enemies, and then we ſhall perhaps again have Leiſure to quarrel among ourſelves; we may then ſee more than one Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Field; we may then liſt under that Banner, which our Intereſt or our Paſſions may direct us to.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let us thank Providence for the preſent happy Situation of our Affairs. Every Man ſhould, as far as he can, endeavour to continue that Acquieſcence, to cheriſh that Concord and Union, which is indeed ſo advantageous to our Country; and every Head of a Party muſt in this have a ſhare in our Acknowledgments for their Acquieſcence.</p>
            <p>But the two great Perſons you addreſs, at preſent engroſs the public Attention. The noble Lord has great Merit both to his Country and his Prince; his early Zeal cannot be forgotten. His extenſive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, his perſonal Authority, exerted as they have been, and as I truſt they always will be, for the good of his Country, will always challenge the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Countrymen. Nor will our Country for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to do Juſtice to the active Spirit of that great Man, to whoſe unwearied Efforts <hi>Great Britain</hi> is ſo much indebted for her preſent Glory; to whom you and I, Sir, owe it, that in a War with ſuch a Power as <hi>France,</hi> we now debate whether our Country ſhould uſe Moderation. I mean not, Sir, to make any Compariſon, for it is not now a Time to draw the nice Line between the Merits of great Men, or to aſcertain exactly where the Merit of the one ends, and the other begins. Compariſons are always invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and might at this time be hurtful, and tend to weaken the Bonds that unite ſo many in the Service of their Country.</p>
            <p>It was no Spirit of Contradiction, Sir, that made me take the pains of anſwering your Letter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I canvaſs with Freedom thoſe Points which appear to me to be miſtaken, ſo with great Pleaſure
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008751_0038_102FDAE91DFD7D80"/>
I join Hands where I think what you ſay is juſt and reaſonable. I agree with you intirely in your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a place Bill, which would, I believe, be more effectual, if not made too violent in its firſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration like an <hi>Oliverian</hi> ſelf-denying Ordinance. Your Judgment on Mediators is ſurely juſt and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and we may believe the Miniſtry think ſo, who have not employed any Mediation, though they have offered Terms to their Enemy.</p>
            <p>I might now aſk yours and the public Indulgence for any Miſtakes. I have not willingly perverted or miſrepreſented any thing. I do not pretend to the Credit of a Writer, but I have endeavoured to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Queſtion I write upon, as I think every Man is bound to do who troubles the Public with his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. If I am miſtaken in what I advance, it does not much ſignify who the Author of wrong Notions may be. If my Opinions are well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and my Remarks juſt, my Country may receive ſome Benefit from them; and if ſhe receives a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, it is of little Concern what Hand adminiſters it.</p>
