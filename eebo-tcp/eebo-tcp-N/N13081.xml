            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>"THAT man was born to delude and be deluded; to believe whatever is taught, and bear whatſoever is impoſed;" are political dogmas which have long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded matter for exultation and ſecurity to dignified villains, from the powergraſping monarch, to the loweſt minion of office. But however juſtified they may have been, and now are, by the paſſive conduct of the greateſt part of mankind, you, my fellow-citizens, thank God, you are an exception to their truth. The numerous, the reſpectable aſſembly which now croud this hallowed temple, prove you an exalted exception to maxims as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful as they are general. Ever vigilantly attentive to the ſacred, unalienable rights of man; equally ſtudious in the glorious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016550_0005_0F9C905AC25536B8"/>of liberty as intrepidly determined to preſerve inviolate the ineſtimable privileges ſhe beſtows; you are now convened, not more to commemorate this anniverſary, than ſolemnly to renew the reſolves, which freedom, wiſdom, virtue, honour inſpire: And not barely to reſolve, but I truſt, ſteadily to purſue the execution of reſolutions which have reſulted from deliberate inveſtigation and full conviction.</p>
            <p>To ſo intelligent, ſo well informed an auditory, it muſt be unneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to deduce the origin of civil ſociety, which, founded in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal advantage, and begun in ſocial virtue, on the mutual neceſſities and mutual aſſiſtance of individuals built the combined happineſs of the community—a happineſs thus inſtituted, nothing but public ſpirit and a union of force and of council can preſerve: I muſt therefore requeſt your indulgence whilſt I rather point out thoſe evils which the concurrent experience of ages and nations prove to be ſubverſive of every good propoſed from civil compact. Little ſolicitous of rhetorical applauſe, I ſhall offer you my ſentiments as they ariſe warm from a heart devoted to the intereſts of this my parent country, in language that becomes a freeman to uſe when addreſſing a free aſſembly.

            <p>SIMILAR cauſes will forever operate like effects in the political and moral, as well as in the phyſical world: Thoſe vices which ruined the illuſtrious republics of Greece, and the mighty common
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016550_0006_0F9C905B578E3A48"/>wealth of Rome; which are now with rapid progreſſion ruining Great-Britain, ſo late the firſt Kingdom of Europe, muſt eventually ruin every State, where their deleterious influence is ſuffered to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. Need I add that luxury, corruption, and ſtanding armies are thoſe deſtructive efficients?</p>
            <p>LUXURY, that ſyren luxury, whoſe treacherous ſong ever charms her deluded votaries to deſtruction, or to infamy, no ſooner finds admittance into a State than ſhe becomes the parent of innumerable evils, public and domeſtic; her contagious influence is ſoon felt in ſociety, her baneful effects diſcovered by a general diſſipation of manners and a declenſion of private virtue, which begets effeminate habits, and by a natural gradation a baſe pliability of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>LUXURY is ever the foe of independance, for at the ſame time that it creates
<note n="*" place="bottom">Si ad naturam vives nunquam eris pauper; ſi ad opinionem nunquam dives. Exiguum natura deſiderat; opinio immenſum. SEN. EP. 16.</note> artificial wants it precludes the means of ſatisfying them. It firſt makes men neceſſitous, and then dependant. It firſt unſits men for patriotic energies, and ſoon teaches them to conſider <hi>public virtue as a public jeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AT ſuch a period, corruption finds an eaſy acceſs to men's hearts. To the promotion of intereſted purſuits, and the gratification of voluptuous wiſhes, a ready ſacrifice is made of the general good at the ſhrine of power. Then ſlumbers that virtuous jealouſy of public men and public meaſures, which was wont to ſcrutinize not
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016550_0007_0F9C905EB5A94248"/>only actions but motives: Then nods that active zeal, which, with eagle-eye watched, and with nervous arm defended the conſtitution. Every day new inroads are made upon public liberty, while in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments like temptations, grow more frequent and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in proportion as the power of reſiſtance decreaſes. Thus before a nation is completely deprived of freedom, ſhe muſt be fitted for ſlavery by her vices.</p>
            <p>GENERALLY, but not always, for we have known a people ruled by a deſpot, who from a private ſtation roſe to uncontroled dominion, at a time when they were ſternly virtuous. And this mode of introducing bondage is ever to be apprehended at the cloſe of a ſucceſsful ſtruggle for liberty, when a triumphant army, elated with victories, and headed by a popular General, may become more formidable than the tyrant that has been expelled. Witneſs the laſt century in the Engliſh hiſtory. Witneſs the aſpiring CROMWELL!</p>

With theſe mercenary aſſociates at his heels, he appeared in the Synod of the State, and dared with force, diſplace the moſt glorious band of patriots that ever led a tyrant from his throne to a ſcaffold. Not content with this enormous outrage upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, this annihilating ſtroke upon the tottering liberties of his country, for a time to keep up the form of a popular goverment, he convened an Houſe of Commons, conſtituted entirely of his own creatures. They met, and in a few months diſcovered that they were utterly unequal to the poſts they were raiſed to, they therefore petitioned their maſter to diſſolve them. Cromwell granted their requeſt—and became ſole tyrant of three kingdoms.—Tyrant—for of what conſequence is it by what ſtyle or under what modification deſpotiſm operates to the public miſery—Dictator, King, Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,—it is not the appellation we reprobate, though even that we ſhould guard againſt—but the thing.

                              <p>You are this day aſſembled, in order to confirm in the manner of your anceſtors, the band of union which ties you to me, and me to you, and both to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; we muſt therefore remember, with the moſt ſenſible gratitude, the benevolence of the almighty, who has order'd things ſo, that this very ancient kingdom of the Sweeds and Goths is ſtill exiſting, after ſo many foreign, as well as national ſhocks, and that I, in the throne of my anceſtors, can yet addreſs free and independent States.</p>

Unhappy the King who wants the tie of oaths to ſecure himſelf on the throne, and who, not aſſured of the hearts of his ſubjects, is conſtrain'd to reign only by the force of laws, when he cannot by the love of his ſubjects!</p>
                              <p>I need not put you in mind of the weightineſs of the engagement you are going to take; the States of Sweeden know beſt the extent of their duty to themſelves and the commonwealth; may concord and harmony ever unite your hearts; may foreign views and private gain ever be ſacrificed to public intereſt; may this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone be a perpetual bond of union amongſt you; and may the ambition of any part of you, never raiſe any ſuch diſturbances as may endanger the freedom and independency of the whole commonwealth!</p>

                              <p>May mutual friendſhip and peace, obedience to the laws, reverence to God and the King, bear witneſs to me and the country, of your zeal in the execution of the ſacred office with which you are intruſted!</p>

                              <p>May piety, diligence, temperance, and old Sweediſh faith and modeſty, be the ſtrongeſt confirmation of the honour always due to that order which gives ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to all the others; an honour which the Sweediſh peaſants have at all times attain'd.</p>

            <p>IN 1763 peace was reſtored after a war of ſeven years ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully waged in every quarter of the globe. At that period what an unrivalled figure did Great-Britain ſtand amongſt the nations! Great beyond all former example, in arms, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and in wealth. Not a corner of the earth but had witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her atchievements. Whereſoever ſhe directed her armies, victory and conqueſt attended; whilſt her irreſiſtable navy, thundering over every ocean, not only ſubdued, but annihilated the fleets of her enemies.</p>
            <p>TRIUMPHANT in war, nor leſs diſtinguiſhed in peace. In <hi>moſt</hi> of the polite, in <hi>all</hi> the uſeful arts and ſciences, ſuperior to her
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016550_0014_0F9C90645DFDEEC8"/>neighbours. In commerce unequalled; not a ſea but bore, not a wind but wafted her countleſs ſhips, laden with the riches of the earth, and made her crouded ports the marts of ſhe world. Late glorious nation, How are thou fallen, how loſt! from ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, ſo ſtupendous an height, by the perverted will of thy infatuated monarch, and the pernicious counſels of his nefarious miniſters. Driven to the fearful edge of ruin, we now behold Thee tottering o'er the gulph of annihilation, whilſt France and her allies urge Thee over the irremeable ſteep!</p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider the capital defects in the Engliſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution—the character of her preſent weak and ambitious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch—the luxury, diſſipation and venality of her influential men, we ſhall ceaſe to wonder at her declenſion and preſent circumſtances.</p>
            <p>IN a limited monarchy, where the prince as ſupreme execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive magiſtrate, and firſt branch of the legiſlature, is inveſted with the important prerogative of making peace and war; is conſtituted the ſole fountain of honor, and becomes the excluſive diſpoſer of every lucrative and honorable appointment, civil, ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtic and military; his influence becomes too enormous to be compatible with the public liberty: But if to ſuch extravagant powers (by a fatal error in the Conſtitution, placed in the hands of the Prince) he ſhould ſuperadd a deteſtable ſyſtem of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bribe the Repreſentatives of the people (a ſyſtem which during the reign of his preſent <hi>Britannic</hi> Majeſty hath been urged

That equipoiſe between the reſpective branches of the Legiſlature (in which the ſeeming, the theoretic excellence of the Engliſh Conſtitution conſiſts) will be totally deſtroyed; the Executive will involve the powers of the Legiſlative, and whilſt the letter and formalities of the Conſtitution are retained, its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and intendment will be totally loſt. An <hi>abſolutely arbitrary,</hi> with the forms of a <hi>free</hi> Government (that worſt and ſureſt of all tyrannies) will gradually ſucceed and be finally eſtabliſhed, unleſs a total revolution is happily effected by the timely exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people, before the Deſpot has ſtrengthened himſelf with a mercenary army, and forever cloſed their chains.</p>
            <p>BUT this tyranny is already eſtabliſhed in Great-Britain: for what hopes can Britons entertain of effecting a revolution, whilſt the Crown by the multiplicity of gifts in its power, can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an infamous majority in each Houſe of Parliament to lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize, and a ſtanding army to enforce its projects, however impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, inhuman or unjuſt. In vain, a few wiſe and virtuous men ſee and lament their diſhonorable ſituation—An army of forty thouſand ſoldiers in time of peace, and a ſtill more numerous band of placemen and penſioners properly diſpoſed throughout the kingdom, effectually ſtifle in their birth every effort of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm to reſtore the conſtitution to its primaeval principles.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the boaſted Conſtitution, ſuch the Prince, and ſuch the preſent condition of the people of Britain. Unhappy nation,

Unworthy deſcendants of illuſtrious anceſtors—thus to ſuffer your moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential rights to be bartered away, your Government not only corrupted, but perverted to purpoſes diametrically oppoſite to its original intention. A Parliament at firſt conſtituted to watch over and preſerve your rights and immunities from the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteps of ambitious Princes, you have permitted to become an engine in the hands of royalty, the more effectually to abridge or nullify thoſe rights. A Parliament conſtituted the ſtewards of your property, who inſtead of guarding it from the inſatiable graſp of royal avidity, you patiently ſee laviſhingly indulging the utmoſt extravagance of regal profuſion; granting enormous ſums for effecting the moſt pernicious purpoſes; traiterouſly leaguing with the ſervants of the Crown in loading you with intolerable taxes, and, ſharers in the ſpoil, prodigally complying with the moſt unbounded demands of miniſterial rapacity, while they at the ſame time treacherouſly unite to ſcreen the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous defaulters of the public money.

            <p>FROM ſubjection to a government thus defective and corrupt, and thus vilely adminiſtered, what freeman would not ſtruggle for an emancipation? But if there is an American preſent who can yet ſecretly wiſh for a re-union with this nation and a ſhare in her ideal privileges, let him for a moment conſider the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable indignities, which for fifteen years back have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered us by this haughty power, added to the ſavage barbarities which they have exerciſed in every part of America where their army have made any progreſs, and he muſt bluſh at the ſpiritleſs, the ignoble ſentiment.</p>
            <p>IN 1764 the plan for raiſing a revenue from this country was reſolved on by the Britiſh Miniſtry, and THEIR obſequious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were inſtructed to paſs an act for that purpoſe. No
