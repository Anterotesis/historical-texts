            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>PERHAPS your Curiosity may Enquire, whence this small Composure had its Original? To satisfy this Curiosity, I am willing to let you know thus much; That being in the House of a private Friend, I had this small Script presented to my view, upon the perusal whereof, I could not but Express my value for it, and my just Acknowledgements unto the then unknown Author of it; whom upon Enquiry, I find to be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased <hi>Gentle-Woman</hi> (formerly the Religious Consort of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Moses Fiske,</hi> Pastor of the Church of <hi>Brantrey</hi>) who, at her Admission into the Church, gave this as a <hi>Confession of her Faith,</hi> drawn up by her, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without his Assistance. Vpon due Consideration, I thought the Publication hereof, would be of no small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto the Children in this Land, (and not altogether to be despised by riper Years) who have herein, briefly summ'd up the main Articles of their Creed, yet fully, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps exceeding any Composure, ordinarily to be met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, of the same Dimentions. Tis not with a design to blazon the Fame and Reputation of any Person, that this is now presented to the Publick View: But as the design of it is purely to do Good, so I hope it will be received with all Candor, without any carping or critical Reflections, upon any thing meerly Circumstantial, since the Main is Serious, Solid, and no wayes to be disapproved</p>
            <p>That it may be followed with a blessing upon all, that shall employ their Minutes in the perusal of it, but especially upon Young Ones, who may hence gather the Fragrant Flowers of Divine Knowledge, is, and shall be, the Hearty Desire and Prayer of him, who is</p>

            <head>A CONFESSION OF FAITH. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Believe,</hi> That the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> the Books of the Old &amp; the New Testament, Penned by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; Apostles, are the Infallible Word of God, the Subject of true Divinity; That only Rule of Faith &amp; Manners, teaching what man ought to Believe concerning God, and what Duty God requires of man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> GOD is a most Pure, Powerful, Eternal, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Being, Independent, Incomprehensible, Invsii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; Glorious; in whom all Fulness dwells, both of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness &amp; Righteousness, Grace &amp; Mercy, Wisdome &amp; Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That there is but ONE <hi>God,</hi> and that there are <hi>Three Persons</hi> in the God-head; The Father, the Son, &amp; the Holy Ghost. The Father is of Himself; The Son of the Father; and the Holy Ghost from the foregoing Persons in the Trinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> The <hi>Decrees</hi> of God are His Determinate Purpose of Effecting all things, by His Allmighty Power, according to the Counsel of His Will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> God doth Execute His Decrees, in the works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> The work of <hi>Creation</hi> is that, whereby God made the world &amp; all things therein, of nothing, and very good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> The <hi>Providence</hi> of God is that, whereby He accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisheth in His Creatures, what He intended in his Counsel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That as <hi>Man</hi> at first, was formed of the Dust of the Earth, consisting both of Soul &amp; Body, being made Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, Cloathed with the Image of God; the Effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, were a sweet and blessed Harmony of Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; so from this estate of happiness, all men fearfully Fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> thro' wilful Disobedience, in contradicting the Express Commandment of God, by Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Forbidden Fruit. The Act of this Transgression, was compleated by our First Parents Eating that forbidden Fruit; in the Guilt of which Act, all the natural Posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> are by the just imputation of God involved. The
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001156_0004_0FB0930043CC5210"/>
principal (blameable) cause was their abusing their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will: The helping cause was the Devil. Altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable was the Command of God, against which <hi>Adam</hi> dashing himself, as a stately Vessel against a mighty Rock, made Ship-wreck of his whole estate. The Consequents whereof, were <hi>Guilt, Filth,</hi> and <hi>Punishment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guilt,</hi> is that Obligation, whereby the sinner is tyed to undergo due Punishment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Filth,</hi> is that Spiritual Pollution, whereby the sinner is made void of all comeliness and honour, and is become vile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Punishment,</hi> is the Reward of Evil, inflicted upon the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner because of sin; which is, <hi>Death,</hi> both <hi>Spiritual</hi> &amp; <hi>Corporal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That the sin which follows this Fall, is either <hi>Original,</hi> or <hi>Actual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Original</hi> Sin, is an habitual inclination to walk contrary to the Law of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Actual</hi> Sin, is a continual Exercise of the Act, in going contrary to the Command of God. This comprehends both Sins of <hi>Omission</hi> and <hi>Commission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inchoation of <hi>Corporal Death,</hi> lies in a miserable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the good things of this Life; the consummation whereof, is the separation of Soul and Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spiritual Death,</hi> is a miserable privation of the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life and happiness [especially] of the inner man. The <hi>Inchoation</hi> whereof consists in a desperate privation of the sweetness of Gods favour and presence. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation</hi> whereof is a final Dejection from the face of God, into Hell; of the Soul immediately after the <hi>First Death,</hi> &amp; of the Soul &amp; Body, joyned together at the <hi>day of Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' all are thus fallen, yet,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That there are some, (tho' but a few,) their number and names, being only known unto God, who shall be everlastingly saved from sin and sorrow, and freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into everlasting life; being such as the Lord in His infinite wisdom hath made choice of, before the world was, to be His Militant Servants on Earth, &amp; to be His Triumphant Saints in Heaven, thro' Riches of, Grace in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001156_0005_0FB093052C9FC460"/>
               <hi>Restitution,</hi> is that whereby a man is lifted up, from a state of Sin and Death, into a state of Grace and Life. The parts whereof are <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Redemption</hi> is that, whereby a man is freed from the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Sin &amp; Satan, thro' the satisfaction of a Redeemer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That this <hi>Redeemer</hi> is the Lord Jesus Christ, by in ineffable Generation, the Eternal Son of God, whom the Father hath appointed from all Eternity, to purchase the Salvation of all the Elect of God; who willingly gave up himself to be a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> for the sins of his People, &amp; in order hereunto, took upon Him our Nature, in every thing made like to us, Sin only excepted, &amp; the manner of His subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore He was made a fit, and suitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, both in respect of His Person in that He was God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and His Offices which he hath freely taken upon him, accomplishing from time to time, his Prophetical, Priestly, and Kingly Mediatorship. His <hi>Prophetical,</hi> in Revealing to man the deep things of the Wisdom and good Pleasure of God. His <hi>Priestly,</hi> in Expiating for Sin, and purchasing Favour with the Father, and making continual Intercession for us. His <hi>Kingly,</hi> whereby he leads men to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Holiness &amp; Blessedness by an uncontroulable <hi>Power</hi>: Conquering his &amp; our Enemies, &amp; at last Raising us from the Dead. Thus Christ Redeems his Elect both by his <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> and <hi>Exaltation.</hi> His <hi>Humiliation,</hi> in that Abasement of Christ, whereby he became subject to satisfy Divine Justice, for our Offences, and to merit life &amp; happiness. His <hi>Exaltation,</hi> whereby he obtains a stately Victory, full of Glory and Triumph, over His and our Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That the Effectual &amp; saving Application of Christ and all his purchased Grace, in a Gospel way, is Exhibited in due season, to every one that belongs to the <hi>Election</hi> of Grace; which consists in <hi>Vnion</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vnion</hi> with Christ, is the consent and agreement, whereby a Believer is joyned to Christ, as his <hi>Spiritual Head.</hi> This Union is begun, in the powerful Ministry of the <hi>Law,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Soul is convinced of Sin, &amp; the necessity of a Saviour;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001156_0006_0FB09308F05D5900"/>
but it is accomplished in <hi>Vocation,</hi> which is a fruit of the Covenant, whereby the Lord powerfully accompanying his Word by his Spirit, doth not only graciously Invite, but effectually <hi>Draw</hi> the Soul to accept the Tender of Grace, and to embrace Fellowship with Christ Jesus. The special Graces here required are, <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> is that Grace of God, whereby the Soul is brought to confide, and acquiess in the Lord Jesus Christ, both for the Grace it stands in need of here, and for Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repentance</hi> is a turning of the whole man, from Sin unto God, with a resolution of, and endeavours after New Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Communion</hi> with Christ, is that whereby the People of God do participate with him, in all his Benefits revealed in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having his Righteousness imputed, together with his Active &amp; Passive Obedience, for their <hi>Justification</hi>; and withal, the Priviledges of <hi>Son-ship</hi> or, <hi>Adoption,</hi> the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press of <hi>Christs likeness,</hi> upon their Souls in <hi>Sanctification</hi>; made Perfect in the Heavenly world, in a state of <hi>Glorification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Justification</hi> is an Act of Gods free Grace; whereby he blots out all the Debts and Arrearages, of every believing sinner, for Christ his sake, and withal gives him a Bill of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, from all the Accompts, that were between God and his Soul, receiving him as Righteous in his sight, both for the satisfaction of his Justice, &amp; glory of his Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adoption</hi> is that Grace of God, whereby he receives every believing sinner, in owning Himself to be their Father, and they to be His Children, and consequently, that they have right unto, and in due time shall have the possession of the promised Inheritance, which appertains to such a Relation. The effects whereof are Freedom from Sin, and Boldness to approach before God in Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer</hi> is a going to God in the Name of Christ, by the help of the Spirit, whereby we present our desires before him, for things according to his Will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That <hi>Sanctification</hi> is a Work of Gods power, whereby sinners are translated from the pollution of sin unto the perfection of the Image of God; which is begun
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001156_0007_0FB09309F76D58A8"/>
in a state of imperfection in this life, made perfect &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in the world to come. The parts whereof, are <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,</hi> and <hi>Vivification. Mortification</hi> is a putting off the Image of <hi>Adam,</hi> by applying the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ. <hi>Vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is a putting on, the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> by applying the power of His <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe</hi> That <hi>Glorification</hi> is that perfecting Grace of God, whereby the number of his Elect, having compleated their warfare &amp; work in this world, according to the will of God, are freely discharged of their sin and the events thereof, forever; and made Fellow-heirs with Christ, of all the promised Inheritance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> the Subject of this blessing, is either <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That there is but one <hi>General, Universal, Invisible Church</hi> of the Saints, in which is contained, the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gods Elect, that one Mystical Body, Christs Bride; the particular Members whereof, have the same Father, the same Christ, the same Spirit, the same Faith &amp; Baptism. This Church is not compleated here, at one and the same time; for it is partly <hi>Militant,</hi> &amp; partly <hi>Triumphant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That a Visible <hi>Particular Church,</hi> is a <hi>Society</hi> of Faithful ones, with their Seed, who are in <hi>Ecclesiastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faederation</hi> with God, and one with another. Or, a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Number of Faithful ones, Saints &amp; their Seed, Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Solemnly, &amp; Religiously, Covenanting with God, &amp; each other, for the advancement of the Kingdom of God, and their own mutual Edification, by the improvement of all those means that are appointed to that end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> This Church being compleat, consists of <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Officers are <hi>Pastors Teachers, Ruling-Elders,</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Office &amp; Work of a <hi>Pastor,</hi> is that whereby he bends himself, especially to apply the Word to the hearts of his Hearers, according to their several occasions &amp; necessities.</p>
            <p>The Labour of the <hi>Teacher</hi> is that, whereby he bends himself, especially to <hi>open the Scriptures, &amp; divine principles, refuting errors</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001156_0008_0FB0930C59F274C0"/>The Work of a <hi>Ruling-Elder,</hi> consists in waiting at the Doors of the <hi>Sanctuary, watching over the Church, and wayes of Church-Members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Office of a <hi>Deacon</hi> is to collect &amp; distribute, the outward Estate of the Church, providing for the Table of the Lord, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Ministers, &amp; the Poor, &amp; that with all <hi>Chearfulness</hi> &amp; <hi>Fidelity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That this Church thus constituted, &amp; thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, hath a right of Administring, both <hi>Seals</hi> &amp; <hi>Censures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Seals</hi> are <hi>Baptism,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> The former of Initiation the other of Education.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That <hi>Baptism</hi> is that washing of the Flesh with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Name of the Father, Son &amp; Holy Ghost, whereby is signified, Christ in the promise, by whom we are <hi>washed from Sin,</hi> &amp; <hi>made Righteous,</hi> deliverd from <hi>Death,</hi> &amp; restored to <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>Believe,</hi> That the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> is the second Sacrament of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> instituted by <hi>Christ,</hi> wherein by the signs of bread &amp; wine, &amp; the actions that concern the same, is shewed forth his death; and God doth signifie, seal, &amp; exhibit the body &amp; blood of Christ, with all the benefits of his Death &amp; Passion, to every worthy receiver, for his Spiritual Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, and Growth in Grace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Censures</hi> are <hi>Admonition</hi> &amp; <hi>Excommunication. Admonition</hi> is that whereby a Brother openly offending, or not hearing his Brethren in private, is convinced, that he may be gained. <hi>Excommunication</hi> is that, whereby a Brother offending, and not hearing the Church, is excluded from the Communion of the Saints, for the cure of his Spirit, and the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Believe,</hi> That as the world had a beginning, so it shall have <hi>an end</hi>: At what time, both those that are Dead, and Alive, shall be gathered together before the Lord Jesus Christ to <hi>Judgment,</hi> at the sound of the last Trumpet; where every one shall receive a full Reward of their works: The <hi>Sheep</hi> being set at his right hand, are acquitted of sin, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into glory; but the <hi>Goats</hi> at his left hand, are Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced irrevocably to suffer Everlasting Torments, with the Devil and his Angels, in the Lake of Unquenchable Fire and Brimstone.</p>
