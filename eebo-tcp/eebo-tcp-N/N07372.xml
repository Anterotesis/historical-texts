            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A LONG, dangerous, and expenſive War now cloſes with an honorable Peace; and for this we are ordered to a moſt reaſonable, pious Duty, to return our ſolemn Thanks to that great and good GOD, who hath taught our Hands to war and our Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to fight ſo very ſucceſsfully. 'Tis this at laſt that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletes our Joy by ſtopping the further Progreſs of War with her cruel and inſeparable Attendants, Miſery and Horror: For Conquerors themſelves muſt own it is ever accompanied by thoſe ghaſtly Furies: The fineſt and moſt brilliant Victories coſt many Tears: The moſt blooming and verdant Laurels are ever ſtain'd with Blood, and even in the Day of Triumph the Cries of Bitterneſs and Sorrow mix themſelves with the Shouts of Joy and Gladneſs. We may with Truth ſay, we have had enough of Victory, we have had enough of military Glory, and the Trophies and the Spoils of War; or rather, enough of human Blood has been pour'd upon the Earth even to glut
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009409_0005_0F74046047CEC780"/>
the ravenous Jaws of Death: We have had enough of that Succeſs which cannot be enjoy'd but at the Expence of the Lives of our Fellow-Creatures, and thoſe oft the braveſt and the beſt of Men. Therefore let us with Hearts unfeign'd and Gratitude ſincere return our Thanks to Almighty GOD for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring Peace to theſe Dominions, Security to Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and Stability to our Religion and Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here take up your time in giving you a Detail of the many and great Advantages we have gain'd, the important Acquiſitions made, or the ſignal Victories obtain'd by Sea and Land in the Courſe of this War, tho' ſuch indeed might be entertaining, and agreable enough, but better ſeen in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the times, and I think with much more propriety read there than heard here. I ſhall therefore beg your Attention to what more nearly concerns you not only as a Community but as Individuals, and while I endeavour to ſhew you what good Uſe you ſhou'd make of theſe peaceable Times, I conceive I ſhall be offering ſome Things worthy your Conſideration and which, if regarded, may prove of ſolid and laſting Benefit to you all.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing that will naturally preſent itſelf to us in our reflecting upon the happy Conſequences reſulting from the Bleſſing now given us, is the Security of our Civil Liberty, a Happineſs we juſtly glory in; For Britons have preſerv'd it pure and uncorrupted thro' all the Struggles of Ambition and the moſt dangerous Attacks of Power: They have ſet the World a fair Example that the higheſt Ambition of Princes ſhou'd be
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009409_0006_0F740460E03DF3B8"/>
to govern a free People, and that no People can be great or happy but ſuch as are ſo; whilſt other Nations have bow'd their Necks to the Yoke of Power and have baſely given up this indiſputable Right of Man deriv'd to Him from the firſt Law of Nature, and daily feel that Miſery, which ever waits on Slaves. Oh Liberty! Thou art the Author of every good and perfect Gift, the inexhauſtible Fountain, from whence all Bleſſings flow. Without Thee, what avails the Sweetneſs of Climate, or the moſt delightful Situation in the World? what avail all the Riches of Nature, the various Production of the Earth, the Mine bringing forth a thouſand Treaſures, the Olive and the Vine blooming upon the Mountains, if Tyranny uſurps the happy Plains, and proud Oppreſſion deforms the gay-ſmiling face of Nature.</p>
            <p>Here the feeling Heart will naturally reflect on and lament the Fate of thoſe who are doom'd to Slavery, eternal Slavery. Unhappy Creatures deſtin'd to ſubmit to it, and perhaps no leſs ſo are thoſe Countries which are oblig'd to practiſe it! Reſpecting this particular, and the manner in which it is Here conducted, it may be ſaid it loſes much of it's Horror, when compar'd with that of other Places. This perhaps is true, and I am likewiſe fully perſuaded, that in ſome of thoſe Families which properly reſpect Humanity, the State of Servitude ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the Condition of an eaſy Dependance, and thro' the Conſideration and mildneſs of the Maſter the very Name of Slave is oft forgotten. But of theſe how few! Whilſt the graſping Avarice of ſome, the unfeeling hard-heartedneſs, the very monſtrous Diſpoſition of others, which ſeems to delight
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009409_0007_0F7404618DB48F68"/>
in acts of Cruelty, are known to be exerciſed daily in producing ſuch Scenes of Miſery and Wretchedneſs, as cannot but be in the higheſt Degree ſhocking to thoſe, who know how to think properly of the Condition of Human Nature.</p>
            <p>But to return from this Digreſſion. Amiable as Liberty is, we muſt not perſue it with blind Enthuſiaſm, and ungovern'd Zeal: We ought ever to remember, that this very precious Liberty is no other way to be ſecur'd to us, but by a dutiful Obedience to the Laws of our Country, and thoſe our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, who have the Care of them. It is Folly, nay it is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuppoſe that that is true Liberty, which allows Men to act as they pleaſe, juſt as their inflam'd Brains, or wild Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination may urge them on: For ſoon, full ſoon by this means Liberty and public Safety wou'd become Enemies to each other, and fall together. When Liberty becomes ſo licentious, as to be free from the Check and Controul of juſt Laws, when it tranſgreſſes the Bounds preſcrib'd by Nature, numerous and thoſe the worſt of Evils will immediately follow: Thus the River, which whilſt confin'd in its proper Channel, carried Riches and Plenteouſneſs along with it, gladdening the Lands it flow'd thro'; when it has burſt thro' it's Barrier and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd it's Banks, brings Terror and Deſolation, the produce of the Earth, Cattle and Men are ſwept away, and loſt in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of it's Waters. Exactly ſimilar is the Caſe, when Laws have not their proper Courſe, or not obey'd, as they ought to be, an Evil which tho' free Governments may be the apteſt to fall into, is ſo great a one, that every true Friend to Liberty wou'd ſtudy to prevent it; for, as it has been well obſerv'd,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009409_0008_0F740462386D86B0"/>
there is no greater Tyranny upon the Face of the Earth, than that, where thoſe who ſhou'd obey, are become our Maſters: So very neceſſary is it that we ſhou'd faithfully adhere to that Principle I mention'd a little before, that we ſhou'd always be ready and willing to pay a cheerful Obedience to the Laws of our Country, to the King, and all that are put in Authority under Him, as this is not only acting according to the Precepts of our holy Religion, but the only way to ſecure to us the Bleſſings we are now ſo thankful for, and which you wou'd do well ſeriouſly to conſider.</p>
            <p>In Reſpect of our private Conduct, our juſt Senſe of the many and various good Things of this Life which we enjoy, will beſt appear in the Uſe we ſhall make of them. In Conſequence of a good Peace may naturally be expected a greater Plenty of every thing, and if you apply your Affluence and Abundance to the Purpoſes Providence deſign'd, they become real Bleſſings. Reaſon in this Caſe evidently points out to you, that you ought to have your Hearts open to acts of Charity and Humanity, and to hold in the greateſt Abhorrence ſordid Avarice. Above all things, not only that you may have it in your Power to do good to others, but on your own account, you ſhou'd be ſober and moderate in your Pleaſures, not diſſolving in Luxury and Exceſs, things ſo extremely prejudicial to your own Health and Fortune, and which will infallibly involve your Families in Hardſhips and Misfortunes. And may it not here be aſk'd, is there not already too great a Tendency amongſt us to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance and Luxury? Some time ago was it not juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009409_0009_0F7404633680BA70"/>
to you, and this by the Higheſt Authority here, that ſome of the Evils this Country labours under, were to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Exceſſes of this Nature? Suppoſing the common Articles of domeſtic Expenſe are not carried too far, why are you beholden to our Mother-Country for ſo many Things you wou'd do very well without, which the inſignificant Pride of Dreſs, the empty Ambition of gaudy Furniture, or a ſplendid Equipage lead you into, and which moſt undoubtedly ſerve more for Oſtentation and Parade, than any real Uſe or valuable Purpoſe in Life. You may imitate other Countries in their Virtues, if they have any, as faſt as you pleaſe, but believe me, you imitate them too ſoon, much too ſoon in their Vices. But what can be ſaid in Defenſe of that prevailing Paſſion and Taſte for Gaming? Racing, Cards, Dice and all ſuch Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, where they are perſu'd with that Eagerneſs as a Buſineſs or Occupation, have that fatal Tendency, that they never will permit that Country long to maintain the Character of a well moraliz'd People. If we conſider the great Loſs of Time, Money, and that Diſinclination to Buſineſs, which theſe Things occaſion, how many good Reaſons may be urg'd, why it is much to be wiſh'd that ſeveral of theſe idle Amuſements were either unknown amongſt us, or immediately vaniſh'd from all Families, that are deſirous to appear Examples of Sobriety, and Moderation? Our great and good Forefathers liv'd without Them, and I can ſee no Reaſon, no good Reaſon at leaſt, why we their Poſterity might not do ſo too, if we pleas'd. Many uſeful Arts in former Days were taken in Hand, and executed by both the Sexes, which now are almoſt entirely laid aſide, and neglected by the one, and are abſolutely forgot by, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009409_0010_0F7404640206EBC0"/>
unknown to the other. I cou'd ſay much more to this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but that has been ſaid, may appear to ſome full enough, and therefore I ſhall proceed to another particular univerſally acknowleg'd of the higheſt Importance, and I hope that what I ſhall here advance will be receiv'd with Candour and Good-Nature, when it proceeds from no other Principle than a Deſire to amend That which ſeems to require it, and to offer ſome Hints which well improv'd, and made uſe of, might prove of ſingular Service, and Advantage.</p>
            <p>I dare ſay you all know, and even feel the Neceſſity of a good Education, and I imagine wou'd look upon it as no ſmall Degree of Felicity, if you cou'd be ſure of making your Sons hereafter in Life ſerviceable to your Country, uſeful to their own Families, and happy in Themſelves.</p>
            <p>It ſhou'd ever be remember'd that the Children of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Generation will be the Men that are to govern in the next, and ſuch as they are train'd up now, will they be afterwards throughout Life, when left to themſelves. The now full-grown, and exalted Oak, which has always undeviating riſen in Rectitude, is not to be forc'd from it's Uprightneſs by Violence very cogent and oppreſſive; and likewiſe fruitleſs wou'd be the Attempt to unbend the ſame from that Crookedneſs, and Perverſeneſs it was fix'd in, ever ſince it was a tender Plant. A Circumſtance which makes it of the utmoſt Importance in every Senſe both with Regard to the Public and Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, in what manner Youth is prepar'd to appear hereafter on the Stage of Life. In reſpect of the preſent Method of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009409_0011_0F740464B360ADF0"/>
Education perſu'd by far the greater Part amongſt us, will it not appear to a thoughtful Perſon likely to take an unhappy Turn? The Attention of the Generality ſeems particularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to thoſe parts of uſeful Knowledge, as they may be call'd, which will turn out to ſome immediate Account of Profit, and Advantage, which will make ſome quick Return of a ſolid, lucrative Nature to their Poſſeſſor, whilſt thoſe more truly uſeful Arts, and valuable Studies, which poliſh, and humanize Mankind, which raiſe the Genius, and which mend the Heart, which inſpire the noble Principles of Probity and Honour, which in ſhort lay the Foundation of every private, and public Virtue, whilſt theſe, I ſay, lie neglected and overlook'd, as altogether unneceſſary to a Youth's future Advancement, and Succeſs in the World. Inſtead of this what is there ſubſtituted? Perhaps I am not far from the Truth, as it is not my Deſign to be ſo, when I obſerve that a little Knowledge in Figures and Accounts, a Smattering of the Mathematics, and a tolerable Acquaintance with the peculiar Buſineſs of the Country, make up the Sum total of the Learning of I know not how many. On ſuch Things as theſe then your Minds muſt always be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, or Time will hang extremely heavy on your hands, except when you are engag'd in ſome of thoſe Amuſements and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions I have before mention'd (for tho' it is a ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, that of a Perſuit after Money and Pleaſure, yet ſuch is frequently the Caſe) and this in ſuch a manner, as ſhall leave no Room (if you had the Diſpoſition) for any Improvement in any thing more commendable. In conſequence of all this your Care of your Deſcendants muſt be expected to be ſimilar, and proportionably Defective; and accordingly we may obſerve

you are much more intent upon cultivating a few dirty Acres of Land, than the improving and poliſhing a Youth's mind, which left wild to itſelf, like the Woods we live in, is ſeldom ſeen to produce any thing fair, lovely, or elegant. For is it an uncommon thing, (I heartily wiſh it was ſo) to ſee the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir to a large Eſtate brought up in a manner by no means anſwerable to it, and who, when in Poſſeſſion of it, either knowing not how to uſe it very ſtupidly hoards it up, or profuſely ſquanders it away, without Judgement, Taſte, or Reputation.</p>
            <p>'Tis moſt certain, that in the Treaſures of Ancient Learning are to be ſought for all thoſe excellent Precepts, which improve and mend the Heart, which as it is the ſource of every Virtue and every Vice cannot be tended with too much De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Care, 'tis I ſay, in thoſe valuable Stores of Knowlege, where we are to receive ſuch Rules, as ſhall lay the Paſſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reſtraint of juſt Laws, that ſhall teach us each virtuous and generous Principle of Juſtice, Integrity, and Honor; 'Tis there, and there only we ſhall meet with painted in the livelieſt Colors the moſt ſhining Examples of the braveſt and the beſt of Men, not to be gaz'd at, but to be imitated: 'Tis from the Contemplation of thoſe amiable Pictures, 'tis by the lovely Ideas we draw in from their Excellence, that we may learn to regulate and form our Manners, learn to tranſplant into our own Breaſts their bright Perfections, till we ſhine like Them. Upon this noble and broad Foundation let us erect the glorious Superſtructure of our Holy Religion, whence we ſhall ſee ariſe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009409_0013_0F740467044EA170"/>
that fair Edifice at once complete in every Point of Utility and Convenience, and adorn'd with all the Elegance and Simplicity of Nature; which at once ſhall ſtand firm and unſhaken on its proper Baſis, and the Ornament and Honor of all the Country round.</p>
            <p>After having thus dwelt more largely, than I at firſt intended, on the foregoing Subject, I ſhall add the following Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which tho' it only touches upon thoſe Particulars, which might very properly be drawn out into a greater Length, yet may have a good Effect, if duly attended to and regarded.</p>
            <p>The moſt unfeeling, adamantine Heart cannot but ſwell with Thanks and Praiſe to Almighty GOD for theſe invaluable Bleſſings, the Peace and Security we now enjoy; but to teſtify properly this our Gratitude to the Supreme Being, let us all for the future (and this is the only way to do it) obſerve the moſt pious and religious Deportment, let us by the ſtricteſt Regard to the Precepts of that Religion with which we are bleſſed, the pureſt upon the Face of the Earth, be ſo very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ſo very circumſpect, that if poſſible, we may never do amiſs: Thus we may hope to appear in the Preſence of Almighty GOD, not as the moſt unworthy of his Creatures, upon whom he has been graciouſly pleaſed to pour down his Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Next to our thus conſcientiouſly diſcharging our Duty to GOD, let us ſtudy to expreſs our Loyalty, Affection, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the beſt and moſt beneficent King by a ſteady and due Obedience to his Laws, and Government, for this is the only
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009409_0014_0F74046779A2C2C0"/>
kind Return we can make him, and this may much contribute towards making him ſit eaſy, and happy on the Throne of his Anceſtors, and ſweeten the Toils and Pains of Royalty. As it will not a little ſerve to this good Purpoſe, let every one as much as lies in his Power diſcourage, and diſcountenance every inſolent Attempt to diſturb the public Tranquillity, curb every Appearance of Diſorder and Diſcontent, and promote by all poſſible means the utmoſt Peace, Friendſhip, and Brotherly Love amongſt one another.</p>
            <p>If we entertain a juſt Senſe of our Happineſs at this Time, we ſhall ſhew our Pleaſure and Satisfaction in it with Propriety and Decency; Let us therefore by no means indulge in wild Intemperance, Riot, or Luxury, but expreſs a rational and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Joy for our preſent Welfare and Proſperity, and ſtudy to render permanent the ineſtimable Benefits reſulting from ſo glorious a Peace.</p>
            <p>On this happy and joyful Occaſion I think the moſt Scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Hearer cannot be offended, that I conclude in a manner ſomewhat unuſual indeed, yet I hope not improper or unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tho' in the Language of Poetry,
<q>
                  <l>Oh Peace! Thou Source and Soul of Social Bliſs,</l>

                  <l>Science her Views enlarges, Art refines,</l>
                  <l>And ſwelling Commerce opens all her Ports:</l>
                  <l>Bleſt be the Man Divine, who gives us Thee.</l>
