            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe Governour and Council, upon mature Consideration of the many loud Calls of Providence, and being also conscious that it is a great duty incumbent on them at all times (but more especially when there are so many solemn inducements) to stir up the People of God to humble themselves before Him, and seek his special Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: And now in particular, that a Spirit of Grace may be poured out upon this People to convince them of, and humble them for all their sinfull Prevarications; and in special, those Sins so publickly borne witness against by the late Synod, and a spirit of Reformation to turn from their evil wayes, and make their peace with God, that so these things aggravate not our guilt, nor hasten the wrath of God upon us: That having made our peace with God, He may graciously smile upon, &amp; crown this Year with his blessing, succeeding the labours of his poor People, and making his paths to drop fatness; favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably preventing those awfull Frowns, in Blastings, Mildews and Insects, which have consumed a great part of our Labours and abated the quantity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our principal Grain for many years past, &amp; most of all the last Summer. That the Lord would preside and so dispose the Lot in the following Election of Magistrates, and give out large portions of his Spirit to his Servants who may then be chosen, such as may witness his gracious presence to be yet with us: That God will graciously indulge and prove us by continuing and uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our precious and desirable Liberties civil and sacred; and utterly disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and bring to nought all the malicious devices of any who hate us, that seek and would gladly see the subversion of those things wherein our greatest felicity doth consist. That Heavens Blessing and Protection may be plentifully afforded to our Sovereign Lord the King, defending his Majestyes Person and Kingdoms from all mischievous designs &amp; endeavours of Papists, or any other wickedly bent and engaged: That God would signally appear to uphold and maintain the Protestant interest in the world, and all true Professors of has Name and Glory, in despite of all the Plots and Policyes wherein the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Party, in combination with Hell are united in deep engagement for their ruine;</p>
