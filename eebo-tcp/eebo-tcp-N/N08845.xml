            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE are many who have, by ſome means or other, ſuch an averſion to all controverſy and diſputes about matters of religion, and look on them to be ſo dangerous and hurtful, that they take the utmoſt care to keep at the greateſt diſtance from every thing of this kind; and are conſtantly cautioning others againſt it, and refuſing to enter into any debate with them; unleſs perhaps they will <hi>diſpute</hi> a little againſt <hi>diſputing.</hi> Theſe cannot hear of a public controverſy, or, as many of them call it, <hi>a paper war,</hi> about any thing that relates to religion, without great diſguſt, and expreſſing their ſorrow that there ſhould be any ſuch thing, eſpecial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y between the miniſters of the goſpel. And doubtleſs many have expreſſed their diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and grief at the controverſy which has taken place between Mr. Mills and me; and have determined, for their part, not to concern themſelves with it, ſo much as to read what is wrote.</p>
            <p>Many of theſe are ſo modeſt as to ſay they do not pretend to be competent judges of ſuch controverted points, which great and good men are not able to agree in, and ſettle. Beſides, they have no time to ſpend upon theſe thorny diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes: They think they can be better employed in reading plain, practical divinity.</p>
            <p>If any of theſe ſhould venture ſo near ſo large a book of controverſy as is the enſuing, as to look into the preface, they may be deſired to conſider the following things.</p>
            <p>Whether they are not neglecting that attention, and free and earneſt inquiry after the truth, without which they are like to live and die, in a great degree of ignorance. And whether they are not depriving themſelves of the benefit of one ſpecial mean and advantage of improving in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And whether, at bottom, this neglect does not
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:011295_0003_0F869EBC627380F8"/>
proceed from a degree of ſelf-ſufficiency, and from an indifference concerning matters of high importance to be known.</p>
            <p>Whether it is not the moſt likely, yea, the only way they can take to know o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> how much importance any controverted point is to them, and to be able to judge on which ſide the truth lies, carefully to read the whole controverſy.</p>
            <p>If any perſons are not competent judges in there things, is it not their own fault for which they have no reaſonable excuſe? And muſt they not be able to judge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerning every truth, in order that it may be of any benefit to them? In this view, is there any real mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and humility in their neglecting to take all poſſible pains to be able to judge for themſelves, in matters in which none can judge for them, merely becauſe others who have had a reputation for learning and wiſdom have differed concerning them; eſpecially ſince theſe things which are hid from the wiſe and prudent, are ſome times revealed unto babes?</p>
            <p>Finally, whether the truth would not greatly ſuffer, and groſs ignorance univerſally prevail, if every one ſhould take the ſame care to avoid all diſputes as they do?</p>
            <p>When we conſider of what advantage controverſy has already been to truth, and what a tendency it has, in the iſſue to eſtabliſh it, and make it ſhine more clearly than if no ſuch controverſy had aroſe; we ſhall have reaſon to conclude it is GOD'S deſign that every important truth ſhall be in this way canvaſſed, and diſputed out, as the beſt way to have it eſtabliſhed to the greateſt advantage: And that this is one end He deſigns to anſwer by ſuffering hereſies to ariſe, and almoſt every truth, in its turn, to be called in queſtion and oppoſed. In this view, diſputes are ſo far from being hurtful, and matter of grief, that when they riſe high, and become very common, and gain atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, there is ground of encouragement and comfort.</p>
            <p>It is to be lamented indeed, that in many inſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy has been ſo poorly managed, by which truth has appeared very much to ſuffer: But even in this caſe, the debate has often been not wholly uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:011295_0003_0F869EBC627380F8"/>The author iſ ſorry that the ſide he has taken in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy before us, has not a more able advocate to defend it, as he doubts not it is capable of a much better defence than he has made. And he is particularly ſenſible there are many defects in his ſtyle, which will be diſcerned by the reader of a critical taſte; and will call for his candor.</p>
            <p>The author thinks he has a claim, on the part of juſtice, to the attention of all thoſe who have read Mr. Mills: eſpecially of thoſe who in reading him have concluded the author has run into very great and hurtful errors. If they have ſo peremptorily prejudged, as not to be willing to hear the accuſed ſpeak in his own vindication, he thinks he ſhall have reaſon to complain: Not to mention the injury ſuch men hereby do to themſelves, and to the cauſe of truth.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to tell with what very good views and deſigns, and from what excellent, noble motives the author has undertaken this reply; as this would be no great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his favour, if any; and it is of very little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the reader: his chief concern being to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the author has well vindicated the cauſe he has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, whatever were his motives.</p>
            <p>If the author &amp; the reader ſhall be found on the right ſide of the queſtion, and to have taken the pains of writing and reading the enſuing reply, from love to Chriſt, and zeal in his cauſe; they will be richly rewarded for all their labour, and numbered among thoſe who follow Chriſt when he rides forth conquering and to conquer: And will ſoon have a happy meeting, and ſtand before the throne, and before the LAMB, clothed it white robes, and <hi>palms</hi> in their hands; where perfect agreement in ſentiment, and the moſt exalted friendſhip and union of hearts ſhall reign forever, to the praiſe of rich, ſovereign grace, and honor of the divine, infinitely worthy Redeemer. To HIM be glory forever and ever. AMEN.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>That on every riſing degree of internal light, awakening, conviction and amendment of life, found in any of the unregenerate, while ſuch, they are undoubtedly (on the whole) more vile, odious and abominable in God's ſight, than they would have been, had they continued at eaſe, going on in their ſins, under the ſame external means of light.<note n="*" place="bottom">D. C.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I would obſerve, in the firſt place, that this propoſition ſeems hardly intelligible. If by "every riſing degree of amendment of life," he means every degree of reformation of life, I ſee not the connexion this has with "every riſing degree of internal light, awakening and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction," as it ſtands in the propoſition. Amendment of life may take place, and often does, without any internal light and conviction at all. It often does ſo by the alteration of a perſon's external circumſtances; by the removal of the temptation which led to external wickedneſs; or by a perſwaſion that ſuch a conduct is hurtful to his worldly intereſt, &amp;c. And there may be a degree of awakening and conviction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, without producing any reformation of life. And where amendment of life does take place in conſequence of internal light, &amp;c.
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011295_0005_0F869EC1B38400E8"/>
the former does not always keep pace exactly with the latter. A ſmall degree of internal light and conviction of conſcience, will often produce a full amendment of life; and after this is effected, and the perſon is quite reformed in his external conduct, this internal light and convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may yet increaſe, and riſe immenſely higher than that degree which was ſufficient for the amendment of life.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſay, in the next place, the propoſition is not a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of what I have advanced in my ſection on means. Where I ſpeak of the light and conviction of conſcience which the awakened ſinner, has preparatory to regeneration and converſion, I no where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it to the loweſt degree of this kind, which ever takes place in the mind of a ſinner; nor to that degree which is barely ſufficient for his external reformation. This is not the conviction of which I ſpeak: I ſpeak of an immenſely higher and greater degree of knowledge and conviction than that which is ſufficient for this. Mr. M. himſelf takes ſpecial notice of this, in the following words, which ſtand not ſix lines from the propoſition I am conſidering. <q>Nor are the convictions of awakened ſinners here ſpoken of under any reſtriction or limitation, but whatever be the degree, 'tho' under the greateſt convictions of conſcience, and the moſt concern about their ſouls,' &amp;c. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor indeed begins with what he calls inſtruction, explained by ſpeculative knowledge, and then adds what he terms more than ſpeculation, and finally riſes to <hi>all that conviction that the unregenerate are capable of, while ſuch.</hi>
                  </q> And he expreſſes this yet more fully in the following words. <q>The author having raiſed the unregenerate to the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> of an awakened ſenſe of divine things, that their ſtate, as ſuch, is capable of; every thing, as himſelf expreſſes it, ſhort of diſcerning the true beauty or moral excellency of divine things,' he propoſes this query, viz. If it ſhould be aſked, what good ALL this inſtruction and knowledge will do the unregenerate, &amp;c. Here it is to be noted, that it is <hi>fully conceded</hi> by the author, that the unregenerate <hi>under conſideration, have</hi> ALL <hi>degrees of light and conviction of divine truth, that can, by a common work of the ſpirit,</hi> agree to an unregenerate ſtate.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 54.</note>
                  </q> Here he appears to be ſenſible enough, that the ſinners <hi>under conſideration,</hi> have <hi>all degrees of light and conviction,</hi> &amp;c. and takes pains to ſhew that ſuch are the ſinners which I have in view in what I ſay. This is indeed very eaſily proved. Had this been in his mind, when he was about forming the propoſition I am, conſidering, it ought to have prevented its ever coming into exiſtence, as it now ſtands.</p>
               <p>In the paragraph from which Mr. M. quotes the moſt as containing the propoſition he has formed, I repreſent the ſinner of whom I am ſpeaking, as having a much higher degree of knowledge and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than is neceſſary barely to produce an external reformation; and as ſinning againſt the light of his conſcience in rejecting the goſpel, whatever may be his external reformations. That the reader may have
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011295_0005_0F869EC1B38400E8"/>
it before his eyes, I will tranſcribe my words. <q>The more clearly he ſees his own wretched caſe as a ſinner, and the dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of dying in his ſins; and the clearer conviction he has of his need of a Saviour, and of the truths of the goſpel in general; the greater is the crime of his impenitence, and continuing to reject the ſalvation offered in the goſpel. The awakened, <hi>convinced</hi> ſinner, who has taken a great deal of pains in the uſe of means, and has hereby got <hi>a great degree of inſtruction and knowledge</hi> and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues impenitent, is in this reſpect much more guilty and vile, and a greater criminal in God's ſight, than if he had never attained to this conviction and knowledge: for now he is guilty of the abuſe of, and oppoſition to, <hi>all this light and knowledge,</hi> which he could not be, while he had it not<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 129.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Had Mr. M. well attended to this, he muſt have been ſenſible that the light and conviction of which I ſpeak, as <hi>rendering</hi> the impenitent ſinner more guilty than when in a ſtate of ignorance and ſecurity, is not the loweſt degree of light and conviction, nor that degree which is only ſufficient in ſome meaſure to reform a perſon's life; and that I affirm nothing particularly of ſuch a low degree of conviction of conſcience which may produce ſome degree of reformation, or even wholly reform a perſon's external conduct: And therefore that the propoſition is not contained in any thing I ſay; but is a groſs miſrepreſentation.</p>
               <p>To ſet this matter in a yet clearer light, if poſſible, I would obſerve; that a perſon may be brought to an amendment of life by what is called; by ſome at leaſt, internal light and conviction of conſcience; and yet not have that light and conviction of which I ſpeak. A perſon may have only ſome imaginary, confuſed notions of a future ſtate of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be alarmed and affrighted by apprehenſions of his expoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to fall into hell, &amp;c. ſo as hereby to be led to leave off his vicious courſes: and yet have no juſt ſpeculative notions of God, ſin or hell. In this caſe, the reformation is not produced by true light and convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſcience: To be ſure, this is not the conviction of which. I am ſpeaking.—Another perſon may reform his life, only under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that the courſe of wickedneſs in which he has lived, leads to hell; without any further conviction with reſpect to his ſin, his loſt ſtate, his duty, &amp;c. and by ſuch reformation may make his conſcience eaſy.—Another, under a yet further conviction, that ſomething muſt be done to obtain God's favor, not only reforms all known ſins, but betakes himſelf to what he thinks duty; and by this gets eaſe to his conſcience, not imagining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that his reformations and doings, will make up for his paſt ſins, and render him acceptable to God. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an one; who from a courſe of ſenſuality and debauchery, or any other open wickedneſs in which he lived; and had little or no thought of God or a future ſtate; but only ſought the gratification of his reigning paſſions and appetites, becomes ſerious and regular in his behaviour, and goes into a courſe of ſtrict external religion, with a view
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011295_0006_0F869EC2E7522D68"/>
to make a righteouſneſs of his own, and get to heaven this way: I ſay, whether ſuch an one, by thus turning from one courſe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to another, does, on the whole, become leſs guilty and vile in God's ſight, may be a queſtion worthy to be attended to.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. M. has himſelf anſwered this queſtion, in repreſenting the phariſee who went up to the temple to pray as "one of the vileſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on earth." (p. 80 margin) And I deſire the reader to conſider whether in doing this, he has not implicitly decided the queſtion in diſpute between us, againſt himſelf. His vileneſs conſiſted chiefly in his being ignorant of God's righteouſneſs, and ſeeking to eſtabliſh his own righteouſneſs: he did not ſubmit himſelf unto the righteouſneſs of God, but oppoſed it with his whole heart. (See Rom. x. 3.) He did this in ignorance and unbelief, and perfectly agreeable to his own judgment and conſcience. Every unregenerate ſinner, under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt awakenings and convictions, does with his whole heart, refuſe to ſubmit to the righteouſneſs of God, and oppoſes it, and deſires and attempts to eſtabliſh his own righteouſneſs; and that in direct oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the dictates of his judgment and conſcience. The difference between theſe two therefore ſeems to lie againſt the latter, if ſinning againſt the light of conſcience, is more vile than living in the ſame way of ſinning ignorantly.</note> But be this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> will, it is not a queſtion that I am at preſent immediately concerned with, as nothing which I have ſaid about ſinners under awakenings and convictions of conſcience, has any reſpect to ſuch an one; or to any of the inſtances which I have now mentioned.</p>
               <p>In a word, whatever internal light and conviction of conſcience is neceſſary to bring a perſon to reform his external conduct, and goes no further than this, and riſes no higher; this is not the light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of which I am ſpeaking. A perſon under the influence of ſuch light and conviction, by thus reforming, may be ſaid, in a ſenſe, to act up to the light he has, i. e. the light of his conſcience, by obeying it and coming up to the dictates of it. As I have ſaid nothing about ſuch an inſtance, in which reformation riſes in a juſt proportion to the light of conſcience, and keeps pace with it, it appears that it is not true that I have aſſerted, "that on every riſing degree of internal light, awakening, conviction and amendment of life, the unregenerate are undoubtedly (on the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e) more vile, &amp;c." I have a right therefore to diſown the propoſition Mr. M. has formed for me, as containing what I have not aſſerted; in which what I have ſaid is kept quite out of ſight, and entirely miſrepreſented.</p>
               <p>Let it be alſo obſerved, that in this propoſition, which is ſaid to contain the ſum of what I have advanced on this head, that which I mention as the ground of the greater guilt and criminalneſs of the awakened, convinced ſinner, and that in which it really conſiſts, is not mentioned, but kept entirely out of view; which renders it a very partial, unfair ſtate of the caſe, and tends to give the reader, eſpecially
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011295_0006_0F869EC2E7522D68"/>
one who has never carefully attended to this matter, quite a wrong view of the thing in diſpute. I place his greater guilt, not in his awakenings and internal light, nor in his amendment of life; but in his continuing entirely obſtinate and impenitent, under all this light and conviction, and in his oppoſing and rejecting with his whole heart the free offers of pardon and ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the clear dictates of his judgment and conſcience. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to have been expreſſed in a propoſition formed with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed deſign to expreſs what I had aſſerted on this head. As it now ſtands, there is nothing expreſſed as the ground of their being more vile, odious and abominable in God's ſight, but "riſing degrees of internal light, awakening, conviction and amendment of life," which ſurely is not a fair ſtate of the caſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. makes the reformation of the convinced ſinner to keep pace with his light and conviction of conſcience. This he does in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in which he attempts to expreſs what I have aſſerted, and every where elſe through his whole book. He makes him to be one who reforms <hi>all known evils,</hi> and comes up to <hi>all known duties.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 7. 28.</note> By this he groſsly miſrepreſents me, and the whole matter in diſpute, and raiſes a duſt to blind the eyes of the inattentive. It is eaſy to ſee that light and conviction does not aggravate the ſins of him who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> with it, and comes up to all the dictates of it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. The ſinner I ſpeak of is ſuppoſed not to comply with the light and conviction he has, but to rebel againſt it (which is certainly the caſe of all the unregenerate under true convictions) and in this I placed his greater ſinfulneſs. Mr. M. in his propoſition leaves this wholly out; ſo, in effect, leaves all out that I had aſſerted; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces a character about which I had not ſaid one word, and ſo makes me aſſert what I never did aſſert, nor meant to aſſert.</p>
               <p>I pretend not to charge Mr. M. with thus ſtating my ſentiment in a partial, unfair, and wrong light <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>upon deſign.</hi> All I am concerned to make out is, that this is in fact the caſe; which I truſt manifeſtly appears to the impartial reader: And I leave it to him to aſſign what reaſon he pleaſes why Mr. M. has ſtated the matter as he has done. I am willing he himſelf ſhould be believed when he ſays he has, "<hi>to the beſt of his underſtanding,</hi> fairly adjuſted, ſtated, and ſum'd up the ſenſe of the author."</p>
               <p>It may be obſerved that Mr. M. has not only here carefully kept the character which I give of the unregenerate ſinner under true awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings and convictions of conſcience, out of view; but has done it thro' his whole performance. And when he has occaſion to quote me where I ſpeak of "the ſinner's continuing obſtinately to reject and oppoſe the ſalvation offered in the goſpel," leſt the reader ſhould be led by theſe expreſſions to look on the ſinner in too bad a light, he carefully obſerves that I "mean no more than merely his continuing unregenerate," and nothing but what it conſiſtent with his reforming

                  <hi>every known ſin;</hi> as if theſe expreſſions of mine naturally carried in them ſome thing more and worſe than what is implied in being unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and therefore cannot be properly applied to the ſinner on this account only.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 56.</note> And it is apparent to me, and I doubt not will be ſo to every diſcerning reader, that if Mr. M. had not viewed the unregenerate ſinner in a better and more innocent light than I do (and, I truſt, than the ſcripture repreſents him) and had he not looked on ſuch as little or nothing to blame for unbelief and rejecting the goſpel, the book he has wrote, would never have ſeen the light.—But of this matter I ſhall treat more largely hereafter.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewn that Mr. M's propoſition is ſo far from "comprizing the plain ſenſe of the author," that it contains what he never aſſerted, and is a very groſs miſrepreſentation of the ſentiment he has eſpouſed, &amp; a very unfair ſtate of the caſe, I will expreſs it in my own words; and ſo as to give what I think is the "plain ſenſe" of what I have ſaid in my ſection on means; and which I yet think is the truth, and may be defended.</p>
               <p>The unregenerate ſinner, who is under genuine and thorough awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenings and convictions of conſcience reſpecting his own ſtate and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and the truths of the goſpel; particularly, reſpecting this truth, that ſalvation is freely offered to him through a Mediator, which he is obliged by the ſtrongeſt ties of duty and intereſt immediately to accept and embrace; being at the ſame time wholly without any excuſe for his neglect in not embracing it, and for the oppoſition of his heart to Chriſt, of which he is conſcious; and who yet continues, under all this light, and contrary to the plain dictates and preſſing, painful convictions of his own conſcience, obſtinately to oppoſe and reject Jeſus Chriſt: ſuch an one is, on the account of this his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence and obſtinacy under this clear light and conviction of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, more guilty, vile and odious in God's ſight, than he was before he had this light and conviction, and was in a ſtate of ſecurity and ignorance; whatever alteration or reformation has taken place in him in other reſpects.</p>
               <p>To prevent miſunderſtanding, it is needful to obſerve here, that in this propoſition, and in all that I have ſaid on this head in my ſection on means, nothing is affirmed of a ſinner who has loſt his convictions which he was under for a while, and has returned in a great degree to ſecurity and eaſe, and to the allowed commiſſion of the groſs external wickedneſs, which he had forſook under the influence of the light and conviction which he had: or to that which is more groſs and vile: I ſay, nothing is affirmed of ſuch an one, whether he is now more or leſs guilty and vile than he was when under conviction, and when external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reformed. All that is affirmed is, that the ſinner under the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and convictions deſcribed, is more guilty than he was in a ſtate of ignorance and ſecurity antecedent to luck convictions, of which he never was the ſubject before. Mr. M. has made this miſtake, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011295_0007_0F869EC3D2567D10"/>
not diſtinguiſhed between theſe two caſes, as I ſhall have occaſion to obſerve in the ſequel. The ſinner I deſcribe may be much more guilty and vile under awakenings and convictions, than he was before; and yet may be more guilty ſtill, on the whole, by oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuppreſſing his convictions, and, as it were, doing violence to his conſcience, by deſignedly taking thoſe meaſures, and going into thoſe ways of groſs, outward wickedneſs, which by degrees wear off the conviction which gave him uneaſineſs. This is a caſe to which nothing I have ſaid has any reſpect.</p>
               <p>I would not be here underſtood, however, to intimate, that the awakened, convinced ſinner does not always oppoſe his convictions; tho' not always in the ſame ſenſe and degree as juſt now mentioned. Convictions may be oppoſed two ways, and in two ſenſes. They are truly oppoſed when the truths of which the ſinner is convinced are diſagreeable to his heart, and he refuſes cordially to ſubmit to them, and comply with them. In this ſenſe unregenerate ſinners always reſiſt all their convictions, and oppoſe them with their whole hearts, however deſirous they may be to have their convictions continue, and whatever pains they may take in the uſe of means to maintain and cheriſh them, becauſe they believe that they are neceſſary in order to eſcape hell, and be ſaved, and that it is moſt dangerous to loſe their convictions, and return to eaſe and ſecurity. In this ſenſe they may "nouriſh their convictions," agreeable to Mr. M's phraſe, and yet oppoſe all the truths they are convinced of, with their whole hearts, and remain moſt obſtinate enemies to Chriſt, and the way of ſalvation by him. But ſinners may alſo reſiſt convictions, and often do, by trying to get rid of them, and taking meaſures with a deſign to wear them off from their minds: And many times they in this way ſtill their conſciences, get eaſe, and return to their former courſes, or to courſes ſtill worſe. Of ſuch nothing is affirmed or denied in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in diſpute between Mr. M. and me.</p>
               <p>Let it alſo be noted here, that if two perſons have equal degrees of light and conviction of conſcience; and one reforms his external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and attends on means under the influence of the conviction he has; and the other goes on in his allowed external wickedneſs, in neglect of all means; and this ever was, or can be the caſe; nothing is ſaid of ſuch a caſe in the propoſition. Indeed, nothing is ſaid of <hi>different</hi> perſons, whether one is more guilty and vile than another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but what is affirmed is of the <hi>ſame</hi> perſon, who is now awakened from a ſtate of eaſe and ſecurity, and has that light and conviction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which he never had before, and which is inconſiſtent with a ſtate of ſecurity and open wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>It will be obſerved that in this propoſition it is aſſerted that this it true <hi>in all caſes;</hi> however vicious and guilty the perſon was while ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ſtupid, and in a ſtate of ſecurity and carnal eaſe; yet by continuing impenitent under the awakenings and convictions mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, becomes a greater criminal, is guilty of more aggravated wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011295_0008_0F869EC4387B6190"/>
than he was before, whatever particular ways of ſinning he has forſaken, in which he before lived.</p>
               <p>This, I am ſenſible, will be thought by many to be carrying the matter to a great length, and even too far. If it had been only ſaid, that many, if not moſt unregenerate ſinners, who have not been guilty of any enormous crimes and uncommon wickedneſs in their lives, do become more guilty when their conſciences are thoroughly awakened and convinced, than they were in a ſtate of ſecurity; they perhaps think this is true, and may be eaſily proved. But to carry the matter ſo far, even to every inſtance without exception, they think is not ſafe, and perhaps is not true; and if it is true, it is a matter of no great importance, and it may be difficult to prove it. And it will give thoſe who are diſpoſed to oppoſe the real truth in this caſe, an advantage againſt it, and an opportunity greatly to prejudice others againſt in, who would probably have fallen in with it, had it not been aſſerted it ſuch <hi>univerſal</hi> terms.</p>
               <p>It is certain that Mr. M. has taken all the advantage he could of this (and as has been ſhewn, more than he could fairly do, by miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter, and carrying it further than I had done.) He has not failed to keep this in view every where, as if it was the only point of controverſy between him and me. Whereas this is not true; for he through his whole book as much oppoſes the notion of ſinners in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral growing worſe under awakenings and convictions of conſcience, or that this is true in any inſtance, as he does that this is the caſe in <hi>every</hi> inſtance: And he has ſaid nothing to prove the latter not true, which is not equally againſt the former. Therefore if I ſhould now give up this point, that ſinners under genuine, thorough convictions are in <hi>all caſes</hi> more criminal and vile in God's ſight, than they were in a ſtate of ignorance and ſecurity, however criminal and vile they were then; and only aſſert that this is the caſe with unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in general who have lived pretty regular lives in a ſtate of ſecurity, Mr. M. would have as real a controverſy with me then, as he has now, as his whole book is as much againſt the latter as the former. This, I truſt, will fully appear before I have done.</p>
               <p>But as I yet think this propoſition is true, as I have now ſtated it, and may be made evident beyond all doubt to thoſe who will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and will thoroughly conſider the matter, I ſhall attempt to prove it, and leave it to the reader to judge for himſelf. But if, after all, any ſhould think it is not proved beyond all controverſy that the unregenerate in the caſe propoſed are in <hi>all inſtances</hi> more vile, &amp;c. tho' it be quite evident that this is true of ſinners in general: and that it is of no importance that the propoſition ſhould be affirmed without any exception; let it be remembered that tho' I think the former to be both an evident and important truth; yet the latter is much more important. And if Mr. M. had not oppoſed the latter as much as the former, perhaps I ſhould not have thought it worth while to make any reply.</p>

But before I proceed to this argument, it will be neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is the true ſtate and character of the unregenerate ſinner under awakenings and under the moſt clear convictions of conſcience. This will therefore be attended to in the next ſection.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The true ſtate and character of the unregenerate ſinner under awakenings and convictions conſidered and ſtated, in oppoſition to the character which Mr. Mills gives of ſuch.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE unregenerate ſinner is an enemy to God. The whole bent, and all the exerciſes of his heart, are in oppoſition to God's true character; and no influences on his mind, whether by the ſpirit of God, or any thing elſe, antecedent to regeneration, or any change whatſoever, do in the leaſt degree remove this oppoſition and enmity. For he is ſtill under the dominion of ſin, having not the leaſt degree of right diſpoſition, and exerciſe of true love to God and man. And whatever awakenings of conſcience &amp; convictions of the truth take place in the ſinners mind; and however diſtreſſed and anxious he is about his caſe, and whatever alteration there is in his conduct produced by fear or hope; ſtill he is as real and as great an enemy to the divine character, to the law of God, to Jeſus Chriſt and the goſpel, as ever. Whatever are the influences of the ſpirit of God on the mind of an unregenerate ſinner, in awakenings and convictions of conſcience they make no alteration as to the prevailing temper and inclination of the heart. No new diſpoſition and principles of heart are given, nor are the natural, corrupt principles of the heart in the leaſt altered for the better, ſo as to be more friendly, or leſs oppoſite to God. Therefore all the exertions and exerciſes of the heart, under the greateſt degree of this influence, by which the conſcience is inlightened and awakened, are no more friendly to God, but as corrupt and as oppoſite to him as ever.</p>
               <p>This muſt be ſo: for the corrupt principles of the heart exerciſed and acted out will always be the ſame, whatever light and conviction is in the judgment and conſcience. The corrupt tree will bring forth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fruit; and that which is born of the fleſh is, and will be fleſh. Every exerciſe of an entire enemy to God, will be of the nature of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt him. And there is no other way to ſuppreſs and put an end to thoſe corrupt, ſinful exerciſes but either to change his heart, or to put an end to all his exerciſes, by caſting him into a deep ſleep, by turning him into a beaſt, tree or rock, or by annihiliation. Many have talked of the unregenerate ſinner's forſaking ſin and doing his duty, upon mere <hi>natural</hi> principles: But what do they mean? What natural
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011295_0009_0F869EC5286A8AD8"/>
principles are there, but corrupt principles? If they ſay <hi>natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is a natural principle, and not corrupt, eſpecially when inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the ſpirit of God; I anſwer, Natural conſcience, ſo far as it is diſtinguiſhed from the heart, is no principle of action at all. The heart is the ſource and ſeat of all moral exerciſe and action; natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience therefore, as diſtinguiſhed from this, is neither ſinful nor virtuous. they ſhall ſay <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> are natural principles; I grant they are common to angels and men, ſaints and ſinners; but in the unregenerate have no more real goodneſs in them, than the ſame principles in the devils themſelves. Fear and hope are as much concerned in the worſt of exerciſes and actions, and have as much influence in them, as in the beſt. And the exerciſes of fear and hope are juſt as corrupt and ſinful, as is the heart in which they are exerciſed. If they ſay <hi>ſelf love</hi> is a natural principle from which the unregenerate do avoid ſin and in many caſes perform their duty; I anſwer, If by ſelf love is meant only a deſire and love of happineſs in general, and averſion to miſery or evil; this is in itſelf neither more nor leſs ſinful or virtuous, but may be conſidered as the principle of all exerciſes and actions, both good and bad, and has as much concern and influence in the worſt, as in the beſt. But if by a principle of ſelf love is meant <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> or a perſon's ſelfiſh regard and reſpect to himſelf, his own private, ſeperate intereſt and happineſs, without any diſintereſted regard to any other being, always ſeeking and purſuing that which appears to him for his own good; being wholly influenced by this, and nothing elſe, in all his exerciſes and conduct; this is itſelf ſinful, and is the principle and ſource of all the ſin in the univerſe, being directly oppoſite to true benevolence, which it the ſum of all that is truly good; this is in its own nature enmity to being in general; and is that by which man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an enemy to God and man. So far therefore as men act from this principle, they ſin; and they are ſinful in proportion to the ſtrength and vigor with which this principle is exerted. If a perſon is wholly under the government of this ſelfiſhneſs, loving and regarding himſelf ſupre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ly, and having no reſpect and regard to God or man, only from ſelfiſh ends, and as the fruit and exerciſe of this ſelfiſhneſs: I ſay if a perſon is wholly under the dominion of this ſelfiſhneſs, as all the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are, all his actions are wrong and ſinful, in whatever way he ſeeks his own happineſs; whether in a worldly intereſt, in purſuing the profits, honors or pleaſures of this world; or in the happineſs of the future ſtate, earneſtly purſuing it, in croſſing his ſenſual appetites, and in the painful exerciſe of what be calls devotion and religion. Oppoſition and enmity to God and his law, and so to Chriſt and the goſpel, may be as really exerciſed in the latter way as the former, and in as high a degree; yea, much higher and more immediately and directly againſt God. But of this more particularly hereafter.</p>
               <p>It hence appears that whatever influence there is on the natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the ſoul by the ſpirit of God, in awakenings, conviction of conſcience, &amp;c. this does not at all abate the power of wickedneſs in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011295_0009_0F869EC5286A8AD8"/>
heart. Self-love, or ſelfiſhneſs, into whatever channel it is turned; whether it is exerciſed about preſent or future good, in fears of evil, or hopes of good in this world, or the world to come, and earneſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to obtain the good and eſcape the evil: I ſay this <hi>ſelfiſhneſs</hi> is ſtill of the ſame nature, and it is in direct oppoſition to all true goodneſs. The greateſt awakenings and convictions of conſcience, and every thing that takes place in conſequence of this in the minds of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, do not in any degree abate the exerciſe of this grand prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all ſin and rebellion in the univerſe; ſo do not make the heart in any degree better; but may be the occaſion of turning the ſelfiſh rebellious heart more directly and in a much ſtronger degree of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe againſt God; and perhaps always has this effect. But this is to be conſidered in the next ſection.</p>
               <p>I particularly obſerve this to ſhew the miſtake which ſome make in this matter. Becauſe awakenings and convictions of conſcience are effected by the ſpirit of God, they think that ſomething good, or leſs ſinful in the heart muſt be the effect of this work of the ſpirit. There is no ground for ſuch a conſequence. There is nothing done in the inlightening and conviction of the conſciences of the unregenerate, and awakening them to attend to the truth, &amp;c. which will not be done in a much higher degree, tho' not juſt in the ſame way, in the minds of the wicked at the day of judgment, and forever afterwards. But who will ſay, the wicked then, under all their convictions, fears and horrors, will not be as rebellious, impenitent and hardened, as the ſecure ſinner is, who neither knows nor fears any of theſe things?</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ſay, 'there is this grand difference, between an awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, convinced ſinner in this world, and the convictions and horrors of the wicked at the day of judgment, that the former is under hope, and has the offer of mercy and ſalvation; but the latter will be in abſolute diſpair: the hope of the former leads him to dread ſin and ſeek deliverance in the uſe of means, &amp;c.' It is granted this is true Self-love or ſelfiſhneſs will exerciſe itſelf in this way in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; but ſtill this is nothing but ſelfiſhneſs under the influence of fear of evil and hope of eſcape, and of obtaining happineſs; the heart is no more truly pliable, obedient and penitent than ever, does not comply in the leaſt degree, but obſtinately oppoſes God and the goſpel. And as he does moſt obſtinately reſiſt and trample under his feet the moſt aſtoniſhing mercy, which is freely offered to him, and reject the Son of God in all his amazing condeſcention and grace; in this view, his impenitence, hardneſs of heart and obſtinacy, appear in a moſt ſtriking, awful light, and much more aggravated and ſhocking than that of the latter.</p>
               <p>The unregenerate ſinner is therefore a hardned, impenitent rebel, who with his whole heart oppoſes and hates God, and his holy law, and hates and rejects Jeſus Chriſt and the ſalvation offered by him, ſo far as theſe come into his view, and under his notice. He is so, under all the awakenings, convictions and reformations that he is the ſubject
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011295_0010_0F869ECA8DECD1C0"/>
of. Whatever it done to him, and what changes ſoever he paſſes through, his character with reſpect to theſe things is not altered; he is yet as really under the dominion of ſin, and a fixed, impenitent, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate enemy to God and Jeſus Chriſt, as ever.</p>
               <p>The awakened ſinner under all his convictions, terrors and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and moſt earneſt attempts to eſcape the evil he ſees himſelf in danger of, and obtain ſalvation, has no more love and reſpect to God than he ever had, and is really as much under the power of oppoſite principles as ever, as has been obſerved; does not hate ſin, at all, but is as much in love with it as ever.</p>
               <p>Many a profligate wretch, who has long indulged himſelf in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs and debauchery, when he has been brought into ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that his wickedneſs is like to be diſcovered, ſo as to bring diſgrace and contempt upon him, and ruin him in all his worldly intereſts; has been filled with anxiety and diſtreſs, ſo that he could find no quiet, night nor day: he has been convinced of his folly, condemned himſelf, and reformed his vile practices, being afraid to indulge himſelf in the leaſt degree, as he had done, and reſolved that he would carefully avoid ſuch conduct for time to come: and has uſed unwearied attempts to eſcape the evil he feared. And in this time of his fear and diſtreſs has made many prayers to God, hoping that he would interpoſe in his behalf, ſo that he might eſcape the evil he feared. But when his fears were over, and nothing was, in his view, in the way of his going into his former practices without danger of puniſhment or a diſcovery, he has returned to them with as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and eagerneſs as ever. In this caſe every one will be ſenſible how little in his favor was his reformation, and that under all his fears and terrors, and earneſt endeavours to avoid evil, his heart was really no better than it was before, and was as much in love with ſin. This may in ſome meaſure illuſtrate the caſe of the awakened ſinner, with reſpect to what I have juſt now been ſpeaking. For there is no more virtue and goodneſs in fearing evil in the future world, even the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hell, than worldly evil; and the reformation of any particular practices from ſuch fear, is from no better principles, and no more an evidence of real oppoſition of heart to ſin, than in the inſtance juſt mentioned.</p>
               <p>The highway robber, who is apprehended and condemned to be hanged, and is hereby thrown into great diſtreſs of mind, and moſt earneſtly petitions the king for mercy, and promiſes reformation and obedience to his laws for time to come, will, as ſoon as he is ſet at liberty, and has no fear of being again apprehended, diſmiſs all his fear, and return to the ſame courſe again. Will he who views him in this light, in the time of his fears, reformations and promiſes, look upon him to be really more penitent, or leſs an enemy to his king and country, than before he was apprehended? In no better light the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinner ought to be viewed, under all his awakenings, and convictions of conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:011295_0010_0F869ECA8DECD1C0"/>
It hence appears that the awakened, convinced ſinner does not, while unregenerate, really yield or give up one point of controverſy between him and his Maker, but is as impenitent and obſtinate as ever, being ſtill as great a friend to ſin, and enemy to God as he was before; the principles and exerciſes of his heart being not in the leaſt abated with reſpect to this.</p>
               <p>AND it is of great importance to be obſerved here, and well attended to, that the unregenerate ſinner <hi>is wholly to blame</hi> for all that in which his unregeneracy conſiſts, it being nothing but wickedneſs and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of heart, for which the ſinner has not the leaſt imaginable excuſe. He is under no kind or degree of impotency or difficulty, which is in the way of his repentance, loving God, and embracing the goſpel, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the leaſt excuſe for not doing it, or takes off the leaſt degree of blame for his neglect. He is under no kind of inability or difficulty that is in the way of his turning to God immediately, which the open profligate is not under, as a bar in the way of his reforming his wicked conduct immediately. In the latter caſe all the difficulty lies in the corruption of his heart, and the oppoſition of his will to it: and this is all the difficulty in the former. And if it is more difficult for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to turn to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt with his whole heart, than it is for him to forſake all ways of known ſin in external conduct, and he is under a greater inability to do the former than the latter, it is wholly becauſe his will oppoſes the former more than it does the latter, or rather becauſe the latter may be complied with conſiſtent with the indulgence of the reigning wickedneſs of the heart, and enmity againſt God, whereas the former cannot. The reaſon why the open profligate does not reform his conduct immediately is becauſe he is not willing, or his heart oppoſes this. And the only reaſon why the awakened, convinced ſinner does not embrace the goſpel immediately, but remains obſtinately impenitent, is becauſe his will, even his whole heart oppoſes it. All the difference is, that in the latter caſe the oppoſition of the heart to Jeſus Chriſt is more fixed and ſtrong, than it is in the former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſe to an external reformation, as an external reformation may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, conſiſtent with the exerciſe and gratification of the reigning luſts of the heart: but compliance with the goſpel cannot. And is there need of ſaying any thing to prove that the ſinner is perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable and to blame for not doing that in which there is no difficulty but what conſiſts in the want of a will or heart, and the oppoſition of the will to it? This would be the ſame thing as to undertake to prove that wickedneſs of heart, and that in which all ſin and blame do conſiſt, is indeed wickedneſs, ſinful and blameworthy. And if oppoſition of heart to that which is in itſelf right, is, in all caſes, ſinful, and perfectly inexcuſable and blameworthy; then the greater is the degree of this oppoſition and the more ſtrong, fixed and perfect it is, the further is the ſinner from all excuſe, and the more blameworthy. So that the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and inability of loving God and embracing the goſpel in the caſe before us, is ſo far from rendering the ſinner in any degree blameleſs or excuſable, that the more there is of this, the more blameworthy and criminal he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:011295_0011_0F869ECBBA20DC00"/>
Hence it appears that the unregenerate ſinner's reigning oppoſition and enmity of heart againſt God and the goſpel, is perfectly criminal and moſt odious and abominable in his ſight, notwithſtanding all his awakenings, convictions and external reformations; the latter do not render the former a whit the leſs criminal, odious and abominable; any more than the cleanſing and ſcouring the outſide of a cup renders the moſt offenſive, abominable corruption and filthineſs, of which it is within full, leſs odious and abominable. Or (to uſe another compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) no more than the cryings of a ſtubborn child, in dread of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od, which is held over him, and his ſtrivings to get out of his father's hands and eſcape, ſerve to extenuate his crime, while he obſtinately refuſes to own his fault and ſubmit to his father's will; and reſolutely oppoſes him under all his threatnings.</p>
               <p>THE unregenerate ſinner has no <hi>ſincere deſires</hi> to repent and embrace the goſpel, or of a new heart: It is the moſt glaring contradiction to ſuppoſe he has; as great a one as to ſuppoſe, that wickedneſs is friendly to holineſs. Theſe things are not the objects of the deſires of the hearts of the unregenerates, but of their averſion and enmity. They deſire deliverance from miſery, and the enjoyment of happineſs (tho' not true happineſs and the ſalvation, which the goſpel offers) under a conviction that they muſt repent and ſubmit to Chriſt, in order to eſcape the one, and obtain the other: But their hearts are as far from deſiring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turn to God, as ever; for if they had a real deſire to repent, &amp;c. they would repent; for nothing is in the way of this, but oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart. And they make no <hi>ſincere attempts</hi> to turn to God and embrace the goſpel; for this would ſuppoſe their hearts did not wholly oppoſe theſe, which they do, as has been ſhewn; and the whole diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of their turning to God, and the only reaſon of their not doing it immediately, lies in this enmity and oppoſition.</p>
               <p>If any are diſpoſed to look on the awakened ſinner, as leſs to blame for his enmity of heart againſt God, and fixed, obſtinate oppoſition to Chriſt, becauſe he is externally reformed, and greatly diſtreſſed, under fears that he ſhall be miſerable forever; and if ſuch appear in a great degree harmleſs and innocent in their ſight, they certainly judge in this caſe according to the outward appearance, and not righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In God's ſight all that wickedneſs of heart in which their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy conſiſts, and in which they continue wholly impenitent, and enemies to the divine character and the goſpel, is perfectly inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable and criminal, and infinitely odious; there being no difficulty in their becoming friends to God, &amp;c. but what lies in the voluntary wickedneſs of their hearts.</p>
               <p>MANY have made a very great and hurtful miſtake here. They repreſent the impotency of the unregenerate to turn to God and believe in Chriſt to be ſuch as not to be altogether blameable, if criminal in any degree. They are to blame, wholly to blame, they allow, for not doing <hi>what they can do,</hi> as they are won<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> expreſs it; but if they reform, and do <hi>what they can,</hi> and cry to God to change their hearts,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011295_0011_0F869ECBBA20DC00"/>
&amp;c. they are poor creatures, to be pitied that they are in ſuch a ſad caſe; but not much, if at all to blame, for remaining under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin, and not embracing the goſpel, which they are deſiring and honeſtly attempting, but have no power to do it: ſo that this is rather their calamity, than their ſin.</p>
               <p>THIS way of repreſenting the matter has been infinitely miſchievous.—By thus miſrepreſenting the doctrine of man's natural impotency, they have rendered it ridiculous to thoſe, who have been diſpoſed to oppoſe the real truth, and have prejudiced them againſt it. While they themſelves have been unable to defend the doctrine in the light, in which they ſet it; and ſo have given occaſion to the enemies of the truth to triumph.—On the other hand, it has proved an agreeable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and ſweet reſting place to multitudes. By this repreſentation they have been "ſewing pillows to all arm-holes,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. xiii. 18.</note> and comforting thoſe, to whom God ſpeaks no peace. The unregenerate ſinner, who has reformed all ways of external ſin, and allows himſelf in no known outward evil practices, and prays to God for a new heart, &amp;c. which he thinks he ſincerely deſires, but that it is wholly out of his power to change his own heart: Such an one, I ſay, makes himſelf in a great meaſure eaſy in an unregenerate ſtate, while he thinks he does all he can. Such a ſinner is not under genuine, thorough convictions; and never will, nor poſſibly can be, while he believes this repreſentation to be juſt.</p>
               <p>AND this doctrine of man's inability, as conſiſting in ſomething, which does in ſome meaſure excuſe, and is conſiſtent with a perſon's ſincere deſires of heart to have it removed, and to do what he <hi>cannot</hi> do: This doctrine, I ſay, is moſt ſweet to many a corrupt heart. Many profeſſing chriſtians fly to this refuge to hide and reſt themſelves, by making it an excuſe for their not living in conſtant and high exerciſes of chriſtian holineſs. They ſay, "We are poor creatures, we can do nothing of ourſelves; if God does not aſſiſt us and give us ſtrength, we can do nothing, we have no power of our own, &amp;c." And if they are told the truth of the matter; that they are under no inability but what conſiſts in their inexcuſable, voluntary wickedneſs: that they are wholly to blame for all their defects, &amp;c. they will oppoſe it with all their might, as what tends to take away their comfort, and rob them of their only refuge. For this doctrine of man's inability, as conſiſting in ſome difficulty in the way of holineſs, which is independent of the will, and for which they are not wholly to blame, is as agreeable to the corrupt heart of man, as any Arminian or Pelagian doctrine whatſoever can be. How many of thoſe who are called Calviniſts have fled to this refuge of lies, and here are like to periſh, God knows!—Be this as it will, it certainly becomes all the friends of truth, and of mankind to do all they can, effectually to expoſe this unſcriptural, abſurd, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous notion; and ſet the truth in a clear light.<note n="†" place="bottom">This I took pains to do in my remarks on Dr. Mayhew's ſermons<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 99, &amp;c.</note> Mr. M. has approved of all this and yet builds all his oppoſition to me on that which is in direct contradiction to it, as will be ſeen in the ſequel.</note>

Mr. MILLS has, I think, unhappily fallen into this ſad and dangerous miſtake; which is diſcovered through the whole of his performance, as that on which he grounds all his oppoſition to me.</p>
               <p>He has not ſaid one word, that I have obſerved, from beginning to end, of the convinced ſinner's enmity againſt God, and obſtinate rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt and the goſpel, being under the dominion of a hard, impenitent heart. All this is carefully kept out of ſight; unleſs when he was obliged to mention ſomething of it in his quotations from me. And in this caſe he always puts in a caveat, obſerving that I mean no more by theſe hard terms than <hi>merely continuing unregenerate.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 3, 15, 56.</note> Plainly intimating that he thinks ſuch terms do not properly belong to the unregenerate as ſuch, and that they repreſent them as worſe and more criminal than they really are. He therefore every where ſpeaks of the unawakened ſinner as impenitent, hardened and ſtout-hearted, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to one that is awakened, as if this was not true of the latter, and as if the latter was of an oppoſite character.</p>
               <p>And he repreſents the unregenerate as not wholly to blame for their unregeneracy, their unbelief and not embracing the goſpel; but as being under an impotence which does in ſome meaſure, if not wholly excuſe. This repreſentation runs through his whole book, as has been juſt now obſerved, and is laid as the foundation of all his oppoſition to me. This I conclude will be quite evident to every attentive reader, before I ſhall have done. I ſhall now cite only a few expreſſions of his, which ſeem to ſet the matter in this light, eſpecially if conſidered in connection with others, which I am about to mention. He ſpeaks of the awakened, convinced ſinner as brought to "reformation and amendment of life, to the higheſt degree the unregenerate are capable of by the common influences of the holy Spirit."<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 16, 17.</note> He ſays they "regard <hi>all</hi> duty and avoid all ſin, that <hi>can agree</hi> to an unregenerate ſtate."<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 22.</note> 
                  <q>Thus the <hi>poor,</hi> trembling, convinced, reformed ſinner (I mean as much as an unregenerate ſinner <hi>can</hi> be ſo)"<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 20, 21.</note> He feels his guilt and moral diſorder as a deſperate, incurable diſeaſe, as to all created pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and therefore cries to God for help.<note n="¶" place="bottom">P. 81.

               <p>But he goes much further than this, and repreſents unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a much more favourable light ſtill.

               </p>
               <p>This is the account Mr. M. gives of unregenerate ſinners under awakening and convictions! And he has ſaid not only this, but much more in their favour; too much to be tranſcribed here. Upon which I ſhall make the following remarks.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If this repreſentation of the unregenerate ſinner under convictions is agreeable to the truth; then all that I have ſaid of ſuch in my ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on means, is wrong and groundleſs; and ſuch an one is not only leſs vile than the profligate; but is in a great degree innocent and blameleſs. He does not ſin againſt the light of his conſcience, or abuſe it in the leaſt; for he reverences his conſcience, and lives up to the dictates of it, avoiding every known ſin and coming up to all known duty. He is not properly an <hi>impenitent ſinner;</hi> for he does really
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011295_0013_0F869ECD3AFD49B0"/>
repent and humble himſelf before God. Nor does he obſtinately reject Jeſus Chriſt and the goſpel; for, on the whole, he deſires the ſalvation which is offered in the goſpel, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>es to ſovereign mercy, there held out to him, as his only refuge. As I placed the great guilt and vileneſs of the unregenerate ſinner in his ſinning againſt the light and convictions of his own conſcience, in obſtinately refuſing the offers of the goſpel and rejecting Jeſus Chriſt, which he is now convinced he is wholly to blame for, and is the greateſt ſin he ever was guilty of; I own my charge is quite groundleſs and very injurious if Mr. M. has given a juſt and true character of the unregenerate: and I muſt yield the point to him.</p>
               <p>But if all he has ſaid on this head, is a groſs miſrepreſentation of the character of the unregenerate ſinner, and he applies to them many things which are found in the regenerate only; and if moſt of his arguments, and the plauſibleneſs of all he has ſaid, are founded in this miſrepreſentation; then all is built on a very ſlender foundation, and really comes to nothing. And I think I have a right to call this a <hi>miſrepreſentation,</hi> as I cannot find that Mr. M. has attempted to prove theſe things; but has taken them for granted, and only aſſerted them. And I think what has been ſaid in this ſection is ſufficient to ſhew that Mr. M's account of the unregenerate is very groſsly wrong. And this will more fully appear, I truſt, before I have done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Mr. M. has given a juſt character of the unregenerate; then what I have ſaid of theſe in my diſpute with Dr. Mayhew, on which I founded all my oppoſition to him, is wholly wrong. For the whole diſpute turned upon this queſtion, Whether unregenerate ſinners do, on the whole, really deſire the ſalvation offered in the goſpel? I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that they do not, and undertook to prove it, and owned that if the Dr. would prove that they do, he would gain his point, and I was ready to yield it to him. Mr. M. has really taken the Dr's ſide in this controverſy, and repreſented the unregenerate ſinner in as blameleſs and fair a light as he did, and has raiſed him as high; yea, has ſaid much more in his favour.</p>
               <p>And is it not ſtrange, that this ſame Mr. M. ſhould give me his "<hi>hearty</hi> thanks" for what I had wrote againſt the Dr. and call it "a finiſhed debate on the point!"<note n="*" place="bottom">Preface P. 5.</note> Surely Mr. M. is far from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the debate between the Dr. and me; and ſo was very unfit to pronounce any thing about it: or he is very inconſiſtent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Both are perhaps true.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is ſtill more ſtrange and inconſiſtent, if poſſible, is his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying promiſes to the doings of the unregenerate, or repreſenting them as coming up to that, to which promiſes are expreſsly made. This appears from what has been juſt quoted from him. He applies the following words to the unregenerate, "Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Hol. VI. 3.</note> If the unregenerate follow on to know the Lord, then they perform the condition, to which there is an expreſs promiſe, that they ſhall know the Lord. But the knowledge of God
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011295_0013_0F869ECD3AFD49B0"/>
is peculiar to true ſaints, and connected with eternal life. And he repreſents the unregenerate as, on the whole, deſiring ſalvation, and humbly applying to God for it, as did the prodigal; and hoping and truſting in the mere mercy of God, as exerciſed to ſinners, and aſking for it, as did the publican Now it is certain that promiſes of ſalvation are made to all who hope in God's mercy, and really deſire the ſalvation offered in the goſpel, and come to Chriſt for it. Is not this very ſtrange, when he had not only formerly wrote a book to prove the contrary to all this; but in his preface to this, acknowledges I have proved the ſame beyond all controverſy, and heartily thanks me for it!</p>
               <p n="4">4. The grand diſpute between Mr. M. and me is about the true character of the unregenerate ſinner; Whether he, under the greateſt awakenings and convictions he ever is the ſubject of antecedent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, does not continue an impenitent, voluntary, inexcuſable, obſtinate enemy to God, and the Redeemer? If Mr. M. will grant this, he will grant the ſum of what I contend for. But he has been ſo far from it, that all his book is really wrote againſt it.</p>
               <p>On the whole, Mr. M. has really taken up Dr. Mayhew's cauſe, and repreſents the unregenerate ſinner in much the ſame light in which <hi>he</hi> did, as the ground of moſt or his arguments to prove that promiſes are made to him. Mr. M. does not expreſsly ſay indeed that there are promiſes made to the unregenerate; but the contrary. But herein he is more inconſiſtent with himſelf, than was Dr. Mayhew: for if Mr. M. gives them a true character, the bible is full of promiſes to them. And he actually applies paſſages of ſcripture to them, which contain promiſes, as has been obſerved; and he might with as much propriety apply all thoſe ſcriptures to them which Dr. Mayhew does; yea all the promiſes in the bible.</p>

                  <p>ARGUMENTS for the affirmative of the queſtion in diſpute.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN order to determine who is the greateſt ſinner, or what way and manner of ſinning is moſt criminal, or what particular ſin is moſt aggravated, we muſt firſt conſider and determine, wherein the guilt of criminalneſs of ſin, of all ſin, chiefly lies, or what is the greateſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all ſin, which does above every thing elſe render it vile and criminal.</p>
               <p>And in this I ſuppoſe all will be agreed, who have attended to this matter, and conſidered what reaſon and ſcripture dictate on this head. The vileneſs and guilt of ſin does chiefly and principally conſiſt in its being committed againſt GOD. GOD is ſo great and excellent a being the ſum of all exiſtence and perfection, that it is infinitely more criminal not to reſpect and love him, than it would be to have no love and regard for the whole creation. And it is in infinitely greater crime
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011295_0014_0F869ECE5CA6E660"/>
to oppoſe and hate GOD, in any way, or in the leaſt degree, than it would be to hate and oppoſe all creatures, and turn an implacable, eternal enemy to them, if this might be, without hating and oppoſing God in any reſpect or degree.</p>
               <p>If a perſon ſhould turn enemy to the whole human race, and with relentleſs hatred, rage and thirſt for blood, ſhould murder his own parents, and all his relations and friends, in the moſt cruel manner imaginable; and ſhould he have it in his power, and go on to murder and deſtroy a whole nation: and ſhould he proceed and actually deſtroy every one of the human race on earth; yea, put an utter end to the whole creation; and then lay violent hands on himſelf, and put an end to his own life: and could this be done, and not imply any rebellion againſt GOD or oppoſition to him, but be conſiſtent with perfect love no him; the crime he would be guilty of in all this would be nothing, in compariſon with the leaſt degree of oppoſition and diſreſpect to GOD: Yea, it would be infinitely leſs than the leaſt motion of heart againſt GOD, or the leaſt defect of perfect love to him for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—It is granted there can be no ſuch thing as is here ſuppoſed; becauſe all hatred and oppoſition exerciſed immediately towards our fellow creatures, is implicitly and really oppoſition to being in general, and ſo is againſt GOD; and it is alſo againſt GOD as 'tis a violation of his command: and therefore the crime of injuſtice, murder, &amp;c. ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily conſiſts in it's being againſt GOD; and not in the injury done to our fellow creatures. This I conclude all with whom I am concerned in this diſpute, will readily grant. I therefore proceed to obſerve further,</p>
               <p>THAT act of ſin and rebellion againſt GOD has immenſely more crime and guilt in it, which is exerciſed and committed directly and immediately againſt Him; than that which is done againſt him me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and more remotely or indirectly. Or every ſin is more or leſs aggravated and criminal, according as it is committed more directly and immediately againſt GOD or not, other circumſtances being alike.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate this it may be obſerved, ſome ſinful exerciſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct are directly and immediately againſt GOD; he is the immediate object againſt which they are committed, and he is in them directly injured and oppoſed. We have an inſtance of this in Pharaoh when he ſaid "Who is the LORD, that I ſhould obey his voice?" And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the people of Iſrael, when they ſaid "The way of the LORD is not equal."</p>
               <p>There are many ſins againſt GOD more indirectly and remotely. Such are acts of injuſtice towards our fellow men. Theſe are ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately againſt GOD, as has been obſerved; but they are directly and immediately againſt our fellow creatures. Such are all thoſe ways and exerciſes of ſin, which have the creature for their direct and immediate object, theſe are more remotely againſt GOD, as they are not directly aimed againſt him but ſtrike at him more indirectly, thro' the creature.</p>
               <p>Now all acts of ſin are more or leſs aggravated and criminal accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are done more or leſs directly againſt GOD, as it has been
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011295_0014_0F869ECE5CA6E660"/>
now explained. An act of direct enmity againſt GOD, and a courſe of direct quarrelling and blaſphemy againſt him is immenſely more cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, than hating and oppoſing a man; tho' this is implicitly and more remotely, and by fair conſtruction againſt GOD.</p>
               <p>If a man murders one of his fellow ſubjects, he hereby acts againſt his prince; he does him an injury and breaks his laws; but his crime would be immenſely greater if he had murdered his prince. If a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant quarrels with his fellow ſervants, and abuſes them, tho' this is an injury to his lord, and a violation of his orders; yet this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable leſs crime than that which he is guilty of, who riſes up im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately againſt his lord in perſon, quarrels with him and ſtrikes him. Theſe inſtances may ſerve in ſome meaſure to illuſtrate the caſe before us: tho' it muſt be remembered there is an infinite odds: as in theſe inſtances, there is ſome proportion between the crime of murdering a fellow ſubject, or abuſing a fellow ſervant, and that of the ſame acts done directly againſt the prince or lord; whereas in the caſe before us there is no proportion, the one being infinitely more criminal than the other.</p>
               <p>LET it be ſtill further obſerved, that thoſe ſins that are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and directly againſt GOD as well as all others, may be many ways greatly aggravated, ſo as to be immenſely more criminal, than the leaſt ſuppoſable ſin of this kind. A perſon's obligations to love God with all his heart, &amp;c. may be vaſtly increaſed by GOD's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, and the great and ſpecial favours he receives from him; by the advantages which he is put under to know GOD and ſerve him, and the light and inſtruction which he enjoys; the great and ſpecial motives, admonitions and reproofs ſet before him, and the variety of means uſed with him to reclaim him. And his ſin in not loving GOD, but perſiſting in impenitence and rebellion againſt him, is criminal in proportion to the increaſe of his obligations by means of theſe things, and others of the ſame kind, that night be mentioned.</p>
               <p>And it muſt be particularly obſerved here, that what GOD has done for the redemption of man by Jeſus Chriſt; and the offers of free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſalvation through him, does aggravate the ſinners guilt in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt GOD, above any thing elſe; and ſinning againſt Chriſt and the goſpel and rejecting and deſpiſing him, are immenſely the biggeſt and moſt criminal acts of ſin againſt GOD, that can be.</p>

All other ſins are ſmall, compared with this of neglecting this great ſalvation with perſevering obſtinacy and contempt, and rejecting and deſpiſing the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011295_0015_0F869ECEB6CF2C78"/>
glorious Saviour, offering himſelf to ſinners in the moſt kind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending manner, and urging them to accept of him as their compleat redeemer, by the moſt powerful motives and arguments imaginable. The devils have never ſinned, nor can they ſin in ſuch an aggravated manner; becauſe they have no ſuch offers, no ſuch ſalvation to reject; no ſuch Redeemer to deſpiſe. What are all the ſins of the heathen world to this? They ſink, as it were, into nothing, when compared with it. What are all the ſins of Sodom to this? No wonder Chriſt tells the inhabitants of Capernaum, who had rejected him, when he offered himſelf to them, that it would be more tolerable in the day of judgment for the moſt abandoned profligates of Sodom, than for them; and tells the 70 when he ſent them to preach the goſpel that the city which ſhould not receive them, ſhould, for this ſin only, let their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct otherwiſe be as it would, receive a heavier doom, than the Sodom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites ſhould for all their abominable, open debauchery and wickedneſs, which cried to heaven, and brought terrible vengeance on their heads.<note n="*" place="bottom">Luk. X. 10,—12.</note> And this view of the caſe gives a very natural and eaſy meaning to Chriſt's words, when he ſays "If I had not came and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin"<note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. XV. 22.</note> All the ſins they could have committed, had not a Saviour appeared and inſtructed them and offered himſelf to them, would have been light, and as nothing, compared with the ſin of hating and rejecting him, which they were now guilty of: And perfectly agreeable to this are the following words of his, "And when he (i. e. the Spirit) is come, he will reprove the world of ſin,—<hi>becauſe they believe not on me.</hi>"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Joh. XVI. 9.</note> Here not believing on Chriſt is repreſented as the greateſt ſin men can be guilty of, ſo that it does, in a ſenſe ſwallow up all other ſins, as not to be mentioned with this, this being the ſum of all. This is the great ſin for which the Spirit will reprove men, when he does his work effectually, and thoroughly convinces of ſin. Hence we may certainly infer that they who ſubmit to this reproof, and are truly convinced of ſin, ſee this ſin to be ſo great that all other ſins are as nothing to it: Therefore that this is the great aggravation of all their ſins, and that in which their guilt and vileneſs principally conſiſts. All the ſin men commit under the goſpel; all the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable uncleanneſs and debauchery, all the murder, profaneneſs and blaſphemy, that men are, or can be guilty of, under the goſpel, have their chief aggravation in this, that they are againſt Jeſus Chriſt, and carry in them unbelief and oppoſition to him; ſo that unbelief itſelf in all the actings and exerciſes of it, is unſpeakably a greater crime, than all this wickedneſs, conſidered in itſelf and not as implying and expreſſing unbelief and rejection of Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable more criminal and vile than all the ſins of Sodom, as they had no opportunity to ſin againſt Chriſt, as goſpel ſinners do. Or, to expreſs it in other words, all the ſins of Sodom, and all the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have been committed by the worſt of men, or that men can poſſibly commit, without being guilty of unbelief and rejecting Chriſt and the goſpel, are incomparably leſs criminal and vile than this ſin of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011295_0015_0F869ECEB6CF2C78"/>
unbelief, or not receiving, but rejecting Chriſt, when he is revealed and offered to men; ſo that when the former are put in the ſcale with latter, they are light and as nothing to this. Who can doubt of this, ſince it is ſo fully and neceſſarily implied, in what Chriſt himſelf has declared more than once? Eſpecially when the reaſon of it is ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to every one who will ſeriouſly attend to the matter. It hence appears certain, even to a demonſtration, that he is the moſt guilty, vile ſinner who exerciſes the greateſt degree of unbelief; or does moſt directly, and in the ſtrongeſt and moſt obſtinate manner, reject Jeſus Chriſt. Whether the awakened, convinced ſinner does this; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his unbelief and oppoſition to Jeſus Chriſt and the goſpel is leſs in the ſtrength and degree of its exerciſe, I ſhall more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider preſently.</p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved yet further, that unbelief, or an impenitent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Jeſus Chriſt now, under the full blaze of goſpel light, and clear convictions of conſcience, is much more criminal and vile, than it was when Chriſt was on earth, becauſe they then had not ſo much light, ſuch a fullneſs of means and advantages, even under the preaching of Chriſt, and in ſight of his miracles, as we now have. This might be eaſily proved, was there need; but I ſuppoſe none will diſpute it. Therefore if unbelief and rejecting him, was ſo great a ſin, and did ſo far out weigh all other ſins in guilt, as to be, as it were, the only ſin, and ſum of all, in compariſon with which all others were hardly to be mentioned; how amazingly great muſt be the guilt of this ſin now; eſpecially in them who have the greateſt advantages, and the moſt light of every kind, and for whom the moſt is done, even all that can be done ſhort of regenerating grace!</p>
               <p>The ſcripture elſewhere ſets the matter in this light, and repreſents the crime of diſregarding Chriſt and rebelling againſt him, when he ſpeaks directly and immediately unto them, as unſpeakably greater, than diſobedience to his word when ſpoken by others,—and ſo that he is not ſo fully and directly in view.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe are the following words, "For if the word ſpoken by angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a juſt recompence of rewards; how ſhall we eſcape if we <hi>neglect</hi> ſo great ſalvation, which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the LORD, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him!"<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. II. 2, 3.</note> Here two things are obſervable,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The great crime ſpoken of, which will iſſue in the moſt awful condemnation and puniſhment, is a bare NEGLECT of the ſalvation offered by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The great and peculiar aggravation of this crime is ſpoken of as conſiſting in the <hi>direct</hi> rebellion againſt Jeſus Chriſt, which this neglect carries in it, as he has himſelf, in his own perſon, revealed and offered this ſalvation to men. This being more direct and immediate rebellion againſt him, than was the diſobedience to a revelation made by angels.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing is ſet in a yet ſtronger light in the ſame epiſtle, "He
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011295_0016_0F869ED3FB774440"/>
that deſpiſed Moſes's law, died without mercy.—Of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God! &amp;c"<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. X. 28, 29.</note> Deſpiſing the law of Moſes was deſpiſing God; but he who deſpiſes Jeſus Chriſt, does more directly ſin againſt him, and therefore ſins in a higher and more aggravated manner.</p>
               <p>This is again ſet in the ſame light, "See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpoke on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we <hi>turn away from him</hi> that ſpeaketh from heaven."<note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. XII. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>They who refuſed Moſes, who ſpoke on earth (by whom are moſt probably meant Korah, Dathan and Abiram, and thoſe who ſinned with them) did rebel againſt Chriſt, but not immediately and directly: they had no thought of oppoſing Chriſt; but intended their oppoſition directly againſt Moſes. They who reject the goſpel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urn away from Chriſt, and directly oppoſe and reject him, who ſpeaks to them from heaven. And this is here conſidered as an unſpeakable aggravation of the ſin of the latter above that of the former. And it is to be here obſerved that the ſin here ſpoken of as the great ſin, and ſo greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by this circumſtance, conſiſts wholly in refuſing, or turning away from Chriſt, of which, every unregenerate ſinner is conſtantly guilty: but more eſpecially awakened, convinced ſinners, to whom Chriſt ſpeaks in a degree and manner he does not to others, even to their conſciences; and who knowingly, and under conviction of what they are doing turn away from him, and refuſe to hear him.</p>
               <p>From this view of things it will follow that the awakened, convinced ſinner, who perſiſts in unbelief and rejection of Jeſus Chriſt, is more guilty and vile in the ſtate and exerciſes of his mind than he was in a ſtate of ſecurity, if he more directly and immediately oppoſes GOD and Jeſus Chriſt, and with as great or greater ſtrength of heart than he did before. And this, I think, will appear to be true beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction or doubt, if the following things are well conſidered.—</p>
               <p>THE ſecure, unawakened ſinner, does not ſin ſo directly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately againſt GOD, as does the awakened, convinced ſinner. GOD is very little in his view and thoughts. It is with him in this reſpect very much as if there was no GOD, and no Saviour. His perfect ſelfiſhneſs, which carries in it oppoſition to GOD and Jeſus Chriſt, is exerciſed not directly againſt GOD and the goſpel; but in ſeeking what appears to him the greateſt good, in the gratification of his ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and luſts; which lead him directly to oppoſe and injure his fellow creatures, in a greater or leſs degree. He may ſin againſt the light of his conſcience in a degree; but then this light and theſe dictates are ſuppoſed to be weak and in a low degree, elſe he would not be a ſecure, unawakened ſinner; for ſo far as a perſon's conſcience is enlightened to ſhew him his ſin and real danger, it muſt give him uneaſineſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſelfiſhneſs itself is neceſſarily averſe to miſery, and he muſt be uneaſy, ſo far as he ſees himſelf expoſed to it. This is the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011295_0016_0F869ED3FB774440"/>
between the ſecure and awakened, convinced ſinner; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is not convinced of his ſin and danger, in any meaſure as it really is, and ſo as to give him any uneaſineſs about it; the latter is in a greater meaſure convinced of both; and the light and dictates of his conſcience, ſhewing the connexion of his preſent ſtate and conduct, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſecure ſinner may indeed have a ſort of conviction of conſcience that what he allows himſelf in is wrong and contrary to God's commands, but has no clear apprehenſions of his ſinfulneſs, and does not reallize it that he is acting againſt God, or that God is angry with him, and will certainly deſtroy him, if he perſiſt in his ways. He only wants to have clear and full conviction of conſcience of this, in order to be an awakened, convinced ſinner.—</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the awakened, convinced ſinner, ſins more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediately againſt God and the Saviour, and in the face of the clear dictates of his own conſcience. If a ſinner's conſcience is only awakened to ſee that the ways of allowed external wickedneſs in which he lives, lead to hell, ſo as to excite him to reform his life, and ſo comes up to the dictates of his conſcience and makes himſelf eaſy; which has been the caſe with thouſands; this is not the awakened, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſinner of which I am ſpeaking. The conſcience of the ſinner I am now attending to is ſo enlightened, that he ſees he muſt periſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unleſs he willingly ſubmits to Jeſus Chriſt and truſts in him, to which he is invited, and urged by the ſtrongeſt motives; and to which he is under indiſpenſable obligations. And under this light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of conſcience he feels himſelf going to a dreadful hell, for his impenitence and unbelief and continuing to reject Jeſus Chriſt and the goſpel, and yet perſiſts in his obſtinacy and moſt daring rebellion againſt God, and horrid abuſe of the moſt worthy, and aſtoniſhingly merciful Redeemer; for which he is convinced he has no excuſe.</p>
               <p>He is now diverted from the purſuit of worldly pleaſures in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of thoſe luſts which urged him on in a ſtate of ſecurity; and his attention is turned more immediately and directly to GOD and the Redeemer; and his heart is exerciſed in direct oppoſition and enmity to the divine character, and the Saviour, and goes into an immediate quarrel with God. It appears therefore that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his reſpect, his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of oppoſition to GOD are immenſely aggravated.</p>
               <p>And it is to be obſerved that his exerciſes of heart, now they are turned directly againſt God and the Saviour, are as ſtrong and vigorous as ever; and he not only oppoſes God more directly, and againſt the clear light of his conſcience; but more ſtrongly, and exerciſes a greater degree of hatred and enmity againſt his character and ways, than he did before. He was an enemy to GOD before, and all his exerciſes and conduct were a mediate and implicit oppoſition to him; even while he had little or no idea of his character, and few thoughts of God. But now the divine character and conduct are in ſome meaſure brought into view, and the attention of his mind is held up to them;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011295_0017_0F869ED52BCA3480"/>
which neceſſarily occaſions a greater degree of the exerciſe of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hatred and enmity, than when the hateful object was leſs in view, ſo long as he is no more reconciled to this character than he was, and the enmity of the heart is not at all abated or weakened. This is the caſe in all inſtances of oppoſition of heart, and fixed enmity to each other's perſons and characters among men. Theſe enemies, while they are out of each other's view, and think little or nothing of each other, will have no direct and poſſitive exertions of hatred and enmity: But let them be brought into each other's view, and come together, and their enmity will riſe into direct and ſtrong exerciſes, and ferment to a high degree. We find it ſo with regard to any thing at which we have a peculiar and fixed diſguſt and averſion, the nearer it is brought to us, and the more it is in our view, the more lively and ſtrong is our averſion to it. And there can be no poſſible reaſon given why it ſhould not be ſo in the caſe before us; yea it is abſolutely impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe. It alſo appears from another conſideration that in this caſe the exerciſes of oppoſition and enmity to GOD and the Redeemer muſt be ſtrong in proportion to the increaſe of light and conviction and the powerful motives which are oppoſed; for it requires a greater exertion of oppoſition to reſiſt greater light and more powerful motives, than it does to reſiſt leſs.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the awakened, convinced ſinner not only exerts himſelf more directly againſt God and the Redeemer than he did in a ſtate of ſecurity; but does this in a much higher and ſtronger degree, on which account his wickedneſs is immenſely increaſed.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be remembered that his ſinfulneſs is not only increaſed in the greater ſtrength and vigor of his oppoſition of heart to GOD and the Saviour; but theſe exerciſes are now more conſtant and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, as the mind is awakened up to the greateſt attention to theſe things, and is more engaged in thoughts and exerciſes, perhaps, than ever it was in a ſtate of ſecurity. And he thinks now a thouſand times more about GOD and Chriſt, &amp;c. than he did; and his exerciſes of heart are proportionably conſtant and numerous. But theſe exerciſes are all againſt GOD and the goſpel; therefore the more conſtant and numerous they are, the more guilty and vile the ſinner is.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the light and conviction of conſcience the ſinner has, not only occaſions more direct acts of oppoſition to GOD, which are alſo more ſtrong, conſtant and numerous, than they could be in a ſtate of ſecurity; but the ſuperior light they have in the awakening and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their conſcience greatly aggravates all their impenitence and oppoſition to GOD. GOD has not only given them an external reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and put them, in common with all others under the goſpel, under advantage to know the truth and obey the goſpel: but has done much more for them. When they were going on ſtupid and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate under this light, he has ordered a light to be forcibly let into their conſciences, and given them a thouſand times more light than they had in a ſtate of ſecurity; and which they never would have had, if GOD had not interpoſed. This muſt be conſidered as a great favor
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011295_0017_0F869ED52BCA3480"/>
and advantage in itſelf, by which they are unſpeakably diſtinguiſhed from ſinners in a ſtate of ignorance, ſecurity and eaſe: Which favour and advantage they ſin againſt and abuſe, by which all their rebellion and obſtinacy in hating and oppoſing GOD and rejecting the goſpel, is immenſely aggravated. So that this diſtinguiſhed light and conviction, being rebelled againſt and reſiſted, becomes the occaſion of an amazing increaſe of guilt and vileneſs, inſtead of making it leſs.</p>

                  </gap> and rebellion in oppoſition to the cleareſt light ſet into their conſciences by God's ſpecial interpoſition, in an uncommon and extraordinary degree.</p>
               <p>Let it be alſo obſerved, that the awakened, convinced ſinner, under all his conviction and external reformation, perſiſts in the neglect of all that God requires of him, and wholly and obſtinately refuſes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in the leaſt degree, as he withholds his whole heart from GOD and Jeſus Chriſt, and neglects and refuſes to love GOD or his fellow men, or to hearken to Chriſt, whom he is commanded to hear and obey by all the authority of heaven. And this neglect of his whole duty is immenſely aggravated by the light and conviction he now has, by which he ſees what is his duty, and what is his intereſt a thouſand times more fully and clearly than any ſecure, unawakened ſinner does. Jeſus Chriſt does now, by all this light and conviction let into his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, "Stand at the door and knock" in a manner and degree, in which he did not before. If this is juſtly conſidered, it will appear that the increaſe of guilt by this means only, is ſo great that no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed reformation in external conduct will in any meaſure balance it, even on ſuppoſition there is as much negative goodneſs as any one is diſpoſed to imagine. All the negative goodneſs that can be ſuppoſed in any external reformation, is immenſely over balanced by the increaſe of poſitive guilt and vileneſs, which now takes place in the convinced ſinner, in the way juſt now mentioned.</p>
               <p>Let it be further obſerved, that this reformation in his external be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and conduct, is not from the leaſt degree of right principle and exerciſe; or becauſe he is at heart more friendly to GOD, or in any degree a leſs enemy; but purely from ſelf-love; even that very ſelf love, in the exerciſe of which, he now ſets himſelf directly againſt GOD, and goes into a courſe of more immediate oppoſition to him. GOD has ordered light and conviction to be given to his conſcience, and has in this way taken him and ſhaken him over hell, and cauſed the fire of his wrath, as it were, to flaſh in his face. This has filled him with terror, and has deadened his heart to all his worldly purſuits, in which before he pleaſed and gratified himſelf. The fears of hell have put a ſtop to all his former courſes, and turned all his attention to his future and eternal intereſt, in the exerciſe of the ſame <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> which in a ſtate of ſecurity urged him into all his overt acts of open or ſecret wickedneſs. And this darling luſt he will not give up, nor is it
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011295_0018_0F869ED604FCF270"/>
abated in the leaſt degree, but he exerciſes it in as high a degree as ever, yea much more ſtrongly, in direct oppoſition to GOD and the Saviour, in all his exerciſes and attempts with reſpect to the ſalvation he deſires. He is reſtrained from the overt acts of allowed ſin he lived in before by nothing but the fears of hell: Take this out of the way, and he will return to his old courſes with more greedineſs than ever. And if he was not afraid of GOD, but really thought he could oppoſe him with impunity and ſucceſs, all his fears and prayers would ceaſe in a moment, and he would go right into allowed, overt acts of direct rebellion and blaſphemy againſt him. This I obſerve, that we may judge more agreeable to the truth, of the reformation of the awakened ſinner: and ſurely if we view this matter in a true light, we ſhall find nothing in the greateſt reformation of this kind, that will in any degree counter-balance the immenſely greater guilt and vileneſs which the awakening and conviction of conſcience that he has fallen under, is the occaſion of.</p>
               <p>His heart is in no reſpect better, more friendly to GOD, or leſs an enemy to him. The principles and motives on which he reforms are really as bad as thoſe, under the influence of which he before went on in open ſin! Yea, they are the ſame, and now his wickedneſs is turned into another channel, and exerciſed more directly and in a higher degree againſt God.</p>
               <p>No external conduct is better or worſe, or has any thing of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nature in it, any further than is connected with the heart, and is conſidered as the expreſſion and effect of the voluntary exerciſes of that. And all the guilt and vileneſs of it lies in theſe exerciſes of the heart. So that every perſon is more or leſs guilty and vile accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the exerciſes of his heart are: and he whoſe heart is not mended, and made better or leſs vile than it has been, is not really reformed at all, whatever alteration there is in his external conduct. If then the heart is yet as unfriendly to God, and oppoſes him as much as ever, yea in a more direct and ſtronger manner, with what propriety can he, upon the whole, be called a reformed ſinner? Mr. M. has made great uſe of this phraſe, THE REFORMED SINNER, and he has conſtantly uſed it ſo that it tends to blind and deceive the reader, who is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to look to the bottom of this matter.</p>
               <p>IF theſe things are impartially conſidered, and we keep in view the high and glorious character of the Mediator, and the aſtoniſhing grace of the goſpel, and the ſtate and character of the ſinner who continues voluntarily to hate, oppoſe and reject the Mediator with all his heart, under the greateſt light and conviction of conſcience, for which he has no more reaſon or excuſe, than he would have for any overt acts of moſt groſs wickedneſs: I ſay, if this matter is well and impartially conſidered, I believe it will appear moſt evident that the awakened, convinced ſinner is much more guilty and vile in the exerciſes of his heart, than he could be, on any ſuppoſition in a ſtate of ſecurity.</p>
               <p>MANKIND do commonly judge quite wrong and contrary to truth in this matter. They over look the great malignity of ſin, and are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011295_0018_0F869ED604FCF270"/>
of that wherein it's guilt and vileneſs chiefly conſiſts, and ſo judge according to outward appearance, and not righteous judgment. It is common for perſons to look upon the leaſt degree of injuſtice towards men in dealing with them; eſpecially if they themſelves are directly injured by it in any degree, to be a greater crime than the higheſt acts of profaneneſs and taking GOD's name in vain a thouſand times, and the former is unſpeakably more odious and vile in their eyes, than the latter. The reaſon is becauſe GOD is very much out of their ſight and thoughts, and they have no real love and reſpect to him; ſo ſee not any real injury done by the latter, or any thing very bad or ſhameful in it; eſpecially when it is very much the cuſtom and faſhion. But they are all ſenſibility to their own intereſt; therefore are ready to hate thoſe who oppoſe and injure them, and look on them as very vile and criminal, even as deſerving eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>There are multitudes who are governed by the prejudices of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or wholly by outward appearance, in their views and judgment of things of this kind: yea, this is very common, if not moſt generally the caſe. By the force of education, and the common ſentiments and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms where perſons live, many practices appear moſt odious, ſhockingly vile and ſhameful, which are really unſpeakably leſs criminal, than other things which appear to them to be innocent, and even commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Inſtances of this are ſo common and apparent, that it is needleſs to illuſtrate it by examples.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. M. has, in much that he has ſaid on this head, applied to the imagination, and to the prejudices of mankind with reſpect to theſe things, as will be obſerved by the attentive reader: which I think, has no tendency to give light, but rather to blind and deceive. He ſeems to be ſenſible of the advantage he has to influence his reader by this way of treating the matter; which appears not only by his taking this method, as has been obſerved, but by his guarding againſt a ſtrict ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the matter by ſound and clear reaſoning and argument, calling it "metaphyſical reaſoning and argument," and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prejudice the reader againſt it, as that which is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon or regarded; as any thing, and even contraries may be proved by it.—But they who will not lay aſide the common prejudices that mankind are under, and a mere warm imagination, and attend cloſely to the dictates of ſound, accurate reaſoning (which I call "me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical arguments" and at preſent know not what elſe Mr. M. can mean by this phraſe) I ſay, they who will not do this, are like to live in darkneſs and deluſion; and to believe any thing, be it never ſo abſurd and contrary to ſcripture and reaſon.</note>
               </p>
               <p>All perſons that are unawakened are wont to judge of themſelves with reſpect to their ſinfulneſs, and the degree of their guilt and vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by their external conduct. Therefore their firſt convictions of conſcience moſt commonly fix upon that, by which they firſt begin to learn their own ſinfulneſs, God's anger with them, and the ſad ſtate they are in. This puts them upon reformation of their ſins, omiſſions,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011295_0019_0F869ED63A4DF2F8"/>
and commiſſions, which now ſtare them in the face as provoking to God and leading to deſtruction. By this they hope to mend their caſe, and become in a great degree innocent, ſo as to remove the curſe of GOD's diſpleaſure. And if they receive no further light and convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will reſt in this, and think all is well. But if they go on to any good degree of thorough conviction, they will ſee things in quite a different ſight, and find that in themſelves which is unſpeakably more criminal than any thing which they ſaw before; that this vileneſs lies in their heart, which is not at all mended by all their external refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and duties.</p>
               <p>I SAY not theſe things with a view to extenuate the guilt and vileneſs of the open profligate, and of theſe open ſins which are juſtly ſhocking and terrible; or to lead any perſons to look on them leſs vile and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than they now do. No, far be it! Theſe ſins are immenſely more heinous and vile than the profligate thinks them to be, or than any one elſe can fully conceive. The ſecure, unconvinced ſinner is guilty and vile beyond, far beyond, any thing he ever imagined; his guilt and vileneſs exceed all thought: But yet all this, viewed in a comparative light, may be little and as nothing, when compared with the immenſely more aggravated guilt of a ſinner, perſiſting in rebellion, impenitence and obſtinacy in oppoſition to the clear light and dictates of his conſcience. Our Saviour's repreſenting the inhabitants of Capernaum as worſe than thoſe of Sodom, is nothing in favor of the open abominations that were practiſed by the latter, nor tends to extenuate their criminalneſs, or encourage ſuch practices; but only ſets the guilt of the former in a true and ſtriking light.</p>
               <p>WHAT has been ſaid on this argument may be in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the following ſimilitude.</p>
               <p>In the diſtant parts of the realm of a great and good prince there lived a man, who was brought up without any true apprehenſions of the character of his prince, or any degree of true affection or regard to him, his government, or any of his ſubjects, but under the influence of directly oppoſite principles. When he grew up, and came to act for himſelf he appeared perfectly ſelfiſh, having no regard to any one, any further than he could anſwer his own ends by him: and therefore hating and oppoſing every one who in his view ſtood in the way of his good and intereſt, which he greedily purſued in the gratification of his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious appetites and luſts. In the eager purſuit of ſenſual pleaſures, riches and honors, he injured many of his fellow ſubjects many ways, and to a great degree. At length they oppoſed him ſo much in his purſuits, that he fell upon them, and killed ſome thouſands, and took their goods as a booty to himſelf. He was often told that theſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices were a groſs violation of the laws of his prince, and that he would one day call him to an account, and puniſh him for it. But he gave very little heed to this; he never entertained a ſerious thought about it, and did not really believe what was told him, tho' he aſſented to it as truth, and never diſputed it in his own mind. Indeed, it was not
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011295_0019_0F869ED63A4DF2F8"/>
often that he had a thought of his prince; tho' he was frequently ſpoken of in his hearing, and his laws were read to him, threatening ſuch practices as he lived in, with the ſevereſt puniſhment: And when he did think of him, he could not realize it that he was angry with him, or would ever puniſh him, as he did not think he had ever done him any hurt, or was in the leaſt unfriendly to him: and as he always took him to be a very kind and merciful prince. Thus he went on in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, ſecurity and eaſe for many years.</p>
               <p>At length the prince ſent a ſpecial officer with orders to apprehend him, confiſcate all his goods and hang him in gibbets, as a monument of his diſpleaſure and vengeance, unleſs he would become a hearty friend to him, repent of his rebellion, and ſubmit to his laws and government as good and excellent, and accept of a free pardon which he was ready to grant thro' the interpoſition of his own ſon, who had interpoſed his own merit with his father in behalf of this rebel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an earneſt interceſſor for him, having himſelf undertaken to make good all the damages this wretch had done to him and his kingdom; which pardon was now freely offered to him without money or price, if he was willing to receive it thro' the interpoſition of this ſon of the prince, and ready to depend wholly upon his merit and worthineſs for it; and give himſelf up to him, conſidered in this character, and be his friend and faithful ſervant to the end of his life.</p>
               <p>Upon his being thus apprehended, and finding what orders were given, his mind was filled with anxiety and diſtreſs in a view of the evil caſe he had brought himſelf into; and forſook his former co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſes immediately, not becauſe he was at heart any more friendly to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubjects, or any better diſpoſed towards his prince, or leſs inclined to rebellion; but merely through the fears and terrors which had ſeized his mind in a view of the terrible puniſhment he was threatened with. He dreaded the puniſhment, and thought of it with horror. But when he conſidered the character and government of the prince, he found himſelf in no degree pleaſed with it, but the contrary. He found he was not willing to accept of a pardon on ſuch terms, and was greatly diſpleaſed with the perſon, character and conduct of the ſon; for in all he had done to procure his pardon, he had juſtified his father, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the rebel to the higheſt poſſible degree. He therefore now went into a courſe of direct oppoſition to the prince and his ſon; and he was ſo far from being willing to accept of the pardon and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance offered, that he rejected the whole with great diſguſt and contempt. And the more he attended to the affair, and conſidered the character of the prince and his ſon, and their treatment of him, the more did his heart riſe in oppoſition to them, and the offers made to him. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in whoſe cuſtody he was, often led him to the place of execution, where he ſaw numbers of rebels hanging and ſlowly expiring in the greateſt tortures; and this ſight filled his ſoul with the greateſt diſtreſs and horror, not knowing but he ſhould be executed immediately, and greatly fearing it: but this did not reconcile him in the leaſt degree to his prince or his ſon, or diſpoſe him to accept of the pardon offered.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011295_0020_0F869ED7089F88E8"/>
He had as great an averſion and oppoſition of heart to the latter as to the former, and this oppoſition was apparent, and exerted with a degree of ſtrength and ſtubbornneſs in proportion to his dread of the evil threatened. And this was alſo the caſe, when he attended to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made him upon his ſubmiſſion; the more he deſired the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance offered, the more ſtrongly did his heart oppoſe the condition.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time his heart was really no more againſt his former practices than ever; he being yet as much as ever under the power of the ſame principles and luſts, which led him to them, in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which he was then. And this was apparent from fact: for the officer gave him his liberty for a few days, upon which all his fears and terrors ceaſed and he thinking the bitterneſs of death was paſt, returned to his former courſes with as much greedineſs as ever; yea, vaſtly more.</p>
               <p>When the officer ſeized him again, his former views and terrors and dread of the prince returned. He was all attention to his caſe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all his thoughts to find out ſome way to eſcape. Could he have found any way to deliver himſelf from the hand and power of the prince; or had it been in his power to dethrone him and his ſon, he would have done it with all his heart. But as he knew this was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, he applied to his prince daily with earneſt petitions that he would pity his caſe, and at leaſt mitigate his puniſhment, offering to ſuffer any thing ſhort of death. He made his great reformation, a plea for pardon and deliverance, and made great promiſes of what he would do, if he would releaſe him from this puniſhment. But when he found all this availed nothing; but was eſteemed by the prince and his ſon as real rebellion againſt them, it being in direct oppoſition to what they inſiſted on, and the fruit of enmity to their character and conduct; and that nothing would do or avail in his behalf but an hearty accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the pardon offered, with a heart friendly to the prince, and ready to juſtify him in all his conduct towards him; and a thankful acceptance of the mediation of his ſon, being heartily willing to be his ſervant for life, as the greateſt priviledge he could think of: I ſay, when he found this to be true, his mind was filled with more dreadful apprehenſions. Yet his heart did not relent and yield at all, and was ſo far from becoming any more friendly to the prince, that it ſwelled with the moſt horrid enmity againſt him; at the ſame time that he was told, and he was convinced in his conſcience, that the prince and his ſon had acted a becoming part, and were amazingly kind to him, and that he was under the higheſt obligations immediately to ſubmit to them, and perfectly without any excuſe for not doing it. In this way of quarrelling directly with the prince and his ſon, and obſtinately refuſing their kindeſt offers, he ſpent many years; 'till the prince reſolved to wait on him no longer, and ordered him to be executed.</p>
               <p>Now, is it not eaſy to determine in which part of this man's life he was moſt guilty and vile? Was he not unſpeakably more ſo in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than in the former, in which he had ſo much more done for him, by which he was brought to ſuch light and conviction of conſcience, and in conſequence of which his heart turned more directly and ſtrongly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011295_0020_0F869ED7089F88E8"/>
againſt his prince, and exerted itſelf againſt him in a much higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of oppoſition and malignity, directly in the face of all this light and conviction, and contrary to the ſtrong and preſſing motives ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to a friendly ſubmiſſion? Would not <hi>he</hi> be juſtly looked upon, as an enemy to the prince and his ſon, or at leaſt to have low thoughts of their character, and to be a friend to the rebel, and take his part, who ſhould ſo much as doubt of this? Much more ſo, if he ſhould take a great deal of pains to repreſent the rebel, when apprehended by the officer, and in the circumſtances and exerciſes that have been deſcribed, as greatly reformed, and much better in the ſtate of his mind, and in a great degree innocent and blameleſs, compared with what he was before.</p>
               <p>And if this is a plain caſe, I ſee not why that before us is not much more ſo.—The difference appears to me ſo great, and the awakened, convinced ſinner to be ſo much more guilty and vile than he was, or could be in a ſtate of ſecurity, that when the matter is juſtly ſtated, I ſee not how any can be at a loſs about it.

               <p>However, if the unregenerate ſinner, as to his abſolute character, is viewed in a juſt light, which I ſuppoſe is that in which he is ſet in this and the foregoing ſections, I have anſwered the great end I propoſed, whether the conſequence is thought to be juſt, or not, with reſpect to his <hi>comparative</hi> guilt and vileneſs. I ſaid what I did on this head in my ſection on means, with a deſign to oppoſe that very notion of an awakened, convinced ſinner which Mr. M. contends for, which is not much different, if at all, from that which Dr. Mayhew had: and which I knew was very common even among profeſſed Calviniſts; which I thought to be directly contrary to the truth, and of a very bad tendency. If therefore what I have ſaid, fully and clearly expoſes and confutes this notion of the ſinner's abſolute character, I have obtained what I chiefly had in view, even tho' it ſhould not be thought to be made evident beyond all diſpute that ſuch an one is more guilty and vile than he could be, or than ſinners generally are, in a ſtate of ignorance and ſecurity. Tho' I confeſs, I know not how any one can have a juſt view of the character and exerciſes of the former, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I conſidered the matter in this comparative view on purpoſe to ſet the guilt and vileneſs of the awakened, convinced ſinner, in a ſtriking light. I find Chriſt took this method to repreſent the great guilt and vileneſs of the inhabitants of Capernaum, and convince them of it. He told them they were more guilty than the inhabitants of Sodom were. This was doubtleſs as ſhocking and offenſive to thouſands, as the compariſon I have made, has been to Mr. M. or any one elſe.

               <argument>
                  <p>THE way which Mr. M. takes to evade ſeveral paſſages of ſcripture, which were referred to in ſupport of what he oppoſes, examined.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN my ſection on means I entered into no laboured proof of what I advanced with reſpect to the increaſe of the guilt of the awakened, convinced ſinner, I only ſtated the character of ſuch in a few words here, having done it more largely in a former ſection,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 100. &amp;c.</note> and then refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſeveral texts of ſcripture, ſuppoſing they proved what I had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted beyond all controverſy, the ſinner's character being allowed to be juſtly ſtated. In all I ſay on this head, I keep in view the ſinner's character, as one who does "continue obſtinately to oppoſe light and truth, and reject the offers of the goſpel."<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 127.</note> Mr. M. does not expreſsly deny this to be true of the awakened ſinner. He indeed gives a quite different character of ſuch, tho' he never once attempts to prove that mine is wrong, or that his is right. And as he builds all his oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me on this mere ſuppoſition, without any proof, it appears to me a very ſandy foundation, which is no way ſufficient to ſupport the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure. He ought in the firſt place to have excepted againſt the character I had given of the awakened ſinner, and proved it not juſt, and then eſtabliſhed his own; and this would have finiſhed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy; for the whole debate between him and me, turns upon this, as it did in that between Dr. Mayhew and me, as has been before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. It will appear, I truſt, on examination, that what Mr. M. has ſaid to ſhew that the ſcriptures I adduced to prove my point are not to the purpoſe is grounded on a ſuppoſition that the character I have given of the convinced ſinner is not true; and therefore that the moſt he ſays here, as well as elſe where, is rather an unfair begging of the queſtion, than a confutation of what I have advanced.</p>
               <p>The paſſages of ſcripture I mentioned are the following, "And this is the condemnation, that light is is come into the world, and men have loved darkneſs rather than light."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Joh. III. 19.</note> "If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Joh. XV. 22.</note> And what Chriſt ſays of thoſe cities wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, and who had the moſt light and inſtruction by his preaching, and yet continued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, viz. that they were on this account more guilty than the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, and even Sodom itſelf.<note n="§" place="bottom">Mat. XI.</note> And St. Paul ſays the goſpel is "a favor of death unto death, in them that periſh." ¶</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:011295_0021_0F869ED84A525580"/>
The general anſwer Mr. M. gives to this, is, that theſe ſcriptures ſay nothing of an awakened, convinced ſinner; nothing of that light which is let into the conſcience, which he calls internal light: but have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect only to what he calls external, objective light; ſo are nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I thought theſe paſſages proved that oppoſing and rejecting the light of the goſpel, and continuing impenitent, obſtinate enemies to Chriſt, in the face of this light, and direct abuſe of it, was unſpeakably the greateſt crime men can be guilty of; that this will be the principal ground of their condemnation, as that in which their guilt chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. And that the awakened convinced ſinner had much more of this light than others let into his conſcience, which he oppoſed and rejected more directly, and with greater ſtrength and obſtinacy, than he did the ſmall degree of light which he had before; and much more againſt the dictates of his own conſcience. From this ſtate of the caſe, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me a plain and undeniable conſequence, that the awakened convinced ſinner is more guilty and vile in the ſtate and exerciſes of his mind than when he was ignorant and ſecure. And it appears in the ſame light to me now. If ſinning againſt and oppoſing the light of the goſpel is the chief aggravation of all ſin, and that in which perſons guilt under the goſpel ſummarily conſiſts; then he who ſins againſt the greateſt and cleareſt light, and that moſt directly, and with the greateſt degree of oppoſition of heart, muſt be the greateſt ſinner. I ſee not that the diſtinction which Mr. M. makes between external, objective light, and internal light, a light in the judgment and conſcience, is any thing to his purpoſe. If two men are under the ſame external revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but one has ſpecial pains taken with him to inculcate the truth revealed, by which his judgment and conſcience is convinced, while the other has really no more light in his judgment and conſcience, than if no revelation had been made: if the chief of their guilt lies in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and rejecting the light of this revelation, ſurely he who has ſo much the moſt light and advantage, muſt be unſpeakably the greateſt ſinner; while he continues wholly to oppoſe and reject it all. The wickedneſs of the latter, his want of love to the truth and oppoſition of heart to it, keeps the light which is ſet before him wholly out of his mind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and this will be the chief matter of his condemnation. The other would have continued as blind and ignorant as he, had not light been forced into his conſcience by ſome extraordinary means, which he now hates and oppoſes in a manner and degree, which the latter has no opportunity to do.</p>
               <p>And now who can be at a loſs which is the greateſt ſinner? Mr. M. repreſents the ſecure ſinner as very criminal in ſinning againſt the light of his conſcience, and by this means, <hi>waſting his conſcience,</hi> as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it: and ſpeaks of this as the great aggravation of all crimes.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 30.</note> This is as really <hi>internal</hi> light as that of the awakened, convinced ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; it being of the ſame nature and kind, and all the difference is in the degree of light. And if ſinning againſt the former is a great crime;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011295_0022_0F869ED89DE84BB8"/>
yea, that in which the guilt of the ſecure ſinner, who goes on in open wickedneſs, chiefly conſiſts; then ſurely the latter is a greater ſinner than the former in proportion to the greater degree of light of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which he ſins againſt. It would be ſtrange indeed, if ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and oppoſing a ſmall degree of light of conſcience, ſhould be very criminal, even the greateſt of all crimes; but ſinning againſt, and oppoſing an immenſely greater degree of light of conſcience, ſhould be quite harmleſs and innocent. But ſo it muſt be, if there is any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this diſtinction which Mr. M. makes. In making this diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he has flatly contradicted himſelf, as has been obſerved: for he allows that oppoſition to this ſame <hi>internal light</hi> and conviction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the unawakened ſinner is the chief aggravation of his crimes. To be conſiſtent with himſelf on this head, he muſt hold that light and conviction of conſcience does in no caſe aggravate the ſins of men; but he is the greateſt ſinner who has the leaſt knowledge and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and whoſe judgment and conſcience dictates nothing at all with reſpect to what is right or wrong: and he is the leaſt guilty, or certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not more, who has the moſt underſtanding and light of conſcience, tho' he abuſes and ſins againſt it all.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour ſays, "That ſervant which <hi>knew</hi> his Lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes. But he that <hi>knew not,</hi> and did commit things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes."<note n="*" place="bottom">Luk.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rced conſtruction of theſe words indeed, to ſay that the meaning is not, that he who actually knows what God requires and neglects to do it in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his judgment and conſcience is moſt guilty, and ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes; but he who is under advantages to know, but does not really know any thing about his Lord's will, ſhall be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with few ſtripes. It is true that he who is under advantages to know the will of God, and yet knows it not, is more guilty and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a greater puniſhment, if he acts contrary to his will, than he who was under no advantages, and had no opportunity to know. Yea, the latter is not guilty at all, ſo does not things worthy of any ſtripes; becauſe in this caſe his ignorance is properly <hi>invincible.</hi> Therefore our Saviour has no reference to ſuch a caſe. But by him that knew not his Lord's will and yet did things worthy of ſtripes, he muſt mean one who is under advantages to know at leaſt in ſome degree and yet does not know. And by him that knew his Lords will, he means one that really and actually, knew it; that is, has internal light, conviction and ſenſibility of conſcience. He then who ſins againſt this light is the greateſt criminal; and the greater is the degree of this light and knowledge, the more guilty and vile he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. M's diſtinction therefore is not only contrary to all reaſon and comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

He who actually knows his Lord's will, let his light and knowledge come how it will, whether in a miraculous way, or by a ſtanding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal revelation; and whether he was brought to underſtand this by ſome extraordinary providence which awakened his attention and rouſed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011295_0022_0F869ED89DE84BB8"/>
his conſcience, or by the influence of the holy Spirit: I ſay let his light and conviction of conſcience come in either of theſe ways, or in any other, if he does not act according to his knowledge, but neglects to come up to the dictates of his conſcience, this light and knowledge unſpeakably aggravates his guilt.</p>
               <p>BUT let us hear what Mr. M. has to ſay to vindicate his diſtinction, and ſhew that, tho' <hi>external light,</hi> does greatly aggravate the guilt of ſinners under the goſpel; yet <hi>internal light of an awakened conſcience</hi> does not. He ſays, <q>They do eſſentially and ſpecifically differ, the one is external, objectively ſet before the mind; the other is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and mental. The former is liable to be utterly rejected with contempt, without any influence upon the conſcience or life. The latter is received into the mind, and allowed by the author in this debate, to have great influence on both, to raiſe conviction, and excite reformation and amendment of life, to the higheſt degree the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are capable of by the common influence of the holy Spirit. And therefore to argue from the one to the other, as if they were the ſame, the reaſoning muſt needs be inconcluſive.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 16, 17.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here are two differences mentioned, which he calls "eſſential and ſpecifical." The firſt is, "One is external—the other is internal and mental." How this difference ſhould make any odds in favor of the latter I can not imagine. To ſuppoſe it does is contrary to all reaſon and common ſenſe, and to the words of Chriſt juſt quoted; as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to himſelf: for he allows that ſins againſt the light and dictates of conſcience, are above all others aggravated, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: but this light is as "internal and mental" as any can be.</p>
               <p>As to the other difference, if by being "received into the mind," he means any thing inconſiſtent with rejecting and oppoſing the truth with contempt, and oppoſite to this, as it is plain that he does, in that he ſets the one in oppoſition to the other; then inſtead of proving any thing, he only begs the queſtion in diſpute, and ſuppoſes that this light reforms the ſinner, ſo that, on the whole, his character is really mended, and that the mind, or heart truly conforms and ſubmits to it in its exerciſes. This is the only queſtion in diſpute; and if this muſt be taken for granted, the diſpute is at an end. Mr. M. has really begged the queſtion in diſpute, thro' his whole book, by ſuch repreſentations as theſe, and thoſe which are more groſsly falſe, without ever attempting to prove that they are juſt. Let his book be ſtripped of this diſguiſe, and moſt he ſays would appear in its true weakneſs. Let Mr. M. or any of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents prove, what he here and every where ſuppoſes and takes for granted, and the debate will be finiſhed; for this is really the only thing in diſpute. Mr. M. here ſays, I allow what he calls "internal light," to have great influence. It is true; but the influence I allow, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to that which he ſpeaks of; viz. That it is the occaſion of exciting direct oppoſition and enmity againſt God and Chriſt, and of a perſon's acting more againſt the light and dictates of his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in neglecting and obſtinately refuſing to do his Lord's will, of which he has a thouſand times more clear and extenſive knowledge,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011295_0023_0F869EDCF4E9FD70"/>
than the ignorant, ſecure ſinner. What Mr. M. means, by internal light having "great influence on the conſcience, I am at a loſs. He does not mean that it <hi>inlightens</hi> the conſcience; for this would be only ſaying that light in the conſcience, is light in the conſcience; for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal light, is the conſcience inlightened. This therefore would be only ſaying nothing; or if it is ſaying ſomething, it is nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If by "influence upon the conſcience," he means any influence by which the heart, or will does in any degree become pliable and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the truth, and obey it; I am ſure I do not, nor ever did "allow" this. Nor had he any right to take it for granted.</p>
               <p>From this difference which he makes, he infers, "that to argue from the one to the other, <hi>as if they were the ſame,</hi> the reaſoning muſt needs be inconcluſive." It is granted they are not the ſame: There is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: I do not "argue from the one to the other, as if they were the ſame: But the argument is from the leſs to the greater If this is the condemnation, if this is the great crime for which perſons under the goſpel will be condemned, that light is come into the world in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal revelation, and they have hated and oppoſed it; then they into whoſe minds and conſciences this light is made to ſhine, ſo that they have a thouſand times more knowledge of the revealed truth than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and hate and oppoſe it more in proportion; are ſinners above all others; and their condemnation will be proportionably greater.<note n="*" place="bottom">But after all, I would obſerve that if what Mr. M. ſays in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was well grounded, and the diſtinction he makes between ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt and abuſing external light, and internal and mental, had any reaſon in it, and was to the purpoſe, (which I think appears to be far otherwiſe) yet before he has done he demoliſhes all he has ſaid here by declaring that they to whom our Saviour ſpoke were awakened, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſinners.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 34, 35.</note> by this he has given up the whole of this pretended argument, having flatly contradicted what he ſo much inſiſted upon here, and in this he has the hiſtory of the evangeliſts on his ſide too. But of this more hereafter.</note>
               </p>
               <p>HAVING conſidered his general anſwer to ſhew that theſe ſcriptures are not to my purpoſe, which he often repeats; I ſhall take notice of ſome other things which he ſays with reſpect to each of theſe paſſages, in order to evade the force of them.</p>
               <p>He ſays of the firſt, "This is the condemnation, &amp;c." <q>Not a word of an awakened, reformed ſinner in the text and context, nothing of internal light, or ſenſibility of conſcience, or any of the effects that might imply it. Nay, the character here given of thoſe ſpoken of, is quite the reverſe of an awakened, reformed ſinner. They are ſaid to practiſe evil, i. e. ſo as the reformed ſinner does not, and to ſhun the light, leſt their evil deed ſhould be reproved, and they called to part with them.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 9.</note>

               </p>
               <p>I have juſt now ſhewn that the ſtrength of my argument from this text does not depend upon its having a direct and immediate reference
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011295_0023_0F869EDCF4E9FD70"/>
to an awakened ſinner; but on ſuppoſition an unawakened ſinner only is meant, the argument from ſuch an one, to an awakened ſinner, is very ſtrong, if the latter hates and oppoſes the light he has, as much, and more than the former. That he does not Mr. M. here takes for granted; ſo that he begs the queſtion again here, as he does from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to end.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee how he proves that theſe words have no reference to an awakened ſinner. He ſays "the character here given of thoſe ſpoken of is quite the reverſe of the awakened, reformed ſinner, they are ſaid to <hi>practiſe evil,</hi> i. e. ſo as the reformed ſinner does not." But of this he has not given the leaſt proof unleſs it be in the repetition of the words REFORMED SINNER, which is a very ambiguous phraſe, as Mr. M. has uſed it here, and every where elſe. There is indeed no ſuch reformed, unregenerate ſinner as he here ſuppoſes, who cannot be ſaid to do evil, and hate the light, and whoſe character is directly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of this. There is no ſuch unregenerate ſinner mentioned in the bible from beginning to end; ſuch a character is the invention of Mr. M. and a thouſand others, in direct contradiction to the whole of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation. It is directly contrary to this paſſage now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Our Saviour ſpeaks of two ſorts of perſons, of diſtinct and directly oppoſite characters, viz. They who do evil and hate the light; and they who love and practiſe the truth, whoſe deeds are wrought in God. And he ſo ſpeaks of theſe, as to exclude any middle character between theſe two extremes; and his words ſtrongly imply that there can be no ſuch perſon. With what face then can Mr. M. dreſs up an awakened ſinner, ſo as not to belong to either of theſe characters in which Chriſt evidently includes all mankind!</p>
               <p>Beſides, Chriſt is here ſpeaking expreſsly of the condemnation that ſhall come on all unbelievers; ſo on all who do not know and love the truth; which appears from the foregoing words with which theſe are connected. "He that believeth not, is <hi>condemned</hi> already. And <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>condemnation.</hi>" &amp;c. Mr. M. it ſeems, has found a ſet of perſons who, though they do not believe on Chriſt, yet are dreſſed in ſuch fine colours, that they will not fall under this condemnation! They are certainly a ſort of creatures which he who ſpoke theſe words knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of.—And it is moſt certain the bible knows nothing about theſe poor, harmleſs, penitent, reformed, humble, obedient, unregenerate ſinners, who do not hate the truth, nor do evil. Nor do any ſuch exiſt in nature, as ſuch a character is the moſt perfect contradiction, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily deſtroys itſelf. They are the creatures of the imagination of a ſet of men in the chriſtian world, with which they have done infinite miſchief to the cauſe of truth and religion.—</p>
               <p>I PROCEED to examine what he ſays on the next ſcripture mentioned; "If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin." I ſuppoſe our Saviour in theſe words repreſents the ſin the Jews were guilty of in hating and rejecting him, when he had come and ſpoken to them, and exhibited his character and the evidence of his divine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in a clear and ſtriking light, to be unſpeakably greater than all
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011295_0024_0F869EDD033C2BB8"/>
their other ſins could be, had he not thus come and ſpoken to them. This ſin was ſo amazingly aggravated, that their other ſins, however great in themſelves, were light and as nothing, and not to be mentioned in compariſon with this. I thought it hence followed with undeniable evidence that the awakened, convinced ſinner, who, under the full blaze of light let into his mind and conſcience, continued to hate and reject Jeſus Chriſt, is unſpeakably more guilty and vile than he was in a ſtate of ignorance and blindneſs when he did not ſee, and ſo could not hate and oppoſe Chriſt as he does now.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. M. objects two things. One is, that the light here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as reſiſted is "merely external, and has no neceſſary relation to, or connexion with an awakened, reformed ſinner."</p>
               <p>This has been juſt now conſidered, as his general objection to all the paſſages of ſcripture now under conſideration. And I hope it has been ſufficiently ſhewn, how weak and groundleſs this is.</p>
               <p>Another thing he ſays to ſhew this text is not to my purpoſe is, that according to our Saviour's own account, the Jews of whom theſe words are ſpoken, "were in a ſtate and temper of their minds, previous to their rejecting the goſpel, more wicked than the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, or even Sodom itſelf."<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 10.</note> This he thinks is evident in that he ſays, the latter "would have repented by the ſame means, which the former rejected. Hence he infers that if they were more wicked than the inhabitants of Sodom, antecedent to their rejecting Chriſt, this their wickedneſs could not with any propriety be ſaid to be little or nothing, compared with what they were now guilty of. Therefore that this cannot be the meaning of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer in the firſt place, that it is by no means evident that when Chriſt ſpeaks of theſe cities wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, as more guilty than Sodom, he has reſpect to the ſins they were guilty of antecedent to his coming and preaching to them, &amp;c. but the contrary is moſt evident. Therefore his conſequence, has no foundation; ſo comes to nothing. But of this I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more particularly preſently.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I ſay, if what he ſuppoſes were true, his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence does by no means follow. Tho' the Jews were worſe than So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, antecedent to Chriſt's coming and preaching to them, it does not follow that they were not immenſely more guilty, in conſequence of the viſit Chriſt made them, than they were before, tho' very guilty then. Their guilt might be vaſtly greater than that of Sodom; and yet they might be put into ſuch circumſtances, and have ſo much greater light, &amp;c. as to increaſe their guilt amazingly; ſo as that in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, their former guilt, ſinks, as it were into nothing, as not to be mentioned with the latter. This is the very light in which this ſame thing is ſet in other paſſages of ſcripture. "For if the word ſpoken by angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward; how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord!"<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. II. 2, 3.</note> Here we ſee the ſin of rejecting Chriſt when he had come, is repreſented as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

expreſſion greater than any diſobedience under the Moſaic diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or before Chriſt came. The words <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation!</hi> are very emphatical, and ſtrongly expreſs the unparallel guilt which they contract, above all others, who reject Chriſt, and the ſalvation offered by him: And are full as ſtrong an expreſſion as the words of Chriſt under conſideration, taken in the ſenſe I have put upon them. But this is expreſſed more ſtrongly yet, if poſſible. "See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, <hi>much more</hi> ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven."<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. XII. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>St. Paul, in order to ſet forth the excellence and glory of the goſpel, as far exceeding the glory of the legal diſpenſation under Moſes, ſays, "For even that which was made glorious, <hi>had no glory</hi> in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth."<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. III. 10.</note> This expreſſion is exactly parallel with the words of Chriſt under conſideration, taken in the ſenſe I put upon them. And it is to be obſerved, that if the diſpenſation opened by Chriſt ſo much exceeded the former diſpenſation in glory, that it may be ſaid to have no glory, in compariſon with this; then it may be with as great propriety affirmed of the ſins under theſe different diſpenſations, that ſins under the former, are no ſins, have no guilt and criminalneſs, in compariſon with ſins under the latter. For deſpiſing and rebelling againſt the latter, is more criminal than deſpiſing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in proportion to the greater glory of the latter.</p>
               <p>The huſbandmen to whom the houſholder let out his vineyard, were very criminal in abuſing the ſervants he ſent to them to receive his due of the fruit; and proceeding to kill ſome of them. But how much more criminal and guilty were they in ſeizing and putting to death his only ſon, when he was ſent to them! This as it were, ſwallowed up all their former crimes, ſo that they are hardly to be mentioned in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with this. In what words could the greatneſs of this crime be better repreſented, than by ſuch an expreſſion as this, "If he had not ſent his only ſon, they had not had ſin; their guilt would have been little or nothing compared with what it is now: For now they have ſeen, and murdered <hi>his only ſon.</hi>" It is common to repreſent the greatneſs of a crime, by ſaying, Such or ſuch a ſin is nothing to this. Or all the wickedneſs he was guilty of before is nothing to this. And is not Chriſt's expreſſion exactly parallel to this? How then can we be at a loſs about the meaning of it?</p>
               <p>This does indeed ſet Jeſus Chriſt in a very grand light; that all the ſins in the world ſhould be nothing to that of rejecting and hating him, when he comes in perſon, and ſpeaks and offers himſelf. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they who have as low and mean notions of him, and as high ones of themſelves as the Jews had, ſhould underſtand them. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then if all ſuch join with Mr. M. and ſay, "Since this <hi>can't</hi> be the meaning, another <hi>muſt</hi> be ſought."</p>
               <p>When we conſider the high and grand character of Jeſus Chriſt the SON OF GOD; his amazing condeſcention and grace in becoming incarnate and living among the Jews—Their high expectations and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011295_0025_0F869EDDBAEDFBB8"/>
deſires of the coming of the Meſſiah—the excellence and amiableneſs of his character—how abundant, clear and plain his public inſtructions were—and what full, bright and awakening evidence he gave, by his ſtupendous works, that he was indeed the SON OF GOD: I ſay, when we well conſider all this, and much more that might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the crime of hating and rejecting him, in thoſe circumſtances, will I am confident riſe ſo high in our view, that there will appear no difficulty in underſtanding the words under conſideration in the ſenſe I have put upon them; and it will, I doubt not, appear that to ſay that this crime does not riſe ſo high above all others, as to juſtify ſuch an expreſſion, thus underſtood; and on this ground to ſeek another mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is very diſhonorable to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In this light therefore I think I have good ground to look on what Mr. M. has ſaid here; eſpecially if we conſider, what is the meaning which he has "ſought," and found. This I will give in his own words. <q>And ſince this can't be the meaning (i. e. the meaning I had put upon the words) another <hi>muſt be ſought.</hi> Which is plainly this, viz. They had not had that ſin of rejecting the clear light of the evidence of the divine miſſion of Chriſt, and ſo of the truth of the goſpel.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 10.</note>
                  </q> That is, if Chriſt had not come and given them opportunity to reject him, they would not have been guilty of rejecting him. This is much the ſame as if he had ſaid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>if they had not been guilty of this ſin, they would not in fact have been guilty of it. Who can think that our divine teacher, who never ſpoke a word but to ſome good purpoſe, took pains repeatedly to inculcate this, which every one knew, without his mentioning it; and if they did not, it is a matter of no importance; ſo that to aſſert it is but mere trifling: Who, I ſay, can imagine this? If Mr. M. will find another ſuch inſtance in the whole bible, or in any author of tolerable ſenſe, he may be excuſed. He was ſurely driven to a hard ſhift that when he <hi>ſought</hi> a meaning to theſe words, he could find no better, if he rejected that which I had given.</p>
               <p>BUT he goes on to ſay, <q>They indeed did it in their hearts; but it lay concealed, hid under the cloak of high pretenſions to ſanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity: But when they acted it out, the cloak fell off, and their wickedneſs appeared to all the world. This acting out the wickedneſs of their hearts, we readily grant, was an aggravation of their ſin. But how comes it to paſs, that all their ſinfulneſs of heart and life</q> (i. e. of the inhabitants of Chorazin, &amp;c.) <q>whereby they were more vile than the idolatrous heathen, and moſt abominable Sodomites, is little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, compared with acting it out in this particular? Is the fountain nothing to the ſtreams? The cauſe nothing to the effect? Is not this to invert the known and eſtabliſhed rules of reaſoning.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here he ſpeaks of theſe Jews, as covering all their wickedneſs under the cloak of high pretenſions to ſanctity; and in the next breath ſpeaks of their wickedneſs of life. So here are a ſet of men, who are guilty of great ſinfulneſs of life, i. e. outward, open wickedneſs; and yet at the ſame time hide all their wickedneſs of heart under high pretenſions to ſanctity. A ſtrange ſort of people indeed! It is to be alſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011295_0025_0F869EDDBAEDFBB8"/>
that he elſe where ſpeaks of theſe very perſons is "<hi>reformed</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who were awakened, brought to conſider, and in a meaſure to <hi>amend their lives.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 34, 35.</note> What then does he here mean by <hi>ſinfulneſs of life?</hi> But if they were never ſo ſinful in their lives, to what purpoſe is it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here, when he is ſpeaking only of ſinfulneſs of heart, of the "foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain" not of the "ſtreams?" Is ſinfulneſs of life the fountain, not the ſtreams; the cauſe, and not the effect?</p>
               <p>As to his two queſtions here, the firſt has been anſwered already. Let theſe be as ſinful in heart and life as Mr. M. ſuppoſes, ſo that "they were more vile than the moſt abominable Sodomites, antecedent to their having opportunity to ſin againſt, hate and reject Chriſt: Yet their acting out the wickedneſs of their hearts in this particular way, had unſpeakably more guilt and vileneſs in it, than all their other ſins put together. To ſay the contrary, is to ſpeak diſhonorably of Chriſt, and contrary to what he has ſaid not only here, but elſewhere, and to other paſſages of ſcripture, as has been ſhewn.</p>
               <p>As to the other queſtion, "Is the fountain nothing to the ſtreams," &amp;c. I anſwer, I ſee not what relation this queſtion has to that which is now in diſpute. What Chriſt ſpeaks of in the words before us are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and exertions of wickedneſs in hating and rejecting him; and theſe he ſays are ſo greatly aggravated, that all the exerciſes and acts of wickedneſs which they would, or could be guilty of, had he not come and ſpoken to them, had been light, and as nothing, compared with theſe: So that what it here ſaid has no relation to wickedneſs of heart, conſidered as diſtinct from all exerciſes of every kind, and antecedent to ſuch; if there is indeed any ſuch wickedneſs of heart in nature. In a word, if by the "fountain," he means that ſinfulneſs of heart and life whereby the Jews were more vile than the idolatrous heathen; then by fountain and ſtreams, cauſe and effect he means the ſame thing; or rather has no meaning at all Their ſinfulneſs of heart and life by which they hated and oppoſed Chriſt, was no more the ſtreams from the fountain, than that wickedneſs of heart and life by which they were more vile than the idolatrous heathen; and the former was as much the fountain and cauſe as the latter. But if by fountain and cauſe here Mr. M. means the wickedneſs of the heart diſtinct from all exerciſes, and antecedent to them, his queſtion is quite foreign to the matter under conſideration; as the words of Chriſt have no relation to this; but to ſinful exerciſes of heart in hating the Father and him. This he ſays was ſuch a high degree of wickedneſs that all ſins they could have been guilty of were as nothing to this.</p>
               <p>His next words are, <q>But what increaſes my ſurprize is, that in the paſſages above quoted from the author, he ſeems to argue that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's being reſtrained from acting out the wickedneſs of the heart in <hi>overt acts,</hi> is as nothing; but what he is in his heart, is all. Whatever particular ways of ſin he has forſaken, &amp;c. yet on the whole he is more vile, &amp;c. And <hi>now,</hi> all the wickedneſs of the heart, whereby the ſinner is diſpoſed to the act, if occaſion offers, is little
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011295_0026_0F869EDE8781FB58"/>
or nothing, if the <hi>overt act</hi> is reſtrained. Does the tables being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, really change the nature of things?</q>
               </p>
               <p>REPLY, Mr. M. here puts the charge upon himſelf, and is the ſole cauſe of increaſing his own ſurprize, and of the contradiction he would faſten upon me, by uſing the words <hi>overt acts,</hi> in an indeterminate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed manner, and ſo as to mean one thing in one ſentence, and quite another in the next I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by <hi>overt acts</hi> are meant external acts of ſin, in diſtinction from the voluntary exerciſes of the heart, I have ſaid that whatever <hi>overt acts</hi> the ſinner is reſtrained from, he may notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be more guilty and vile in acting out the wickedneſs of his heart, in hating and oppoſing Chriſt, under great light and conviction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, than he was when guilty of theſe <hi>overt acts,</hi> in a ſtate of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſecurity. In this ſenſe Mr. M. uſes theſe words in the firſt ſentence, unleſs he abuſes me, and himſelf too. But where is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtence with this, in repreſenting the great ſin of the Jews as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in hating and oppoſing Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that all their <hi>overt acts</hi> of ſin, that they had been guilty of, or could be, without this, were as nothing to it: Is not this perfectly conſiſtent? Every reader who has ſenſe and attention enough to read two plain ſentences, muſt know it is. But Mr M. has uſed the words <hi>overt act</hi> in the laſt ſentence, in quite another ſenſe, as meaning all the exerciſes of the mind whatever, in diſtinction from the dormant principles of the heart, antecedent to all thought, motion or exerciſe, "whereby the ſinner is diſpoſed to act, if occaſion offers." Now I have ſaid nothing about this, thro' the whole ſection he is remarking upon. I ſpeak of no wickedneſs of heart, but what conſiſts in thought and voluntary exerciſe; or the neglect of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exerciſe, when occaſion offers: And therefore make no compariſon between the one and the other. It is Mr. M. therefore that has "turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tables" and confuſed and ſurprized himſelf and his leader, with his own miſtake and inaccuracy.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this paſſage, I would obſerve that Mr. M. by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtreams as nothing to the fountain, meaning by ſtreams overt acts of ſin, has in a great meaſure ſpoiled his <hi>reformed ſinner,</hi> about whom he ſays ſo much, laying a mighty ſtreſs upon his external reformation, as being ſufficient to counterbalance all the greater guilt he contracts by his oppoſition of heart to immenſely more light and conviction than he had. This external reformation now dwindles into little or nothing compared with the fountain of corruption that remains as great, and with as much ſtrength as ever. If he had kept this in view every where, we ſhould not have heard ſo much of his poor, trembling, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſinner;</hi> nor ſo much ſaid in his favor, how oppoſite ſoever is his heart to Jeſus Chriſt and the goſpel.</p>
               <p>I COME now to conſider the other paſſage of ſcripture, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to in ſupport of what I had advanced. It is this, "Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, <hi>becauſe they repented not.</hi> Wo unto thee, Chorazin, Wo unto thee, Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida; for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011295_0026_0F869EDE8781FB58"/>
and aſhes. But I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. And thou Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, ſhalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I ſay unto you, that it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee."</p>
               <p>Mr. M ſays, Chriſt has reſpect here only to the wickedneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> inhabitants of theſe cities were found guilty of ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to his preaching and working miracles among them; by which they had rendered themſelves harder and more unimpreſſible by theſe powerful means, than the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon were. This he thinks to be certain from Chriſt's telling them, that, if the ſame means had been uſed with the latter, they would have repented. And he hence concludes alſo, that the repentance here ſpoken of, for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of which he upbraids theſe cities, and which he ſays the Tyrians and Sidonians would have been brought to by theſe means, was not true repentance, or a repentance which implies any real love to God and hatred of ſin, and turning of the heart from it; but what he calls "a legal repentance, or repentance on natural principles." He thinks this is certain, "ſeeing our bleſſed Saviour well knew, that neither theſe means, which they enjoyed, nor any other means, could ever bring them to a ſaving repentance, without an almighty power exerted in giving a new heart,"<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 12.</note> He therefore gives the ſenſe of this paſſage in the following words. <q>As if Chriſt had ſaid, You have by your own wickedneſs waſted natural conſcience, ſinned away your <hi>moral ſenſe,</hi> and rendered yourſelves more unimpreſſible by the ſame motives and arguments to repentance, ſet in the ſame advantageous light, than the idolatrous Tyrians and Sidonians and therefore on that ſingle account, your ſtate is more wicked than theirs, and you are juſtly expoſed to a more aggravated condemnation in the day of judgment than they.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 12, 13.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this, I take leave to obſerve the following things, 1 It is ſtrange and unaccountable indeed, if Chriſt here ſharply reproves tho inhabitants of theſe cities, for not repenting with a legal repentance, which implies in it no true regard to his character or oppoſition of heart to ſin; and ſays not a word to them for their not coming to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which John Baptiſt, his harbinger and he himſelf, from the beginning of his miniſtry, had been inculcating, and calling them to. John Baptiſt had ſounded an alarm among them all, and loudly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "repentance for the remiſſion of ſins." This was certainly ſaving repentance. And when John was put in priſon, "Jeſus came into Galilee (to theſe very cities) preaching the goſpel of the kingdom of God, and ſaying, The time is fulfiled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: <hi>repent ye, and believe goſpel.</hi>"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mark I. 14, 15.</note> Chriſt had been calling and urging them to true repentance in all his teaching, and by all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. And it is perfectly unaccountable and aſtoniſhing, if he now drops this demand, and ſays not a word to them by way of reproof for not hearkening to his calls and demands, and to what was the language
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011295_0027_0F869EDF3A95A670"/>
of all his mighty works; but reproves and upbraids them ſeverely for ſomething elſe, which he never expreſsly mentioned before, or called them to, but only as it is implied in true repentance; and which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in it no true regard and obedience to him, and leaves them as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a ſtate of miſery and ruin as ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reaſon which Mr. M. gives why our Saviour cannot mean ſaving repentance, is really as much of a reaſon why he cannot mean legal repentance; for he holds that this is not effected merely by means, but the influences of the Spirit of God, are as neceſſary to bring men to legal repentance, as they are to bring them to ſaving repentance. And he repreſents that a very dangerous and hurtful doctrine, that teaches that legal repentance is not produced by the Spirit of God. Mr. M. muſt either eſpouſe this <hi>new divinity,</hi> or his argument will prove that Chriſt did not mean legal repentance, for according to his own doctrine, "Our bleſſed Saviour infinitely well knew, that neither theſe means they enjoyed, nor any other means could ever bring them to" legal repentance, "without an almighty power exerted" by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon influences of the Spirit of God, in a work of awakening and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. His argument therefore is good for nothing, or rather much worſe than nothing; becauſe it proves too much: and he is guilty of groſs ſelf contradiction in uſing it as he does.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The whole of what he ſays here is in direct contradiction to the truth of the caſe, according to the hiſtory the evangeliſts give; and contrary to what he aſſerts elſewhere,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 34, 35.</note> He ſpeaking of what Chriſt ſays of the unclean ſpirit, which is caſt out, and afterwards returns and finds the houſe ſwept and garniſhed, &amp;c.<note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. XII. 43.—45.</note> obſerves, <q>By the houſe empty, ſwept and garniſhed, is repreſented the ſtate of an awakened, reformed ſinner, when wickedneſs as to the actings of it is reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the unclean ſpirit gone out.—This is applied to the Jewiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Even ſo ſhall it be alſo with this wicked generation, i. e. they who were awakened, brought to conſider, and in a meaſure amend their lives by the preaching of John Baptiſt, Chriſt and his apoſtles, and by the mighty works done among them.</q> Here you ſee theſe very perſons are awakened and reformed, and brought to a legal repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by the preaching of John Baptiſt, Chriſt and his apoſtles, and by the mighty works done among them, who he ſays in the paſſage under conſideration, were not awakened, and did not reform by all this preaching, and theſe mighty works: and that this is the very thing of which Chriſt upbraids them, as that in which they appeared to be worſe than the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon. What is now become of his argument to prove that the Jews were worſe than the Sodomites "on this ſingle account" that they were not brought to legal repentance by Chriſt's preaching, &amp;c? He has quite confuted it himſelf, by declaring this was not true of them; but that they did in fact repent. And in this he is ſupported by the hiſtory the evangeliſts give of the matter.</p>
               <p>He therefore has not hit on the true meaning of this paſſage; and "another muſt be ſought."—But I proceed to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:011295_0027_0F869EDF3A95A670"/>
4. If the ſenſe which he has put upon this paſſage ſhould be allowed to be true, however inconſiſtent it is with the evangeliſts, and with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet it ſtands full to the purpoſe for which I quoted it, viz. to prove that they are the moſt guilty and vile who enjoy the moſt light, and rebel againſt it. For if theſe Jews were worſe than Sodom ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to Chriſt coming among them, their greater guilt did not conſiſt in their open profligacy and wickedneſs; for in this Sodom doubtleſs exceeded them: but in their abuſe of greater light and advantages, and by this means bringing themſelves into a more guilty, hardened ſtate.</p>
               <p>But as the caſe ſtands, and as Mr. M. ſays it in fact was, it is exactly to my purpoſe. Here is an inſtance of ſinners "who were awakened, brought to conſider and to amend their lives" who are declared by Chriſt himſelf to be more guilty and vile than the abandoned profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of Sodom, purely becauſe they remained impenitent and rejected him, under all their awakenings, convictions and external reformations.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of theſe cities had been for a long time thoroughly reformed from idolatry, to which their fathers were ſo much given; and were punctual and zealous in attending the inſtituted duties of worſhip and religion. They did not practiſe the abominable vices of Sodom. And they had been greatly alarmed and awakened and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their external conduct by the preaching of John. They flocked to him in crowds, and were baptized, confeſſing their ſins, and earneſtly aſking the important queſtion "What ſhall we do?" And when Chriſt came to preach among them, they flocked to him from all quarters, and heard with great attention, admiration and applauſe; "And Jeſus returned in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> notwithſtanding all this, they did with one conſent reject the meſſage that Chriſt brought to them, and refuſed to repent and believe the goſpel. And for this impenitence and unbelief, perſiſted in, under all this light, awakening, conviction and reformation, and while theſe mighty works were wrought in their ſight; for <hi>this,</hi> I ſay, Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids them, and tells them that "on this ſingle account" notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their convictions, fears and reformations, and attending on his preaching with affection, admiration and applauſe, they were worſe, more guilty and vile than open groſs idolaters, or even Sodom itſelf: And not <q>that they had by their own wickedneſs, waſted natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſinned away their <hi>moral ſenſe,</hi> and rendered themſelves more unimpreſſible by the ſame motives and arguments to repentance, ſet in the ſame advantageous light, than the idolatrous Tyrians and Sidonians.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſaying of our Lord was doubtleſs very ſhocking, offenſive and provoking to the inhabitants of theſe cities; nothing could be more ſo; eſpecially to the Scribes and Phariſees, and to every one who had as favourable an opinion of the "awakened reformed ſinner" who yet perſiſts in impenitence, and obſtinately rejects Jeſus Chriſt, as Mr. M. has. And no wonder if on this occaſion they mentioned all the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011295_0028_0F869EE05D5D45E0"/>
abſurdities of this principle, and uttered all the exclamations, that are found in Mr. M's book, or ſomething like them. "Strange abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity this! Strange divinity indeed! Nor is it in our power to doubt, that the grand enemy of the Meſſiah and precious ſouls, put his hearty AMEN to it. Thrice amazing"!!!</p>
               <p>After all, I cannot think the inhabitants of Capernaum, &amp;c. came up to the character of the awakened, convinced ſinner of which I ſpake. They had not that degree of light, and were not ſo fully convinced in their conſciences that Jeſus was the Chriſt; nor did they ſo clearly ſee their inexcuſableneſs in rejecting him, and the dreadful conſequences to them, &amp;c. as the awakened ſinner does, of whom I ſpeak. But as ſuch a ſinner is as really an impenitent, as they were, and does as fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Jeſus Chriſt as they did; and that under immenſely greater light and conviction of conſcience than they had; <hi>how much more</hi> guilty is he than the Sodomites; or even than the inhabitants of Capernaum, who were themſelves ſo much worſe than thoſe of Sodom!</p>
               <p>WHEN our Saviour ſays to Chorazin and Bethſaida, "If the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes;" I ſuppoſe we are not to underſtand him as aſſerting that this would certainly have been the effect of ſuch means being uſed with the inhabitants of theſe cities, as if he ſpake in the character of the omniſcient God, as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowing what in all caſes would be. But he is here to be conſidered as ſpeaking as a man, (and he was no more than a man in their view to whom he ſpake) and after the manner of men; viewing and judging of this matter according to human appearance and probability. As if he had ſaid, "Who could have thought that you would not repent and believe the goſpel, before whoſe eyes ſuch mighty works have been done for your conviction. If ſuch things had been done among men of the worſt character, even the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, ſurely they would have repented immediately. It would be natural to expect, and be confident that this would be the effect." If the words are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in this ſenſe, they will be very agreeable to ſome other paſſages in the bible "For he ſaid, ſurely they are my people, children that will not lie: ſo he was their Saviour."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. LXIII. 8.</note> Here God is repreſented as putting confidence in his people, that they would be faithful to him, according to their profeſſion, vows and engagements; and ſo is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as ſpeaking only after the manner of men; for as the omniſcient God, he knew they did lie, and would break all their promiſes. The following paſſage, I think is exactly parallel to this under conſideration.—"For thou art not ſent to a people of a ſtrange ſpeech and of an hard language, but to the houſe of Iſrael: not to many people of a ſtrange ſpeech, and an hard language, whoſe words thou canſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: <hi>ſurely, had I ſent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</hi>"<note n="†" place="bottom">Ezek.

               </p>
               <p>Chriſt's deſign was to repreſent to them their folly and obſtinacy in a way that was ſuited to their conviction, and to ſtop their mouths. And what was better ſuited to do it, than to obſerve to them, the confidence

any one would have, before the trial, that thoſe, who in their view were the worſt of men, and whom they held in the higheſt contempt and abhorrence, would have been brought to the deepeſt repentance, by the ſame means under which they had continued obſtinately impenitent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Before I leave this paſſage, I would obſerve, that our Saviour does not ground his aſſertion that it ſhould be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for the inhabitants of theſe Jewiſh cities, upon this, that the former would have repented, had the mighty works been done in them, which were done among the latter. This Mr. M. takes for granted in all he ſays; but I think without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If this had been the caſe, the word would have been "<hi>Therefore</hi> I ſay unto you it ſhall be more tolerable, &amp;c." and not "<hi>But</hi> I ſay unto you, &amp;c." Chriſt tells them that if the ſame means had been uſed with theſe wicked cities, which theſe Jews did moſt ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>minate and condemn, that had been uſed with them, any one would be confident they would have repented; as beſt ſuited to ſtrike conviction into their minds, and make them reflect on their own amazing unreaſonableneſs and obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And then goes on to ſay, "But I ſay unto you, &amp;c." As if he had ſaid, "But, be this as it will, whether they would have repented or not. I have one thing to ſay to you which you may depend upon, as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly certain, However abominably vile and wicked you think theſe cities to be, you are much more guilty than they, and they ſhall have a lighter puniſhment than you, when every thing ſhall be adjuſted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth.</p>
               <p>But let it be remembered that whether I have given the true ſenſe or not, it does not affect the matter in diſpute between Mr. M. and me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for be this as it will, it is certain the ſenſe he has given, in order to oppoſe me, cannot be the right, which I conclude has been ſufficiently proved.</p>
               <p>THE laſt text mentioned muſt now be attended to. "The goſpel is a favour of death unto death, in them that periſh"</p>
               <p>I referred to this ſcripture to prove that all means uſed with ſinners, all light and advantages they have had, and therefore, all light and conviction of conſcience, if they continue impenitent and periſh, will turn againſt them and aggravate their condemnation: and ſaid, <q>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the more light and conviction men have, the more their attention is awakened to the things of the goſpel, and the more means they attend upon, and are uſed with them, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue obſtinately to oppoſe light and truth and reject the offers of the goſpel; the more guilty and vile, and the greater criminals are they in God's ſight.</q> Before I proceed, I beg leave to take notice, that Mr. M. when he quotes theſe words, having tranſcribed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, "While they continue obſtinately to oppoſe light and truth, and reject the offers of the goſpel," ſtops here, and adds "<hi>i. e. while they continue unregenerate, as the author explains himſelf.</hi>" This he ſeems to add out of his great tenderneſs to the awakened, unregenerate ſinner, to qualify my words, as if they ſet the ſinner in too bad a light, and as if to be barely unregenerate, was a more innocent, harmleſs character
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011295_0029_0F869EE0B69A4968"/>
than theſe words repreſented. He puts in this ſoftening expreſſion; as he ſeems to think it, whenever he has occaſion to quote the words in which I repreſent the ſtate and exerciſes of the unregenerate, even under the higheſt awakenings and convictions. A plain evidence this; among an hundred others, that he does not think the awakened, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſinner does obſtinately reject the offers of the goſpel. But why then did he not ſpeak this out plainly, and expreſsly oppoſe me on this foot, which is really the turning point, and the only diſpute between us? He might then perhaps have been more conſiſtent with himſelf whether he had gained his point, or no.</p>
               <p>But let us attend to what he obſerves upon this paſſage of ſcripture, to ſhew that it is not my purpoſe. This is in the following words, <q>Were it never ſo fully conceded, that thoſe that periſh from under the external light of the goſpel, do thereby fall under a more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated condemnation; yet this would be nothing to the author's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; becauſe this may be the caſe with multitudes, that they reject the external light of the evidence of the truth of the goſpel with ſcorn and deriſion, without ever being awakened or reformed by it; ſo the goſpel may be a ſavour of death unto death, unto thouſands that never were one of them a proper ſubject of this debate: becauſe never awakened to reformation and amendment of life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This paſſage is ſomewhat dark to me, I own: But if I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, the meaning is this, Tho' it is granted that the goſpel becomes a ſavour of death unto them that periſh from under it, yet it does not follow that it is ſo to them who are awakened and reformed; becauſe this may be true of thouſands under the goſpel, who do reject it with ſcorn. If any thing is proved by this, I think it is, that the awakened and reformed do not any of them periſh, ſo theſe words have no relation to them; but only to thoſe who reject the goſpel with ſcorn. They, indeed periſh, and the goſpel is a means of aggravating their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. If any of the awakened and reformed <hi>periſh,</hi> then the goſpel is a ſavour of death unto death unto them; for it is ſo to <hi>all</hi> that <hi>periſh,</hi> be they awakened and reformed or not.</p>
               <p>Indeed I do not wonder if Mr. M. thinks the awakened, humbled, reformed, unregenerate ſinner, who honeſtly attempts to be obedient, and lies at the foot of ſovereign mercy as his only hope, does never periſh; tho' he allows there are no promiſes made to ſuch.—Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour divides all under the goſpel into thoſe who do evil and hate the light; and conſequently ſhall fall under an aggravated condemnation: and thoſe who love and obey the truth; and ſo ſhall be ſaved. Mr. M. inſiſts upon it that his awakened, reformed ſinner does not belong to the former claſs, as has been obſerved; therefore will not be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What he ſays here is of the ſame tenor. St. Paul divides all into them that ſhall periſh, and thoſe who ſhall be ſaved, and Mr. M. ſays tho awakened, reformed ſinner is not to be ranked among the former, therefore ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I SHALL finiſh this ſection, when I have taken notice of one paſſage more under this head. Mr. M. ſays,<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 17.</note> "Another miſtaken way is
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:011295_0029_0F869EE0B69A4968"/>
which the author argues his point, <hi>as it appears to me,</hi> is determining the degree of man's wickedneſs, meerly from the degree of light ſinned againſt, without any regard had to the degree of the ſtrength of his bias to ſin."</p>
               <p>I cannot ſay how this happened to <hi>appear</hi> to Mr. M. However, I think it did not "appear to him" from any thing that I have ſaid. To illuſtrate this remark, he ſuppoſes two perſons with different degrees of bias to ſin, under the ſame degree of light; and concludes that he, who has the ſtrongeſt bias, or inclination to ſin, is the greateſt ſinner. This is granted: but I have ſaid nothing that relates to ſuch a caſe. I am ſpeaking of <hi>the ſame</hi> ſinner, having different degrees of light at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times; in which there is no room for the ſuppoſition of different degrees of bias; unleſs we ſuppoſe that his bias to ſin increaſes, as the light of his conſcience does. And this ſuppoſition is ſo far from ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my argument inconcluſive, that it greatly ſtrengthens it. And if I any where ſpeak of two ſinners, repreſenting him as the greateſt, who has the moſt light, it is ſuppoſed that their natural powers, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and bias to ſin, are in all other reſpects equal.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>IN which ſeveral things which Mr. Mills ſays in favor of the negative, are examined.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. MILLS has mentioned ſeveral things which he intends as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt what I have advanced, tho' they are not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, propoſed as ſuch; which as they are perhaps as weighty as any he has offered, and will probably have more influence on the minds of many of his readers to prejudice them againſt me and the doctrine I have advanced, than all he has ſaid in his book beſides; it ſeems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the firſt place to conſider them.</p>
               <p>ONE argument of this kind, which he holds up to view, and harps upon abundantly from the beginning to the end of his piece, is, that the doctrine I advance is NEW. He makes his firſt attack upon me with this weapon. In his firſt ſentence, after he has in his own words ſtated the doctrine he means to oppoſe, he has theſe words.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 5.</note> 
                  <q>I muſt ſay the divinity here exhibited, appears to me <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>new;</hi> never before advanced in the chriſtian world, by any divine of tolerable ſenſe and reputation, ſo far as my acquaintance reacheth.</q> And as he thus begins, he holds up the cry of NEW DIVINITY, to the end of his book.</p>
               <p>This has indeed been often objected to doctrines that have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and many are ſo weak and fooliſh, as to be ready to reject any thing that is propoſed, which is to them ſtrange and new; becauſe NEW, <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi> are with them ſynonymous words. This was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt Chriſt and his apoſtles. This was a grand objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011295_0030_0F869EE6E21AD5C0"/>
the reformation from popery. And it is now a ſufficient objection againſt any doctrine advanced by any divine in the church of Rome, that it is NEW never before advanced, by any of the fathers. And this has always been the cry, whenever there has been any attempt to bring on a reformation in doctrine or manners; "Theſe are <hi>new things,</hi> therefore wrong and not to be received." Mr. M. himſelf has not forgot, I conclude, that he has been often in a way of reproach, called a NEW <hi>light.</hi> And as he has had ſo much to teach him what influence this now has with too many, and muſt be ſenſible that it is quite ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſet them againſt a man and his doctrine, to tell them he has publiſhed ſtrange and new divinity: his making uſe of it as he has done, is not only very weak, but is quite unjuſtifiable and wrong. For this is in a high degree impoſing on ſuch, and confirming them in a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which every public teacher ought to guard againſt, and endeavour to eradicate to the utmoſt of his power; as it can never do any real good, and has proved infinitely miſchievous in ten thouſand inſtances; and will always be improved againſt the diſcovery of new truth, and the increaſe of light and knowledge in the church of Chriſt, which is ſo much predicted in ſcripture, and is ſo greatly to be deſired. And Mr. M. is yet more inexcuſable and culpable, if he has raiſed and kept up this cry of NEW DIVINITY, with a <hi>deſign</hi> to avail himſelf of this too common prejudice among mankind, the more effectually to run down and raiſe the popular cry againſt the man and the doctrine which he had undertaken to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. M perhaps thinks he has given ſufficient caution on this head, in that when he ſpeaks of my doctrine as "quite new" he adds, <q>And therefore requires the <hi>greater caution,</hi> not to admit of other than clear and demonſtrative ſcripture evidence and proof for the confirmation of it.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 7, 8.</note>
                  </q> But what he has aſſerted <hi>here</hi> is directly contrary to truth and all reaſon. We ought always to exerciſe ſo much caution as never to admit any doctrine as true, without good evidence: and all doctrines propoſed to us as true, whether old or new, are to be carefully exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and tried in the light of ſcripture, and not to be received unleſs we judge them ſupported by that unerring rule: and in this enquiry and examination, their being <hi>old</hi> or <hi>new,</hi> ought not to come into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſo as to have the leaſt weight with us, on one ſide or the other. It is no argument at all that a doctrine is true, becauſe it has been long received as ſuch, nor is it the leaſt evidence that a doctrine is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſcripture, that it is "quite new, and never before advanced." And therefore both <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new</hi> are to be examined with <hi>equal</hi> caution, and the latter to be as readily admitted as the former, if it be equally agreeable to ſcripture. And if any one uſes <hi>greater caution</hi> in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admitting one or the other, either becauſe it is <hi>new,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>old,</hi> he ſo far is governed by unſeaſonable prejudice. The word NEW ought not to be mentioned in ſuch an enquiry. Therefore Mr. M. cannot be juſtified in any thing he has ſaid on this head; but is, anſwerable for all the prejudice he has by this means excited in the minds of any againſt the author and doctrine he oppoſes, and for all the odium this outcry has raiſed.</p>

The church has yet been in its infant ſtate as to knowledge. The bible is in no meaſure underſtood, as it will be, when it ſhall be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and thoroughly attended to. Many things which have been held for truth by long preſcription, will be exploded, and new truths will riſe into view. "Many ſhall run to and fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"Every ſcribe which is inſtructed into the kingdom of heaven, is like a man that is an houſholder, which bringeth forth out of his treaſure things <hi>new</hi> and old." And ſhall any one of theſe profeſſed <hi>ſcribes,</hi> raiſe a cry againſt another merely becauſe he brings forth <hi>new divinity!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this charge and out-cry will appear worſe, and more injurious ſtill, if the fact is not true, and the doctrine I have advanced is indeed not <hi>new divinity,</hi> but has been often taught, tho' not juſt in my words, or in ſo expreſs and particular a manner as I have done, by many <hi>old</hi> and noted divines. They have all aſſerted it in effect, who have taught that the ſum of all ſin lies in the exerciſes of the heart, and that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or rejection of Jeſus Chriſt is beyond compariſon the greateſt ſin that men can be guilty of; and that the awakened convinced ſinner does reject Chriſt with as great ſtrength and obſtinacy of heart, as ever, under all his light and conviction, which does amazingly aggravate his ſin. Was it a matter of importance enough to call for it, a volume of collections to this purpoſe from many eminent divines, that have been long dead, might be publiſhed. But this would be labor in vain, as it would not be the leaſt evidence that the doctrine I have publiſhed is true, or afford the leaſt degree of reaſon why it ſhould be received with leſs caution, than if it was in direct oppoſition to all the divines that ever lived. However, for Mr. M's ſatisfaction, and to calm his mind which has been ſo greatly agitated and troubled about this "ſtrange, new divinity," which appeared to him "too ſtrange to be true," I will make a quotation or two from one who, I truſt he will own was a "divine of tolerable ſenſe and reputation.

               <p>Here are not only two of the moſt noted divines in New-England, not againſt me, but expreſsly on my ſide of the queſtion; but calviniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic divines in general, ſo far as Preſident Edwards's judgment is to be relied upon with reſpect to this fact. I have tranſcribed this partly to enlarge Mr. M's acquaintance, that he may no longer be able to ſay, the divinity I have exhibited was <q>never before advanced in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world by any divine of tolerable ſenſe and reputation, <hi>ſo far as my acquaintance reacheth</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>After what I have ſaid above, it will perhaps be needleſs to obſerve, that I do not make theſe quotations becauſe I would not be thought to have publiſhed any thing NEW. I now declare I had much rather pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh NEW DIVINITY than any other. And the more of this, the better, if it be but true. Nor do I think any doctrine can be "too ſtrange to be true." I ſhould think it hardly worth while to write, if I had no thing <hi>new</hi> to ſay. And if I am ſo unhappy as to live in an age in which I muſt be condemned merely becauſe I bring certain <hi>ſtrange</hi> things to their ears, I will appeal from them, and from Mr. M. in particular, to the happy people who ſhall live in the laſt days, who will be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to everyone who has caſt in his mite towards the overthrow of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, however long eſtabliſhed, and the diſcovery of truth, however <hi>new</hi> and overlooked by all generations before: And will look on him as an enemy to the church &amp; to mankind, who has uſed his influence to ſtifle and ſuppreſs every or any <hi>new</hi> truth, becauſe he had never heard or thought of it before.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER argument againſt me is, that the doctrine I have advanced is not only <hi>new,</hi> but directly contrary to the opinion of many eminent fathers and divines; and among the reſt, "the late preſident

                  </gap>ies after the truths of the goſpel. He who pays the leaſt regard to this, or is in any degree influenced by it, gives himſelf up to a very uncertain, fallible guide. And if he is not lead wrong, but believes what is real truth, meerly upon the credit and teſtimony of others, it will be of no more ſaving advantage to him, than if it was not true: for ſuch implicit faith is no better than no faith at all. Beſides, it is a great abuſe of any divine who is dead, to rely upon him, or quote him as an authority, who knew himſelf to be fallible, and would be very ſorry to have his miſtakes received as truth, meerly becauſe he was ſo unhappy as to publiſh them.</p>
               <p>He therefore may be juſtly cenſured who quotes any father, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fathers, as an authority, or of the leaſt weight to ſupport what he holds, or run down what he oppoſes. It is much worſe than child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh trifling; it is an abuſe of the public, and tends to uphold people in that which they are very prone to, and has proved pernicious to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, viz. Relying on the opinion of others, eſpecially thoſe who have had the character of ſound and great divines, without examining for themſelves. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It does not appear evident to me that the divines Mr. M. has quoted againſt me, do ſay any thing really contrary to what I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. If it is an abuſe to quote an author, as an authority to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or oppoſe <hi>any</hi> doctrine; it is yet much more injurious to miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, and produce them to oppoſe a doctrine which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant to oppoſe. Therefore, tho' the matter in diſpute between Mr. M. and me is not in the leaſt degree to be determined by them, and it is really no matter, in this view, on which ſide of the queſtion they are; yet it is but a piece of juſtice to them, to remove the miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, when their words are quoted in a ſenſe which they never meant.</p>
               <p>Mr. M's quotation from the Weſtminſter and Savoy confeſſions, is in the following words, <q>Works done by unregenerate men, although, for the matter of them, they may be things which GOD commands, and of good uſe both to themſelves and others; yet, becauſe they proceed not from an heart purified by faith, nor are done in a right manner, according to the word, nor to a right end, the glory of GOD; they are therefore ſinful, and cannot pleaſe GOD, or make man meet to receive grace from God. And yet their neglect of them is more ſinful and diſpleaſing to GOD.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. M. ſays, "This laſt clauſe, taken in <hi>a compound ſenſe</hi> is denied by Mr. Hopkins." I confeſs I know not what ſenſe that is which he here calls <hi>a compound ſenſe,</hi> unleſs it be a ſenſe compounded of the author's ſenſe and Mr. M's. It does not appear, I think, that this clauſe, taken according to <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> has ever been denied by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:011295_0032_0F869EE8D2233FE0"/>
All they ſay is, that the practice of theſe things which are externally right, is leſs ſinful than the neglect of them would be, other things being equal. And I ſay nothing contrary to this. They do not ſay that he is the leaſt ſinner, leſs guilty and vile in all caſes, and in every inſtance, who attends on thoſe external things, than he might be, in the neglect of them. Nor is this true. A perſon may put on all external ſobriety and religion, out of enmity to chriſtianity, and with a deſign to put himſelf under advantage thereby to overthrow it more effectually. In this caſe I ſuppoſe all will grant, he is as ſinful and vile as if he had lived in the neglect of theſe things. If a perſon believes in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it is wrong and very ſinful for him to attend the externals of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that GOD forbids him to do it, his doing theſe things in this caſe, would be more ſinful in him, than the neglect of them. The paſſage under conſideration (Mr. M. will grant) has no reſpect to ſuch inſtances as theſe; ſo affirms nothing about them. But it has as much reſpect to theſe, as to the caſe I have ſtated in my ſection on means. I ſtate a particular caſe, in which I ſay the unregenerate ſinner is more guilty and vile, even tho' he reforms all external ways of ſin, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms all external duty, than he was when he did not ſo; at the ſame time I expreſsly aſſert that his greater ſinfulneſs does not conſiſt in his reformation of external ſins, &amp;c. but in ſomething elſe, quite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of this. Is this to aſſert attendance on theſe externals is not in itſelf conſidered, other things being equal, leſs ſinful? ſurely no: nor any thing like it. Therefore I do not contradict what the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of divines here aſſert. I do not ſay that the awakened, convinced ſinner, would not be more guilty in continuing in external wickedneſs, and the neglect of external religion than he is in his external refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, &amp;c. but that he is now more guilty and vile, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, than he was in a ſtate of ignorance and ſecurity, whatever alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration there is in his external conduct. How Mr. M. came to think I had denied what is aſſerted in the paſſage quoted, I cannot tell. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he will unfold the matter, when he comes to explain his <hi>compound ſenſe,</hi> until this ſhall be done, I muſt ſay, "no conſequence, and wait for light."</p>
               <p>Before I leave this paſſage, I would juſt obſerve, that tho' it contains nothing in oppoſition to what I have aſſerted, Mr. M. has advanced things in his book, which I think, are directly contrary to it. Here it is ſaid, "They," (i. e. works done by unregenerate men) are ſinful, <hi>and cannot pleaſe GOD.</hi> But Mr. M. ſpeaking of Ahab, ſays the Lord took a <hi>favourable notice</hi> of his doings.<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 31.</note> And he ſpeaks of GOD'S <hi>expreſs approbation</hi> of Jehu, and the congregation of Iſrael in the wilderneſs, for what they did, while unregenerate.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 32.</note> Surely to ſay that the doings and works of the unregenerate <hi>cannot pleaſe GOD,</hi> and to ſay that GOD <hi>takes a favourable notice of them,</hi> and <hi>approves</hi> of them, are as contrary and oppoſite propoſitions as any can be. To ſay that God approves of that, with which he is not, and cannot be pleaſed, is a flat contradiction; and is juſt the ſame as to ſay God cannot be pleaſed with that, with which he actually is pleaſed.</p>
               <p>In this paſſage it is alſo ſaid, that the works and attainments of the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011295_0032_0F869EE8D2233FE0"/>
unregenerate, do not <hi>make a man meet to receive grace from GOD.</hi> Mr. M. in direct oppoſition to this, has laboured thro' ſeveral pages to prove that the unregenerate do by their exerciſes and works get nearer to true grace or holineſs; or in the ſtate of their mind nearer to that of good men.<note n="‡" place="bottom">See P. 24—28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I do not mention Mr. M's oppoſition to "the teſtimony of ſo many calviniſtic divines," as any evidence that he is not right. That he has herein groſsly erred from the truth, I truſt will appear evident enough before I have done; tho' his contradicting theſe divines is no evidence againſt him at all. I obſerve this only to ſhew his ſelf-contradiction, in that he with high approbation quotes a paſſage, as being directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and then repeatedly contradicts it himſelf; ſo that when the matter comes to be examined, it ſtands not at all againſt me; but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>WE will now attend to what he has quoted from Preſident <hi>Edwards.</hi> He ſays, "He is ſo expreſs to the point as if he had wrote on purpoſe to confute the doctrine I am oppoſing." His words are, <q>The exerciſe of natural conſcience is ſuch and ſuch degrees, wherein appears ſuch a meaſure of awakening or ſenſibility of conſcience, tho' it be not of the nature of real poſitive virtue, or true moral goodneſs, yet has a negative moral goodneſs; becauſe in the preſent ſtate of things, it is an evidence of the abſence of that higher degree of wickedneſs, which cauſes great inſenſibility, or ſtupidity of conſcience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That the author in theſe words has no reſpect to the doctrine Mr. M. is oppoſing; and much leſs ſays any thing on purpoſe to confute it, will be evident, if the following things are well conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is not here ſpeaking of that light and conviction of conſcience, which the unregenerate ſinner has in a work preparatory to regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and converſion; but of that ſenſibility, and thoſe dictates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which moſt men have in a greater or leſs degree, even heathen, as well as thoſe that are under the light of the goſpel, which ſuggeſt to them in general what they owe to GOD, and to their neighbours, and the reaſonableneſs of GOD'S law, which may be called the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He is here dealing with thoſe men who inſiſt upon it that theſe dictates of natural conſcience are true virtue, and hence infer that all men are naturally virtuous in ſome degree. He is here giving the reaſon why theſe dictates of conſcience have been miſtaken for true virtue. They with whom he is concerned here, never ſpeak of that peculiar kind and degree of awakening &amp; conviction of conſcience which ſinners under <hi>genuine conviction</hi> have. They are ſo far from miſtaking ſuch conviction for true virtue, that they rather look upon it to be groſs deluſion, grounded on quite wrong and falſe notions of things. Preſident <hi>Edwards</hi> therefore has not this awakening and conviction in view, nor has any reſpect to it in theſe words. Therefore his words do not confute any thing which I have ſaid concerning that, to which they have no reference.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Preſident <hi>Edwards</hi> is here ſpeaking of thoſe dictates of conſcience which are regarded and obeyed, in a great meaſure at leaſt, in the view and apprehenſion of him who is the ſubject of them. Surely he does
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011295_0033_0F869EE901119710"/>
not mean to aſſert that however the dictates of conſcience, are diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, oppoſed and ſinned againſt; yet this conviction is an evidence that he who has them is not ſo great a ſinner, as he who commits the ſame ſins in ignorance, and not againſt his conſcience. If he does, theſe words are as much againſt Mr. M. and almoſt every body elſe, as they are againſt me. But I am ſpeaking of an awakening and ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience, which is perfectly oppoſed and ſinned againſt. It is therefore certain, that he has no reference to the convinced ſinner of whom I ſpeak. And what makes this more certain, if poſſible, is, that when he is expreſsly ſpeaking of ſuch an awakened, convinced ſinner, he repreſents him as guilty of the <hi>moſt heinous kinds of wickedneſs,</hi> and ESPECIALLY <hi>provoking to God,</hi> as has been ſhewn.</p>
               <p>In one word, he here ſpeaks of different perſons, under the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of light and advantages every way. This light makes impreſſions on one, and not on the other. In this caſe it is an evidence that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is not ſo much blinded and hardened by ſin as the latter: ſo is an evidence of an higher degree of ſin in the latter than in the former. But what is this to the awakening and convictions of conſcience which are brought on not by the meer force of external means; but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary influences on the mind, counteracting &amp; repelling the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of that wickedneſs of heart which had before held the mind in blindneſs and ſecurity? Not a word is ſaid about ſuch a caſe as this, therefore nothing to the purpoſe for which Mr. M. has made the quotation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let it be obſerved that the words here quoted, taken in the ſenſe in which Mr. M. underſtands them, are directly againſt himſelf. He ſpeaks of this awakening and ſenſibility of conſcience as taking place in an ordinary and common way, and as common to all in whom it is not weakened and ſuppreſſed, by a courſe of oppoſition to it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not brought on the mind, and wrought in it, by any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the ſpirit of GOD. If therefore he is here ſpeaking of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening and conviction which is preparatory to converſion, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes no ſpecial agency of the ſpirit of God in this, and implicitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it; which Mr. M. repeatedly ſpeaks of as a dangerous error. Mr. M. therefore by quoting theſe words, in the ſenſe he puts upon them, and with approbation, is guilty of ſelf-contradiction, as he was in the former inſtance.</p>
               <p>I COME now to the laſt argument of this kind, which Mr. M. maker uſe of againſt me It is in one word this, That I have joined with SANDEMAN: ſo far at leaſt, as to be on his ſide of the queſtion, and favour what he has advanced, in what Mr. M. undertakes to oppoſe. Of this he takes care to remind the reader in the firſt ſentence, after he has ſtated what he ſays I have aſſerted. <q>I muſt ſay the divinity here exhibited appears to me ſtrange and new, never before advanced in the chriſtian world by any divine of tolerable ſenſe and reputation, ſo far as my acquaintance reacheth; unleſs ſomething of a like complexion is to be ſound in the letters on Theron and Aſpaſio, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to <hi>Sandeman,</hi> who has well nigh condemned all other divines;
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011295_0033_0F869EE901119710"/>
to eſtabliſh himſelf and his party as the only true church of Chriſt upon earth, which, it is ſaid, hath for many ages been concealed in the wilderneſs, but now lately hath appeared in them, agreeable to other enthuſiaſtic viſionaries.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sad indeed, to be guilty of ſaying that which looks like <hi>any thing</hi> "which has been publiſhed by ſuch a man! He has endeavored to keep this in view to the end of his book; and in his concluding pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph ſays, <q>I have not been able to perſuade myſelf, but that ſome things have by him (the author he is oppoſing) been carried too far in favor of what is commonly called the <hi>Sandemanean</hi> error.</q> Thus I am ranked with Sandeman in front and rear. I cannot perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that Mr. M. thought this ought to have the weight of a feather in determining, whether what I have aſſerted is right or wrong. This argument, however will have more influence on the minds of many of his readers than all that he has ſaid beſides. Mr. M. could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of this; and if he has taken this method, and ſaid theſe things with this view, and on purpoſe to raiſe an <hi>odium,</hi> and gain any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to his cauſe by this means, he cannot be excuſed. But of this the reader will judge.</p>
               <p>I know not what foundation or good reaſon Mr. M. had to mention Sandeman's name in this controverſy. Mr. S. ſays not one word, that I have obſerved, relating to this point, in any of his writings: Nor is there any reaſon to conclude that what I have aſſerted is more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, than to Mr. M. I claim no alliance to him, nor he to me, that I know of. I have thought, and ſtill think, that the faith and holineſs which he teaches are not the faith and holineſs which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in the new teſtament; but eſſentially defective, and even op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the whole of divine revelation: ſo quite ſubverſive of true chriſtianity. He has however, ſaid many things very well, and ſome by which many public teachers ſtand juſtly corrected. And if he muſt be branded with holding the Sandemanean error, who agrees with San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deman in any point, or ſays any thing "of a like complexion" with ſomething which he has wrote, who then ſhall eſcape?</p>
               <p>By all I can learn, my ſection on means is no more agreeable to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deman and his followers, than to Mr. M. Mr. M. approves of the nine firſt ſections; but finds great fault with the tenth; and ſo does Mr. Sandeman. Herein they agree. And it would not be a difficult taſk to ſhew that Mr. M. agrees with him in many more points than I do; and there is evidence enough that he has a much better opinion of the man and the religion he teaches than I have: and that Mr. S. is much more friendly to him, than to me, and rather takes his ſide in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between us. What reaſon then had Mr. M. to raiſe ſuch an out-cry through all the country, and inſinuate to the world that I held <hi>the Sandemanean error?</hi> Was it becauſe he knew that this would make many ſtare at me, as ſome dreadful monſter?</p>
               <p>When I have attended to this method Mr. M. has taken in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with me, and the way in which he has managed it, which ſeems almoſt peculiar to himſelf; and how he has not only tacked Sandeman
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011295_0034_0F869EE9C53A0728"/>
upon my back, and took care to keep him faſt there, and held him up in ſight from beginning to end; but has alſo ranked me with Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 45.</note> and Quakers,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 107.</note> yea, with the Devil himſelf:<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 21. Speaking of may books he ſays, <q>Nor is it in my power to doubt, that the grand enemy of Chriſt's cauſe and precious ſouls puts his hearty Amen to it.</q>
                  </note> I ſay, when I have attended to this, it has brought to my mind the method the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man catholics have often taken with Proteſtant martyrs, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be put to death: That is to place a large cap on their head, on which are painted a number of hideous monſters and ugly devils, on purpoſe to raiſe the indignation of the croud againſt them. It is to be obſerved however, that they do this to thoſe only who, they really think, deſerve ſuch treatment, they being in their view as bad, at leaſt, as the devil himſelf: Whereas Mr. M. has done all this to his "DEAR BROTHER, and <hi>worthy author,</hi> and one whom he <hi>highly eſteems.</hi>"</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>IN which Mr. Mills's four arguments to prove the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, are conſidered and refuted.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. MILLS has reduced his arguments againſt what I have advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to four general heads; which I ſhall conſider in the order in which he has placed them.</p>
               <p>His firſt argument is founded on the <hi>abſurdities</hi> which he ſays will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from what I have aſſerted; three of which he particularly mentions.</p>
               <p>The firſt he ſtates in the following words, <q>If the principle advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be true, there is no poſſibility of the profligate ſinner's becoming leſs vicious in the ſtate of his mind, whatever be the wickedneſs he lives in the practice of, by any reformation of life while unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; becauſe reforming in any inſtance ſuppoſes the increaſe of internal light and ſenſibility of conſcience; and then, according to this <hi>new</hi> principle, he is undoubtedly, on the whole, more vile, odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abominable in God's ſight, than he would have been, had he continued ſecure and at eaſe, going on in his ſins.<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 18.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It appears from what I have ſaid already that this is not a juſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from that which I have aſſerted. For, every inſtance of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of life, does not ſuppoſe an increaſe of internal light. The profligate may reform his life from worldly motives, or by the removal of the temptation and opportunity, &amp;c. without having any more light and conviction of conſcience than he had before. Or he may have light and conviction of conſcience enough to lead him to reform his life; and yet not be the convinced ſinner of whom I ſpeak, as has been obſerved before. This therefore is not an abſurdity (if it is one) that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the doctrine I have advanced but is wholly grounded in the miſrepreſentation he has made of it.</p>
               <p>I have indeed aſſerted that the awakened, convinced ſinner which I deſcribe is more guilty and vile in the exerciſes of his mind, than he
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011295_0034_0F869EE9C53A0728"/>
was in a ſtate of ignorance and ſecurity, whatever is his external refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. This is the principle itſelf which I hold. And what Mr. M. mentions as an abſurdity no more follows from this propoſition, than it does from any other that ever was thought of. If there is any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity in the caſe, it lies in the propoſition itſelf: If there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity in this, no abſurd conſequence can be drawn from it; unleſs the abſurdity conſiſts in it's being a forced and unjuſt conſequence. In this ſenſe, I acknowledge, Mr. M. has made out a very ſtrange and monſtrous abſurdity indeed. But as it is one entirely of his own make, I chooſe he ſhould have all the credit of it.</p>
               <p>Is there any abſurdity in ſaying, that a profligate may reform his external conduct in ſuch circumſtances and with ſuch views and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of heart, as on the whole to be more guilty and vile, than he was before? If not, then there is no abſurdity in what I have advanced on this head. I aſſert that it is impoſſible for a ſinner not to grow more guilty and vile than he was before, whatever alteration takes place in his external conduct, if he goes into a courſe of ſtronger and more direct acts of oppoſition to Jeſus Chriſt, contrary to much higher degrees of light and conviction of conſcience, than before. This, I think, has been fully proved: And am ſure it leads to no abſurdity whatſoever. If it is impoſſible that a profligate ſhould reform in any inſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing himſelf into theſe circumſtances; then all perſons unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate do become more guilty and vile in every inſtance of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But where is the abſurdity of this? Is there any abſurdity in ſuppoſing that the abuſe of light and ſinning againſt it, is in all caſes criminal in proportion to the degree of that light; and that the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate do always abuſe all the light they have; and that the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, convinced ſinner is guilty of a much higher abuſe of light than any other perſon can be?</p>
               <p>But before I leave the paſſage now quoted I would particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon two expreſſions in it. He ſays, "there is no poſſibility of the profligate ſinner's becoming leſs vicious <hi>in the ſtate of his mind,—by</hi> any reformation of life." This ſuppoſes that reformation of life has ſome influence on the ſtate of the mind to render the latter leſs vicious: the former preceeding as the cauſe, and the latter following as the effect. This is certainly an abſurdity. All vice lies in the ſtate or exerciſes of the mind; and no external conduct is virtuous or vicious, leſs or more, nor has any relation to the ſtate of the mind, any further than it is the fruit and effect of that. But, paſſing this abſurdity, what he aſſerts here is only this: The profligate is nor leſs vicious in the ſtate of his mind by any reformations of life, ſo long as the ſtate of his mind is not leſs vicious. "Strange abſurdity this, indeed!</p>
               <p>The other expreſſion I would take notice of, is this, "ſenſibility of conſcience." This is a very ambiguous expreſſion. By it ſometimes is meant <hi>tenderneſs of conſcience,</hi> and ſo denotes ſomething good and right in the heart. It ſometimes means only <hi>conviction of conſcience.</hi> This is conſiſtent with the moſt perfect and higheſt degrees of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart. It is never true of the unregenerate that they have any
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011295_0035_0F869EEAF1846828"/>
ſenſibility of conſcience in the former ſenſe; in which ſenſe Mr. M. ſeems to uſe it; and the reader who is not well on his guard will take it in this ſenſe, and ſo be inſenſibly led aſide by it. This expreſſion he often uſes, and always ſo as tends to blind and miſlead. Not with ſuch a deſign I believe; for I conclude he firſt impoſed on himſelf, by putting a ſenſe on theſe words which is not compatible with the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and then impoſed on his reader.</p>
               <p>I am inclined here to tranſcribe the following words, in which Mr. M. endeavours to repreſent the abſurdity he fathers on me in a very ſtriking light, eſpecially as they are a ſpecimen of much of the ſame kind ſcattered thro' his book.— "I appeal to the common ſenſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, Is not this ſtrange divinity? What! is there no poſſibility <q>that the drunkard, the thief, the liar, the profane ſwearer, the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, the murderer and blaſphemer ſhould become, on the whole, leſs vicious in GOD'S ſight while unregenerate, by reforming all this atrocious wickedneſs, tho' on no higher principle than that of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience, awakened by the common influences of the ſpirit, than he would be, continuing in the practice of all this wickedneſs? Strange abſurdity this!</q>

               <p>Here is a loud out-cry indeed! But is there any <hi>reaſon</hi> in it? Is it not rather only an application to the imagination, prejudices and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ignorant and unguarded; and the whole of it a groſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation? It is an eaſy matter thus to harangue, and cry out, O ſtrange! Strange abſurdity this! He has pronounced this an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity repeatedly in very ſtrong terms: But if it really is one, he has not offered the leaſt reaſon to prove it to be ſo, nor ſo much as attempted it. Mr. M. profeſſes to remove as far as poſſible from all <hi>abſtruſe, metaphyſical reaſoning.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 30.</note> By this means, or ſome other, he ſeems to be got far enough from <hi>reaſoning</hi> of every kind. I ſuppoſe I have ſaid enough in the foregoing ſections to ſhew that this is ſo far from being an abſurdity with reſpect to the <hi>convinced,</hi> unregenerate ſinner, that it is a moſt evident and important truth. Let the calm, thoughtful reader ſtop and judge.</p>
               <p>THE next abſurdity is expreſſed in the following words, <q>Another abſurdity ariſing from this <hi>new principle</hi> is, that the more ſtupid, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unconcerned men are, under the goſpel, about what ſins they commit, and what duties they neglect, the leſs vile, odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable they are on the whole in GOD'S ſight.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If Mr. M. had ſaid, that the more blind and ignorant men are under the goſpel, about ſin, and duty, the leſs vile they are in committing thoſe ſins, and omiting the duties; this would indeed not have been a conſequence from what he is arguing againſt; but really the very principle itſelf. And this ſurely is ſo far from being an abſurdity, that it is a ſelf-evident propoſition. Whatſoever is contained in the words now quoted more than this, is a miſrepreſentation. In theſe words, and what follows for the illuſtration of them, it is repreſented as if it followed from what I have advanced that <hi>the more conſcientious</hi> men are, or the more inclined and diſpoſed they are to act agreable to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011295_0035_0F869EEAF1846828"/>
and come up to them, the more vile and odious they are. But I have been ſo far from aſſerting this, or any thing from whence it will follow; that I place the greater guilt and vileneſs of the convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner in his oppoſing and acting againſt the clear light and dictates of his own conſcience, however ſenſible he is of the dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this to him. The reader needs only to keep this in view to ſee how groundleſs all that Mr. M. ſays on this head, is, and that the whole is only a groſs miſrepreſentation.</p>
               <p>But what if ſinners are in ſuch a ſituation, that ſo long as they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue perfect enemies to GOD, and the Saviour, and are diſpoſed to abuſe all light and advantages, and all means uſed with them to bring them to repentance, all means uſed with them, and all light and conviction of conſcience, render their obſtinacy and impenitence more vile and odious? What abſurdity is there in this? Mr. M. has not attempted to ſhew where the abſurdity lies. He has only dreſſed the matter up in ſuch words and phraſes as to keep the truth of the caſe out of view, and miſlead the inattentive reader, and then cries out, "ſtrange abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity this!"</p>
               <p>I COME now to the laſt abſurdity which Mr. M. mentions. <q>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſurdity that ariſes from this principle is, that in an exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> under the goſpel is, in the language of the author, more likely to be ſaved, and in the phraſe of our Saviour, 'near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the kingdom of God,' he is on the whole more vile and odious in God's ſight.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 21, 22.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But where is the abſurdity of this? Mr. M. does not attempt to ſhew wherein the abſurdity lies. It ſeems he thought his calling it an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity was ſufficient to make it paſs for one. It may perhaps with the <hi>unthinkîng</hi> reader who takes Mr. M's advice, and follows his example, in "removing as far as poſſible from all abſtruſe, metaphyſical reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing," that is, as I take it, from all that cloſe, ſound reaſoning, which requires exactneſs of thought, and fixed attention of mind. It will alſo paſs for the greateſt abſurdity with all thoſe who think that GOD is more inclined to ſhew mercy to a leſs ſinner than to a greater; and that the leaſt guilty and vile are more likely to be ſaved than others; and are founding their hopes of their own ſalvation very much in this, that they are "not as other men," not ſo great ſinners, ſo guilty and vile in God's ſight as the ignorant, ſecure profligate. M. M's whole book is ſuited to pleaſe perſons of this ſtamp as he not only goes on this ſuppoſition here, but every where elſe.</p>
               <p>I particularly obſerved in my ſection on means,<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 143, 144.</note> that there is no foundation for ſuch a notion in ſcripture; to which Mr. M. has not ſaid a word. He ought to have ſhewed that what I had aſſerted there was groundleſs and contrary to ſcripture, and not to have taken for granted, what I thought I had proved from ſcripture not to be true, and then to build ſo much upon it. Indeed it is a notion ſo ſhockingly diſhonorable to the ſovereign grace of God, and contrary to the whole goſpel, and has ſuch a direct tendency to exclude every one from all hope, and throw him into abſolute diſpair, who does not with the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011295_0036_0F869EEB471D7110"/>
proud phariſee, think himſelf a leſs ſinner than others in general area that I wonder not at all that Mr. M. choſe rather to keep it, as it were, behind the curtain, than to bring it out to open view, and avow it expreſsly.</p>
               <p>But to attend more particularly to this abſurdity. If there is any in the caſe, it lies in this propoſition, viz. That a greater ſinner, one who is on the whole more vile and odious in God's ſight than another, may be more likely to be ſaved, than that other, and then he himſelf was, when he was not ſo guilty and vile, as he now is: But this is ſo far from containing any abſurdity in it, that all, and even Mr. M. himſelf, will grant it to be true beyond all diſpute. For inſtance, thoſe who live under the goſpel are more likely to be ſaved, than thoſe who live in heatheniſh darkneſs, as all allow. And yet it will be as readily granted that goſpel ſinners are, in general at leaſt, much more guilty and odious in the ſight of God, than the heathen.</p>
               <p>As Mr. M. goes on to illuſtrate this abſurdity by inſtancing in two perſons, brought up under the ſame external light and advantages; one is a ſecure profligate, the other is under great awakenings and convictions of conſcience. The latter he ſays, according to me, is moſt likely to be ſaved; and yet is by far the moſt guilty and odious of the two. Well, what then? There is nothing ſhocking or abſurd in this, more than there is in the caſe juſt now mentioned; unleſs it be in what ariſes from his dreſſing up the latter in an innocent favourable light, and ſetting out the former in moſt monſtrous colours; and then ſuppoſing him to be much more vile and odious than the other: yea, "the moſt vile, odious and abominable ſinner on the face of the whole earth." He repreſents the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the following words, <q>From early childhood he has conſtantly paid ſuch <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to the dictates of conſcience, as hath nouriſhed the greateſt degrees of tenderneſs to regard all duty, and avoid all ſin that can agree to an unregenerate ſtate.</q> In this way of ſtating the matter, Mr. M. has been guilty of two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He has entirely miſrepreſented the matter in diſpute between us, by dreſſing up the awakened, convinced ſinner unregenerate in ſuch fine colours, as do not belong to him: for ſuch an one inſtead of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing and obeying his conſcience, lives in the greateſt ſin, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the dictates of his conſcience, and a thouſand times as much light as others have; and inſtead of paying any "regard to all duty" he has no true regard to any duty at all, as ſuch, but really refuſes to do the whole that God commands. This miſrepreſentation, as has been obſerved, runs thro' the whole of Mr. M. books. I mention this as a ſpecimen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He has hereby really gone off from the point he was profeſſedly attending to, viz. That they who are moſt likely to be ſaved, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably more guilty and vile in God's ſight than they were; and has lead the attention of his reader to quite another thing, viz. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of ſuppoſing the convinced ſinner, ſo much more vile and odious than the other. I think this is indeed to "remove as far as poſſible from all REASONING, abſtruſe, metaphyſical" or any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:011295_0036_0F869EEB471D7110"/>
And thus having quite forgot the argument he was upon, he leads his reader a jaunt into the heathen world to ſhew him who is the vileſt among them, upon my principles. I ſay, he quite forgot the argument he was upon; for among the heathen one is not more likely to be ſaved than another, which was the only point he was now profeſſedly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to. But to paſs this, if we particularly follow him in his ramble, we ſhall find him here guilty of a very groſs abſurdity (I leave it to the reader, whether it does not weigh down all that he attempted to faſten upon me) it is this, he finds a heathen, who "comes up neareſt to the dictates of conſcience," and yet "in failing to come up to his duty he ſins againſt the greateſt light." How he ſins againſt the greateſt light, in not coming up to his duty, who "comes up neareſt to the dictates of his conſcience" it is difficult to ſay.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of this argument, Mr. M. adds, <q>It is needleſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here, that theſe things never did agree to the common ſenſe of mankind; or of the chriſtian world: and to my weak underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I muſt ſay, they ſound too ſtrange to be true.</q> I agree with Mr. M. that this obſervation was <hi>quite needleſs,</hi> ſeeing all the appearance of abſurdities is owing to his departing from the dictates of common ſenſe, to raiſe a ſcare-crow to fright the unwary reader. And whether his taking ſuch pains to frame ſuch abſurdities as theſe, is to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his <hi>weak underſtanding,</hi> of which he ſo often boaſts, or to a miſimprovement of what he has, I leave the reader to judge.</p>
               <p>Mr. MILL'S ſecond argument is from two paſſages of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>The firſt is in there words, "The men of Nineveh ſhall riſe in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with this generation, and ſhall condemn it; becauſe they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold a greater than Jonas is here."<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. XII. 41.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He forms an argument from theſe words in the following manner. The repentance of the Ninevites, upon the preaching of Jonas, ſhall condemn the Jews for not repenting as the Ninevites did, tho' they were under the preaching of Chriſt. Now the repentance of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevites was only a legal repentance, by which they were brought to the ſtate of awakened, convinced ſinners. It hence follows that the awakened, convinced ſinner is not more vile in God's ſight than the unawakened, ſecure ſinner: for then the Ninevites coming to this ſtate, in which they on the whole become more vile, than they were before, even in a ſtate of ſecurity and open wickedneſs, could not condemn the Jews for not repenting as the Ninevites did.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 23, 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. 1. The Ninevites were not awakened, convinced ſinners in the ſenſe in which I ſpeak of ſuch; ſo no argument can be formed from them in this caſe. Mr. M. himſelf ſays, in a marginal note under this argument, <q>They were in the depth of heatheniſh darkneſs, and for any thing we know, had not ſo much as the name of a mediator, to be believed on among them.</q> If this was their caſe they were not capable of that ſin, in which I conſtantly place the greater guilt and vileneſs of awakened, convinced ſinners under the goſpel, viz. in their perſiſting in an impenitent rejecting and hating of Jeſus Chriſt, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the light of their own conſciences. The Ninevites, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:011295_0037_0F869EEC87566EE8"/>
to Mr. M. had no degree of this light and conviction; therefore were not in a capacity to ſin againſt it, and ſo become more guilty and vile, in conſequence of their awakening and conviction. The Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, if Mr. M's account of them is right, acted fully up to the light and conviction of their conſciences, and did all that they knew was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, and that was neceſſary in order to their eſcaping the divine judgments threatened. Mr. M. was ſurely quite inattentive to the caſe before him, and wholly overlooked the character of the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, convinced, unregenerate ſinner under the goſpel, or he would have known that the caſe of the Ninevites was very far from being any thing to his purpoſe; and that the argument he has formed from them, is extremely weak, and altogether inconcluſive.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2d. All that Jonah ſaid to the Ninevites was, "Yet forty days and Nineveh ſhall be overthrown." This was all the light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction he gave them. They believed him, that they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, unleſs they reformed theſe open ſins, by which their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences told them they had provoked God. Theſe they reformed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately: and thus they hearkened to Jonah, as they underſtood him; they believed his words, and they were influenced by them, according to the light and dictates of their conſciences. Chriſt, a greater than Jonah, came to the Jews, with much greater and more ſtriking evidence that he was ſent of God, than Jonah had; but the Jews did not believe him and comply with his inſtructions, invitations and warnings. They did not come to that repentance which Chriſt called them to; but perſiſted in rejecting him. With great propriety then did Chriſt addreſs the Jews in theſe words, "The men of Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh ſhall riſe in judgment with this generation and ſhall condemn it, &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, "The men of Nineveh ſhall be an inſtance by which this generation ſhall be condemned in the day of judgment; for they hearkened to Jonah and regarded him, when he was ſent to them, as they underſtood him; but this generation refuſe to hearken to me, and continue impenitent under all my inſtructions &amp; warnings."</p>
               <p>ANS. 3d. In theſe words our Saviour has no reference to the real, internal character of the men of Nineveh whether they were ſinners in their repentance or not, whether they were, on the whole, more guilty and vile, or leſs than they were before Jonah came among them. All that was to his purpoſe is, that the men of Nineveh hearkened to the preaching of Jonah, and repented viſibly; whereas the Jews did not hearken to Chriſt, but viſibly oppoſed and rejected him. Chriſt ſpeaks of nothing but their external appearance and conduct, without deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining what they were at heart. This is evident from the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following with reſpect to the queen of the ſouth. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not infer that ſhe came to hear the wiſdom of Solomon from any pious and good end, or that ſhe was on the whole leſs vile than if ſhe had not ſeen Solomon and heard his wiſdom, becauſe Chriſt ſays her coming to hear the wiſdom of Solomon ſhall condemn the Jews, who deſpiſed and rejected one ſo much greater than Solomon. She in fact paid more regard to Solomon, than the Jews did to Chriſt, and this was fully to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011295_0037_0F869EEC87566EE8"/>
his purpoſe, let her act from what principles ſhe would, and what ever was the conſequence to her; he having regard only to that which was viſible in her, from the hiſtory of her, and not to that of which we have no account. And in the ſame manner he ſpeaks of the Ninevites.</p>
               <p>THE other paſſage of ſcripture Mr. M. mentions under this argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is what Chriſt ſays to the ſcribe in conſequence of his anſwering the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he was then attending to, "diſcreetly," i. e. underſtandingly, "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." Mr. M. inſiſts upon it, that theſe words muſt mean that tho' he was not a good man; yet he was leſs ſinful in the ſtate of his mind, and ſo nearer the ſtate of a good man, on account of the attainments he had arrived to, than thoſe who were deſtitute of theſe, or than he would have been in their abſence.

               </p>
               <p>His argument to prove that by his being not far from the kingdom of God conſiſted in his being leſs ſinful in the ſtate of his mind, and in this reſpect, not far from the ſtate of a good man, is, that he could not be ſaid to be ſo in any other ſenſe. He particularly ſays, by this cannot be meant, <q>That he was merely more likely to be converted, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had to any of thoſe things, by which; conſidered in themſelves, he was leſs ſinful, ſince 'tis evident from the expreſs letter of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred text, that in what is ſaid of the ſcribe's being nigh or not far from the kingdom of God, reſpect is had to thoſe things, and thoſe only, by which, conſidered in themſelves, he was leſs ſinful.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On this it may be obſerved in the firſt place, that in this he only begs the queſtion, and proves nothing. The queſtion is, in what ſenſe the ſcribe was not far from the kingdom of God, and what Chriſt has reſpect to in theſe words? Mr. M. ſays, he had reſpect to thoſe things, and thoſe only, by which, conſidered in themſelves, he was leſs ſinful; and that "this is evident from the expreſs letter of the ſacred text." But this is the very thing in diſpute. Chriſt has reſpect to the words of the ſcribe, in which he diſcovered his ſentiments to be right with reſpect to a very important truth, and which, if followed in all its juſt conſequences, would lead him to the moſt important doctrines of chriſtianity. But that this orthodoxy in ſpeculation implied any thing with reſpect to the ſtate of his mind, as being more or leſs ſinful, Mr. M. has not proved, but takes wholly for granted, and founds his argument upon it.</p>
               <p>I had ſaid that orthodoxy or right ſpeculative knowledge brings a man nearer to the kingdom of God, or renders him more likely to be ſaved than if he had it not, let the ſtate of his mind, his heart, be more or leſs ſinful. And here is an inſtance to my purpoſe, if Mr. M. rightly underſtands the phraſe, "thou art not far from the kingdom of God." Here is a perſon of whom Chriſt ſays this merely upon his appearing to be right in his ſpeculations in an important point, and the text ſays not a word of any thing elſe. But Mr. M. muſt bring into the account ſomething good in his heart, or at leaſt leſs ſinful, becauſe he could not, upon his plan be nearer the kingdom of God than others without this. But this is to beg the queſtion, as I have obſerved. Mr. M. had obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011295_0038_0F869EECEFF95F40"/>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 22.</note> that to be in my language "more likely to be ſaved," was in the phraſe of our Saviour, to be "nearer the kingdom of God." Had he kept this in view he might eaſily have ſeen in what ſenſe the ſcribe might be nearer the kingdom of God, by the degree of ſpeculative knowledge he appeared to have, without concerning himſelf with the ſtate of his heart, and contriving to make that leſs ſinful, from a text which ſays not a word about it. At leaſt, he ſhould have proved that he could not be nearer the kingdom of heaven in that ſenſe, inſtead of paſſing it over in ſilence, as if there could be no ſuch ſenſe put upon the words.</p>
               <p>But Mr. M. ſeems to take it for granted (for he has not ſaid a word to prove it) that the ſpeculative knowledge which the ſcribe appeared to have, implied ſomething good, or leſs bad and ſinful in the ſtate and temper of his mind. But this is contrary to all reaſon, and to known fact. If he will prove this to be true, that mens hearts are leſs ſinful and come nearer to the temper and exerciſes of good men, in proportion as their judgment and conſciences are convinced, and they advance in right ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative notions of the truths of divine revelation: I ſay, if he will <hi>prove</hi> this, he will gain his point, and entirely overthrow what he has underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to diſpute againſt; Yea, he will confute what St. Paul himſelf has aſſerted. For if men unregenerate in all caſes grow leſs ſinful, as light and conviction of conſcience increaſes, then certainly they are not more guilty and vile: Nor can any one "hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs," as St. Paul ſays many did.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. I. 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It appears therefore in every view that Mr. M. has here only begged the whole of the queſtion in diſpute between us.</p>
               <p>And he has done more than this; he has groſsly contradicted himſelf, and that two ways. He has ſaid,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 61.</note> 
                  <q>It is evident and certain that every degree of <hi>knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. attained by the unregenerate, that is neceſſary, in order to a ſtate of grace and ſalvation, brings them in ſtate one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree nearer to it.</q> But here he takes it for granted a perſon cannot be ſaid to be nearer the kingdom of heaven, on account of his knowledge. Again, he elſe where finds fault with me that I ſpeak of ſpeculative knowledge only, and not of any reformation of the ſinner, as rendering him more likely to be ſaved;<note n="¶" place="bottom">P. 58.</note> where he ſuppoſes there is no connexion between any ſpeculative knowledge of the unregenerate, and any degree of reformation, and that the latter is no ways implied in the former: But here he takes it for granted that ſpeculative knowledge, or light in the underſtanding does imply ſomething good in heart, or a leſs degree of ſinfulneſs, &amp; that it neceſſarily brings a perſon to a ſtate of mind, nearer to that of a good man. Yea, that this is one of thoſe things, by which, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in itſelf, a man is leſs ſinful; for he ſays Chriſt has reſpect to ſuch things <hi>only.</hi> Men who will make ſuch ſuppoſitions, and ſuppoſe and take for granted the whole matter in diſpute, and ground an argument on that, and at the ſame time contradict themſelves ſo many ways, as it were in the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I obſerve, in the next place, upon the paſſage quoted, that he ſays, "'tis evident, that in what is ſaid of the ſcribe's being nigh, or not far from the kingdom of God, reſpect is had to thoſe things, and thoſe things

only, by which <hi>conſidered in themſelves,</hi> he was leſs ſinful." The ſcribe might appear to have many things which, <hi>conſidered in themſelves,</hi> might be leſs ſinful than ſomething elſe, and yet, on the whole, be more ſinful and vile than if he had them not. So that what Mr. M here takes for granted, if allowed him as he has expreſſed it, makes nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The ſcribe might notwithſtanding all this, be, on the whole, more ſinful in the ſtate of his mind, than others, who had not thoſe things, by which, <hi>conſidered in themſelves</hi> they would be leſs ſinful. Suppoſe for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the ſpeculative knowledge which the ſcribe had was one thing by which, conſidered in itſelf, he was leſs ſinful; yet if he hated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Jeſus Chriſt, with all this light and knowledge (which he did, if he was ſtill an unregenerate man) he was, on the whole, a greater ſinner than they who had not this knowledge. I therefore ſtand ready to prove that if the ſcribe was not really a good man, and did not love God, and believe in Jeſus Chriſt, he was on the whole much more ſinful and vile in the ſtate and exerciſes of his mind, than thoſe who were without this ſpeculative knowledge. And I preſume it is impoſſible that any one ſhould find any thing in this text contrary to this.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. in order to make theſe words of Chriſt anſwer his purpoſe, ſuppoſes the ſcribe to be unregenerate, and yet not prejudiced againſt Chriſt, but in an awakened reformed ſtate; and that in this ſtate his heart was leſs ſinful, and not far from a ſtate of grace; and concludes that the kingdom of God means a ſtate of grace. All theſe things he lays as the foundation to build his concluſion upon. All of which have not the leaſt evidence to ſupport them. Surely that muſt be a very weak, flimſy argument which is built wholly on ſuch a number of precarious, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuppoſitions. And he muſt be at a great loſs for ſcriptures to argue from, who can find none more to his purpoſe than this.</p>
               <p>By the kingdom of God here may be meant the goſpel diſpenſation; or the viſible kingdom which Chriſt was ſetting up, as this is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the meaning of this phraſe. And the ſcribe might be a man of true piety on the Jewiſh plan; but had not yet been under advantage to ſatisfy himſelf about the character of Chriſt and his doctrines. If it ſhould be objected to this, that St. Matthew ſays this very ſcribe, aſked Chriſt this queſtion, <hi>tempting him.</hi> I anſwer, this may be underſtood not in a bad ſenſe; it may only mean, that he aſked this queſtion to try him, and ſee what his opinion was on this point, that he might be the better able to form a judgment of him. If theſe words are not underſtood in this ſenſe, they are not conſiſtent with his being <hi>near</hi> the ſtate of a good man, as Mr. M. ſuppoſes him to be. In ſhort, there is as much evidence that he was <hi>quite</hi> a pious, good man, as there is that he was ſo <hi>near</hi> to this as Mr. M. ſays he was, and he has been perfectly arbitrary in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo near the ſtate of a good man, and yet not allowing him to be really good. If he was a good man, the meaning of Chriſt's words to him is, "I find you have ſo much light and knowledge, that you want only to be a little more acquainted with me and my doctrines, in order to be one of my diſciples, a profeſſed member of that kingdom, which the Meſſiah is now about to ſet up."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:011295_0039_0F869EF0DE1A5450"/>
But, after all, it is my opinion, that as we know nothing of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of this ſcribe but what appears in his putting a queſtion to Chriſt, and approving of his anſwer, and making an observation upon it; and it is expreſsly ſaid that the reply of our Lord was grounded entirely on his anſwer, Chriſt has reference to this only, and declares that this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſentiment, in which he appeared to be ſo full and clear, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſo much, and was in ſuch a degree the foundation of all he taught; that he was hereby in a great meaſure prepared to underſtand all the doctrines neceſſary to be known and believed, in order to be a member of his kingdom; and in this reſpect was not far from the kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>But if this is not the true meaning of theſe words, and they muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a nearneſs to a ſtate of grace and ſalvation, there is not the leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that this conſiſted in any good, or leſs ſinful diſpoſition of mind by which he was not far from the temper and exerciſes of a good man, and more diſpoſed heartily to embrace the goſpel, than any other unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, as has been obſerved.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. and others have taken it for granted, that a perſon, in order to be more likely to be ſaved than others; or to be in any true ſenſe not far from the kingdom of God, muſt be in ſome degree well diſpoſed, or leſs inclined to ſin, and leſs oppoſite to God and holineſs, and ſo a much leſs ſinner than others: Hence when they read this text, and find one pronounced not far from the kingdom of God, by Chriſt, they conclude he was a man of a good diſpoſition, almoſt diſpoſed to embrace the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, tho' not one word is ſaid about it in the text.</p>
               <p>On this plan he has the leaſt ground to hope for ſalvation, who views himſelf to be a greater ſinner than others: Yea he cannot reaſonably have any hope until he has a better opinion of himſelf, and thinks himſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any who ſhall finally periſh. And every one who is under the government of the ſame ſpirit, which Chriſt points out in the Phariſee, who went up to the temple to pray, may have high hopes of ſalvation, and ſwell in his confidence that he is not ſo bad as other men. But this notion, ſo far as it is received, will ſtrike death to all the hopes, of every perſon, who is of a different and oppoſite ſpirit.</p>
               <p>And indeed, if the ſcribe by his ſpeculations and the right notions which he appeared to have, was become leſs ſinful and oppoſite to God and the goſpel, and not far from a ſtate of grace, or true holineſs in the ſtate and exerciſes of his heart, which muſt imply, at leaſt, that he was got much above half way to it; no reaſon can be given why he might not ſoon arrive to the ſtate and exerciſes of a good man, by making a little more progreſs in his preſent courſe and advancing in the ſame kind of light and knowledge, and diſpoſition of mind, which he now had in ſuch a conſiderable degree. If he had got ſo near to real holineſs, as not to be far from it, the greateſt difficulty was over, and a few ſteps more in the ſame courſe in which he had hitherto proceeded, would have brought him completely into the kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>Mr. MILLS'S third argument,<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 28, 29, 30.</note> conſiſts in ſtating the matter in diſpute between us, as he ſays, "in a fair light," and then "appealing to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious reader" to judge, who is on the right ſide of the queſtion. This,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011295_0039_0F869EF0DE1A5450"/>
I confeſs, appears to me to be ſomewhat of an odd argument, and to be expreſſed in a very round-about, intricate way: However we muſt make the beſt of it that we can.</p>
               <p>I agree with him that the only point to be determined, as that on which the whole controverſy turns, is, Whether the ſin and guilt, which the awakened, convinced, unregenerate ſinner exerciſes and contracts in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the light and conviction that he has, and which he was not chargeable with in a ſtate of ignorance and ſecurity, are ſo great as to over balance all his external reformations, be they as great as they will, ſo that on the whole he is now more guilty and vile, than he was before, even in the practice of all that external wickedneſs, which he has now forſaken? Mr. M. has not ſtated the point in theſe words; but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this is his meaning.</p>
               <p>I have particularly and largely conſidered this matter in ſome of the foregoing ſections: And I am willing to join iſſue with Mr. M. here, and appeal to the judicious reader, who has carefully attended to what has been ſaid.</p>
               <p>But I muſt beg leave to obſerve that what Mr. M. calls "ſetting this matter in a fair light," is really a groſs miſrepreſentation of it. Of this the "judicious reader" will be ſenſible, without my ſaying a word upon it: but he who is not ſo, will be in danger of being deceived by it. For the ſake of ſuch therefore, I would ſay a few things, to prevent the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which it might otherwiſe have on them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He has not ſet the aggravated ſin and guilt of the awakened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſinner in a true light; or rather has not brought it into view at all, in the whole that he has ſaid. He indeed ſpeaks of "the additional ſin, ariſing merely from that ſenſibility of conſcience, whereby the awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſinner reforms ALL known ſin." But there can be no "additional ſin" in this ſtate of the caſe; for the ſinner is ſuppoſed to act up to the ſenſibility and light of his conſcience, in reforming <hi>all known ſin.</hi> Such an one is either not an awakened convinced ſinner, becauſe he does not know that unbelief and rejecting, having and oppoſing Jeſus Chriſt, is a ſin, and by far the greateſt of which he can be guilty; or he does em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the goſpel, and ſo is not unregenerate. The awakened, convinced ſinner is ſo far from reforming <hi>all</hi> known ſin, that he is conſtantly guilty of a thouſand times more known ſin, than he was, or could be, before he was thus awakened and convinced, and the actual hardneſs and rebellion of his heart is immenſely increaſed. This is kept wholly out of view by Mr. M. Yea, his repreſentation is in direct oppoſition to this; and ſo moſt contrary to the truth. This he has done thro' his whole book, as has been before obſerved. And he here, and every where elſe, puts "ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of conſcience" in oppoſition to "hardneſs of heart," and a "hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtate," which is contrary to the truth, and only tends to miſlead the unwary reader; The awakened, convinced ſinner has as much hardneſs of heart, and is as really in a hard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>d ſtate, as the ſecure ſinner, if by hard heart is meant a rebellious, ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>te heart, which is the meaning of the word in ſcripture: yea, his heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> harder, than it was in a ſtate of ſecurity, as much greater degrees of light and conviction are now let into his mind.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:011295_0040_0F869EF1958BBB58"/>
2. He has not ſet the ſtate of the unawakened, ſecure ſinner in a juſt light. This appears in what has been juſt obſerved of his repreſenting him, as having hardneſs of heart, and being in an hardened ſtate, as differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein from the awakened, convinced ſinner. The ſecure ſinner is indeed in a hardened ſtate, but not more ſo, nor ſo much, as the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed convinced ſinner. The former would be as much awakened, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about himſelf as the latter, had he as much light in his mind and conſcience, but this would not remove the leaſt degree of hardneſs of heart, but be the occaſion of increaſing it.</p>
               <p>Again, he repreſents the ſecure ſinner as committing all his open wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs "preſumptuouſly, not only againſt the light of God's word, but againſt the <hi>clear</hi> dictates of natural conſcience." It is doubtleſs true in general, of ſecure profligates, under the goſpel, that they ſin more or leſs againſt the dictates of their conſcience. But the light and dictates of their conſciences are very weak and faint; and they ſeldom attend to this matter, or think any thing about it, and are not convinced that there is really much harm in what they do. They have no reallizing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, that they ſhall be called to an account for what they are doing, and be puniſhed for it. This muſt be ſuppoſed; for in proportion as their conſciences dictate this, they will be awakened and concerned. They cannot therefore be properly ſaid to ſin againſt the <hi>clear</hi> dictates of natural conſcience. To be ſure they cannot be ſaid to do ſo in diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the convinced ſinner: for, as has been obſerved, the latter ſins a thouſand times as much againſt his conſcience as the former, and againſt immenſely clearer light and dictates of conſcience, both with reſpect to what is ſin, and what are the juſt conſequences of it.</p>
               <p>As to what he ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 30.</note> that he has "<hi>clearly ſhewed</hi> that the degree of wickedneſs in <hi>Chorazian</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> above <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> conſiſted in a greater degree of ſtupidity and hardneſs of heart in the former, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were more unimpreſſible than the latter, the ſame external means and advantages to repent being ſuppoſed:" I truſt the reader who has attended to what I have already ſaid upon this caſe, will not think he has given the leaſt evidence of it.</p>
               <p>MR. MILLS'S fourth argument conſiſts in ſhewing, <q>Of what account theſe characters are with the bleſſed God, and how he treats them in his word and providence, viz. That of the awakened ſinner, brought, tho' on principles of nature, to humble himſelf before God, repent, reform known evils, and conſcientiouſly attend known duties; and that of the ſtout hearted, bold, daring, hardened ſinner, that obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſts in all manner of vitious and immoral pactices, under the ſame external means of light, and againſt the clear dictates of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reader will obſerve in what colours theſe different characters are ſet; and will be ſenſible, I truſt, that there are no ſuch different characters of the unregenerate; which I have endeavoured to ſhew heretofore. The awakened ſinner never does <hi>humble himſelf before God,</hi> but is quite as far from this as the ſecure profligate: Yea, the pride and ſtubbornneſs of the former, is exerciſed in a higher degree, and more directly againſt
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011295_0040_0F869EF1958BBB58"/>
God, than that of the latter. And he does not conſcientiouſly attend known duties: for under <hi>true</hi> convictions, he knows that he really does no duty at all, has never done any thing that God commands, or paid the leaſt obedience to him in one inſtance: And his conſcience tells him of a thouſand times more duty to God, which he with obſtinacy, and knowingly refuſes to do, than the ſecure ſinner ever thought of. And the former appears to be a more <hi>ſtout-hearted, bold, daring, hardened ſinner,</hi> than the latter, as he "obſtinately perſiſts" in the higheſt crimes, the moſt heaven daring ſin that men can be guilty of; and voluntarily goes on in the way to deſtruction, with his eyes, as it were, wide open, and under all the awakenings and terrors of his conſcience, in a view of the awful conſequence of his rebellion, and in the ſight of an angry God, and dreadful hell.</p>
               <p>But let us attend to the argument. He goes on to ſay, <q>If we can find clearly of what account theſe characters are with the omniſcient God, we ſhall find what they really are, and a more ſure ground to form our judgment concerning them, than all our weak reaſonings can otherwiſe furniſh us with. I ſhall therefore touch on a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of each kind, as exhibited in the holy ſcriptures.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe I have already ſufficiently ſhewed from the ſcripture, how theſe characters ſtand in God's ſight. However we will attend to Mr. M's inſtances; for I doubt not we ſhall get ſome light hereby.</p>
               <p>HE firſt undertakes to produce inſtances "of awakened, humbled, reformed ſinners. He inſtances in Ahab, Jehu, the Ninevites, and the children of Iſrael at Mount-Sinai. Of Ahab he obſerves, that when he rent his cloaths, &amp;c. in conſequence of the terrible meſſage delivered to him by the prophet; the Lord <hi>took this favourable notice of it,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the evil threatned; "ſeeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me? Becauſe he humbleth himſelf before me, I will not bring the evil in his days."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings XXI. 25, 29.</note> He appeals to all, whether it can be ſuppoſed that Ahab was not leſs ſinful and vile, when he thus humbled himſelf, ſince God <hi>takes ſuch favourable notice of it,</hi> and out of reſpect to this, defers the evil threatned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He alſo obſerves concerning Jehu, that <q>it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from God's <hi>expreſs approbation,</hi> and the beſtowment of ſo great, tho' outward favor, becauſe he had done well, that in God's account, his obedience, tho' but the matter of duty, upon principles of nature, was leſs wicked than a total diſregard to GOD'S command would have been.</q> And his argument is to the ſame purpoſe from the caſe of the Ninevites, whom God ſpared, and granted them a great ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of reſpect to their repentance, which he concludes was not a gracious repentance</p>
               <p>Upon this the following things may be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If God granted favors to Ahab and Jehu, and a great deliverance and ſalvation to the Ninevites purely out of reſpect to their repentance and good deeds, while they were impenitent, unbelievers, and enemies to God and his Son the Mediator; then he may and does ſhew favor to ſinners out of reſpect to what they are in themſelves, their exerciſes and doings, and without any relation and reſpect to Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011295_0041_0F869EF2036B3A98"/>
Therefore if there was no ſuch Mediator he might ſhew favors to ſinners, take a favourable notice of their doings, and expreſs and manifeſt his approbation of them, and purely out of reſpect to this ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his puniſhments, and grant them pardon and ſalvation. For if he grants a leſs good, a leſs deliverance and ſalvation, out of reſpect to their character and doings, becauſe they have done well, or have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs ſinful, than they were; he may as well grant a greater good, even pardon of all ſin and eternal ſalvation, out of reſpect to this; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they ſhould become really virtuous and obedient, from the higheſt and beſt principles. If Ahab, for inſtance, obtained the divine approbation, and God's favorable notice, ſo as to have the awful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned, ſuſpended, and removed from him, only by becoming in ſome degree leſs ſinful, in being filled with fears of temporal evil, while he remained yet an enemy to God; how much higher muſt he have riſen in God's favor, had he truly repented and humbled himſelf before God and returned to obedience from the nobleſt principles, lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God with all his heart and ſoul! Surely, if what he did, was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to abate God's anger towards him, and obtain his approbation and favor ſo far as to remove the heavy judgment from him which was threatened; had he made advances in his goodneſs, ſo as to become perfectly friendly and obedient to God, it would have been ſufficient; quite to remove God's anger, and atone for all his paſt ſins, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure God's higheſt approbation and favor. The ſame obſervation is juſt when applied to Jehu and the Ninevites.</p>
               <p>If Ahab abated the divine diſpleaſure againſt him, and obtained God's approbation and favor in any degree, by the alteration of his character and conduct, and purely on this account; Then this did ſo far atone for his ſins, and render his perſon, and character, the whole taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, leſs diſpleaſing, and more acceptable to God. What need then did Ahab ſtand in of the atonement and merit of a Mediator, in order to obtain the acceptance of his perſon, and pardon of his ſins, and the favour of God? He had obtained this in ſome degree purely by his own reformations and doings; and nothing could be in the way of his obtaining it in as high a degree as he needed, if he went on in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and obedience to higher degrees. Therefore no ſinner wants any other atonement and righteouſneſs in order to obtain pardon and ſtand compleat in God's favor, but what is contained in his own refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and obedience.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr M. in his zeal in the cauſe of his awakened, reformed, humbled ſinner, has quite ſapped the foundation of the doctrine of atonement by a mediator; and ſo has overthrown the whole goſpel, and repreſented Chriſt as dying in vain! He has done this, I believe, without deſign, not really knowing what he was about, as many others have done before him: but he, and every one elſe, may be challenged to ſhew the need, the propriety and wiſdom of the atonement which Chriſt has made, if ſinners out of Chriſt, wholly unconnected with him and his enemies, may abate the divine diſpleaſure, and obtain God's approbation and favor purely by their own reformations and doings and wholly out of reſpect to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:011295_0041_0F869EF2036B3A98"/>
This is what the awakened ſinner is at heart deſiring and ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nothing would pleaſe him better, than to obtain God's approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and favour by his own reformation and doings. He always will be of this diſpoſition as long as he views himſelf in the light Mr. M. ſets Ahab, and till he deſpairs of becoming any better or leſs ſinful in this way. And never was one reconciled to the way of ſalvation by Chriſt, till he was not only convinced in his judgment, and conſcience, that what Mr: M. has here advanced is not true, but hates and deteſts ſuch a notion, in his heart.</p>
               <p>I therefore ſcruple not to ſay, that Mr. M. has in the paſſages I am conſidering, exalted the ſinner, and eſpouſed his cauſe, at the expence of the honor and glory of the Mediator and ſaviour of ſinners. Yea, that if what he has here advanced is true, Chriſt is dead in vain, and ſinners are in an infinitely leſs guilty, miſerable ſtate, than the preaching of the croſs of Chriſt, and the atonement by him ſuppoſes them to be. Mr. M. having obſerved concerning the Ninevites, that tho' their repentance did not "proceed from a principle of ſaving grace, yet a great ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is beſtowed <hi>out of reſpect to it,</hi> and their repentance was made the <hi>only condition</hi> of their great ſalvation," adds the following words, <q>And can it agree to the purity of God's nature, to make a greater degree of wickedneſs, on the whole, the condition of beſtowing a great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, tho' of an outward nature? Sure it cannot, ſince this would be to manifeſt ſome regard to ſin, and encourage men to practice it with boldneſs.</q> I think it may be alſo with as much propriety aſked, can it agree to the purity of God's nature to make <hi>a leſs degree of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi> the condition, &amp;c.? If <hi>wickedneſs</hi> is made the condition, it ſeems to be no great matter, whether it be greater or leſs. Surely to make any degree of wickedneſs the condition, "would be to manifeſt <hi>ſome</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſin and ſo far encourage men to practice it." But, what is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſe, to make the reformations and doings of the ſinner <hi>the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> of any ſalvation, and to grant it <hi>out of reſpect to theſe,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to Chriſt, his merit and righteouſneſs, is to ſet aſide and deſtroy all law and moral government, and to manifeſt infinitely leſs hatred of ſin, and to favour it and the ſinner infinitely more, than becomes the majeſty of heaven; and nothing could tend more to <q>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men to practice it with boldneſs.</q> I therefore proceed to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="2">2. A very natural and eaſy meaning can be put upon theſe paſſages, conſiſtently with the doctrine of atonement, and the glory of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and as conſiſtently with the principle, in oppoſition to which Mr. M. has attempted to ſet them. God in his conduct towards theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in what he ſays of them, has reſpect only to what was viſible, to their external appearance and conduct: So nothing can be inferred from this with reſpect to their hearts, whether they were more or leſs ſinful.</p>
               <p>Ahab humbled himſelf before God in his appearance and viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and put on the external appearance and profeſſion of a true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and God who acted not as the ſearcher of hearts and final Judge,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:011295_0042_0F869EF2BA744B60"/>
in his treatment of the church and people of Iſrael, out as their viſible head and civil governor, and treated them according to their external appearance and profeſſion: I ſay, God in this character, ſpeaks of Ahab and treats him according to his external appearance and conduct, i. e. as if he had been a true penitent, whether he was really ſo or not, or whether he was ſincere or only played the hypocrite. God treated A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab in this caſe, as he did Joſiah afterwards on the appearance and profeſſion he made of repentance and reformation, and renouncing the ſin of his fathers. God uſes much the ſame language to him on this occaſion, by Huldah the propheteſs, as he does to Ahab; "Becauſe thine heart was tender, and thou didſt <hi>humble thyſelf</hi> before God, when thou heardſt his words againſt this place, and againſt the inhabitants thereof, and <hi>humbledſt thyſelf before me,</hi> and didſt rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have heard the alſo, ſaith the Lord. Behold I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither ſhall thine eyes ſee all the evil that I will bring upon this place."<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Chron. XXXIV. 27, 28.</note> God treated Ahab as he has obliged profeſſing chriſtians to treat one another. If one falls into groſs external ſin, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon their dealing faithfully with him, returns and ſays he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, i. e. puts on this appearance and profeſſion, they are to forgive him, and treat him as a true penitent, whatever his heart may be, and tho' he may wickedly diſſemble in the whole, and his pretenſions to repentance be really more criminal than the conduct of which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to repent.</p>
               <p>Thus God dealt with the church and people of Iſrael. When they in profeſſion and appearance gave themſelves up to God, and ſolemnly promiſed, "all that the Lord hath ſaid, we will do and be obedient." He is repreſented as relying on their promiſe, and treated them as if they were ſincere and hearty in this profeſſion and appearance. "He ſaid, ſurely they are my people, children that will not lie: So he was their Saviour;"<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſai.

"At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and deſtroy it: if that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, <hi>turn from their evil,</hi> I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them."<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Jer.

Theſe words are therefore conſiſtent with his being the greateſt ſinner, in the nation at that very time; and moſt odious and abominable in

God's ſight, in all he did, it being all taken together, nothing but a piece of high-handed wickedneſs. This was doubtleſs the real truth of the caſe; for at bottom he was no more of a friend to Jehovah than to Baal: and while he was pulling down Baal, and deſtroying his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, and executing vengeance on the houſe of Ahab, he was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf up, and regarding only himſelf, in oppoſition to Jehovah; and all his pretences of "zeal for the LORD" were nothing, but groſs hypocriſy. Who then can think that Jehu was leſs ſinful and vile in God's ſight now, than before, as Mr. M. repreſents him to be? And when GOD ſays of the children of Iſrael at Mount-Siani, "They have well ſaid all that they have ſpoken,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. V. 28.</note> he has reference to their words and profeſſion only, and nothing is ſaid about any thing elſe. They had indeed ſpoken well, they had promiſed obedience and ſaid to Moſes "Speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will hear it and do it." But they had no heart anſwerable to their words. In theſe good words "they did flatter him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongues." This is intimated in what God ſays to Moſes on this occaſion, "O that there were <hi>ſuch an heart</hi> in them, that they would keep all my commandments always." It is therefore ſo far from being true, that the people of Iſrael were leſs vile and ſinful in God's ſight when they ſaid theſe words; and that on this account they had his "expreſs approbation, which Mr. M. aſſerts, that it is certain they were more vile and odious in God's ſight, than if they had ſaid nothing; if groſs and ſolemn lying and hypocriſy is more ſinful, than to make no profeſſion, and tell no lie. Theſe two laſt mentioned inſtances are therefore very ill choſen ones to anſwer Mr. M's purpoſe, whatever are the reſt.</p>
               <p>But if we ſet aſide what has been ſaid in the foregoing obſervations, and allow that the perſons here mentioned were not ſo guilty and vile in God's ſight as they had been, and that this is expreſsly aſſerted of them all; yet this does not afford the leaſt ſhadow of an argument to prove that an awakened convinced ſinner, ſuch an one as I deſcribe, is not more guilty and vile in God's ſight, than when in a ſtate of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſecurity. For, I have to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="3">3. It does not appear that any of theſe were the awakened, convinced ſinners of which I ſpeak, but the contrary is moſt evident. Let Mr. M. produce as many inſtances as he will of perſons becoming leſs ſinful, and growing ſo much better, as on this account to abate and remove God's anger towards them, and attain his approbation and favor; yet this will be nothing in favor of the cauſe he has eſpouſed; unleſs theſe are inſtances of theſe awakened, convinced ſinners, about whom is the diſpute.</p>
               <p>Jehu has not the leaſt <hi>appearance</hi> of any awakening and conviction, or humiliation, or ſo much as external reformation. I therefore a little wonder how Mr. M. happened to think of him for an inſtance of an "awakened, humbled reformed ſinner."</p>
               <p>The caſe of the Ninevites has been before conſidered; and it appears by the account which Mr. M. gives of them, that they were very far
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011295_0043_0F869EF3EC53ABE8"/>
from the conviction, of which I ſpeak, being "in the depth of heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh darkneſs, and not knowing ſo much as the name of a Mediator."</p>
               <p>The Iſraelites were terrified and affected by the extraordinary, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful appearances at Mount-Sinai; but that they had much light and conviction let into their conſciences, there is no evidence; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is moſt evident. They had no real conviction of conſcience, of the ſinfulneſs and perverſneſs of their own hearts; but thought they were diſpoſed and ready to do all that God commanded. Inſtead of having any true light and conviction of conſcience, they were vaſtly ignorant and ſtupid in this reſpect, while they were only alarmed and frighted by the external appearances of Mount-Sinai. Juſt as many perſons now are affrighted by ſome imaginary ſuggeſtions and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſo imagine themſelves to be under the awakenings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of ſin, which are preparatory to converſion, and are thought to be ſo by many others; while they have really no true ſight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their ſin and danger, and know not what is their real ſtate and character. Indeed the Iſraelites were neither truly "awakened, convinced, humbled, nor reformed; for they directly upon this fell into the groſſeſt acts of idolatry; they made and worſhipped a golden calf, and in their idolatrous revel "they ſat down to eat and to drink, and roſe up to play."</p>
               <p>Ahab put on the appearance of a true penitent: "He put ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth upon his fleſh, and faſted and lay in ſackcloth, and went ſoftly." And thus he did, in his external appearance, humble himſelf before God. But there is not the leaſt evidence that he was under what is called legal conviction, or was in any degree troubled, or tho'tful about a future ſtate; or that he had any right ſpeculative notions of his guilty, loſt, miſerable ſtate, as a ſinner, and of the way in which he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon and ſalvation. He believed the prophet, that God was angry with him for what he had done in the affair of Naboth's vineyard, and he was afraid of the temporal, worldly evils which were threatened, and put on this appearance of penitence in hopes that hereby the judgments might be averted. He is not therefore an inſtance of an awakened, convinced ſinner: ſo is not in any degree applicable to the caſe before us, on ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it was certain that he, by what he did, became leſs ſinful. But whether he was a convinced ſinner or not, as it appears by his after conduct, that he was not a true penitent, we may be very ſure that his heart was not anſwerable to the external appearance he put on, but was directy oppoſite thereto; and therefore that he was guilty of groſs hypocriſy, and was more vile and hateful in God's ſight, than he was before he had this ſpecial admonition, and put on this hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical appearance. How far then is this inſtance from being to Mr. M's purpoſe!</p>
               <p>BUT Mr. M. has more inſtances under this head, to which I will now attend. He ſays the point he contends for is evident from the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation our Saviour makes of this matter in the following words. <q>When the unclean ſpirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011295_0043_0F869EF3EC53ABE8"/>
dry places, ſeeking reſt, and findeth none. Then he ſaith, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my houſe, from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty ſwept and garniſhed. Then goeth he, and taketh with him ſeven other ſpirits more wicked than himſelf, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, and dwell there: and the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe than the firſt.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. XII. 43—45.</note>
                  </q> He obſerves upon theſe words, that, <q>by the houſe emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſwept and garniſhed, is repreſented the ſtate of an awakened, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſinner. By his return with ſeven other ſpirits more wicked than himſelf, entering in, and dwelling there, is repreſented the more deſperate, wicked ſtate, to which he is reduced on the abatement of his convictions, returning with further degrees of contracted hardneſs of heart, to the unreſtrained practice of more deſperate degrees of wickedneſs. Now it is expreſsly affirmed that the laſt ſtate of that man is WORSE than the firſt.</q> He then goes on to obſerve that this is applied to the Jewiſh nation, who had been awakened and reformed by the preaching of John, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 34, 35.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It has been before obſerved, that in arguing from this inſtance, Mr. M. has expreſsly contradicted what he had advanced in a former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Since therefore he has introduced this at ſuch an expence, it would be very wrong not to allow it its full weight. The reader will judge for himſelf, when he has attended to the following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I allow that the going out of the unclean ſpirit intends external reformation of groſs, open ſins; which took place in a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree among the Jews, upon the appearance and preaching of John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and continued for ſome time. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. I think Mr. M. has miſtaken the meaning of the 'houſe empty, ſwept and garniſhed.' This does not intend external reformation, or any reformation at all: But denotes a habitation ſuited and prepared for the reception of ſuch a gueſt or inhabitant as is an evil ſpirit; every thing being ready for his admittance, and ſuited to invite him to dwell there, and give him all deſirable advantage. In one word, it denotes a heart not made better or leſs ſinful in any degree, but fit and prepared for the entrance and abode of a devil, only in a different ſhape; and that he might dwell there with greater power and advantage. This indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the ſtate of an awakened, convinced ſinner. The unclean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil which reigned in him in a ſtate of ignorance, ſecurity and external vice, now enters him in another ſhape, for which his heart is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in a manner it was not before, and becomes ſeven <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>old more wicked and vile, in the exerciſes of a ſelf-righteous, proud ſpirit, and in more direct and ſtronger oppoſition to Chriſt and the goſpel. Mr. M. has therefore led me to a paſſage very much to my purpoſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>This alſo repreſents the ſtate of the Jews when they were in ſome meaſure awakened and externally reformed. They only forſook one way of wickedneſs for another, which was much greater, and every way worſe. They truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and hated and rejected Jeſus Chriſt. Inſtead of the unclean devil in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to whom they had wallowed in external filthineſs, a ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:011295_0044_0F869EF43B839C68"/>
proud, unbelieving devil entered them: and they became ſeven fold more wicked and the children of hell, than the publicans and open ſinners, in their hatred of Jeſus Chriſt, and direct, and violent oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By <hi>firſt and laſt ſtate</hi> are meant, not their reformed ſtate, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal wickedneſs afterwards returned to; but the ſtate they were in, before the unclean ſpirit went out, and the ſtate in which, under the influence of ſeven worſe devils, they hated the divine character; and rejected and oppoſed Jeſus Chriſt, by which they became worſe, more guilty and vile than the unclean Sodomites, and the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, and were going on to a more dreadful damnation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their external reformations &amp; profeſſions, in which they cleanſed only the outſide, while the moſt abominable wickedneſs reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within, and were 'like whited ſepulchres, which indeed appeared beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanneſs.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. XXIII. 27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, the true import of this parable being attended to, it appears to be ſo far from containing an argument in favor of what Mr. M. has eſpouſed, that it is directly againſt him, and repreſents the Jews, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their awakenings and reformations, more than ſeven fold worſe than they were before, while they hated the divine character clearly ſet before them in the incarnate Son of God, and obſtinately rejected and oppoſed him.</p>
               <p>But if this moſt natural and plain ſenſe of the words is given up, and the interpretation Mr. M. has given is admitted, they will afford no argument in his favor; for,</p>
               <p n="4">4. According to him, the Jews became <hi>worſe,</hi> more guilty and vile, becauſe under all their awakenings, reformations, light and advantages, they did not embrace the goſpel; <q>but hardened their hearts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the cleareſt light and evidence of the truth, and thereby ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves for a more aggravated condemnation.</q> It was then the abuſe of the light and advantages they had, in their awakened, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſtate, that ripened them for a more aggravated condemnation, which is the very thing which I aſſert, and which Mr. M. oppoſes. And if it is allowed, that they, <q>finally hardened their hearts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the cleareſt light and evidence of the truth; and thereby ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened themſelves for a more aggravated condemnation,</q> not in their awakened, reformed ſtate, under the preaching of John Baptiſt, Chriſt and his apoſtles: but, as Mr. M. ſuppoſes, <hi>after</hi> all this, by returning to their former or greater external wickedneſs; this inſtance will be nothing to the caſe before us: For tho' it be granted that if a perſon who has been under great awakenings and convictions, does not only abuſe all his light and conviction by continuing to reject Chriſt and the goſpel; but in oppoſition to all this goes into an allowed courſe of open wickedneſs, does hereby become more guilty and vile, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts greater hardneſs of heart, than while he was externally reformed under the influence of his convictions of conſcience; yet it does not follow that he was ſo, when in a ſtate of ignorance and ſecurity before
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:011295_0044_0F869EF43B839C68"/>
he had this light and conviction: In this caſe the light and conviction he has had is the reaſon and ground of his greater ſinfulneſs; which ſerves to ſhew how ſuch light and conviction aggravates all his ſins: and therefore that he could not have been ſo guilty and vile, had he never been the ſubject of them: and ſo is an argument in favor of what I have advanced: but if it was not, it is nothing againſt it; for it has no relation to the caſe of a ſinner before he falls under awakenings and conviction; but only to thoſe, who <hi>after</hi> awakenings and convictions fall into groſs open wickedneſs; to which what I aſſert has no reſpect at all. In a word, in order to prove that a ſinner is more guilty and vile <hi>before</hi> he falls under awakenings and convictions, than he is when thus awakened, Mr. M. brings an inſtance to prove that he who runs into open wickedneſs <hi>after</hi> he has theſe convictions, is on this account more guilty and vile; which ſurely is a very inconcluſive way of arguing.</p>
               <p>The next inſtance Mr. M. produces is that of "the young man, on whoſe declaration of his having obſerved the commandments from his youth, 'tis ſaid, Chriſt beholding him, loved him."<note n="*" place="bottom">Mar. X. 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. M. obſerves upon this, that "whatever diſpute may be raiſed on the words," he ſuppoſes it will be allowed by all, <q>that he was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an externally moral and amiable converſation, and that <hi>on that account</hi> Chriſt ſhewed him reſpect, at leaſt as being leſs vile than if he had under his religious advantages continued in greater degrees of <hi>ſtupidity,</hi> and lived in the open violation of all God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 35.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here I take leave to obſerve the following things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr. M. ſeems here quite to have forgot what he was about, or had undertaken to do; which was to produce inſtances of "awakened, humbled, reformed ſinners: for ſurely he could not have the leaſt tho't that this young man was ſuch an inſtance. He was not <hi>reformed;</hi> for had never been guilty of any courſe of external ſins. He was not a <hi>humbled</hi> ſinner; for he did not charge himſelf with the leaſt ſin; and was ſtupid and proud enough to think of obtaining eternal life by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome good thing. It hence appears alſo that he had not the leaſt degree of true light and conviction of conſcience. Mr. M. ſays, "Chriſt ſhewed him reſpect, as being leſs vile, than if he had continued in greater degrees of <hi>ſtupidity.</hi> I wonder that he mentioned this; for he manifeſted the moſt ſhocking degree of <hi>ſtupidity</hi> of conſcience, by ſaying that he had kept all the commands, which Chriſt mentioned to him, from his youth. One would hope there was not another ſuch ignorant, ſtupid wretch among all the Jews.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I do not allow, what Mr. M. ſuppoſes will be allowed by all "that Chriſt ſhewed him reſpect" and loved him, on the account of his good character, "at leaſt as being leſs vile, &amp;c."</p>
               <p>If Chriſt loved him merely becauſe he was <hi>leſs vile</hi> than he might have been, he had the ſame reaſon to love every one that he ſaw; for we have no reaſon to think that any one of them was as vile and ſinful as he could poſſibly be, on any ſuppoſition. Beſides, this would be a very odd ſort of love indeed, which is wholly grounded on his being
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011295_0045_0F869EF556573530"/>
leſs ſinful and odious than he might have been, or than others were. It is indeed a <hi>love</hi> which conſiſts in <hi>not hating him ſo much,</hi> as if he had been more odious. In this ſenſe we may be ſaid to love all who are not ſo bad as the devil, or the moſt odious creatures in the univerſe.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any reaſon to think that Chriſt loved him on account of any thing amiable and excellent in his character. His ſaying "all theſe have I obſerved from my youth," was much more of an expreſſion of the moſt odious ignorance, ſtupidity and wickedneſs of mind, than of any thing elſe.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. M. often ſpeaks of the phariſee who went up to the temple to pray at "a proud, ſtupid, ſelf-juſtifying ſinner." And ſays, "he was, in ſome reſpects, if not on the whole the vileſt of all ſinners."<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 80, 81.</note> I ſee not what great difference there is in the characters of theſe two. The young man was not an extortioner, unjuſt or adulterer: and was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as exact in his obſervance of the firſt table of the law, as of the ſecond. And he certainly truſted in this as a righteouſneſs to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to God. He did not think that he wanted any thing more, unleſs it was to make further progreſs in his good deeds, and do ſome good thing, further to recommend him to God, which he had not yet done. Surely Mr. M. had no reaſon to ſet one of theſe phariſees in ſo bad a light, as the greateſt ſinner on earth; and repreſent the other as a ſmall ſinner, and ſo amiable as to attract Chriſt's reſpect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency.</note> He muſt have been deſtitute of all true benevolence, vaſtly proud, and a perfect enemy to God, elſe he could not have been ſo ignorant of himſelf, and the divine law: And Chriſt ſaw all this in the cleareſt light. He "beholding him," looking on him as a poor, ignorant, ſtupid, proud enemy to God, and in a moſt wretched condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this excited in him the love of pity and benevolence towards him; and under the influence of this he went on to uſe means ſuited to inſtruct and relieve him. This, I ſuppoſe is all that is meant by his <hi>loving</hi> him. We have no need to look for ſomething amiable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in this young man, in order to account for Chriſt's loving him, with a love of pity and benevolence. Miſery and wretchedneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing amiable, is the proper object of this love. Thus God is ſaid to love the world of mankind, when they were his enemies,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Joh. III. 16.</note> and we are commanded to love our worſt enemies, not with a love of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, but of benevolence and kindneſs, how ever odious their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter may juſtly be to us. But if it were granted, that Chriſt loved him out of reſpect to his decent, amiable, external behaviour, (as ſome have ſuppoſed) this is very conſiſtent with his being the greateſt ſinner in the nation, his <hi>whole character</hi> being conſidered, as comprehending the ſtate and exerciſes of his heart.—But more than enough has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps been ſaid to ſhew with what little reaſon Mr. M. has produced this inſtance in ſupport of his cauſe.</p>
               <p>HE goes on to ſay, <q>Again, the ſame truth is clearly held forth by the apoſtle Peter, where he tells us, 'If after they have eſcaped the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011295_0045_0F869EF556573530"/>
pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again entangled therein, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning</q> Upon this he aſks the following queſtion, <q>Is it not plainly implied in theſe words, that while <hi>he</hi> is not again entangled, and overcome with the pollutions of the world, i. e. continues to eſcape them, <hi>he</hi> is leſs vile?</q> Anſwer. If this is granted, it is nothing to the purpoſe: for according to this, there is reference only to their abuſe of that light and knowledge, which they had, <hi>after</hi> they had been awakened and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The point in controverſy has no relation to ſuch a caſe as this. The queſtion between us is not, Whether a perſon that has reformed his external conduct under the influence of light and conviction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, may not grow worſe by returning to his former ways of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? But whether a convinced ſinner, how much ſoever he is reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his external conduct, is not on the whole worſe, more guilty and vile than he was before he had this light and conviction? But this has been repeatedly obſerved before. It ſeems a little ſtrange and odd, that Mr. M. when he is hunting up arguments to ſupport that ſide which he has taken of the queſtion in debate, ſhould ſo often quite forget the point in diſpute, and argue againſt ſomething elſe.</p>
               <p>But I have here to obſerve Mr. M. has not given the true ſenſe of the words. When St. Peter ſays, "the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning," (or as the ſame words are rendered<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. XII. 45.</note> the laſt ſtate is worſe with them, than the <hi>firſt</hi>) he means, that they who have once, under the influence of their knowledge and conviction of the truths of chriſtianity, externally ſubmitted to the laws of that holy religion; and after that turn apoſtates, and fall into their former ways of external ſin, are in a worſe ſtate, than they were before they had the knowledge of chriſtianity. Their <hi>beginning,</hi> or firſt ſtate, is the ſtate they were in before they had eſcaped the pollutions of the world, thro' the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt. This is as evident as can be by the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following: "For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, than after they had known it, to turn from the holy commandment." To prove that the <hi>latter end</hi> is <hi>worſe</hi> with them than the beginning, he ſays it had been better for them, to have remained as they were in the beginning, i. e. in ignorance of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, than to renounce it after they had known it Mr. M. has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quite miſtaken the force and meaning of this text. As it ſtands, it is rather a conformation of the point which he oppoſes: For their being in a worſe ſtate is wholly grounded, not in their greater external wickedneſs; for they are ſuppoſed only to return to their former ways in which they lived in the beginning: but on their returning to their old ways of ſinning when they had ſo much knowledge and conviction of the truth. So that their ſinning againſt the <hi>internal</hi> light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction which they had, is repreſented as the chief aggravation of their ſins: which is the very thing which I aſſert, and which Mr. M. oppoſes.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. concludes his argument from theſe inſtances with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing queſtion. <q>Are not theſe as clear indications as can well be
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:011295_0046_0F869EF5B78662D0"/>
given by words, that the account the bleſſed God makes of theſe different characters of men, under the means of grace is in favor of the negative part of the queſtion?</q> I leave the reader now to anſwer this queſtion himſelf.</p>
               <p>MR. M. proceeds, <q>On the other hand to inquire, of what account with the bleſſed God the character of the ſecure, bold, preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, hardened ſinner is, who obſtinately perſiſts in vicious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral practices.</q> This he propoſes to do by conſidering the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings uttered by God againſt ſuch in particular. And "the execution of his judgments and wrath, in the way of his providence, correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with the threatenings of his word," on thoſe of this character, when this is expreſsly aſſigned as the ground of theſe judgments.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 36.—40.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The threatenings he mentions are contained in the ſcriptures referred to in the margin.<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. XXIX. 1. Numb. XV. 30. Amos VI. 1. 1 Theſſ. V. 3. Pſal. LXVIII. 21. Deut. XXIX. 19.</note> The inſtances of God's judgments which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, are the deſtruction of the old world—God's ſending fire and brimſtone on Sodom—The judgments executed on Pharaoh—and on the people of Iſrael, firſt and laſt.</p>
               <p>Upon this I ſhall only make the following brief remarks.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr. M. ſuppoſe and allows that theſe are only threats and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of "outward judgments," i. e. of temporal evils and calamities. And is it not eaſy to ſee why open, viſible ſins ſhould be puniſhed viſibly and openly in this ſtate, rather than thoſe which are inviſible and ſecret: and therefore why thoſe ſins ſhould be <hi>threatened</hi> with theſe judgments? It cannot be hence inferred, that theſe are always moſt guilty and the greateſt ſinners in God's ſight. God has no where in his word intimated that in his providence he treats men according to their true character, inflicting the greateſt outward judgments on the greateſt ſinners, and ſhewing the greateſt favors to the leaſt guilty and vile: So far from this, that directly the contrary is abundantly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore nothing can be determined about the queſtion in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, who is on the whole the greateſt ſinner, by all the threatenings and executions of God's judgments in this world.<note n="‡" place="bottom">It cannot be inferred that the man of God who was ſent to cry againſt the altar at Bethel was a greater ſinner than Jeroboam or the old prophet, becauſe he was ſo ſeverely threatened, and ſlain by a lion, while they were ſpared.<note n="§" place="bottom">1 King. XIII.</note> But this inferrence is as well grounded as Mr. M's. Nor is it any evidence that the man who refuſed to ſmite the prophet, was in this a greater criminal than any of his neighbours, becauſe he was for this act of diſobedience to the prophet threatened, and ſlain by a Lion.<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 King. XX. 35, 36.</note>
                  </note> Our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly oppoſes &amp; cenſures ſuch a concluſion as Mr. M. makes from theſe inſtances, in the followings words: (Suppoſe ye that theſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Galileans, becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you, Nay." God's bringing outward temporal calamities on ſome for their viſible open ſins, as a manifeſtation of his diſpleaſure and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:011295_0046_0F869EF5B78662D0"/>
is no evidence that their external wickedneſs is greater, and more provoking to God, than the outward wickedneſs of many others, whom the ſpares and ſmiles on in his providence; much leſs is it any evidence that they are in all reſpects, and on the whole, greater ſinners than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who eſcape theſe judgments.</p>
               <p>It is enough that they, on whom theſe judgments are brought, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, and infinitely more, and that it is wife and proper, all things conſidered, for God in this way to manifeſt his diſpleaſure at them, tho' at the ſame time others who eſcape theſe judgments, are more guilty and vile in God's fight; and will have a much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable condemnation in the day of judgment. Of this we have an inſtance which cannot be diſputed, in the inhabitants of Sodom, and thoſe of Capernaum, &amp;c. The former were burnt up in fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone from heaven; the latter, the moſt of them, at leaſt, we have all reaſon to think died a natural death, with no extraordinary marks of the divine vengeance: And yet the latter were more guilty and vile than the former, our Saviour being judge, and will appear ſo at the day of judgment. It might be alſo obſerved that moſt who had an actual hand in crucifying the Lord of glory, died quietly in their beds; and a peculiar vengeance fell on thoſe, who came upon the ſtage after this; for the evils that come on the nation of the Jews, were ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till 40 years after this fact; in which time moſt of that generation, died off, and others roſe up in their room. And I ſuppoſe all will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the former were more guilty than the latter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some of the threats Mr. M. has here quoted have no particular reference to external ſins of the unawakened ſecure ſinner, or to any temporal, outward judgments; but are as applicable to the awakened, convinced ſinner as to any other, and much more ſo. "He that being often reproved, herdeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy," is peculiarly applicable to an awakened, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſinner. Such an one is <hi>reproved</hi> by the light and convictions of his conſcience much more and oftener than any other: and he <hi>harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his neck,</hi> more than others in proportion as his reproofs are ſtronger and more conſtant. And his continuing to harden his neck will iſſue in ſudden and remedileſs deſtruction.—And when it is ſaid, "God ſhall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch an one as goeth on ſtill in his treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes;" a ſecure profligate is no more pointed out, than an awakened, convinced ſinner; for the latter is really as much an enemy to God, as the former, and "goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſſes." Mr. M. might as well have quoted any other text in the bible as theſe. And his mentioning theſe, only ſhews that he either little tho't what he was about, or quite miſunderſtood the character of the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, convinced ſinner while unregenerate. The latter is doubtleſs the truth, ſince he appears to carry this miſtake thro' the whole of his book, and builds all his oppoſition to me upon it, as has been before obſerved.</p>
               <p>But be this as it may, whether the texts Mr. M. has quoted are all to his purpoſe, or not; let it be remembered that however many threats of outward judgments for open wickedneſs there are in the bible; and
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:011295_0047_0F869EF9F4F261E0"/>
tho' there are many inſtances of God's bringing judgments on men for ſuch ſins; yet this affords not the leaſt argument, that theſe were, all things conſidered, and on the whole, greater ſinners than any others who have eſcaped theſe judgments, nor is any ſuch thing implied or intimated in all this, as has been ſhewed in the firſt remark. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument therefore of Mr. M's comes to nothing, and may well be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with all the reſt, which have been conſidered.</p>
               <p>AND now the reader is to judge of the weight of all Mr. M. has ſaid in oppoſition to the point in debate, and whether he has overthrown, or ſo much as ſhaken, what I have advanced in my ſection on means; and have endeavoured to vindicate in the preceeding pages.</p>

            <div n="7" type="section">
               <head>SECT. VII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>IN which what Mr. M. has ſaid upon ſeveral other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in my enquiry, is examined.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFTER Mr. M. has finiſhed what he had to ſay upon the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſet up to diſpute againſt, he has filled up above two thirds of his book upon another point of doctrine, which he owns I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſsly affirmed nor denied. He does not however, quite forget the former diſpute, but often brings it into view under this head, and ſeems to think himſelf diſputing againſt me. What I am more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerned with here is what he ſays under his <hi>fifth</hi> general head, in which he propoſes <q>to touch briefly on ſome particular paſſages, which to him appear liable to exception, as not being clear from the holy ſcriptures.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE firſt he mentions of this ſort, is my conſtruction of thoſe words of Chriſt, "Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate." I had ſaid that ſome by the ſtrait gate here, underſtand "the entrance into heaven, or eternal life." And ſtriving to enter in at this gate muſt then intend, <q>a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commandments of God, or the holy exerciſes of true ſaints, by which they walk in the way to heaven; fight the good fight of faith, and ſo lay hold on eternal life.<note n="†" place="bottom">Enquiry, P. 1, 2.</note>
                  </q> And proceeded to offer ſome things in favour of this interpretation, without expreſsly declaring my own opinion. Mr. M. has taken an alarm at this, as if all ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, and even religion itſelf was given up by ſuch an interpretation of theſe words. But let us conſider what he has to ſay againſt it.</p>
               <p>He firſt ſays, this is the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſenſe of this text, <q>which ſome think is a ſhort ſummary of their whole ſcheme. For this tends to deliver them from the inviſible influences of the holy Spirit in grown perſons, and ſenſible experiences and exerciſes in converſion, &amp;c.</q> And he goes on to aſk, <q>Is not advancing this gloſs on the text, the moſt effectual method that could be taken unobſervedly to overthrow Calviniſm in this point, and promote Arminianiſm?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:011295_0047_0F869EF9F4F261E0"/>
ANSWER. I am ſorry if Calviniſm, or any one peculiar doctrine of it, depends ſo much upon the meaning of this ſingle text, that it muſt ſtand or fall, according as this is underſtood. I think ſuch a ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more favorable to Arminianiſm, than any interpretation that can be put upon this text. Calviniſts are poorly off indeed, if they have no text but this to prove "the invincible influences of the holy Spirit, and ſenſible experiences and exerciſes in converſion;" which does indeed ſay nothing about them. Many Calviniſts have greatly hurt themſelves and their cauſe, by preſſing into their ſervice texts of ſcripture which have no relation to the point which they would ſupport by them. And they need not be afraid of joining with Arminians, when they are ſo lucky as to give the right ſenſe of a text. And they who think the ſenſe of this text which I have mentioned "is a ſhort ſummary of the whole Arminian ſcheme," or tends to ſupport it in one article, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, I imagine, quite confuſed and in the dark with reſpect to any ſcheme of doctrines whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. goes on to ſay, <q>However, as this interpretation of the text made by Arminians, was to me obſcure and unintelligible, as not holding forth the true ſenſe of the text; ſo it equally is now, when made by a Calviniſt. But whether this is owing to the miſinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the text, or to my age and dullneſs, I ſhall not determine, but leave to the impartial public, when the following things are conſidered<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 45, 46.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Let us then <hi>conſider</hi> what he has ſaid.</p>
               <p>He obſerves that I <q>explain the ſtrait gate as meaning the entrance into heaven or eternal life;</q> and ſays <q>If I mean entering into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtrictly without a metaphor, this is not till death; and then it ſhould ſeem that <hi>ſtriving</hi> to enter in by this gate would be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to die, which makes a very uncouth ſenſe.</q> 
                  <hi>Uncouth</hi> indeed! But we muſt thank him for this ſenſe: for I believe no mortal elſe would ever have thought of it. I ſhould have thought that on my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, ſtriving to enter this gate, was ſtriving to obtain eternal life, in going in the way that leads to it, the way of holineſs; or to be of that character, which alone will be admitted into heaven: or that it was to fight the good fight of faith, ſo as to lay hold on eternal life. This is the ſenſe I had given of ſtriving. He therefore proceeds to ſay <q>But taking <hi>ſtriving</hi> as he has explained it, yet it is ſtill unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how they can walk in the narrow way that leads to heaven, ſince they are ſuppoſed by his expoſition, to have entered there by paſſing thro' the gate.</q> I leave the reader to make the beſt he can of this.</p>
               <p>He firſt ſays that according to my interpretation, ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate, means ſtriving to die. In the next ſentence he ſays my expoſition ſuppoſes they who ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, have entered into heaven already; and he cannot ſee how, after this, they can be ſaid to walk the narrow way that leads to heaven. He then aſks "If by the entrance into heaven, I mean the entering into a ſtate of grace, or converſion, how I have oppoſed the ſenſe of the text, which I endeavour to overthrow? But he preſently forgets all this, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:011295_0048_0F869EFA97FB9660"/>
ſuppoſes that I make the gate and the way to mean one and the ſame thing: and that according to my conſtruction, living a holy life and actually entering into heaven are the ſame.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 46, 47, 48.</note> And upon theſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he argues againſt me, in his own imagination, very ſtrongly, till he thinks he has "reſtored the true and genuine ſenſe of the text." But in the midſt of all this he takes notice that I <q>have not attempted to explain what is meant by the <hi>narrow way;</hi> nor ſhewed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of our Lord's placing <hi>this gate</hi> before <hi>the way</hi> in his repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entation; both which, I apprehend, (ſays he) neceſſary to be done, in order to ſet the ſenſe of this important text in a true and conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent light.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The words <hi>narrow way</hi> are not found in the text, nor is the gate placed before the way. And what need there was of <hi>explaining</hi> or ſaying any thing about that which is not found in the text, I cannot conceive. I did indeed ſay, that ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate according to the ſenſe I mentioned, did intend walking in the way of holineſs; and this I ſuppoſed was the narrow way. Mr. M. repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells of my ſpeaking of <hi>the way,</hi> and what my expoſition makes it to mean: but he has juſt at this inſtant forgot all this which was in his mind immediately before, and juſt after, and ſays, "He has not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to explain what is meant by the <hi>narrow way!</hi>"</p>
               <p>And now the reader is to determine whether all this is owing to Mr. M's <hi>age and dullneſs,</hi> or to ſomething elſe, For my part, I cannot help <hi>determining</hi> that he was quite confuſed and loſt here, whatever was the cauſe of it; and that he has done nothing towards reſtoring any ſenſe of the text at all.</p>
               <p>I OBSERVED that the word in the original tranſlated <hi>ſtrive,</hi> in the text, when uſed in other places in the new-teſtament denoted not any exerciſes and doings before converſion, but the exertions and labours of true chriſtians in their way to heaven, which might <hi>perhaps</hi> be a good reaſon for underſtanding it in the ſame ſenſe in this place. To ſupport this obſervation I produced a number of inſtances. Three of theſe Mr. M. examines, and thinks they turn out rather againſt, than for me. The two firſt are the words of St. Paul, ſpoken of himſelf, and of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy. "I have fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ght the good fight. Fight the good fight of faith." Mr. M. obſerves that <q>in both theſe inſtances, that which limits the word <hi>fight</hi> or ſtrive to the exerciſes of true chriſtians, is rather the <hi>good</hi> fight, with which it is connected. Whereas if Mr. Hopkins's ſenſe of the word ſtrive were certain, there had been no need at all for the apoſtle to have added, the <hi>good</hi> ſtrife or fight, ſince it could mean nothing elſe, but a good and holy ſtriving.</q> It would have been a wild aſſertion indeed if I had ſaid, this word always neceſſarily carried this ſenſe and could not ſignify any thing elſe. Words, I know are in themſelves quite arbitrary ſigns, and no more ſignify one thing than another, till ſome meaning is affixed to them. All I attempted was to ſhew in what ſenſe the inſpired writers uſed it, when applied to religious exerciſes. It was to Mr. M's purpoſe to ſhew that they
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:011295_0048_0F869EFA97FB9660"/>
did not uſe it in the ſenſe which I had ſaid they did: but this he has not attempted.</p>
               <p>I know, and particularly obſerved, that the word was originally uſed among the Greeks, to denote, the ſtrifes in the olympic and other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic games. The apoſtle conſiders theſe ſtrifes as an emblem of the chriſtian race and ſtrife, in which men run and fight for eternal life; and therefore takes the word they uſed for the former, and applies it to the latter. He calls the latter the <hi>good</hi> fight, to diſtinguiſh it from that fight or agony which the word originally ſignified, and to which he has reference; and not to diſtinguiſh it from the exerciſes and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the unregenerate, Mr. M. ſays, <q>This ſeems to imply there might be a fighting and ſtriving, that was not thus ſtrictly good and ſucceſsful.</q> I grant that it implies there was a ſtriving in the olimpic games, in diſtinction from which the chriſtian's labor and ſtrife, is a <hi>good</hi> fight; but not that there was any other proper religious ſtriving diſtinct from this.</p>
               <p>The other inſtance I mentioned, which Mr. M. excepts againſt, is in the following words, <q>And every one that <hi>ſtriveth</hi> for the maſtery, is temperate in all things: Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.</q> Upon this he ſays, <q>Here the apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>ſtriving</hi> for the maſtery, and for a corruptible crown. Were theſe gracious exerciſes?</q> Wonderful queſtion!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Theſe exerciſes are an emblem of the gracious exerciſes of true chriſtians, in which they <hi>ſtrive</hi> for an incorruptible crown, which is here aſſerted of them. The reader ſhall judge with how good a grace, and what propriety Mr. M. adds, <q>This text which he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, ſeems to confute the interpretation he has advanced, inſtead of eſtabliſhing it.</q> He who can think this a confutation of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation I have advanced, can eaſily confute every interpretation that ever was, or can be advanced on any text in the bible.</p>
               <p>I quoted Dr. Doddridge, and Pool's Synopſis to prove that ſome ſuppoſe that by the ſtrait gate is meant the entrance into heaven or eternal life. Mr. M. has been at ſome pains to ſhew that no ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this text is found in theſe authors. In order to this he jumbles together part of what Dr. Doddridge ſays upon this and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther text, taking part of a ſentence from one, and joining it to a piece of a ſentence on the other; carefully leaving out the words, which are apparently contrary to the ſenſe he tries to make him ſpeak. The cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical reader who has Dr. Doddridge and Mr. M. before him, will, by examining and comparing, have a more clear and ſtriking idea of what Mr. Mr. has done in this matter, than can be given any other way. And I am confident he will be convinced that my reference to the Dr. was on good grounds; eſpecially if he obſerves, that in his note on this text, in order to ſhew the ſenſe of the original word, here tranſlated <hi>ſtrive,</hi> he refers to thoſe texts which have been mentioned,<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. IX. 25. Col. I. 29. 1 Tim. VI. 12. 2 Tim. IV. 7.</note> in which the exerciſes of chriſtian faith and holineſs are ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. ſays, 'Such is my weakneſs, that I cannot deviſe why this
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:011295_0049_0F869EFAFA251220"/>
author referred to Dr. Doddridge, as an authority for his <hi>new ſenſe</hi> of this text. On this I would obſerve the following things.</p>
               <p>I did not refer to the doctor <hi>as an authority</hi> for this ſenſe of the text. I hope I never ſhall be guilty of referring to any uninſpired <hi>man</hi> as an <hi>author<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </hi> When I mentioned a ſenſe which <hi>others</hi> put upon this text, I referred to the doctor as one of them, not as any evidence that this was right ſenſe: but that it was in fact ſo underſtood by ſome, as I aſſerted.</p>
               <p>Why does Mr. M. here call this a <hi>new ſenſe</hi> of this text, when he had ſo often ſaid it was a ſenſe, which arminians put upon it; unleſs it be that he may add to the number of his many ſelf contradictions!<note n="*" place="bottom">Beſides, it appears that this was Mr. M's ſenſe of the text, above 20 years ago. So that he has by calling it a <hi>new ſenſe</hi> now, contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in another ſenſe, and yet higher degree. In his letter to Dr. Johnſon, called a <hi>A vindication of goſpel truth,</hi> he ſays<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 17.</note> 
                     <q>The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no where puts mankind upon ſeeking their everlaſting happineſs in any other way than that of <hi>well doing,</hi> truly ſuch <hi>in the account of God,</hi> i. e. <hi>doing his commandments.</hi>
                     </q> Certainly then when Chriſt <q>puts mankind upon ſeeking their eternal happineſs,</q> by telling them to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, he means <hi>doing the commandments of God,</hi> as I have explained it.</note> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps however, he means to ſet NEW, in oppoſition to orthodox. If ſo, this will account for his calling every thing he does not approve <hi>new divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far Mr. M's <hi>weakneſs</hi> appears in this, or in any thing elſe to be found in his book, is a matter of no great importance, and is left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the judgment of the reader. All that I am concerned to make out is, the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of what he ſays in ſupport of the cauſe he has eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed.</p>
               <p>He alſo endeavours to ſhew that I have made a miſtake in refering to <hi>Pool's Synopſis</hi> for this ſenſe of the text.</p>
               <p>As this is a matter of no great importance, I will not trouble the reader with the defence of myſelf, which I think I am able to make, and a particular confutation of what Mr. M. has ſaid; but I leave it entirely with the learned, who will be at the pains of conſulting the <hi>ſynopſis.</hi> However, I will juſt mention three miſtaks which Mr. M. has made, in what he has ſaid on this head.</p>

Therefore he produces the different and oppoſite ſentiments of expoſitors and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly refers to them in the margin. Mr. M's quotation in the margin is what Mr. Pool collected from two expoſitors, the latter of which has been reckoned in ſome ſenſe the father of all Arminians.

                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Mr. M. here again ſuppoſes I quote Pool's ſynopſis as an authority to ſupport that ſenſe of the text which I had mentioned. Whereas I referred to this only to ſupport my aſſertion, that this ſenſe has been put on the text; and not as the leaſt evidence that it was the right one, as I have before obſerved. However, while Mr. M. runs into this miſtake and that juſt mentioned, he is right, in rejecting all human authority in the following words, <q>But ſuppoſe Mr. Pool was of opinion, &amp;c. as we are <hi>to call no man father on earth,</hi> I would enquire, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Mr. M. here ſuppoſes that whatever the unregenerate are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected or commanded to do, they are to do, or may do it, while unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; and ſo that they are directions or commands to unregenerate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. This is manifeſt in what he pretends to take from <hi>Pool's Synopſis,</hi> juſt mentioned, in the following words, <q>Chriſt invites or requires all, the unregenerate not excepted, to take in hand, or enter upon the way of holineſs. And that they ſtrive in this matter with all their powers.</q> Tho' all the unregenerate are required immediately to enter upon the way of holineſs, and to ſtrive in this matter, &amp;c. this does not certainly enjoin unregenerate ſtrivings, unleſs whatever the unregenerate are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do, they are to do as ſuch, or while unregenerate. But what Mr. M. here ſuppoſes is by no means true. The unregenerate are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to love God, and to ſtrive in this matter, and exert all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But it does not follow from this that unregenerate men do thus love God, or ever will while unregenerate. But this matter will be more particularly conſidered in another ſection.—I return to the text under conſideration.</p>
               <p>IT was my prevailing opinion, when I wrote my enquiry that the <hi>ſtrait gate</hi> in this text does not mean the entrance on a religious life, or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from ſin to God; but the entrance into eternal life, to which a life of holineſs or the good fight of faith is the way; and therefore is the ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here commanded, which includes the beginning in the firſt act of faith and repentance, &amp;c. as well as progreſs in this way unto the end of life. And I have not been lead to alter my opinion, by any thing that Mr. M. has ſaid, or that I have learned from any other quarter. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I then ſaid in ſupport of the interpretation in queſtion. And I muſt now aſk the patience of the reader, while I mention ſeveral other things which appear to me to be in favour of this ſenſe of the text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The words immediately following theſe ſeem to be in favor of this conſtruction.<note n="‡" place="bottom">V. 25—30.</note> 'When once the maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the door, and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us, &amp;c.—There ſhall be weeping, &amp;c. when ye ſhall ſee Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, &amp;c." Theſe words are evidently introduced with reference to what is ſaid in the text, and to explain and enforce it. And we are hereby led to underſtand this ſame thing by the <hi>ſtrait gate</hi> in the text, and the <hi>door</hi> in the next ſentence. The way to eternal life, or the kingdom of God, the gate or door by which perſons enter thither, and by which the patriarchs and prophets have gone into this kingdom, now
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:011295_0050_0F869EFBCE9EEF68"/>
ſtands open to all; and all are invited to enter in: and all that is neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in order to this, is to <hi>ſtrive</hi> to enter in, or to go in the way which leads to eternal life. And all are urged <hi>now</hi> ſo to run for eternal life, not as uncertainly; ſo to ſtrive and fight the good fight of faith, as to lay hold on eternal life, from this awakening conſideration, that many ſhall <hi>ſeek</hi> to enter in, ſhall cry for admittance when it is too late, and the door is forever ſhut. From this view of the matter, I think it is very evident, that the <hi>ſeeking</hi> to enter in, which is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>ſtriving,</hi> and is ſet in oppoſition to it, intends the crying for admittance in at the door, after it is ſhut, repreſented in the words immediately following. And if ſo, it will follow, that the ſtrait gate, and the door mean the ſame thing: For Chriſt ſays, many <hi>ſhall</hi> ſeek to enter in, i. e. at the ſtrait gate; and <hi>ſhall not</hi> be able, and then goes on to illuſtrate this, by telling how they ſhall knock and cry for admittance at this gate or door, after it is ſhut. And is it not equally evident, that by <hi>ſtriving</hi> Chriſt means that which ſhall be effectual, and ſhall certainly bring a perſon to "enter in through the gates into heaven," ſince it is put in oppoſition to that which ſhall be ineffectual, and is conſiſtent with being forever excluded? Thus I think, if we attend to Chriſt's own explanation of theſe words, I think we cannot be at a loſs about their meaning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The paſſage juſt now alluded to,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. XXII. 14.</note> ſeems to be in ſome meaſure parellel to this under conſideration, 'Bleſſed are they that do his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the <hi>gates</hi> into the holy city." Here is a gate, or gates mentioned, as the entrance into heaven, and the way to enter is to <hi>do his commandments.</hi> This therefore <hi>ſtriving</hi> to enter in at theſe gates. They therefore who do ſtrive to enter in at this gate, do obſerve the commandment of Chriſt, and ſhall certainly be ſucceſsfull. If ſtriving is Chriſt's command, they who ſtrive, do his commandment, and ſo ſhall enter into eternal life, thro' the gate. This leads me to obſerve further.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſeems to me very diſhonorable to Chriſt, and contrary to his wiſdom, faithfulneſs and goodneſs, to ſuppoſe that he has given any direction and command to ſinners, in order to their ſalvation, which they may punctually obſerve and do, and yet miſs of ſalvation. If they may do ſo; what ſafety is there in relying upon his advice and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for according to this, he does not always adviſe and direct to the way that leads to heaven; but to that which a man may follow, and yet be going in the way to hell. Chriſt ſays, 'Bleſſed is the man that heareth me.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. VIII. 24.</note> He that ſtrives to enter in at the ſtrate gate, heareth Chriſt; for this is his counſel and advice to men; and therefore is ſafe and bleſſed. It is implied in theſe words, that he who ſtriveth ſhall be able to enter in, or ſhall certainly enter in, in diſtinction from thoſe who ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able. And who can now think, that men may faithfully and punctually take the advice, and follow the command of him who came to teach men the way to life, and yet not be able to enter in, but periſh at laſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:011295_0050_0F869EFBCE9EEF68"/>In this view, they who take the ſtriving here commanded, to be the doings of the unregenerate, and at the ſame time hold that there are promiſes made to ſuch ſtrivings, are more conſiſtent; and in this reſpect, do not, I think, reflect ſo much diſhonor on Chriſt, as they who hold the former and deny the latter. And hence it is, perhaps; that it is ſo common for the latter to contradict themſelves, and <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly</hi> hold that there are promiſes to the doings of the unregenerate, or which amounts to the ſame thing, while they are <hi>expreſsly</hi> denying it.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. is an inſtance of this, not the leaſt remarkable; for, as has been obſerved, he in the book under conſideration, applies ſcriptures to the unregenerate, which carry a promiſe in them to thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the direction and command. And when he had formerly wrote a book to prove there are no promiſes to the doings of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, he concludes the whole with the following declaration, <q>On the whole, I would juſt make this one remark, <hi>and be it remembered:</hi> though I deny any <hi>promiſe,</hi> by virtue of which the <hi>ſpecial grace</hi> of God can poſſibly become <hi>due</hi> to the prayers and endeavours of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, while ſuch; yet, however, <hi>I am perſuaded,</hi> that it is the duty of ſinners to be ſeeking and ſtriving after it; and that <hi>not a ſingle inſtance</hi> will be found of any ſinner in the day of judgment, able to ſtand forth, and plead in truth, Lord, I did my beſt endeavour to the very laſt, that I might obtain the ſalvation which is by Jeſus Chriſt, and looked diligently leſt I ſhould fail of the grace of God; but after all, was deny'd.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Vindi. of Goſ. Truth. P. 76, 77.</note>
                  </q> How did Mr. M. come to be thus <hi>perſuaded,</hi> unleſs it was from the nature and perfections of God? But if theſe, or any thing elſe, are the proper ground of ſuch a <hi>perſuaſion,</hi> then they are as good a ſecurity to the ſinner as ten thouſand promiſes would be. And on the ſame ground we may be <hi>perſuaded</hi> that he who ſtrives to enter in at the ſtrait gate, according to the advice of our kind Saviour, ſhall not miſs of ſalvation, as this may be argued from the character &amp; perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, whether he has made any expreſs promiſe or not. And now, by the way, we may ſee the force of the following words, of Mr. M. when ſpeaking of this performance, he ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Pref. P. 4.</note> 
                  <q>Which, according to my <hi>weak</hi> ability, was attempted in ſuch a manner as might guard againſt this its oppoſite extreme, by leaving proper, ſcriptural encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to a diligent attendance on means.</q> I ſee not how there can be any thing worth diſputing about between thoſe who hold that there are promiſes made to the doings of the unregenerate, &amp; thoſe who hold to <hi>this</hi> encouragement. And it is worthy of particular remark here, that in theſe words he gives the unregenerate ſinner a character, which never yet belonged to ſuch, and ſets him in a light, in which he is rather to be pitied than blamed, doing his <hi>beſt endeavour</hi> to the <hi>very laſt,</hi> and <hi>looking diligently</hi> leſt he ſhould fail of the grace of God. He that does <hi>his beſt,</hi> does unſpeakably more than ever an unregenerate man did, or any other meer man in this world; for he is perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and holy. And he who diligently ſeeks, <hi>ſhall find.</hi> He has a divine promiſe to rely upon, which is much better, than Mr. M's <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion.</hi> He who has ſo good an opinion of the unregenerate, can never
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011295_0051_0F869EFC76CE4DD0"/>
conſiſtently think they ſhall fail of ſalvation, upon their thus doing their beſt, and has no reaſon to quarrel with him who aſſerts that there are promiſes to ſuch.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It appears to me that a perſon does never truly <hi>ſtrive</hi> for that, which he oppoſes with all his heart, and to obtain which nothing is wanting but the leaſt degree of inclination of heart towards it, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſire of it. But this is true of unregenerate ſinners, in the caſe before us. They have not the leaſt inclination to enter the ſtrait gate, or to embrace the goſpel. Their want of this, and fixed oppoſition of heart to it, is the only thing in the way of their entering, or that keeps them out. And to ſuppoſe they do ſtrive to enter in at this gate, while they remain ſo, is, I think, very abſurd. They may ſtrive indeed, and have great motions and ſtrong exertions of mind, relating to their future ſtate and eternal ſalvation: But this will be ſo far from ſtriving to enter in at this gate, that all their ſtriving, every exertion and voluntary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their heart will be a refuſal to enter, and oppoſition to it. Now who can think Chriſt exhorted to ſuch exerciſes as theſe, under the notion of their being ſtrivings to enter in at the ſtrait gate? This is to uſe language quite otherwiſe, and in a manner directly oppoſite to what mankind do in the common affairs of life.</p>
               <p>This may be illuſtrated thus; The ſon of a certain and worthy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has ſtolen a thouſand pounds from his father, and run off; and the father purſues and overtakes him, and kindly invites him to return home, and promiſes to forgive him, and to make him heir of all that he has, if he will turn about and reſolutely ſee his face homeward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to <hi>ſtrive,</hi> to exert all his ſtrength in overcoming the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the way to his father's houſe. But if he finds him obſtinately ſet in his way, and without the leaſt inclination to return, or ſo much as to turn his face about, he will not exhort him to <hi>ſtrive</hi> to turn about, under the notion of his doing this, while his heart is wholly oppoſite to it; becauſe this is a contradiction. And if he ſhould ſay to him, "Strive to turn about and get into the road which leads home," it would be underſtood as an exhortation to exerciſe ſome inclination that way, at leaſt; and not that he ſhould ſtrive for this, not only without any inclination to it, but in direct oppoſition to his whole will. And if it was taken in the latter ſenſe, it would be thought the moſt abſurd propoſal that ever was made. Surely he muſt ſtrive without any heart or will, who ſtrives to do that which is in direct oppoſition to his whole heart and will, and the doing of which is nothing but willing and chooſing it. And this is a ſtrange ſort of ſtriving indeed! I am bold to ſay no man ever yet had an idea of it; becauſe it is in itſelf a moſt perfect contradiction.—</p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons, and others that might be mentioned, I think this text is to be underſtood as it has been explained, and that by <hi>ſtriving</hi> here Chriſt does not mean any thing which impenitent unbelievers ever do, while ſuch. Nor do I ſee any bad conſequences of underſtanding the text in this ſenſe. Mr. M. obſerves this is the Arminian ſenſe of the text; &amp; contrary to that which Calviniſts put upon it. And ſays, <q>It ſeems
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:011295_0051_0F869EFC76CE4DD0"/>
ſomewhat ſtrange, that when this author undertook the cauſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy, he ſhould give up and reject their ſenſe of the text, which was ſo greatly in diſpute.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It would ſeem as ſtrange at leaſt, if every one who <hi>undertakes in the cauſe of orthodoxy,</hi> ſhould be obliged to underſtand every text of ſcripture exactly in the ſame ſenſe in which it has been taken by thoſe who have been on the ſame ſide of the queſtion. This would be to renounce orthodoxy in many inſtances, I doubt not. And what point of <hi>orthodoxy</hi> is given up or the leaſt weakened by the ſenſe I have given of the text, I cannot imagine. Whereas by eſpouſing the ſenſe which I am oppoſing an important point of orthodoxy is, I think, implicitly given up (which indeed is given up by Mr. M. thro' his whole book;) viz. that unregenerate ſinners do not with their whole hearts oppoſe Jeſus Chriſt and the way of ſalvation by him. In this view, an attempt to reſtore this text to the true ſenſe, is to eſpouſe the cauſe of orthodoxy. And it does not fright me at all to be told that Arminians underſtand this text as I do. For who would not much rather join with the groſſeſt Arminians ſo far as they are right, than with the moſt orthodox Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts, wherein they are wrong?</p>
               <p>Mr. M. aſks, <q>If this text does not reſpect the unconverted, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join duties upon them, where can there be any paſſage found in the bible that has any reference to them?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If this is the only text in the bible that enjoins unregenerate duties and doings, I think the doctrine of duties enjoined on the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, to be done by them while ſuch, which Mr. M. has ſo zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly eſpouſed, ſtands on a very weak and precarious foundation—But it ſeems Mr. M. is not in earneſt here: but only makes this out-cry, and aſks this queſtion to anſwer a particular end: For before he has done, he thinks he finds ſcripture enough beſides this, which enjoins duties upon the unconverted, to be done by them while ſuch,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 70.</note> and ſays that "theſe performances of the ſinner are encouraged by God thro'out the ſcriputres."<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 82.</note> But this will be more particularly conſidered hereafter.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. as many others have, takes this text in Luke, to be parallel with that in Matthew,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chap. VII. 13, 14.</note> "Enter ye in at the ſtrait gate; becauſe ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life."</p>
               <p>There is perhaps no good reaſon for this. The former ſays nothing about the <hi>narrow way;</hi> but ſpeaks of a gate only, which, as has been obſerved, is in the following words called the <hi>door</hi> which ſhall be ſhut, when this life is at an end. But if it is granted that theſe two texts are parallel, meaning the ſame thing, Mr. M. will gain nothing by it in favor of unregenerate ſtrivings and doings: for upon this ſuppoſition <hi>ſtriving</hi> to enter in, and actually entering in are the ſame thing. But to enter in at the ſtrait gate is certainly not any thing that unregenerate men do.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. has indeed attempted to prove that ſtriving to enter the ſtrait gate intends, ſomething previous to actual entrance: and his argument is ſo remarkable, that I will tranſcribe every word of it. <q>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, i. e. ſtrive to enter upon the chriſtian life,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:011295_0052_0F869F01D837FF38"/>
as explained above. And is not this attempt to enter, previous to actual entrance, ſince the former ſometimes exiſts without the latter? For many I ſay unto you will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 70.</note>
                  </q> Here, in order to form his argument, he makes <hi>ſtriving</hi> to enter, and <hi>ſeeking</hi> to enter to mean one and the ſame thing: for he proves the former is not connected with entering in, from Chriſt's declaring the latter is not. This makes the text to run thus, "Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for verily I ſay unto you, this ſtriving ſhall in many inſtances be to no purpoſe, and you may ſtrive as much as you will and yet never enter! This I believe is quite a <hi>new ſenſe</hi> of the text, and is peculiar to Mr. M. and I hope and truſt will remain ſo.</p>
               <p>But let us hear "the true and genuine ſenſe of the text" from Mr. M. in the following words. <q>Were I allowed to ſpeak freely my <hi>humble ſenſe</hi> of the text, to me it appears, that by entering the ſtrait gate, is meant active converſion to God, or a compliance with the covenant of grace, in the way of faith, &amp;c.—This is the gate we muſt enter upon pain of eternal damnation. What! And not required <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ſtrive</hi> in this matter! Thrice amazing!<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 48, 49.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is a violent diſcharge or fervent zeal by way of ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mation, as all will perceive: but the <hi>humble ſenſe</hi> as well as the argument ſeem to be quite loſt by the means; at leaſt, are not ſo eaſily perceived. Since Mr. M. has had ſo long a time to cool, calm down, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> at ſuch a diſtance from him I will venture, to ſay, if entering the ſtrait gate means active converſion, in the way of faith, then ſtriving to enter is doing that by which men enter, or actually converting to God, and believing, or that which is done with a good will to this, which is the ſame. And all that ſtriving which is in oppoſition to converting and believing, &amp;c. (as are all the ſtrivings of the unregenerate) is not ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enter the ſtrait gate; but ſtriving to do ſomething elſe; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtriving in direct oppoſition to it.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER ſentence which Mr. M. finds great fault with is in the following words, <q>It has been obſerved that the end of uſing or atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the means of grace is inſtruction.</q> He thinks it is very wrong indeed, and of a bad tendency to ſay the end of the uſe of means is <hi>inſtruction:</hi> And undertakes to ſhew "that the end of attending on the means of grace, is grace, the fruits of holineſs."<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 51, 52.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In order to ſee how groundleſs Mr. M's objection is, and how very wrong and injurious is his repreſentation of this matter, nothing more is needful than to refer the reader to the whole paſſage from which he takes theſe words:<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 121, &amp;c.</note> Yea, all he ſays upon this is ſufficiently refuted in the paragraph from which he takes them, which is contained in leſs than ten lines.</p>
               <p>Having taken notice in the words which Mr. M. quotes, that it had been obſerved that the end of uſing or attending on the means of grace is inſtruction, I proceed to ſay, <q>The queſtion now is, What end this inſtruction anſwers; Of what advantage is it to have the truth ſet before the mind, and to have the attention of the mind fixed upon it?</q> From this it ſufficiently appears, had I not ſaid another word,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:011295_0052_0F869F01D837FF38"/>
that I did not conſider inſtruction or knowledge as the ultimate end of means; becauſe the very inquiry I am upon is, "What end this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction anſwers?" But Mr. M. goes on and harangues away for a page or two, againſt my making inſtruction the ultimate end of means; in diſtinction from grace or holineſs and ſalvation. If Mr. M. did not read the whole of this paſſage, eſpecially the whole paragraph and even ſentence from which he quotes, he is doubtleſs very much to blame: but if he did, it will be difficult to conceive how he could ignorantly make ſuch a groſs miſtake and very injurious miſrepreſentation. The firſt and immediate end which is anſwered by the uſe of means is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, <q>or, (as I further expreſs it) to lead the mind to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that truth, of which it was before ignorant, or to renew the attention to truth already known, and fix the mind upon it.</q> And then I go on to tell what end <hi>this</hi> anſwers, and particularly ſhew that it prepares the mind in which there is a right <hi>taſte,</hi> or whenever it ſhall be brought to this, to exerciſe holineſs. And then go on to ſhew how important and neceſſary it is that the unregenerate ſhould be all atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the conſtant uſe of means, as the only way in which they may hope for ſalvation. Mr. M. not only aſſerts from this, that I make the only end of the uſe of means to be inſtruction; but goes on to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome dangerous conſequences that will follow from it. But as they are conſequences of his own inventing, and are taken from what I never aſſerted, and in direct contradiction to what I ſay, I ſhall not further trouble myſelf, or the reader with them.</p>
               <p>BUT Mr. M. goes on, I think, from bad to worſe, and ſuffers his imagination, or ſomething elſe, to run quite away with him; for he proceeds to remark on another exceptionable paſſage of mine, which is in the following words. <q>If it ſhould be aſked, What good all this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and knowledge will do the unregenerate, who are under the dominion of an hard and impenitent heart, and will continue ſo until a new heart is given in regeneration? If this knowledge will be of no ſervice to them, and really do them no good, and they are yet as far from ſalvation as ever; then there is no encouragement for them to attend on the means of grace, in order to obtain it, and keep up a view and ſenſe of the truths of chriſtianity in their minds.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I having ſhewn the neceſſity of inſtruction and knowledge, and the mind's attending to the truth, in order to the exerciſes of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, &amp;c. In theſe words proceed to propoſe a query and objection, which I ſuppoſed would naturally ariſe in the mind of the reader; that by anſwering theſe I might more fully clear up this matter, and ſhew what end inſtruction anſwers, and the good this will do the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; and in what ſenſe they who thus attend are not ſo far from ſalvation as others. And this I proceed to do, as an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this query and objection. Now Mr. M. takes this query and objection, which I introduce in order to anſwer, to be certain aſſertations of my own, viz. that this inſtruction and knowledge will <hi>in fact</hi> do no good, is of no ſervice to the unregenerate; and leaves them as far from ſalvation as ever. And upon ſuch a groſs miſtake and miſrepreſentation, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues

away for near ſeven pages. And what is not the leaſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble here is, that he makes uſe of what I had ſaid in anſwer to this objection, and to ſhew that the ſuppoſitions made in it are not true, to confute me, and to prove the ſame thing, as he imagined, againſt me: I ſay, <hi>as he imagined,</hi> but it requires a great ſtretch of charity, I confeſs, to ſuppoſe him in earneſt here; and not rather trying how much he could miſrepreſent me, and impoſe on his reader. But here we muſt call in for our aſſiſtance his <hi>old age, dullneſs and weakneſs,</hi> of which he ſo often reminds the reader.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this query and objection, I endeavour to ſhew what is not the end which is anſwered by the ſinner's attendance on means, while impenitent; and what good the inſtruction and knowledge he gets does <hi>not</hi> do, while he oppoſes, and lives in the abuſe of it. Under this head the paſſages are found, which have given the chief offence to Mr. M. and which have been particularly attended to in the foregoing ſections. I then proceed to ſay what end and purpoſe this does anſwer, and what encouragement there is, in this view, to attend on means with engagedneſs and perſeverance to which Mr. M. has made no objection.<note n="*" place="bottom">This I have the more largely conſidered in what I have ſince publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which the reader may conſult, if he pleaſes.

               </p>
               <p>As all he ſays for ſo many pages<note n="†" place="bottom">from P. 51, to P. 61.</note> is founded on the groſs miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations I have mentioned; nothing more need be ſaid by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. However, I will take leave briefly to remark upon ſeveral things contained in theſe pages, before I leave them.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. here repreſents me as not including external reformation of open, groſs ſins in what is preparatory to converſion, or ſaying a word that implies it. Speaking of me and my tenth ſection, he ſays, <q>Thro' this whole ſection he has not ſo much as <hi>once</hi> mentioned the ſinner's breaking off from his ſins, as that whereby he is more in the way of God's mercy, than going on in them. All that belongs to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, as means, with the anthor, it ſeems, terminates in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and ſpeculative knowledge; as though it was not as much out of God's wonted way, to beſtow ſaving grace on the ſinner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned to all kind of wickedneſs, while ſuch, as on the groſsly ignorant.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe words are <hi>three</hi> contradictions, viz. to truth and fact—to his own repeated declaration: And to the words themſelves.</p>
               <p>They are contrary to fact. I ſay,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Enq. P. 120, 122.</note> 
                  <q>To uſe or attend the means of grace, is to make uſe of all the means of inſtruction in the things that relate to God's moral kingdom; to go into that conduct and practice, and do all thoſe things, which tend to lead us into the knowledge and the truths of divine revelation, and to keep up the attention of the mind to them; <hi>and carefully to avoid whatever has a contrary tendency.</hi>
                  </q> Here I ſpeak of "the ſinner's breaking off from his ſin, as that whereby he is more in the way of mercy, if he who does ſo is in the way of uſing the beſt means of inſtruction, which I ſuppoſe
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:011295_0053_0F869F01E41DCDC8"/>
none will queſtion. And I expreſsly ſay that I mean <hi>that</hi> "knowledge which <hi>no openly vicious, or careleſs ſinner</hi> ever obtains."<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 183.</note> How then could Mr. M ſay, <q>He <hi>has not ſo much as once</hi> mentioned the ſinner's breaking off from his ſins, as that whereby he is more in the way of mercy, &amp;c.?</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this aſſertion he has contradicted himſelf, as he has repeatedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the contrary, and thro' his whole book ſuppoſes that I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>reformed ſinner,</hi> and no other. Thus he ſays<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 54.</note> 
                  <q>Here let it be noted, that 'tis fully conceeded by the author, that the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, under conſideration, have all degrees of light and conviction of divine truth, that can agree to an unregenerate ſtate:—all that there is in a common work of the Spirit of God, preparatory to ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, the inlightening of natural conſcience, <hi>putting the ſinner upon reformation of life,</hi> &amp;c.</q> It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eems that what he here deſires may be <hi>noted,</hi> had entirely ſlipped his mind before he had got four pages; for he then utterly denies that the author had conceded, or ſo much as once mentioned any ſuch thing!</p>
               <p>But, to ſay no more of <hi>theſe</hi> contradictions, it is to be obſerved that the words I am conſidering <hi>are contradictory to themſelves.</hi> His word are, <q>As tho' it was not as much out of God's wonted way, to beſtow ſaving grace on the ſinner, <hi>abandoned to all kind of wickedneſs,</hi> while ſuch, as on the <hi>groſsly ignorant.</hi>
                  </q> Theſe words ſuppoſe that a ſinner who is abandoned to all kind of wickedneſs, may not be groſsly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and deſtitute of that knowledge, of which I ſpeak in my tenth ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which is an abſurdity and contradiction in itſelf. For ſecurity in ſin, implies groſs ignorance with reſpect to the knowledge of which I ſpeak; even ignorance of the moſt eſſential and important things, neceſſary to be known, in order to exerciſe faith, repentance, &amp;c: There is an abſurdity in ſuppoſing ſuch an one to have any tolerable degree of the inſtruction and knowledge of which I ſpeak, this being peculiar to the awakened, convinced ſinner of whom I am ſpeaking, and is as inconſiſtent with a courſe of open profligacy and wickedneſs, as light is with darkneſs.</p>
               <p>I would alſo remark upon the following words. <q>Upon this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all the attainments of the unregenerate, ſuch as awakening, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, reformation, legal humiliation, and whatſoever is preparatory to a ſaving faith, are no grounds at all of thankfulneſs to God. If they are really ſuch worthleſs things, what are of no ſervice to the unregenerate, can do them no good, and on the account of which, <hi>conſidered in themſelves,</hi> they are not leſs wicked than they would be without them, abandoning themſelves to all manner of wickedneſs; in this caſe to give thanks to God for them, would be no leſs than to mock God, giving thanks for a thing of nought.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 58, 59.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words are predicated upon my ſaying, as Mr. M. has ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly underſtood me, that all this conviction, &amp;c. of the unregenerate are of no ſervice to them, and anſwer no end, becauſe I introduced a queriſt aſking, what good theſe things did, that the matter might be
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:011295_0054_0F869F028761E098"/>
explained in my anſwer; which has been before obſerved. Put at Mr. M. goes further than all this here, and repreſents, that I had ſaid, that on the account of theſe things, <hi>conſidered in themſelves,</hi> the unregenerate are not leſs wicked, than they would be without them, abandoning themſelves to all manner of wickedneſs. I am ſure I have not ſaid or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated any ſuch thing. All I ſay of the convinced ſinner's not being leſs wicked, but more ſo, is conſiſtent with theſe things being leſs ſinful <hi>conſidered in themſelves;</hi> for I expreſsly place their greater ſinfulneſs, not in theſe things, but in ſomething elſe. Why then did Mr. M. put in theſe words, <hi>conſidered in themſelves,</hi> unleſs it was on purpoſe to add to his other miſrepreſentations; or becauſe he could not anſwer his purpoſe without them?</p>
               <p>As for grounds of thankfulneſs for awakening, conviction, &amp;c. where is the difficulty, on ſuppoſition they are attended not with leſs, but greater ſinfulneſs? The greater ſinfulneſs conſiſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the abuſe of thoſe things, which are conſidered in themſelves, great advantages and favors. There is no ground of thankfulneſs indeed for this greater wickedneſs, of which theſe things are the occaſion: But is there therefore no reaſon of thankfulneſs for a favor, becauſe, by abuſing it all the benefit of it is loſt, and it by this means becomes the occaſion of greater guilt and more dreadful ruin, than could have took place in any other way? This muſt be true, elſe what Mr. M. ſays here is leſs than nothing to his purpoſe; even directly contrary to an important truth.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER paſſage of mine which Mr. M. has ſeen fit to remark upon, is the ſimilitude of a father and two ſons. The ſons run off, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to leave their father's houſe and ſervice. The father calls after them, adviſes and commands them to return. One ſtops and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to what his father has to ſay to him: the other pays no regard to what his father ſays, but runs on till he gets out of hearing. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved upon this that he who ſtopped and attended to what his father had to ſay, cannot properly be ſaid to obey his father's command, if, after all, he refuſes to return; <q>and may by the light and conviction laid before him by his father, in conſequence of his ſtopping and attending, be more guilty in refuſing to ſubmit to him, than the other that has been out of hearing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This laſt ſentence Mr. M. chiefly objects againſt. And firſt he ſays "This ſimilitude does by no means fully repreſent the ſtate of the caſe."<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 62.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. This ſimilitude was not made with any particular reference to the general ſtate of the caſe between Mr. M. and me; but to illuſtrate my anſwer to a particular objection which I was then conſidering.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Enq. P. 140, 141.</note> If it anſwers the particular caſe as it is put in the objection, which it was deſigned to illuſtrate; it anſwers the end propoſed.</p>
               <p>However, let us ſee wherein it fails. Mr. M. ſays, <q>Here is nothing of the awakened, reformed ſinner, ſave only his making a pauſe, ſtopping his career, when running away, and attending to what his father had to ſay.</q> I aſk, What more takes place in ſuch a ſinner, that is not here repreſented? Mr. M. has not told. However, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to "propoſe a query or two, lame and defective as it is."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:011295_0054_0F869F028761E098"/>
He aſks <q>What was the true cauſe why A (the ſon who run-off) ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his ears, run off, &amp;c.—when B (the other ſon) hearkened ſo far as to ſtop his wicked courſe, &amp;c.?—What can be the true cauſe of this difference, but a more wicked ſtate of mind in A?</q>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. The true cauſe of this might be ſome ſuggeſtions made to B's mind, of the dreadful conſequence of thus leaving his father, &amp;c. which, were conveyed to him by or together with his father's words, and not to A. This, I own, muſt be ſuppoſed in order to make the caſe in this reſpect repreſent that of an awakened ſinner. The awakened, reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner, is brought to this ſtate by influences on his mind and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by which he is made to ſee, and, in a ſenſe, feel the ſad and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtate he is in, which will immediately ſtop him in his career of open wickedneſs: I ſay this is the effect of influences on his mind and conſcience which A has not: Therefore it is not in the leaſt owing to the leſs wicked ſtate of mind of B, that there is this difference. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mr. M. ſhould aſk this queſtion, ſince he ſo zealouſly holds to the influences of the Spirit of God in awakening the conſciences of ſinners. If I had aſked ſuch a queſtion, Mr. M. would have had more reaſon to ſuſpect and <hi>inſinuate</hi> that I had <q>an inclination to favor the NEW DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINITY, that entirely denies any preparatory work, in order to ſaving faith, by the common influences of the Spirit,</q> than he had from any thing that I have ſaid.<note n="*" place="bottom">See P. 55.</note> Mr. M. ſurely does not ſuppoſe that in order to ſinners being awakened by the Spirit of God, they muſt firſt become leſs ſinful in the ſtate of their minds than they were, or be leſs ſinful than others. We ſee then the true reaſon why one ſinner is awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and another is not, can eaſily be given, without ſuppoſing a more wicked ſtate of mind in the latter. And it is a little ſtrange Mr. M. could not think of it, in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. goes on to aſk, <q>Will any one in this view of the caſe ſay, that B is more wicked than A? What! Becauſe B is leſs bold, daring and fixed in his rebellion, and in caſting the utmoſt contempt on his father's authority?</q>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. It does not appear that "B is leſs bold, daring and fixed in his rebellion, &amp;c." But the contrary appears to be true. B's conſcience is awakened to ſee the dreadful ruin that is before him, if he does not return home to his father, and he trembles at the thought of it. He is convinced in his conſcience it is his duty and higheſt intereſt to return home; that there is no other way to eſcape the evil he dreads; and that in this way he ſhall certainly eſcape, and be made compleatly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Yet under all this light and conviction of conſcience, his heart riſes againſt his father in a more direct and ſtronger manner than ever it did before, in the moſt horrid exerciſes of hatred, enmity, and fixed oppoſition to his father's perſon, character and government; while he has not the leaſt inclination in his heart to ſubmit, or take one ſtep homeward, but perſiſts in an obſtinate refuſal. A, it is true, is a rebel, and is wholly to blame for running off as he did; but he is not in thoſe circumſtances, in which he can be ſo "bold and daring, and appear ſo
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:011295_0055_0F869F0340D05020"/>
obſtinately fixed in his rebellion as A. He has never had any realliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehenſions of the dreadful ruin which he is bringing on himſelf, but thinks all is well, and that he is purſuing his own happineſs in leaving his father's houſe. And he has very few thoughts and exerciſes about his father's government and family. B knows a thouſand times more about them, and about his duty and intereſt; and has ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more thoughts and exerciſes about this matter; and they are all in the moſt direct oppoſition to his father.</p>
               <p>We are therefore now prepared to anſwer Mr. M's queſtion. "Will any one in this view of the caſe ſay, that B is more wicked than A?" Yes, every one will ſay ſo, who will hearken to the dictates of common ſenſe. And he who ſays the contrary juſtifies the wicked, even in the height of wickedneſs, and reproaches, and caſts a high degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on the father.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. goes on to ſay, <q>Should it be pleaded that B is more wicked than A, becauſe B diſcovers a greater degree of tenderneſs and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of conſcience ſinned againſt, than A in non-ſubmiſſion. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that to argue thus, would be prepoſterous and abſurd to the laſt degree. For, upon this principle, the moſt abandoned ſinner under the goſpel, having waſted his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſinned away his moral ſenſe, ſo that he is paſt feeling, as the ſcripture expreſſeth it, may commit the moſt atrocious wickedneſs, and yet be innocent, becauſe paſt feeling. Whereas the truth in this caſe is juſt the reverſe; he, of the two under the ſame light and advantages, that can with the greateſt boldneſs and freedom commit the moſt enormous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without remorſe or feeling of conſcience, is the more deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here Mr. M. again forgets himſelf, and ſpeaks of one who has by a courſe of ſinning againſt his conſcience got rid of his awakening and conviction; whereas A is not ſuch an one; Nor am I ſpeaking of ſuch. But what he ſays here in the laſt ſentence, I think cannot be true. The ſinner who is moſt blind and ignorant with reſpect to his duty and true intereſt, and knows not that he is acting againſt either; ſo does not ſin at all againſt his conſcience, cannot be ſo great a ſinner as he, who has the greateſt light and conviction of conſcience relating to his duty and intereſt, and yet goes on in ſin, in direct oppoſition to this Yet this Mr. M. aſſerts here, but is it not moſt ſhockingly abſurd! It is alſo directly, contrary to what he ſays elſewhere, as he often ſpeaks of ſins againſt the light and dictates of conſcience as peculiarly aggravated. And this he ſuppoſes in this very paragraph; for he ſpeaks of <hi>waſting conſcience,</hi> as the great crime of the abandoned ſinner. Theſe two ſentences therefore ſtand in direct contradiction one to the other. The firſt aſſerts <hi>him</hi> to be the greateſt ſinner, who has moſt oppoſed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for his having <hi>waſted his conſcience,</hi> and <hi>ſinned away his moral ſenſe,</hi> as that wherein his great ſinfulneſs lies. The laſt aſſerts <hi>him</hi> to be the greateſt ſinner, who never had, and now has not any light and conviction of conſcience; and ſo has never had opportunity to <hi>waſte his conſcience,</hi> or ſin againſt it; for here his great ſinfulneſs conſiſts in
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:011295_0055_0F869F0340D05020"/>
ſinning <hi>without remorſe or feeling of conſcience,</hi> i. e. without any light and conviction of conſcience. I leave it to the reader, whether "to argue thus" is not more than "prepoſterous and abſurd to the laſt degree."</p>
               <p>Mr. M. adds, <q>But perhaps the grand plea in reſerve, to evince that B is more faulty than A (if different from what has already been ſaid) is, that B has a higher degree of internal light and conviction, that 'tis his duty to ſubmit to his father, than A had, therefore more guilty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This I think is not really "different from what has already been ſaid;" as <hi>tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>ſenſibility of conſcience</hi> muſt be the ſame thing with <hi>light and conviction of conſcience</hi> in the unregenerate. He has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made no advance, the <hi>plea</hi> is exactly the ſame with that which he mentioned and anſwered before. But perhaps he has a better anſwer now. It is this: If A has not ſo much light and conviction as B, it is altogether A's fault that he has not. And <q>if it be entirely and merely A's fault, ſhall not A be dealt with, as if he had that light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in his conſcience, which only, and merely his own fault, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtopping his ears, impeded his hearing?</q>
               </p>
               <p>This anſwer is quite different from the former, and even in direct contradiction to that. Whether it is better, is now to be inquired. I ſay it is a contradiction to the foregoing, becauſe there he places the great crime of the ſinner, not in ſinning againſt the light of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but in ſinning without any light and conviction. But here he has ſhifted the crime, and places it in ſinning againſt that light, which tho' the ſinner has not actually, yet he has virtually, becauſe it is wholly his own fault that he has it not: ſo is looked upon and treated by God as actually "ſinning againſt all that light, which he wilfully refuſed."</p>
               <p>It is granted that A is anſwerable for <hi>not having,</hi> and <hi>rejecting</hi> that light and conviction, which by his own fault he has not. But it will not be granted that he is anſwerable for actually ſinning againſt that light which he never had; and that he will be looked upon and dealt with by God, as if he actually had this light, and actually ſinned againſt it; for this would be to look upon him, and treat him contrary to the truth. There is a real and great difference between him, who actually has light and conviction in his conſcience, and him, who has it not, whatever may be the cauſe of this difference. And to look upon them and treat them, as if there was no difference, is certainly to contradict the truth of fact.</p>
               <p>If Mr. M's poſition is true, the moſt ſtupid, blind and ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon under the goſpel is as guilty, as great a ſinner, in not embracing the goſpel, as he who has the greateſt degree of light and conviction of conſcience, and yet perſiſts in the higheſt exerciſes of enmity againſt Chriſt, and oppoſition to all the light he has. And he who is guilty of ſtopping his ears, and putting himſelf out of the way and beyond the reach of all means of light and inſtruction, by one act, is as great a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he who ſpends a whole life in the moſt horrid acts of rebellion and enmity againſt God, contrary to the cleareſt light of his conſcience:
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:011295_0056_0F869F0408B47848"/>
ſo that one ſingle act which occaſions ignorance in refuſing to admit the light that is offered, is as great a crime, and carries as much guilt in it, as all the actions of high rebellion and enmity againſt God, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the cleareſt light and conviction of conſcience, thro' a whole eternity. This muſt be ſo, if A is accountable for ſinning againſt all that light which he wilfully refuſed, and ſo had not; and is as guilty as B, who actually had it, and yet ſinned againſt it. A heathen, for inſtance, who was once invited and had a fair opportunity to come into a chriſtian country, and enjoy the light of the goſpel, and refuſed; and ſo lives and dies in heatheniſh darkneſs, is as guilty as he who has liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his days under the light of the goſpel, and had great and clear light and conviction of conſcience and has conſtantly abuſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt it all, in ten thouſands acts of the moſt horrid enmity againſt God, which the heathen never was guilty of, it being impoſſible he ſhould in his circumſtances. And according to this, the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant creature under the goſpel will be reckoned and dealt with by God as having abuſed all the light which he might have had, had he been perfectly holy from his childhood to the end of his life; and will be found as guilty, as if he actually had all this light, and had all his days abuſed, and ſinned againſt it all. And Paul, who did many things againſt Chriſt and his church in ignorance and unbelief, was as guilty as if he had all the light and conviction that Peter, or any of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles had, and muſt have been dealt with accordingly, had he not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>I may here ſay in Mr. M's word?, "I appeal to the impartial reader, Whether theſe be not abſurdities by no means to be admitted in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? And whether it is <hi>poſſible</hi> to avoid them, the principle advanced being admitted?"<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The only argument Mr. M. produces to ſupport this contradictory aſſertion is, the words of Chriſt with reſpect to the Jews: "But now have they both ſeen, and hated, both me and my father."<note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. XV. 24.</note> He ſays Chriſt treats them here as if they actually ſaw his divinity, tho' it does not appear that they actually ſaw it; but were blinded thro' the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wickedneſs and prejudices of their hearts, and were not, at leaſt many of them, convinced that he was the Meſſiah. "And ſo were reckoned with by God, as if they had ſeen it; becauſe nothing but their own meer faultineſs prevented it."</p>
               <p>ANS. The divine character was clearly ſet before them, in the perſon and character of Chriſt; and this they diſapproved and hated; and that whether they were convinced in their judgment and conſciences that this was indeed the divine character or not. In this ſenſe they did ſee and hate both the Son and the Father; of this they were actually guilty, and were treated, and will be reckoned with accordingly. But it does not follow from this that they who were convinced in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences that he was the Chriſt, and yet rejected him; and they who verily thought he was an impoſtor, were equally guilty, and that the latter will be reckoned and dealt with, as if they actually had the light and conviction of the former, which they had not. Thanks be to God!

No ſuch abſurdity is contained in this paſſage of ſcripture, or any other.</p>
               <p>BUT Mr. M. has not done with A and B yet. He obſerves that I <q>have ſaid nothing of the <hi>preſent ſtate</hi> of B under conviction, as being more guilty than A, who ſtopped his ears, and run off.</q> He does not "attribute it to any want of <hi>ingenuity</hi> in the author," that he avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, being ſenſible that to aſſert B to be more guilty than A, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, "would be even ſhocking to common ſenſe. He then goes on to aſk <q>What moment of future time may be fixed upon, when B, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the ſimilitude above, will be more guilty than A?<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 64, 65.</note>

               </p>
               <p>ANS. It was not owing, I believe, to the want of ingeunity of the author, that he ſaid nothing about this, as the matter to be illuſtrated did not require it. However, he is now ready to anſwer the knotty queſtion. When B was in the circumſtances which repreſent an awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, convinced ſinner, he was more guilty than A. He was ſo, when he had ſhocking apprehenſions of the dreadful conſequence to him of ſlighting and diſobeying his father, and was convinced of the ſafety and happineſs he ſhould enjoy by hearkening to his father, and returning home, and that this was his indiſpenſable duty, without any delay, for which he had no excuſe; and yet his whole heart roſe againſt it and oppoſed it; and when the more his father diſcovered his goodneſs to him, in making him the higheſt offers, and urging him by all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motives to return and his mind was all attention to theſe matters, the more he hated him, and the ſtronger was the oppoſition of his heart to his taking one ſtep towards his father's houſe: when B was in theſe circumſtances, as the awakened, convinced is, <hi>then</hi> he was more guilty than. A.</p>
               <p>MR. M. goes on to aſk another queſtion. But an anſwer to this will be made in the next ſection, as it will more properly come in there. I now proceed to examine his remarks on another paſſage.</p>
               <p>IN anſwering the objection from the convinced ſinner's growing worſe, more ſinful in the attendance on means, that this was matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and a good reaſon why they ſhould not attend; I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that their greater ſinfulneſs did not conſiſt in their attendance on means, but in their impenitency, &amp;c. and therefore this could be no reaſon, why they ſhould neglect the proper means of ſalvation; And then proceeded to illuſtrate this in the following manner, <q>If the plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wicked is ſin, ſhall they therefore not plow? ſhall they not deſire food for themſelves and their families, and take the moſt likely method to obtain it? Their ſin does not conſiſt merely in their plowing, ſo that it would be a leſs ſin not to plow, than to do it; but in the wrong views and exerciſes of mind with which they plow, and in the want of right ones.<note n="†" place="bottom">Enq. P. 142.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. M. quotes only this one ſentence, "If the plowing of the wicked is ſin, ſhall they therefore not plow?" And ſays "that a part only is here put for the whole ſtate of the caſe and therefore can be no illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the point." And then goes on to ſtate it in his own way; and
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:011295_0057_0F869F04B8364A10"/>
repreſents it as if the man's ſin conſiſted in his plowing and providing for his family, ſo that his greater ſinfulneſs conſiſts in this, which gives all the plauſibleneſs there is in his ſtate of the caſe: whereas I had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly obſerved that the ſinfulneſs did not conſiſt in this, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, and for this end brought this inſtance to illuſtrate this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular truth, and not to illuſtrate the whole of my anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which I was conſidering.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. concludes what he ſays on this paſſage in the following words, <q>And now let the reader judge, <hi>the caſe being fairly ſtated,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall plow in this caſe; and whether the caſe only in part put, as at above, can at all ſerve to illuſtrate the author's point.</q> The read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is now to judge, whether the caſe as I put it, does not fully illuſtrate the point I was upon? And whether Mr. M. had any right to ſay he had <hi>fairly ſtated the caſe</hi> or had not rather groſsly miſ-ſtated it, and done violence to the paſſage which was then before his eyes?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>IN which it is conſidered, whether the doctrine that the awakened, convinced ſinner is more guilty and vile in the conſtant and painful attendance on the means of grace, than when he was in a ſtate of ſecurity and open profligacy, is an encouragement to ſinners to abandon themſelves to careleſneſs and vice, or any matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to an attendance on means?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. M. has repreſented the matter in this light, thro' his whole book. He ſuppoſes that awakened, convinced ſinners grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>leſs ſinful</hi> in the uſe of means, is matter of encouragement to attend; and that the contrary doctrine tends greatly to diſcourage them. And this he has particularly preſſed in the following paſſage.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 122.</note> 
                  <q>Theſe things, to the beſt of my ſmall diſcernment, naturally tend either to quiet ſecure ſinners in the careleſs neglect of means, going on in their ſins; or to damp and retard thoſe that are ſeriouſly inclined to exert themſelves, in a painful attendance on means and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life: Since every ſtep they take this way, while unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, they are on the whole involved in greater guilt, than they would have been had they continued in the wilful, careleſs neglect of means, obſtinately perſiſting in the groſſeſt wickedneſs, as above, under the ſame goſpel.</q> And in the next page he ſays that to deny that the awakened, convinced ſinner may be leſs ſinful, than in a ſtate of ſecurity and open wickedneſs, <q>is to lay a ſtumbling block in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners way, and to rob them of a precious branch of encouragement allowed them from the word of God, to ſtrive and run for eternal life, in all painful endeavours in the uſe of means,</q> And again he

                  <q>While we attempt to ſcare men from truſting in their duties, care muſt be had that we don't ſcare them from their duties, either by inſinuating that they are more vile in that attendance they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, while unregenerate, than in the neglect of it; and he puts the following queſtion to me; whether this way of reaſoning in favour of A, as tho' he might expect ſome notable abatement of his guilt, by ſtopping his ears and going out of hearing, don't carry in it too much encouragement to the ſinners A repreſents, who abandon themſelves to wickedneſs, and neglect the means of grace: Since they are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inclined in themſelves, without the help of others, to deviſe pleas in their own favor.<note n="¶" place="bottom">P. 65.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. M. has not mentioned this as one of his arguments againſt the doctrine he ſets himſelf to oppoſe, where he undertakes to produce argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt it; but as is evident, he deſigns it as an argument not of the leaſt weight, and it will probably have more influence with ſome, than any thing elſe that he has offered. I therefore propoſe particularly to conſider it in this ſection.</p>
               <p>In order to determine whether there is any truth in this, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what are the motives which will induce the unregenerate to act or forbear acting in any caſe; or what is the principle they act upon, or the end which they always have in view. If we can find what theſe are, we may eaſily determine what tends to diſcourage, or to encourage them in all caſes; for this will be juſt according to the motives by which they are influenced. And here I ſuppoſe all will allow that the unregenerate are always influenced in all they do by what may be called <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. They are always ſeeking and purſuing that which is in their view, or ſeems to them to be for their own intereſt, and never act from any higher motive. The ſecure ſinner, whether he is an open profligate, or not, is puſuing ſome good in this world as his happineſs, becauſe it ſeems to him his own higheſt good in this ſtate. The ſinner whoſe conſcience is awakened in ſome meaſure to reallize a judgment to come, and future ſtate, and the dreadful end to which the ſinner is expoſed to come every moment, at once loſes his keen appetite for the pleaſures of time and ſenſe, and all his pleaſing worldly proſpects, and ſchemes drop and die, and he begins to feel that his whole intereſt lies in another world; and that he ſhall be happy or miſerable forever, according as he eſcapes hell and obtains heaven, or not. This excites in him the grand and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant inquiry," What muſt I do to be ſaved?" And he is willing to take any method, and uſe any means, conſiſtent with his continuing a perfect enemy to God, and holineſs, or his duty, which ſhall be preſcribed to him, as the moſt likely way to eſcape the evil which he dreads, and obtain the good which he deſires; or in other words, that ſhall appear moſt likely to promote his eternal intereſt.</p>
               <p>He is by the ſuppoſition, no more a friend to God and holineſs now, or an enemy to ſin, than he was before. And really cares not how much God is diſhonored, and whether he is a greater or leſs ſinner, if he may but anſwer his own ends. He does not fear and dread ſin, for its own ſake, or in itſelf conſidered: but purely becauſe of the conſequence to
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:011295_0058_0F869F08D84804C8"/>
him, which he now dreads. He is not afraid of ſin, or deſires to avoid it, from any true reſpect he has to God, and merely becauſe it is againſt him, and diſhonorable and offenſive to him; but purely from his fear of eternal puniſhment. This being the caſe, it is eaſy to ſee it would be in vain to tell him that he will be leſs guilty and vile in God's ſight, in conſequence of his attending on means, &amp;c. For this in itſelf would not be the leaſt encouragement and motive to him to attend. And juſt as much in vain would it be to tell him, in order to diſſuade him from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on means, that if he continued impenitent, he would be more guilty and vile, than the careleſs ſinner; for this will not be the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to him, ſo long as he views this the moſt likely way to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>If therefore the ſinner can be perſuaded, that the probability of his being ſaved or loſt does not depend upon his being a greater ſinner or a leſs; but he is the moſt likely to be ſaved, who attends moſt conſtantly and earneſtly on the means of grace, in the cleareſt view and ſenſe of the important truths revealed in the bible, and conſtant attention to them; and that this is the only hopeful way: I ſay, if he can be convinced of this, it will be a ſufficient motive and encouragement to him to attend, and will influence him, in proportion to his belief, and ſenſe of a future ſtate, and of the ſad and miſerable caſe in which he now is. And no other motive can be thought of, that will have the leaſt influence on him, to encourage him to attend on means, or as matter of diſcouragement. In a word, the unregenerate ſinner dreads ſin only as connected with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; therefore he dreads that ſin moſt, which, in his view, moſt expoſes him to deſtruction, and is moſt likely to ruin him forever; but theſe are the ſins committed in a ſtate of ſecurity, or in the neglect of means, and not thoſe committed under awakenings and convictions, and in a conſtant attendance on means; however more heinous and vile the latter are than the former. Therefore the ſinner only needs to be well inſtructed, in order to have all the encouragement he is capable of to attend on means. Let him be convinced that this is the moſt likely courſe he can take to be ſaved, and that there is no other likely way, however great may be the guilt he contracts while he continues impenitent, and it will be a ſtrong and prevalent motive with him to take it, in proportion to his dread of eternal deſtruction, and deſire of future happineſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. does therefore in the paſſages above cited go upon a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which is directly contrary to the truth, viz. That the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate do fear and dread ſin on its own account, without any conſideration of its conſequence; and have ſome true reſpect to God and holineſs; drop this ſuppoſition, and they appear to be without any foundation at all. If the ſinner fears and hates ſin, for its own ſake, and from reſpect to God, why then does he go on in ſin? Let him forſake it, and all is well. If therefore he does neglect means, and live in known ways of open ſin, under a pretence that he is afraid of that greater ſin he ſhall be guilty of, if he attends on means and becomes a convinced ſinner; it is certain it is but pretence in which there is no truth: for if he is afraid of greater ſinfulneſs, why not of leſs; why does he go on in known ſin? If he hates
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:011295_0058_0F869F08D84804C8"/>
ſin; and hence ſincerely deſires to be delivered from it, why does he not leave off ſinning and fly to Chriſt the only deliverer?</p>
               <p>If a ſinner objects againſt attempting to pray, and ſays he is afraid to do it, becauſe the prayer of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. He may be aſked what he is afraid of? If he is indeed afraid of ſin; and ſo avoids prayer that he may avoid ſin, why is he not equally concerned to avoid all ſin, or ſin in any other way? If he is willing to do this, he may pray without ſinning; and ſo the objection ceaſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> But if he is not willing to leave off ſinning, but is determined to go on, then there is no ſincerity or weight in the objection, for he really cares not how much ſin he commits, and he is indifferent whether he ſins in one way or another. Beſides, if he is afraid of ſinning in prayer, left he ſhould be damned for it; why does he not fear ſinning in any other way, for the ſame reaſon; for the ſins men commit in praying, are no more likely to prove fatal to them, than any other way of ſinning: Yea this is the only likely way to eſcape deſtruction, and obtain ſalvation.</p>
               <p>It will be laid, perhaps, tho' the attendance on means, &amp;c. is the only likely way to obtain ſalvation, however guilty and vile the ſinner may be in this way; yet, if he finally miſcarries and fails of ſalvation, he will be more miſerable than if he had neglected all means and abandoned himſelf to the ſins of a ſtate of ſecurity; and the ſecure ſinner will be hence induced to continue in his old way, and it will be a diſcouragement with all in the way of attendance on means. I anſwer. If any one ſhould neglect the means of grace on this pretence, he would be ſelf-condemned. For there is no perſon who is not almoſt conſtantly run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ventures in hopes of obtaining his end, when he knows that if he fails of the end propoſed, he ſhall loſe all his pains and coſt, and will be, on the whole, a great loſer, ſo that he had better not have been at the pains and expence, than to do this, and yet fail of the end in view. And the more intereſting and important the affair is, in a perſon's view, the greater venture will he run as a means to obtain it, and the greater will be his care and attention in the matter. While men are conducting thus in their temporal affairs, and are pretending the unreaſonableneſs of doing ſo in concerns of infinitely greater moment, and hence refuſing to run any venture in the latter caſe, we may be ſure there is no ſincerity, and that this is not the bottom of the matter. Beſides, this objection may be as well made by a heathen, to whom it is propoſed to go and live in a country where the goſpel is preached, or by any others, againſt taking pains to put themſelves under greater religious advantages than they now enjoy. For if they ſhould enjoy theſe advantages, and abuſe them, as the moſt do who have them, their condemnation will be greater, and they be more miſerable forever, than if they had never enjoyed them.—If it ſhould be ſaid, that if they become awakened, convinced, reformed ſinners, they will be leſs ſinful, and not quilty, or miſerable, tho' they periſh, as if they had not enjoyed thoſe ſuperior advantages: I ſay, if this ſhould be ſaid, and granted; yet it muſt be obſerved that they are altogether uncertain that they ever ſhall be ſuch: or that they ſhall not abuſe all their advantages ſo as to become much more guilty and vile, than if they
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:011295_0059_0F869F0A0DA8D380"/>
never had enjoyed them. Therefore they know not, but every ſtep they take to obtain any religious advantage, will be worſe than loſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the occaſion of their greater guilt, and more awful condemnation.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if the doctrine of awakened convinced ſinners growing worſe, more guilty and vile, is any juſt ground of diſcouragement, to take uſe of means, then there is juſt ground of diſcouragement: to take any pains to enjoy any religious means and advantages whatſoever, or to uſe any with others, by preaching the goſpel to them, &amp;c. For unleſs God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents it by his ſovereign grace, all this will be but the occaſion of their greater ſinfulneſs, and more aggravated deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Mr. M and every one elſe may therefore be ſure that the doctrine of the ſinner's growing more vile in the uſe of means, if his eyes are fully opened, does not give the leaſt encouragement to any, "to abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to wickedneſs, and neglect the means of grace;" and never was, nor can be reaſonably improved ſo by any. Nor does it tend in the leaſt degree to "damp and retard thoſe that are ſeriouſly inclined to exert themſelves in a painful attendance on means and amendment of life." So far from this, that it is the only doctrine that can give proper and conſiſtent encouragement to thoſe who are under clear and genuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions; and the contrary tends directly to drive ſuch into diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deſpair.</p>
               <p>This I particularly obſerved, and endeavoured to make quite clear and evident in the concluſion of my ſection on means, in the following words,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 144, 145.</note> 
                  <q>If ſinners were to take their only encouragement to hope for ſalvation in the uſe of means, from their being leſs ſinners than others, <hi>or not ſo bad as they once were,</hi> this would tend to take all encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from thoſe, who are under genuine convictions, and have any true view of their own ſinfulneſs, and leave them in abſolute deſpair. For all ſuch, as they have a more clear and full fight of their own ſins than they can have of others, are naturally led to view themſelves as the greateſt ſinners. And as by attendance on means, they get more and more acquainted with their own hearts, their own ſinfulneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes in their view, they are ſo far from looking on themſelves as leſs ſinners than they were, that they naturally view themſelves in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary light.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The only proper way therefore to encourage the ſinner, who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any great degree of genuine conviction of ſin, and concern about his eternal intereſt, to attend on means with hope, is not to lead him to expect hereby to become leſs ſinful; but to teach him the true end and deſign of means. He will then know that the great wickedneſs of his heart, exerciſed in all he does, and his appearing to himſelf to grow worſe rather than better, which is commonly the chief ground of diſcouragement to ſuch, is really no reaſon why he ſhould neglect means; but rather an encouragement conſtantly to attend.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. M inſtead of taking any notice of my argument here, wholly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooks what I had in view, viz. To ſhew that the doctrine I had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced could be no diſcouragement to the ſinner under proper awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and convictions; becauſe he always views himſelf in the very light
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:011295_0059_0F869F0A0DA8D380"/>
in which this doctrine ſets him, i. e. as conſtantly growing worſe, more wicked and vile: and that the contrary doctrine, viz. That ſinners under conviction grow leſs ſinful than they were before, and muſt do ſo in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ſaved, was ſo far from giving encouragement to ſuch, that it tended to drive them to deſpare: I ſay, Mr. M inſtead of taking notice of this, and attempting to oppoſe and refuſe it, remarks only upon the laſt ſentence, accuſing me, with altering my expreſſions and lowering down from the point I had aſſerted, to ſomething elſe, which he allows to be true, not chooſing he concludes to cloſe my diſcourse with that which would be ſo ſtartling to a common reader, &amp;c. His words are,—<q>And in the cloſe of his diſcourſe he comes down wonderfully; in theſe words, 'His <hi>appearing to himſelf</hi> to grow wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>—as really no reaſon why he ſhould neglect means; but rather an encouragement conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attend.' FULLY ORTHODOX THIS. But why this abatement? If the principle advanced in the former pages is true, why not thro' the whole? If it was of importance to be ſet up; why not to be kept up, eſpecially in the cloſe? Which if it had, would have ſtood thus, viz. The awakened ſinner's <hi>really</hi> growing worſe, on the whole, in attendance on means, as conviction of ſin ariſes, whatever be his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, amendment of life, &amp;c than he would have been continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecure, and going on in the practice of all manner of moſt enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wickedneſs,—is really no reaſon why he ſhould neglect means, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 66, 67.</note>

               </p>
               <p>I am ready to aſk here, what does Mr. M. mean!

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> is really no matter of diſcouragement; but the contrary: whereas it muſt be matter of the greateſt diſcouragement on any other plan. And might I not, in this view, once mention the ſinner's <hi>appearing to himſelf</hi> to grow worſe, when the argument I was upon required it; and when inſtead of this to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the ſinner's <hi>really</hi> growing worſe, would have been quite nonſenſe, without being accuſed with going off from my point, coming down wonderfully, &amp;c. as it I was afraid in the cloſe to aſſert what I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore advanced, and endeavoured to eſtabliſh?</p>
               <p>There are two leading principles that run thro' Mr. M's book, which I had in view, and endeavoured to confute in the three laſt pages of my ſection on means. One is, that the only way for a perſon to be more likely to be ſaved, or not far from the kingdom of God, is to become leſs ſinful and ſo nearer the ſtate of a good man, God being more ready and diſpoſed to ſhew mercy to a leſs ſinner, than to a greater. The whole he ſays on the ſinner's being not far from the kingdom of God ſets the matter in this light. And from this he infers in the following words, <q>There is ſuch a thing among the unregenerate under the goſpel, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſtate nigh to or not far from the kingdom of God." And that their nearneſs in ſtate to the kingdom of God, or which is the ſame, to that of a good man, conſiſts in thoſe attainments whereby they are, on the whole, in the ſtate of their minds leſs vicious than either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others would be in the abſence of thoſe things.<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 26, 27.</note>
                  </q> And again,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:011295_0060_0F869F0B49D89970"/>
he ſpeaks of the attainments of the unregenerate, ſuch as awakening, conviction, reformation, &amp;c. as that <q>whereby they are leſs wicked, and, in a true ſenſe of ſcripture, in ſtate brought nearer to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, to a ſtate of grace,</q> &amp;c.<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 59.</note> And in another place he repreſents the ſinner who is leſs diſpleaſing to God, to be more in the way of mercy, ſo more likely to be ſaved. Speaking of the awakened, convinced ſinner, and the careleſs and ſecure, he ſays the ſcripture <q>gives a ſort of preference to the former, at leaſt, as leſs diſpleaſing to God, and more in the way in which God's ſovereign mercy is won't to be displayed.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 96.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The other principle I have reference to is grounded upon this, viz; That if a perſon grows, not leſs ſinful, but more guilty and vile in the uſe of means, this is matter of great diſcouragement and that ſinners cannot be encouraged to attend on means in any other view, but that they may hereby become leſs ſinful and vil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Had Mr. M. attended to theſe pages, and taken what I think is the plain meaning of them; inſtead of making the groſs blunder and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation he has done, he muſt have been ſenſible, that what I here ſaid, was in oppoſition to theſe two principles, and found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerned to anſwer it. But he has been ſo far from this, that he has, in effect, conceded to it all, and very emphatically pronounced it orthodox.</p>
               <p>The reader will here particularly obſerve what he has pronounced orthodox. "His appearing to himſelf to grow worſe, is really no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he ſhould neglect means, <hi>but rather an encouragement conſtantly to attend.</hi> "Fully orthodox this!" And he allows that this generally or always is the caſe with ſinners under deep and genuine conviction, in the beginning of his book, where he ſays, <q>Divines of the beſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and greateſt note, have allowed that ſinners under deep and genuine convictions, converſing more ſenſibly with the wickedneſs of their own hearts and lives, have been ready to look on themſelves as greater ſinners than heretofore; yea, perhaps as growing daily worſe, and more hard hearted.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 7.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this, the following things are obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the ſinner's <hi>appearing to himſelf</hi> to grow worſe more guilty an1d vile, in the uſe of means, is no reaſon why he ſhould neglect means; than his really growing worſe is no matter of diſcouragement. For what <hi>appears</hi> to be true to the ſinner, muſt have juſt as much influence as if it was really ſo, until the appearance is removed, and the ſinner is convinced he was miſtaken. Therefore if this appearance is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, or reaſon why he ſhould neglect means; It's being really ſo is no diſcouragement. This is therefore at leaſt implicitly aſſerted in theſe words: and conſequently Mr. M. has aſſerted it in the ſtrongeſt manner, by pronouncing them orthodox, in the terms he has. What then becomes of all that he has ſaid, repreſenting this as a diſcouraging doctrine, <q>tending to damp and retard thoſe that are ſincerely inclined to exert themſelves,</q> &amp;c. <q>and laying a ſtumbling block in ſinners way, and robbing them of a precious branch of encouragement, &amp;c?</q>
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:011295_0060_0F869F0B49D89970"/>
He has here given all this up, as contrary to reaſon and truth; ſo has once more run into groſs ſelf-contradiction.</p>
               <p>It hence appears alſo, how unreaſonable Mr. M. is in repreſenting me as not daring to bring this principle out, and ſays here, <q>The awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened ſinner's <hi>really</hi> growing worſe in attendance on means, &amp;c—more vile than he would have been, continuing ſecure, &amp;c.—<hi>is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally no reaſon why he ſhould neglect means.</hi>
                  </q> For it is really brought out and aſſerted in the words I have uſed, as has been juſt obſerved: and Mr. M. has given his ſanction to it alſo in the ſtrongeſt terms, however "ſtartling to the common reader" he may think it will be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the ſinner under genuine and thorough convictions appears to himſelf to be much worſe than he was in a ſtate of ſecurity; then the doctrine that the ſinner under true convictions does grow leſs ſinful and vile, and that this is the only way in which he may hope to be ſaved, will do him no good; but will be the moſt diſcouraging doctrine that can be preached to him, and drive him to deſpair, if he believes it.</p>
               <p>It cannot do him any good, or be any encouragement to him to be told that he is now leſs ſinful and vile than he was; for by the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he will not believe it, but is confident that the contrary is true. But if he is taught, and he believes it, that this muſt be true of him, in order to his being in a likely way to be ſaved; this will be ſo far from encouraging him to go on, that he will conclude himſelf to be in a very bad way indeed, that his attendance on means has done him hurt rather than good; and ſo will give out, concluding that there is no hope for him in this way. Mr. M. has therefore, I think, by his own acknowledgement, in effect given up the whole book he has wrote, as quite uſeleſs, and to no purpoſe. For the doctrine he contends for can never be inculcated on the unregenerate, ſo as to be of any ſervice to them; but muſt be carefully kept out of their hearing, leſt it prove very miſchievous.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee how the doctrine of Mr. M's book muſt be applied to the unregenerate. He will tell the ſecure profligate that he muſt reform, and earneſtly attend on all means of grace: and for his encouragement will aſſure him, that in this way he will grow better, leſs ſinful and vile; and ſo get into a more likely way to be ſaved, and more in the way of God's mercy; in which he has no reaſon to expect to ſhare ſo long as he is ſo guilty and vile as he is at preſent. And the more he will reform, and the leſs ſinful he ſhall become; the nearer he will come to ſaving converſion, and the more likely will he be to obtain it. If the ſinner believes what he ſays, and from this encouragement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms all ways of known external ſin; and begins to attend on means; he may go on with good courage, and in his own view have a great degree of tenderneſs of conſcience, and carefully avoid all known ſin, and come up to all known duty. And if he is not led into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his own heart, and has no genuine conviction of ſin, and is not convinced of the great ſin of not loving God and believing on Chriſt, he will have high hopes from his imagined comparative goodneſs, or his becoming leſs ſinful than he was, by his reformations and duties,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:011295_0061_0F869F0B7A4B04F8"/>
and be confident that God is not ſo angry with him now; but takes a favorable notice of his doings and looks on him with approbation. He will now drink in Mr. M's doctrine with greedineſs, and it will be ſweet and comfortable to his ſoul. But alas! Whither will it lead him? To the ſame place, no doubt to which the proud phariſee went.</p>
               <p>But if by the divine influences he falls under genuine, thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, he will begin to appear to himſelf to be growing more guilty and vile than he was in a ſtate of ſecurity, inſtead of becoming leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as he was encouraged to expect. This ſinks his heart, all his hopes fail him; and he runs to Mr. M. to know what he ſhall do. What will Mr. M. ſay to him? Will he tell him, this is no matter of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; he has as much encouragement to go on as ever, altho' he continues to grow worſe and worſe? If he tells him this, which he has in effect declared to be fully orthodox; he will now retract and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contradict all he had preached to him before, and which is the fundamental doctrine of his whole book, as what he had better never have publiſhed; for it is not true, and has done no good, but hurt.</p>
               <p>If he perſiſts in his former doctrine, and tells the ſinner that tho' he appears to himſelf to be more ſinful; yet this is not his <hi>true</hi> ſtate; if it was he would be in a bad and hopeleſs way indeed: But he is really growing much better, leſs ſinful and vile than he was, ſo that God's anger is in a meaſure abated: He has reformed many groſs ſins, and done many duties, of all which God graciouſly approves, and takes a favorable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: And if he holds on, he will undoubtedly become in this way ſo much leſs ſinful than others, or than he once was, that God will beſtow ſalvation upon him, rather than upon thoſe who are more guilty and vile, having never reformed, and humbled themſelves at the feet of ſovereign mercy as he has done, nor nouriſhed ſuch tenderneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, &amp;c. I ſay, if he ſhould preach this, or, which is much the ſame, read over his book to him; the ſinner will either believe it, or he will not. If he believes it, and is brought to view himſelf not as growing worſe, but leſs ſinful, his convictions are at an end, he is no longer under genuine thorough convictions; for ſuch appear to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at leaſt, to grow more ſinful and vile. Therefore in order to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Mr. M's doctrine he muſt loſe his convictions; and they never can take place again, until he gives this doctrine up, and ſo perſeverance in the belief of this doctrine will infallibly carry him to hell, unleſs a ſinner may be converted without a proper work of conviction.</p>
               <p>If he does not believe it, and it is to be deſired in mercy to his ſoul he way not; for we, and Mr. M. too are ſure that he cannot as long at his convictions continue: I ſay, if he does not believe it, he will eſcape the miſchief, and all the pains taken to inculcate it will be in vain.</p>
               <p>If he believes it in <hi>part,</hi> viz. that ſinners under genuine convictions do become leſs ſinful, as the only hopeful way to be ſaved; and yet by the force of his own convictions appears to himſelf to be growing more ſinful; this will have a very bad, diſcouraging tendency indeed, as has been obſerved, and drive him into deſpair, as being too great a ſinner ever to hope for God's mercy. In order to relieve this ſinner Mr. M. muſt give up his great doctrine, which he wrote his book to defend;
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:011295_0061_0F869F0B7A4B04F8"/>
he muſt do it for a while at leaſt, as he has indeed done by the paſſage under conſideration, and tell him, that he may grow worſe, more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and vile, and yet be in a hopeful way, and have all poſſible encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to attend; for the end of the uſe of means to the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is not to make them leſs ſinful, but to lead them to that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſenſe of their true ſtate and character which the unregenerate may have. Thus the ſinner muſt believe the doctrine which I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, as long as his convictions continue and increaſe, or fall into deſpair; and can receive no other encouragement, but what is conſiſtent with this doctrine, of the ſinners growing worſe under convictions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and what is directly contrary to that of Mr. M.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. concludes this general head in the following words, <q>Now if in the author's view, it appeared too ſtartling to a common reader to cloſe his diſcourſe with this plain repreſentation of the ſtate of the caſe in debate; it had been a great favor, in my humble opinion, if he had been under the ſame reſtraint when he advanced it. To be ſure it had prevented me theſe my <hi>poor labours</hi> on the ſubject. And I think I may ſay with good aſſurance, it had prevented grief to many worthy fathers in the miniſtry, whoſe praiſe is in the goſpel thro' the churches; and who are not ſo far <hi>ſuperannuated,</hi> but that with good old Eli, they <hi>tremble</hi> for fear of the ark, when they ſee it in danger of a wrong touch, from the vigor and ſprightlineſs of younger years.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, and clearly ſhewed, I preſume, that I am quite clear of the charge which Mr. M. has brought againſt me, upon which, the words now tranſcribed are grounded; that I could not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed myſelf in the words which he preſcribes for me, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the argument I was upon, and being guilty of as great an oversight nearly as he has in making this charge.—And that what he ſays I ought to have ſaid, is implied in my words; and ſo implicitly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. And that he has fully aſſented to it, and pronounced it ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, in the ſame breath, in which he attempts to repreſent it ſo groſs and ſhocking an error, as to ſtartle a common reader.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I am not aſhamed of this doctrine; nor am I afraid to aſſert it, in its full length and breadth on all proper occaſions. Nor do I repent my publiſhing it; but think I have reaſon to bleſs God that I have been under no <hi>reſtraint</hi> that has prevented it, even although it has occaſioned "Theſe POOR <hi>labours</hi> of Mr. M on the ſubject:" Yea, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe I may ſuffer by it. Whether he had any call thus to exert himſelf; and whether theſe labours ought to be called <hi>poor,</hi> or by a better, or a worſe name, every reader will judge for himſelf. They have, however, I think, given me opportunity further to explain and vindicate an important truth, which tends to exalt the character of the adorable Jeſus, and abaſe the ſinner.</p>
               <p>Who theſe worthy, aged, <hi>trembling</hi> fathers are I know not, and have no inclination to detract from their praiſe. But I think I have a right to ſay <hi>they fear, where no fear is;</hi> and if they <hi>tremble,</hi> and handle the ark as Mr. M. has done, no thanks are due to them, that it has not been compleatly overſet long ago.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THE queſtion particularly ſtated; and arguments offered to prove the negative.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE queſtion is not, Whether any commands are given to the unregenerate? Or whether any thing is required of them, which it is their duty to comply with and perform? The unregenerate, it is granted, are under law, as much as the regenerate, and the former are required to be perfectly holy, as much as the latter, and are forbidden everything which is contrary to this. In a word, no duty is required of the regenerate, which the unregenerate are not alſo commanded to do. This may be true conſiſtently with their doing no part of their duty, and living in perfect rebellion againſt every command, while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate. And indeed, they who take the poſitive ſide of this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, allow that the unregenerate never do in any degree comply with thoſe commands which require holineſs; for they grant there is no true holineſs in any thing which they do. This Mr. M. conſtantly allows.</p>
               <p>The queſtion therefore is, Whether there are any commands given to the unregenerate, which do not require any thing truly holy; but only require ſuch exerciſes and doings which they may and do comply with, and truly perform, according to the true meaning and intent of the commands, while they are perfect enemies to all true holineſs?</p>
               <p>Mr. M. has zealouſly eſpouſed the affirmative ſide of this queſtion; and great part of his book is taken up in attempting to prove that God requires duties of the unregenerate, which they are to do, and may and do perform while in an unregenerate ſtate. He owns that I have not expreſsly denied that there are any ſuch duties required of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; but he has taken conſiderable pains to ſhew why there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect and even conclude that I held to no ſuch duties. I am ready to own the charge; and ſhall proceed to produce the arguments I have for the negative.</p>
               <p n="1">I. ACCORDING to our Saviour's account of the divine law or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, it requires nothing but love to God and our neighbour.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. XXII. 37—39.</note>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:011295_0062_0F869F0C38B7CA68"/>
And he expreſsly ſays that "on theſe two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."<note n="‡" place="bottom">v. 40.</note> That is, all that is required in the law and in the prophets, every injunction and command to be found in divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, really requires nothing but love to God and our neighbour; l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> ſenſe can be put upon theſe words of Chriſt. But would they bear another ſenſe, what St. Paul ſays on the ſame ſubject fixes the meaning; of them. He ſays "He that loveth another, <hi>hath fulfilled the law.</hi>" And again, "Love is the fulfilling of the law."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. XIII. 8, 10.</note> Love could not be the fulfilling of the law, if the law required any thing more than love, acted out to a perfect degree, and in a proper manner. Love is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>whole duty of man.</hi> Nothing more nor leſs is required. God has not given one precept to man in the law or the prophets, in the old teſtament or new, but what requires love to God, or man, or both, and is to be obeyed in the exerciſe of love, and no other way, or by nothing elſe. There is therefore no <hi>obedience</hi> but what conſiſts in love; and where there is nothing of this, there is no duty done; nothing that is required, and is due, is given. This, I conclude is a plain, inconteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible truth, as demonſtrably evident as any truth contained in divine revelation; and muſt approve itſelf to the reaſon of every one who will exerciſe his reaſon, and not confuſe and bewilder himſelf with a ſet of words without a meaning. The unregenerate have no true love to God or their neighbour; for in this, and in the conſequent exerciſes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, their unregeneracy conſiſts. Therefore they do no duty, obey not one command in the law or the prophets, in the old teſtament or new.</p>
               <p>IT will be ſaid doubtleſs, they do obey and do duty in ſome ſenſe, or at leaſt ſome part of duty: They do external duties; or that which is the <hi>matter</hi> of duty. Theſe things, ſuch as prayer, reading the bible, acts of juſtice and mercy, &amp;c. are commanded duties; and they who do theſe things, ſo far obey the command, and do their duty.</p>
               <p>ANS. Nothing is either duty or ſin, if conſidered without any reſpect to the heart, and as not implying any exerciſes of that: Therefore there is not really any external duty or ſin, which is not conſidered in connexion with exerciſes of heart, and as the fruit and expreſſion of theſe. If a ſtatue is formed ſo as by the motion of certain ſprings to ſpeak diſtinct words and pronounce a well compoſed prayer, none will imagine there is any duty done, or any part of duty, any more than in the noiſe of a cataract or in the whiſtling of the wind. Such a ſtatue is not a ſubject of command, and is not capable of any part of duty. And man is not the ſubject of command, or capable of any duty or ſin in any other view, but in that of a voluntary agent: and all the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motions, and effects produced by him, which are not in any degree voluntary, are no more duty nor ſin, and no more any part of either, than if there was no ſuch thing as duty or ſin in nature. If a man kills another by a motion or ſtroke, in which he had no deſign, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly involuntary, there is no more ſin in this than there is in the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a tree on a man that kills him. And in this caſe to ſay, that
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:011295_0063_0F869F0D12D36D70"/>
the man, or the tree is guilty of external ſin, or has done the matter of ſin, and ſo has really ſinned, and done what was forbidden, would juſtly be reckoned a high degree of abſurdity and nonſenſe. But this would be as proper language, as to ſpeak of a perſon's doing external duty or the <hi>matter</hi> of his duty, as tho' ſome duty was really done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking into view the exerciſes of his will in the affair, and not conſidering him as a voluntary agent. But if he is conſidered as a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary agent, and the whole of the duty lies in the exerciſes of the heart or will; then what is done is either duty or ſin, according as theſe are. If one man kills another by a voluntary execution or motion, in which he had a prudent deſign &amp; deſire to ſave his life, the action is so far from being ſin or murder, that it is an act of kindneſs and mercy. The man committed no ſin, but did his duty. If a man pronounces the words of a prayer, without one thought or voluntary exerciſe about it, he does no more duty than the ſtatue juſt mentioned, or the tree that bows before the moving air. But if he does this voluntarily, with tho't and deſign, and his will and deſign herein is perfectly bad, and the ſame with his, who curſes and blaſphemes the name of God, ſuch vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarineſs, ſuch exerciſes and deſign ſurely do not render exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal action duty, which would not be ſo in itſelf conſidered. If the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal action was neither duty nor ſin, conſidered as unconnected with any deſign or will, it does not become duty by being conſidered in connection with ſinful volitions, and as the fruit of them, but on the contrary, the whole taken together, is ſin, and nothing but ſin.</p>
               <p>If it is well attended to, it will appear I conclude, that there is a great impropriety and groſs abſurdity in ſpeaking of a man's doing any part of his duty in his external conduct, when this conduct is not conſidered as the fruit and expreſſion of his heart, or any way connected with it; but more eſpecially when it is conſidered as the fruit of wrong and ſinful exerciſes of heart. And to uſe ſuch language in this caſe, and talk of doing duty in part and ſome degree in external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, by ſeparating it from all views and exerciſes of the mind, is uſing words with at any conſiſtent ideas, and only tends to blind and confuſe the minds of thoſe who ſuffer themſelves to be impoſed upon by ſuch expreſſions. The externals of devotion and religion are the proper and appointed ways of our acting out and expreſſing our love to God: and in this view may be called the external part, or matter of duty; hence they have obtained the name of <hi>duties:</hi> But when there is really no love to God exerciſed and expreſſed in theſe externals, there is no duty in them; they ceaſe to be any part of duty. And if theſe externals are attended upon in the exerciſe of perfect enmity againſt God, and as the fruit and expreſſion of that, it is ſomething far worſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the former have obtained the name of duties, being the proper and appointed ways of acting out and expreſſing reſpect and love to God, many have bewildered themſelves by the word <hi>duty,</hi> and have been led to think and ſpeak of theſe externals as duties, conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the attendance on them as doing duty, and have in this way impoſed on themſelves and others. Theſe things are not required,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:011295_0063_0F869F0D12D36D70"/>
for their own ſakes, or in themſelves conſidered, but only as proper ways of exerciſing and expreſſing love to God. Love to God is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thing required, the whole of the duty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in this, and where this is wanting the externals are as to duty an empty nothing, not the thing required; and in doing them, no duty is done.</p>
               <p>In this view of the matter we may ſee the true meaning of what God ſays to the people or Iſrael, "When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. I. 12.</note> Theſe things were required, but not for their own ſake, but only as an expreſſion of their reſpect and love to God. Therefore when this ceaſed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and expreſſed, and they appeared not to have the love of God, but the contrary, their attendance on theſe externals, was not doing any thing that was required of them. There things were not required of them, as they performed them: Therefore in their attendance on them they really did nothing that was required of them, and ſo did not the leaſt part of their duty. To the ſame purpoſe is what God ſays by Jeremiah, "I ſpake not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and ſacrifices: But this thing commanded I them, ſaying, Obey my voice,"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Jer. VII. 22, 23.</note> Burnt offerings and ſacrifices and all other externals were not required merely as ſuch, or conſidered by themſelves as mere externals; as ſuch God did not command them; but as the expreſſion of love and obedience. Therefore when theſe were attended upon, without the exerciſe of love and obedience, the thing which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in his command and even the whole that was commanded, was neglected, and no duty done.</p>
               <p>None will ſuppoſe, I preſume, that the devils did any duty when they cried out ſaying "Thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

VIII. 28.</note> But the defect was not in externals, but in the want of love to Chriſt, and the exerciſe of enmity againſt him. And will any one imagine that men who have no more love or true reſpect to God than the devils, and are as real and entire enemies to him as they, which is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of all the unregenerate; that ſuch, I ſay, do any more duty in their external words and actions, than the devils did in the inſtances mentioned? What do ſuch men do, which the devils did not? If the want of love to Chriſt and enmity againſt him in the latter rendered all they did in openly confeſſing Chriſt to be the Son of God, and praying to him, not duty, but ſin; why is not this as true of the former?</p>
               <p>If a man does juſtice in his dealings, without any deſign or deſire to do juſtice he does no more duty than the juſt balance which gives to every one his due. And if one gives to the poor without deſign, and good will, he does no more of the duty of ſhewing mercy, than the fruitful tree from which the poor is fed. And whatever external acts of kindneſs and charity he does, if he means not ſo, and has not the leaſt degree of love and good will to his fellow men in his heart, he
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:011295_0064_0F869F0DD87EC850"/>
certainly pays no true regard and obedience to the command to ſhew mercy, and does no part of this duty. And if, contrary to this, his heart it full of malevolence and ill-will to his neighbours, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſome evil to them by his external appearance of love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he is ſo far from doing any duty, that theſe external acts, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at his acts (and they are no acts at all in any other view) are as really a violation of his duty, and acts of melevolence and ſin, as are ſtealing from his neighbour, and attempting to cut his throat.</p>
               <p>To him, who will well conſider theſe things, I think, it muſt appear, that to talk of doing the external and <hi>material</hi> part of duty, under the notion that this is really doing <hi>any</hi> duty and obeying God's commands, without any regard had to the mind, or while that is ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed to be directly contrary to all duty, is very abſurd, and tends to confuſe and deceive all thoſe, who will be confuſed and deceived by a ſet of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning words and phraſes; and that where there is no love to God or men exerciſed, there is no duty done, whatever is the external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and conduct.</p>
               <p>IT is ſtill ſaid by ſome that tho' it is granted, as it muſt be, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal words and actions cannot be conſidered as any part of duty, or as having any thing of the nature of duty, unleſs they are viewed as the voluntary exerciſes of a moral agent, by which he acts out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his heart; and therefore if the principles and exerciſes of his heart are all wrong and ſinful, no duty is done, but all is ſin; yet it does not follow that the unregenerate do no duty: They may obey the divine command, from the natural principles which they have, ſuch as <hi>natural conſcience</hi> and <hi>ſelf-love.</hi> Theſe, tho' they are not the beſt principles, yet are good, or at leaſt not ſinful; and God requires the unregenerate to improve theſe, and act from ſuch principles as they have; and when they do ſo, this is real obedience, and they do their duty, even what God commands.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. There is no love to God or our neighbour in the exerciſe of theſe natural principles, or while men act from them only: it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follows from what has been already proved, that there is no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in this, becauſe all obedience conſiſts in love to God and our neighbour. At leaſt it muſt be allowed to be proved, till it can be ſhewn wherein the argument fails.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. But if this argument is laid aſide, and what is here advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is attended to, it may be proved to be groundleſs, and very abſurd. Theſe natural principles are not principles of obedience; nor is there any obedience meerly in acting from them. If the dictates of natural conſcience are not according to the truth, but directly contrary to what is truth and duty, none will think, I conclude, that a man does his duty in acting according to ſuch dictates: for this is the ſame as to ſay that a man does his duty in acting directly contrary to his duty. Will any one ſay, that <hi>Saul</hi> did his duty, and obeyed Chriſt in perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the church, becauſe he acted according to the dictates of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:011295_0064_0F869F0DD87EC850"/>
and blind men are to duty, and the more contrary their hearts are to it, as the ground and reaſon of their ſtupidity and blindneſs, the more obedient and dutiful they are. If the dictates of conſcience are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth, and point out what is duty, they declare that this conſiſts in love to God and our neighbour: That this is their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate duty and all that is required. If therefore, they continue not to love God &amp; their neighbour, they are ſo far from obeying the dictates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that they go in direct oppoſition to theſe, &amp; ſo are very far from doing their duty. But, to ſay the truth, natural conſcience it neither a principle of obedience, nor of diſobedience, as has been before obſerved. There is but one principle of obedience, which is love, or diſintereſted reſpect or regard to God, &amp; our neighbour. Whatever regard is paid to the dictates of conſcience from any other principle, there is no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in it; and the greateſt enemy to God and his neighbour, may exerciſe as much of this ſort of obedience as any other man.</p>
               <p>And as to <hi>ſelf-love:</hi> If by it is meant only a love and deſire of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; this is the principle of all actions in general, whether they be rebellion againſt God, or obedience. It is eſſential to all voluntary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and is the principle of all the ſin in the univerſe, as much as of holineſs and obedience. If by ſelf-love is meant <hi>ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's having reſpect to himſelf only, and to nothing elſe, either God or his neighbour; placing his happineſs in his own private intereſt, as diſtinct from all other beings, deſiring and purſuing this happineſs and nothing elſe; this is ſo far from being a principle of obedience, that it is the principle of all the diſobedience and ſin, that ever was, or will be in the creation; and in direct and moſt perfect oppoſition to love to God and our neighbour. How abſurd then is it to talk of obeying God, and doing duty from a principle of ſelf love!</p>
               <p>OBJ. But a well regulated ſelf-love is reaſonable and right. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought to ſeek their own happineſs, if it be true happineſs, and if they ſeek it where it is to had, and place it in right and proper objects, and with a proper ſubordination to the glory of God and the general good. How then can this be ſin and rebellion? If it is right and reaſonable, men <hi>ought</hi> to exerciſe it, and this is their duty, and the contrary is ſin.</p>
               <p>ANS. 1. There is no ſuch thing as a well regulated ſelf-love, if by ſelf-love be meant, what has been juſt deſcribed. Selfiſhneſs ought not to take place in the leaſt degree; it is in every degree unreaſonable and rebellion againſt God. A well regulated ſelf love is quite a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing from ſelfiſhneſs, and in direct oppoſition to it. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in placing our happineſs in the glory of God and the good of our neighbour, and regarding our intereſt only as included in the intereſt of the whole, or the greateſt good of being in general, and not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſtinct and ſeparate from it; which is ſo far from ſelfiſhneſs, that, it is directly oppoſite to it, even diſintereſted benevolence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing general.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. No perſon under the influence of that ſelf-love which has reſpect to himſelf wholly, and to no other being, is ſeeking after true
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:011295_0065_0F869F0E835499A0"/>
happineſs, or places it where he ought. True happineſs conſiſts in the enjoyment of God in the exerciſe of love to being in general; but by the ſuppoſition the ſelfiſh man does not ſeek this happineſs, for he has no true reſpect to God, or any other being but himſelf. And there is no more obedience in ſeeking future happineſs in a ſelfiſh way, or without any reſpect and regard to the intereſt of any other being, than there is in ſeeking happineſs in this preſent world, in any way, and in any objects whatever.</p>
               <p>ANS. 3. It is moſt abſurd and a groſs contradiction, to talk of ſelf love or ſelfiſhneſs ſubordinated to the glory of God, and the general good: for ſelf-love has no regard to God or any other being but ſelf; and is ſo far from being ſubordinated to the glory of God, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good, that it is an enemy to the general good; and in its own nature enmity itſelf againſt being in general. The man under the influence and dominion of ſelf-love, regards and ſeeks himſelf only; and the language of his heart is, "I care not what becomes of the glory of God and the general good, if my own ends may be anſwered." And how can this principle be ſubordinated to the general good? Will it ſubmit and ſubordinate itſelf to this? That is to ſuppoſe that it will change its own nature, and no longer ſeek ſelf wholly, but the general good more than ſelf, and as the higheſt and beſt end. And what can be more ſelf-contradictory and abſurd than this!</p>
               <p n="2">II. THO' the ſhort and plain argument that has been conſidered, is quite ſufficient, I think, to end the diſpute, and prove that there are no commanded duties which the unregenerate fulfil, or comply with in the leaſt degree; yet it may be proper to mention ſome other arguments, which prove the ſame thing, as they may ſerve to ſtrengthen the former, with ſome at leaſt, and ſet the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>ty of the contrary doctrine, if poſſible, in yet a clearer and more ſtriking light.</p>
               <p>Therefore I proceed to ſay,</p>
               <p>All God's commands to his creatures are an expreſſion of his will or heart, which is the ſame with their being a tranſcript of his moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as the common phraſe is. But God's moral perfection is his holineſs: and his will is holy. Therefore whatever command is an expreſſion of his will, muſt require holineſs. That which requires any thing elſe, is no expreſſion of his moral perfection; therefore cannot be the expreſſion of the will of God, and ſo cannot be his command.</p>
               <p n="3">III. DUTY to God always ſuppoſes and implies ſomething given to God, and done for him, out of regard and reſpect to him. But where there is no true love to God, there is no true reſpect paid to him; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is offered to him or done for him in the intention and deſign of the doer. Therefore there is really no duty done. Nothing that is due to God is given; and ſo no command that he can give is obeyed.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. If God ſhould command the unregenerate to do any thing, as ſuch, and which they may do conſiſtently with their having no love to him, and being under the power of perfect and reigning enmity againſt him; this is in ſome degree, if not wholly giving up his demands on

               <p>Mr. M. very juſtly obſerves "that God don't make the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> depraved, that they have no reſpect and love; but are perfect enemies to him. If mans will was perfectly right, there would certainly be no occaſion or reaſon for any ſuch commands. Therefore if God gives ſuch it is purely out of regard to their depraved will, as the ſole rule and reaſon of the command. Were they diſpoſed to love God with all their heart, he would not give any command that could be obeyed without love to him: But ſince they have no love to him, he love's his demand, and appoints a rule of duty, ſuited to their hearts or wills, which have no love, but are perfectly oppoſite to him. And is not this to make the depraved will of the creature the rule of his duty? And is not ſuch a notion very diſhonorable to God; and in effect to give up all moral government, by making the will of the creature, and not the will and law of the creator, the guide and rule?</p>
               <p>If a prince ſhould treat his rebellious ſubjects ſo, who refuſed to lay down their arms and ſubmit to him, and pay him any reſpect; would he not act a diſhonorable part, and give up his own character &amp; govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a meaſure at leaſt in favor of his avowed enemies and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubjects? Should he, for inſtance, when he came among them, and called upon them to return immediately to their allegiance and ſubmit to him; and found that they were ſo far from obeying, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand rouſed them all to arms, and they ſtood with drawn ſwords point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly at him, obſtinately refuſing to yield one point to him, or ſubmit in the leaſt degree: Should he, I ſay, inſtead of inſiſting on his former demand, tell them that he found they were obſtinately fixed in rebellion againſt him; he would therefore propoſe ſomething to them and require it of them, which they might do and yet continue rebels, and oppoſe and fight againſt him and his government as much as ever, viz. to draw up a petition to him th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="124" facs="unknown:011295_0066_0F869F0F5712BD00"/>
and profeſſion directly contrary to the truth: And that if they would do this he would look upon them as in ſome meaſure loyal, dutiful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or as doing ſome part of their duty: would not this be giving up his firſt demand, at leaſt in ſome degree; and be implicitly granting that they were not wholly to blame for not immediately ſubmitting to him?</p>
               <p>If a prince ſhould conduct ſo, all who were friends to his character and government would be grieved, and view him as injuring both; and in a degree giving them up in favor of rebels. I ſuppoſe this will be a clear caſe to all. And I ſee not why the caſe before us is not as clear; ye much more ſo, in proportion to the greater dignity and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the moſt high God, and the proportionable inexcuſable wickedneſs of the ſinner. And the only reaſon, I conceive, why any have run into this notion of God's appointing duties to the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, to be done by them while ſuch, and have not been rather ſhocked at it, is that they look on them as in ſome meaſure at leaſt excuſable for not loving God and embracing the goſpel, this being above their power, and what they <hi>cannot</hi> do while unregenerate; altho' (poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures!) they are quite willing and deſirous to do what they <hi>can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. IF God commands the unregenerate to do that which they may do in a ſtate of rebellion, and while they are with all their hearts op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him, and in the exerciſe of perfect enmity againſt him, I ſee not why this is not commanding ſin and rebellion, and making this their duty. It muſt be ſo, if all they do is ſin and rebellion, which, I think is certain to a demonſtration; for in the exerciſes of a moral agent there is, there can be, no medium between holineſs and ſin. It will be ſaid here, that God doth not command the ſin, but the duty. I anſwer, take away the ſin, and ſeparate it from every thing elſe, and there remains nothing in which there is any moral agency, and ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in which there is either ſin or duty; and therefore nothing which can be the ſubject of command. Conſequently if the ſin is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nothing is commanded.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. has made ſeveral attempts to anſwer this argument, which may moſt properly be conſidered here. He ſays, <q>The miſtake on which this objection is founded, is a ſuppoſition that there is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural connexion between requiring the unregenerate to pray, and requiring them to ſin: Whereas the connexion is intirely of a moral nature, and ariſes merely from a moral cauſe, the creature's want of moral ability, or which is the ſame, his want of diſpoſition of heart, and inclination of will ſincerely to comply with the command, which is merely the creature's fault. And ſhall this fault of the creature be attributed to God's command, requiring what is ſtrictly the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's duty?<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 94.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this the following things may be obſerved.</p>
               <p>l. There is indeed a natural connexion between requring the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate to pray as ſuch, as wholly wicked and oppoſite to God in all the exerciſes of their hearts that reſpect him, and requiring them to ſin; for theſe are preciſely one and the ſame thing, and the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:011295_0066_0F869F0F5712BD00"/>
moral and natural here, is quite unintelligible and to no purpoſe. If the prayers of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord, i. e. wholly ſinful, then to require them to make <hi>ſuch prayers,</hi> is for God to require them to do what is an abomination to him, and wholly ſinful. And this is the ſame, I think, as to command them to ſin. If God requires the wicked to pray, as ſuch, in the exerciſe of their wicked inclination of heart, and without any other or better inclination, what he requires is ſin; and its being wholly their own fault that they are thus inclined, and do ſin, as they are commanded, is ſo far from rendering the thing commanded no ſin, that it is the only reaſon why it is ſin; for if it was not their fault, it would not be ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Mr. M. had conſtantly kept this mind, that it is wholly man's fault that he is not holy, and really believed it in all its length and breadth, he would never have thought of their being commanded to do unholy duties: for if it is their immediate and indiſpenſible duty to be holy and embrace the goſpel, no reaſon can be given why this ſhould not be required of them immediately; or why any thing leſs or lower than this, even unholy duties, ſhould be required at all. Mr. M. thro' a great part of his book goes on the ſuppoſition that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate are not wholly to blame for not embracing the goſpel, and doing holy duties: had he not ſuppoſed this, we never ſhould have heard of his unregenerate duties, and of their honeſt attempts, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their utmoſt in the exerciſe of ſuch principles as they have, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. M. does fully yield the point to the objector in what he ſays here. According to his own conceſſion, God's command has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the fault of the creature; but requires what is ſtrictly his duty. Surely then he requires holineſs; for this is "ſtrictly his duty;" and every thing ſhort of this is the creature's fault. If God commands men to do duties, without any regard to their moral deficiency, which is wholly their own fault, or making any allowance for it; then in his commands he makes no allowance for their unregeneracy; for this is a moral defect, and wholly their own fault: and therefore does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire unregenerate, unholy duties. It appears therefore that Mr. M. had no other way to anſwer the objection, but by giving up what was objected againſt, and granting that no unregenerate duties, nothing unholy and impure is required, but real holineſs, which is in all caſes "ſtrictly the creature's duty."</p>
               <p>But let us attend to the ſimilitude he brings to illuſtrate this matter. <q>To make this miſtake plain to the meaneſt capacity, ſuppoſe a father correcting his ſon for diſobedient rebellious behaviour, ſhould in the cloſe, require him to bow his head, in token of reverence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his parental authority: the ſon, thro' unſubdued per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of temper, bows in hypocriſy. Does the father by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the duty, command the ſin? Far be it. And much leſs in the preſent caſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I think he has by this ſimilitude "made it plain to the meaneſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city" that he has entirely given up his cauſe, and expreſsly aſſerts the contrary, viz, that God does not require what ſinners do while under
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:011295_0067_0F869F0FFAFC2C88"/>
the dominion of "unſubdued perverſeneſs." If the father requires the ſon to bow his head, "in token of reverence and ſubmiſſion to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental authority," and in no other way; the ſon does not obey this command in the leaſt degree; therefore does no duty, nothing that the father commands: but his bowing his head in hypocriſy in the exerciſe of unſubdued perverſeneſs is ſo far from being an act of obedience, that it is an exerciſe and act of high rebellion, and only ſerves to offend and provoke the father; as it is a daring attempt to impoſe upon him and mock him. Does Mr M. think, and will he ſay, that acts of groſs hypocriſy, in the exerciſe of "unſubdued perverſeneſs," are the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures duty, and acts of obedience, and that God commands theſe? And that theſe are leſs ſinful and more acceptable in God's fight than the neglect of them? This is a very ill choſen ſimilitude for Mr. M. and will, I doubt not, make it "plain to the meaneſt capacity," that his notion of unregenerate duties is very abſurd, and that he here aſſerts that ſuch are not required; but that God in all caſes requires ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him, and proper tokens and expreſſions of this, and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>And by the way, I deſire it may be conſidered, whether the ſon who under the father's correction and reproofs, continues in the exerciſe of "unſubdued perverſeneſs," and bows his head in hypocriſy, is not more guilty and vile than he was before his father took him in hand. lf ſo, which I conclude Mr. M. himſelf will allow; then he has by bringing this inſtance to repreſent the caſe of the unregenerate, not only given up the point he brought it to ſupport; but alſo muſt allow that they do not become leſs ſinful; but more guilty and vile in the uſe of means, while they perſiſt in their "unſubdued perverſeneſs," under all the light and conviction they have: and ſo has here really given up the whole which he undertook to ſupport. Had Mr. M. conſtantly viewed the unregenerate in the light in which he ſets them here, my ſection on means. could not have given him ſuch great offence.</p>
               <p>BUT let us ſee if he has ſucceeded any better in his other attempt to anſwer this objection. He ſays the ſin the unregenerate are guilty of in what they do, <q>is no part of the duty, as required by God, don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to its eſſence; but ariſes from man's deficiency. God has a right to require of his people <hi>good duties.</hi> When he puts them un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der goſpel advantages, &amp;c. he requires <hi>goſpel holineſs.</hi> A prevalent indiſpoſition of heart, and diſinclination of will to <hi>do right,</hi> makes no abatement in God's demands of us: or in the duty we owe to God.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 115.</note>
                  </q> Here again he expreſsly gives up the whole, and aſſerts that what God requires is <hi>good duties, goſpel holineſs;</hi> and not unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate duties. Thus he ſhifts, gives up his cauſe, and turns againſt himſelf. He labours abundantly, to prove that God requires of the unregenerate ſomething which is not holineſs but thoſe doings which they may perform with "unſubdued perverſeneſs" of heart. And when he is told that that is to require that which is ſin; he turns about and ſays God requires nothing but "good duties, goſpel holineſs;" and ſo gets rid of the objection by unſaying all he had ſo often and zealouſly aſſerted before, againſt which the objection yet remains in its full force.</p>

                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:011295_0067_0F869F0FFAFC2C88"/>But he goes on, <q>Thus ſtands the caſe; God puts his covenant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under advantages to bring forth <hi>good fruits,</hi> and then he has a juſt right, expects and demands them. God requires <hi>good duties</hi> of his people; both the performance and the goodneſs or the duty is abſolutely required: And therefore God will have the duties or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, tho' thro' their badneſs they come mar'd out of their hands. Does God in requiring these duties, require their being mar'd? Far be it, ſince he abſolutely required their being good.</q> Here he is in the ſame ſtrain yet: God requires nothing but "good fruits, good duties," and therefore not the marred, ſinful duties of the unregenerate; exerciſes and fruits of "unſubdued perverſeneſs;" they never do the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which God' requires of them. When he ſays, <q>Both the <hi>performance</hi> and the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the duty is abſolutely required: And therefore God will have the duties or performances, tho' thro' their badneſs they come mar'd out of their hands,</q> I think he is quite unintelligible, or at leaſt ſuppoſes ſomething which is very abſurd and ſelf-contradictory. The diſtinction between the <hi>performance</hi> of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of it, is, I ſuppoſe, quite new, and ſo nice that I queſtion whether it can be underſtood. There is no other duty that I can conceive of, but <hi>good</hi> duty: The <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the duty comes into performance, and is indeed one and the ſame thing; the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance is doing the good duty; and where there is no goodneſs exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed there is no performance of duty. Therefore when he ſays, "God will have the duties or performances tho' ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If by the <hi>performance</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>goodneſs,</hi> he means only the external action, without any relation or regard to the exerciſes of the heart, I ſuppoſe enough has been ſaid to ſhew the abſurdity of ſuch a way of talking.</p>

               </p>
               <p>ANS. 1. Our Saviour does not direct the Jews to ſearch the ſcriptures with all their prejudices, and in the exerciſe of enmity againſt him; and with a deſire and deſign to prove from them that he was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor. This I truſt neither Mr. M. nor any one elſe will aſſert, or allow. But there is juſt as much evidence that he directed them to ſearch the ſcriptures thus, as there is that he directed them to do it, as enemies to his character and doctrines. They ought to have ſearched the ſcriptures with a heart ready to embrace and practice the truth, whatever they found it to be; and therefore our Saviour doubtleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins this on them; which he knew they would not do ſo long as they continued to hate both him and the Father that ſent him. Chriſt told them that, "If any man will do his will (i. e. is diſpoſed and inclined to do the will of God) he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of myſelf."<note n="§" place="bottom">Joh. VII. 17.</note> And when he tells them to ſearch the ſcripture in order to determine this, he directs them to do it with ſuch an inclination; and not with a diſpoſition directly oppoſite to that which was neceſſary in order to anſwer the end propoſed.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. obſerves that Chriſt directs them to ſearch the ſcriptures, "as a means in order to come to the knowledge of him as Mediator." This is granted: but it does not follow that he enjoins them to do this with a wicked heart; but with a right temper and diſpoſition of mind: for the latter was neceſſary in order to come to the true knowledge of Chriſt as Mediator. And, as has been obſerved, it was their indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty, as well as intereſt to ſearch the ſcriptures with ſuch a diſpoſition of mind.</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. The word in the original, tranſlated <hi>ſearch,</hi> in the impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mood, may be as well rendered <hi>ye do ſearch.</hi> It is thus tranſlated by moſt of the noted critics on the orginal.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Vid. Pol. Syn. in locum.</note> And this tranſlation is thought to be confirmed by the following verſe; the ſenſe of the two verſes being this, "Ye take much pains to ſearch the ſcriptures, becauſe ye think ye have eternal life in them. This is very true, and I am the life here revealed; and yet ſo perverſe and blind are you, that while ye are paying ſuch great regard to the ſcriptures, ye reject me, and will not come to me that ye may have the life there revealed."</p>
               <p>ANS. 3. When Chriſt directs and commands to ſeek firſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, &amp;c. and labor for the meat that endures to everlaſting life, he doubtleſs directs to that ſeeking and labor by which men will certainly obtain what they ſeek and labor after. There is certainly not the leaſt evidence that he does not; or that by ſeeking and lobor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he means any exerciſes and doings of men unregenerate. I ſee not why Mr. M. might not with as much propriety and reaſon have quoted every direction and command of our Saviour that is recorded, as requiring unregenerate doings, and nothing but ſuch.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. M. proceeds, "And is not the ſinner that finds the pearl, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented as being a ſeeker, previous to his finding it?"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. XIII. 45, 46.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. 1. If it is granted that the unregenerate ſinner <hi>ſeeks</hi> after Chriſt and ſalvation, this is not to the purpoſe; for he may do this, and yet obey no command, nor do any duty. How then came Mr. M. to think that this was in the leaſt to the point he was upon?</p>
               <p>ANS. 2. The merchant ſeeking goodly pearls is not deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a man unregenerate but one who is as much prepared in the temper of his mind, as much diſpoſed to embrace Jeſus Chriſt as his only Savior and Portion, as the greedy merchant is to prize and purchaſe a precious pearl. And who can this be but a perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate? All that Chriſt means to repreſent by this ſimilitude is, the temper and exerciſes with which men embrace him and become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his kingdom, or, in his language, receive the kingdom of God. They love and prize him ſo as to forſake all for him. On the whole then, Mr. M. has proved nothing by producing this text, unleſs it be, that he looks on the unregenerate, not as enemies to Chriſt, but as being as much diſpoſed to embrace Chriſt and part with all for him, as is the merchant, who is in purſuit of pearls, to part with his whole eſtate to purchaſe a pearl of great price: a notion which he has kept in view thro' his whole book, and on which it is in a meaſure all built, as has been obſerved, however contrary to the whole tenor of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>THE next paſſage of ſcripture Mr. M. produces in the following words, <q>And does not God complain of his people, that <hi>they will not frame their doings to turn unto their God?</hi>
                     <note n="¶" place="bottom">Moſ. V. 4.</note> Sure this muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing previous to a ſaving repentance, and ſomething that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; otherwiſe they had not been blamed for the neglect of it; for where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. 1. The Hebrew word here tranſlated <hi>frame</hi> properly ſignifies to <hi>give</hi> or <hi>grant,</hi> and is often tranſlated to ſuffer or permit. And theſe words may be rendered thus, Their purſuits, or their evil ways, will not ſuffer them to turn to the Lord. That is, the ſins in which they live are in the way of their turning to the Lord, and do with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrength and obſtinacy oppoſe it. This ſenſe agrees well with the following words; "For the ſpirit of whoredoms is in the midſt of them, and they have not known the Lord." The words ſet forth their great degree of corruption, by which they were at the greateſt diſtance from turning to the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:011295_0069_0F869F1602654418"/>ANS. 2d. The words as they ſtand in our tranſlation, expreſs much the ſame thing. The meaning or them is, that they were ſo far gone in wickedneſs, that they had not the leaſt diſpoſition or inclination to turn to the Lord, which is true of every unregenerate perſon. And the words do not ſuppoſe that while men continue perfectly wicked, and obſtinate enemies to God, they in any true ſenſe, <hi>from their doings to turn to the Lord;</hi> becauſe this is a groſs contradiction, which Mr. M. and all who join with him have run into, by putting ſuch a ſenſe upon them. Mr. M. therefore had no warrant to ſay, "Sure this muſt be ſomething previous to a ſaving repentance." On this aſſertion all the weight of his argument from theſe words reſts; which he has not ſaid one word to ſupport. And indeed it could not be ſupported by him, had he attempted it; for it <hi>ſurely</hi> reſts on a ſandy foundation.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. goes on, <q>And does not St Paul clearly point out atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the word preached as a means in order to faith? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word preached,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. X. 17.</note>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>(by the word of God</hi> it ſhould be.)</p>
               <p>ANS. All that is aſſerted here is, that it is impoſſible that men ſhould believe that of which they never heard: that the truths to be believed by men in order to ſalvation are contained in divine revelation, and that none can believe theſe, unleſs he hears them. It follows from this that hearing or attending to the truths of divine revelation, is neceſſary in order to faith in Chriſt. But how are they to hear? Not with a diſpoſition to hate Chriſt and all divine truth, as ſoon as it comes to their notice; but as Cornelius heard St. Peter, with a diſpoſition and readineſs of mind to receive the truth in love, and believe it. This is never done by the unregenerate. No unregenerate duties therefore can be inferred from theſe words.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. adds, <q>And does not the apoſtle Peter expreſsly exhort Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, being unregenerate to pray? Repent therefore of this thy wickedneſs, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Act. VII. P. 22.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Repentance is often ſpoken of in the new teſtament and old, and perſons are often called upon to repent. And when ſpoken of as connected with forgiveneſs of ſins, and the condition of this, it always has one determinate preciſe meaning, even a turning from ſin to God through Jeſus Chriſt. St. Peter received orders from his maſter at the laſt interview he had with him to preach repentance and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins in his name.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luk. XXIV 47</note> And we find him obeying his orders and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a large auditory when waiting on him to know what they had to do, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Act. II. 38.</note> And to another, 'Repent ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out."<note n="§" place="bottom">Acts. III. 19.</note> And we have no account of his, or of any of the reſt of the apoſtles directing any one to do any thing ſhort of repentance and converſion; or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of forgiveneſs of ſins in any other connexion but with true repentance and converſion. It would therefore be very ſtrange and quite unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:011295_0069_0F869F1602654418"/>if when St. Peter directs Simon to <hi>repent</hi> of his wickedneſs; and that with a view to obtain forgiveneſs, he uſes the word repent in a different and oppoſite ſenſe from that in which his Lord and maſter had expreſsly commanded him to uſe it, and different from that in which he had uſed it before on like occaſions, and as it never is uſed in another inſtance in all the new teſtament. If therefore theſe words of St. Peter; can, without doing manifeſt violence to them, be underſtood conſiſtent with the orders which he had received from Chriſt, and with his way of addreſſing men on ſuch occaſions in all other inſtances, we may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain we have the true ſenſe of them; and may with confidence reject any other ſenſe that any have deviſed.</p>
               <p>I therefore obſerve, Simon is not directed to pray as an impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but as a penitent. "<hi>Repent</hi> of this thy wickedneſs, and pray to God." Is not the meaning of theſe words as plain, as theſe are when this ſame apoſtle ſays, "Repent and be converted; Repent, and be baptized"? Theſe words have been long quoted as an inconteſtable proof that unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men are commanded to pray as impenitent and unregenerate; and many have done it without ever obſerving that the word <hi>repent</hi> was to be found in the text. Whereas directly the contrary is moſt evidently true. As well might we overlook the word repent in the other paſſages mentioned, and ſay St. Peter commanded his hearers to be baptized: yea, to be converted as impenitent, unregenerate ſinners; and hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that to be baptized and converted are duties that the unregenerate are to do while ſuch. With good reaſon therefore, I think, Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge ſays, in his note on this text, <q>One would think that none could be <hi>ſo wild</hi> as to imagine faith in Chriſt was not included in that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and prayer, which an <hi>apoſtle</hi> preaches to a baptized perſon as the way of obtaining forgiveneſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The only difficulty in the words is that St. Peter does not here ſpeak of forgiveneſs of ſin, as certainly connected with the repentance and prayer to which he exhorts Simon, which he does in the other inſtances mentioned: and it is certain that he who prays as a true penitent ſhall be forgiven: Whereas it is here ſaid, "IF PERHAPS the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee." Mr. M. and others have inſiſted upon this as an argument that the prayer not of a true penitent, but of an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, unregenerate ſinner is here exhorted to.</p>
               <p>Upon this it may be obſerved, that the words, <hi>if perhaps,</hi> are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to expreſs the uncertainty of his obtaining forgiveneſs if he ſhould repent of his wickedneſs and pray to God, as he was exhorted to do; but the doubtfulneſs and uncertainty whether there was forgiveneſs for this his ſin; and ſo whether he would repent and pray. Simon had been guilty of a ſin which it was to be feared was the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, for which there was no forgiveneſs, or at leaſt was bordering upon it: and it is in this view that St. Peter puts in the words <hi>if perhaps.</hi> As if he had ſaid "If there is room left for repentance and pardon in this caſe, which perhaps there is not." Thus the peculiar circumſtances of Simon's caſe, rendering it doubtful whether there was any forgiveneſs for his ſin, are the only reaſon why the apoſtle puts in theſe words <hi>if perhaps,</hi> which we find he did not in other caſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:011295_0070_0F869F16B8A0DF38"/>Dr. Doddridge underſtands the words in this ſenſe, and gives the reaſon of it in the following words. <q>The dubious manner in which he ſpeaks of his being forgiven intimates, not that his ſincere repentance might poſſibly fail of acceptance, for that is contrary to the whole tenor of the goſpel, but that after the commiſſion of a ſin, ſo nearly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, there was little reaſon to hope he would ever be brought truly to repent.</q> And tho' I do not quote the Dr. <hi>as an authority;</hi> yet I may be allowed perhaps to quote another author as ſuch, at leaſt as one of ſufficient authority with Mr. M as it is no leſs an one than Mr. <hi>Mills</hi> himſelf. He ſays, <q>This <hi>perhaps,</hi> as here uſed, imports indeed only a ſuſpicion of the truth of the man's repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and not any doubt of God's forgiveneſs in caſe his repentance were ſincere.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vind. of goſpel truth, &amp;c. P. 76.</note>
                  </q> This he wrote above twenty years ago, and I think it is a pity he has in his <hi>old age,</hi> given this up, and eſpouſed a ſenſe which is attended with inſuperable difficulties.</p>
               <p>But if this ſenſe ſhould not be ſatisfying to all, there is another which ſome have eſpouſed, that I will mention. The words in the original tranſlated <hi>if perhaps,</hi> do not appear to have this ſignification and denote doubtfulneſs or a <hi>perhaps,</hi> at leaſt not always; but are uſed only as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletives, without any particular meaning, taken by themſelves; or elſe are uſed to make the aſſertion more ſtrong and emphatical. According to this, the words ſhould have been tranſlated, "Repent, &amp;c.—that the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee," or, "may <hi>indeed</hi> be forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en." The ſame words in the original are uſed in the firſt v. of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding chap. by the high prieſt in his queſtion to Stephen, tranſlated "Are theſe things ſo?" Where it would at beſt make a poor ſenſe, to tranſlate them as they are here, <hi>If perhaps,</hi> are theſe things ſo?" And it is to be obſerved that theſe ſame particles are found in the ſeptuagint in 58. Pſal, 1. v. which in our tranſlation ſtands thus, "Do ye <hi>indeed</hi> ſeek righteouſneſs," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now I leave it to the reader, whether either of theſe ſenſes is not much more eaſy and natural than that which Mr. M. has put upon the words, which involves us in the inextricable difficulties, which have been mentioned? I am confident that it will appear to all who well attend to this matter, that this text is by no means a ſufficient foundation to build a doctrine upon, which has no ſhadow of ſupport from any other paſſage of ſcripture; and which indeed is repugnant to the whole run of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and moſt apparently contrary to the expreſs aſſertions of Chriſt and St. Paul, as has been ſhewn: eſpecially, if what has been obſerved be kept in view, that to put this ſenſe upon the text is to make the apoſtle ſpeak a language which he never uſes before or after, or any of the other apoſtles, and is directly contrary to the orders which Chriſt gave them; and that when another ſenſe, free of all theſe difficulties, offers itſelf.</p>
               <p>If they who now hold that the impenitent enemies of God and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are commanded to do many impenitent unregenerate duties, would be as ſilent about it, as were the apoſtles, we ſhould not hear much of this doctrine, if at all, and it would do very little hurt, and to be ſure, as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:011295_0070_0F869F16B8A0DF38"/>MR. M. ſays ſomething elſe, which perhaps he intends as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſenſe of the text which he contends for, and therefore muſt not be neglected. His words are, <q>It is evident therefore, that as the apoſtle knew he was a ſinner, ſo he expected from him the prayer of a ſinner.</q> If there is any thing in this argument, it takes its force from this ſuppoſition, viz. that whatſoever is ſaid to an impenitent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinner by way of exhortation or command, can require or propoſe nothing but what he may do and yet continue impenitent and unregenerate. Therefore every exhortation and command in the bible directed to ſuch, requires nothing but impenitent, unregenerate doings. And becauſe this ſuppoſition is taken to be an undeniable maxim, and is built upon as ſuch, not only by Mr. M. but others, I will take leave particularly to conſider it here, and obſerve theſe following things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. If this maxim is true, then another is as true, viz. That it is not the duty of the impenitent, unregenerate to repent and believe the goſpel: nothing is to be required of them but what they may do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of the diſpoſition and principles by which they are now governed. For if any thing more than this is their duty, more is certainly required of them, and they may and muſt be commanded and exhorted to do more, even to repent and embrace the goſpel. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this therefore, the unregenerate, and impenitent are not to blame in the leaſt for being ſo, or for not loving God and embracing the goſpel, but only for neglecting to do unregenerate duties; or thoſe which they may do conſiſtent with being enemies to Chriſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in impenitence and unbelief—If the unregenerate are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to repent and love God, for inſtance; theſe commands, as they reſpect them, only require the <hi>attempts</hi> and <hi>endeavours</hi> to repent and love God, which the impenitent enemies of God may exert, and yet continue in their impenitence and enmity againſt God. Thus, if St. Peter's knowing that Simon was an impenitent ſinner, was a good reaſon why he ſhould not exhort him to repent and pray to God as an impenitent never does, it muſt be becauſe it was not his duty thus repent and pray and ſo he could not be exhorted and commanded to do it.<note n="‡" place="bottom">This appears to be Mr. M's notion of the matter by the tenor of of his book; and by the ſenſe he puts on the words of St. Peter to Simon, as will be ſeen under the next argument; tho' there are a few expreſſions in it, contrary to this. He ſeems to think the duty of the unregenerate lies wholly in unregenerate doings, and not in loving God, &amp;c. Therefore all the commands and exhortations to them, are to ſtrive to love God, &amp;c. or to make thoſe <hi>attempts</hi> which perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate may do while ſuch: And he takes for granted that if they are not required to do unregenerate duties, nothing is required of them. He is not alone in this: many preachers and writers, have repreſented the matter in the ſame light; yet I truſt neither Mr. M. nor any of them will expreſsly undertake a vindication of this notion.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. It alſo follows from this, that ſinners may not be exhorted and
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:011295_0071_0F869F17772D2AF8"/>
commanded to do any thing from higher and better views, diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or principles than thoſe which they now actually have. The only reaſon why the impenitent enemies to God may not be exhorted to repent and love God, if there is any reaſon for this, is, that this requires higher principles than thoſe which they now act from; or, in other words, they have no heart, diſpoſition, or inclination to repent and love God, but their hearts are inclined to that which is directly the reverſe of this, as what they chooſe and prefer. And for the ſame reaſon, no perſon may be exhorted and commanded to do any thing which his heart is now ſet againſt, and is not in the leaſt inclined to do; which therefore he will not do till he has a different diſpoſition and turn of mind, and views things in a different and better light than he now does. If it was not proper for St. Peter to exhort Simon tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repent and become a friend to Chriſt, and pray as ſuch, becauſe he knew he was an impenitent enemy of Chriſt; and if we may hence ſafely infer that he did not exhort him to this; we may for the ſame reaſon infer that he did not exhort him to repent and pray from any higher views and motives than merely worldly ones, for he had as much evidence that he was wholly under the influence of worldly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as he had that he was an impenitent ſinner.</p>
               <p>And when Chriſt exhorted the Jews to labour for the meat which endureth unto everlaſting life; if their being unholy and perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclined to any thing truly good, is any reaſon and evidence that he does not exhort them to any thing inconſiſtent, with this perverſe, prevailing temper and diſpoſition of their hearts (and ſuch an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been <hi>gravely offered to the public,</hi> by thoſe who would not chooſe to have their talent at clear reaſoning called in queſtion;) I ſay, if this is ſo; then ſince they were ſo low &amp; ſordid in their views &amp; aims, as to be influenced to follow him, purely that they might get their fill of bread, we may ſafely infer, that Chriſt did not in theſe words exhort them to any thing that they might not do under the influence of ſuch low car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal views and motives; and that he does not really exhort them to ſeek any other bread but that with which they might fill their bellies, however his words may ſeem, at firſt view, to imply ſomething more.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Yea, it hence follows, that men are never to be commanded or exhorted to any thing which is contrary to their preſent prevailing will and inclination; for, if their prevailing inclination in one caſe, is a good reaſon why they may not be exhorted and commanded to that which is contrary to it, it is as good a reaſon in any other caſe of this kind whatſoever. Therefore, according to this principle, if we knew what were the preciſe inclinations of Simon's heart when St. Peter ſpoke thoſe words to him, we may determine what he did, and what he did not exhort him to; as well as we can know that he did not exhort him to any thing contrary to the inclination and heart of an impenitent, unregenerate ſinner. And we may be ſure Simon was fully inclined to repent of his wickedneſs, and pray to God, in the ſenſe in which the apoſtle directed him to do it, and actually complied with the exhortation, elſe he would not have exhorted him to it.</p>
               <p>According to this, no man can be directed and commanded to do
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:011295_0071_0F869F17772D2AF8"/>
that which is contrary to his inclination and heart, or which he is not willing to do. Which is the ſame as to ſay, no man can be under any law at all but his own inclination and will, which in all caſes muſt be the law and rule of his conduct; and ſo long as he does as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he tranſgreſſes no law, and ſo commits no ſin. The conſequence is there can be no ſuch thing in nature as ſin and blame; for all men always do as they pleaſe, or act according to the inclination of their own hearts. All theſe abſurdities, I think, are evidently contained in the maxim under conſideration. which Mr. M. and others ſeem to take for granted, and build much upon.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. goes on to produce two other texts; but ſeems here to have ſhifted his point, and inſtead of attempting to prove by them that there are duties enjoined on the impenitent, to be done by them while they remain ſo, he ſeeks only to prove that there are <hi>encouragements</hi> to ſuch to uſe means, &amp;c. One of theſe is in the following words, "Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſ VI. 3.</note> He ſays, <q>How, as the body of the people, by far the greater number comprehended in the pronoun <hi>we,</hi> were undoubtedly ſinners, deſtitute of the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, as the words plainly hold forth; can any thing leſs be underſtood by theſe expreſſions, "if we follow on to know," than that the <hi>only encouragement</hi> ſinners deſtitute of the ſaving knowledge of God have of attaining to it, is a perſevering attendance on all God's appointed means, as ſinners, until by grace they become ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful?<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 73, 74.</note>
                  </q> Upon this it may be obſerved,</p>
               <p n="1">I. This text riſes much higher than <hi>encouragement;</hi> it contains an <hi>expreſs promiſe</hi> to them that follow on to know. So that if follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on to know means the doings of the unregenerate, as Mr. M. ſays it does, theſe are promiſes to the doings of the unregenerate. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he did not obſerve this: Did he forget that he had wrote a book to prove the contrary: and had rendered his public thanks to me, for <hi>finiſhing this debate?</hi> He <hi>may now thank himſelf,</hi> for giving this point up; for he has certainly contradicted all this, by ſaying the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate follow on to know the Lord, and that theſe words are ſpoken of ſuch. He has now got on the other ſide of the queſtion, and found an expreſs promiſe to unregenerate doings, and might as well have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied all the promiſes in the bible to them. What reaſon, what right had he to lower down this promiſe, and call it only an <hi>encouragement?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is not the leaſt evidence that the perſons into whoſe mouths theſe words are put, have the character of impenitent, unregenerate ſinners; but the contrary is moſt evident. The whole from the firſt verſe to this is the language of God's people, ſubmitting and returning to him, under his corrections, and repreſents that temper of mind, and thoſe exerciſes, which ought to take place, and do actually take place in the truly penitent, and which are connected with deliverance and divine favor.</p>
               <p>The other text which he mentions here is this, <q>I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.<note n="¶" place="bottom">Ezek. XXXVI. 37</note>
                  </q> He quotes
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:011295_0072_0F869F186542E508"/>
this here not as commanding a duty, but only as an encouragement to the unregenerate. He expreſsly ſays, <q>the words are ſpoken in the way of a prediction or prophecy, and ſhewed them what God had absolutely, not conditionally, determined to accompliſh for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 83</note>
                  </q> What God does reveal as a promiſe of what he will do, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered as a command. Whether the enquiry here ſpoken of points out the prayers and ſeeking of the unregenerate, I particularly conſidered, in my remarks on Doct. Mayhew's ſermons, and ſuppoſe I produced evidence that it does not. Mr. M. has a large note on this text to prove that I have miſunderſtood it, as well as the Doctor. But to this I ſhall have ſomething to ſay in another place.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Mr. M. forms another argument from the <hi>encouragement</hi> which is given in the word of God to ſinners to attend on means, &amp;c.<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 78,—82.</note> He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that <q>from the encouragement ſet before Simon to repent &amp; pray, i. e. to attempt the performance of thoſe duties, tho' on no higher principles than that of natural conſcience—which encouragement ſtands good to all the unregenerate, under the external light and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the goſpel, 'tis evident that God doth ſome way <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> theſe eſſays of the unregenerate: otherwiſe he encourages them to that in his worſhip, which he no way, in any ſenſe requires in his word. Would no: this be for the Almighty to encourage his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to practiſe will-worſhip, and the inventions of men; which God every where condemns in his word, as utterly ſinful. And can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to the purity of his nature, to encourage his creatures to that which is utterly ſinful? Sure it cannot. It muſt therefore hence clearly follow, that the unregenerate, under the light and advantages of the goſpel, are ſomeway required to make theſe eſſays, to repent, pray, &amp;c.</q> On theſe words I obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the words of St. Peter to Simon are not a command to him to repent and pray in an unregenerate manner, or as an impenitent enemy to God, which Mr. M. has inſiſted they are; then they are not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to do any thing, as an impenitent. Mr. M. has remarkably low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered down here, and conſiders theſe words not as an expreſs command or exhortation to do any thing; but only as an <hi>encouragement</hi> ſet before Simon to <hi>attempt</hi> to repent and pray; not a command really to do them. He might juſt as reaſonably conſtrue away all the commands in the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and repreſent them to be nothing but <hi>encouragements</hi> to <hi>attempt</hi> to do ſomething.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſinner who is utterly impenitent, never does truly attempt to repent, and pray as a penitent. He never has the leaſt motion of heart or will this way: for his whole heart is, by the ſuppoſition, in direct oppoſition to this; therefore the more he exerciſes himſelf about it, or the more exerciſes he has, the more he oppoſes it. We may therefore be ſure that the ſcripture no where ſays any thing to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſuch attempts to repent, &amp;c. which are conſiſtent with perfect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, and enmity againſt God; becauſe there are not in nature any ſuch attempts; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch a ſuppoſition involves the moſt groſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> never exiſted, except in the minds of thoſe
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:011295_0072_0F869F186542E508"/>
who ſuppoſe that the unregenerate are penitent and friendly to God and the goſpel in a degree; or of thoſe who are abſurd enough to hold that the perfectly impenitent and enemies to God, are inclined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and diſpoſed to be friendly to him. Mr. M. is to be ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong both theſe, for he ſuppoſes each of theſe in their turns.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is difficult, I think, to know what Mr. M. means by "will worſhip, and the inventions of men," as applied to the caſe before us. If by this he means ſomething external, ways of worſhip and conduct which men invent and practiſe, to expreſs their devotion and reſpect to God, which I ſuppoſe is the ſenſe in which theſe phraſes are commonly uſed, they are not applicable to this caſe; for it is not pretended by any one that the unregenerate or any other are urged to any ſuch thing. If he means any motions and exerciſes of the heart that are neither right nor wrong, in themſelves, neither ſinful nor holy, theſe are indeed "the inventions of men," of Mr. M. at leaſt; for there are in reality no ſuch, which are not holy, and yet not utterly ſinful,"</p>
               <p>All the ſeeming force and plauſibleneſs in what Mr. M. ſays here, if there <hi>ſeems</hi> to be any, lies in the ambiguity of the word <hi>encouragement,</hi> which may be taken, in different ſenſes, and is often uſed ſo.</p>
               <p>To encourage, ſometimes means to invite, urge, and exhort a perſon to ſomething, urging him to it by good reaſons and motives. In this ſenſe God's encouragements and commands cannot be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; for where there is ſuch encouragement, there is a command, implied or expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Sometimes encouragement means that which gives a hope and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſucceſs in any buſineſs and purſuit. And when we ſay a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has encouragement to do this or the other thing, we mean that this is the moſt likely way to obtain hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> end which he is purſuing. And to encourage him to any particular way of conduct, is to let him know that this is the moſt hopeful way to miſs of the evil he dreads, and obtain what he ſets up, as the object of his purſuit, be that what it will.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſenſe of encouragement mentioned, God encourages men to holineſs, and nothing elſe. In the laſt ſenſe, he encourages men, let their hearts be as ſinful and oppoſite to him as they will, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on the means of grace. He has ſo ordered things that this is the moſt likely way to eſcape the greateſt evil, and be happy forever; ſo that when they come to view things in any meaſure as they are, and are above all things afraid of eternal deſtruction, and deſirous of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs, they will be induced from a principle of ſelf-love, or ſelfiſhneſs, even that very principle which ſets their hearts againſt God, and leads them into all the wickedneſs they practiſe, with great care and anxiety to attend on theſe means. The whole encouragement, as laid before them, lies in its being the moſt hopeful and likely way to promote their intereſt, and anſwer the end which they are purſuing. God has ſo contrived and ordered things, that whenever the ſinner's conſcience is thoroughly awakened and convinced, and he comes to a ſenſe of the wretchedneſs of his caſe, and attends to what is contained
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:011295_0073_0F869F1D82CC27F0"/>
in divine revelation, and labours under no particular deluſion; he will forſake thoſe ways in which ſecure ſinners live, and purſue the moſt likely way to obtain deliverance, and eternal ſalvation, however vile his heart is, and tho' he is a greater enemy to God, and all that is good now, than he was before. And thus there is encouragement to all this, and this is the encouragement God ſets before the ſinner. And a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be "utterly ſinful;" that is, inclined to nothing elſe but ſin; yea may be growing more and more guilty and vile continually, and yet take this encouragement, and act upon it.</p>
               <p>He who will conſider theſe things, muſt be ſenſible, I think, that the encouragement ſinners have to attend on means, &amp;c. is conſiſtent with their obeying no command, and doing no duty, while they act under the influence of this encouragement; and that God may, and does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with the purity of his nature, encourage his creatures to that, in doing which they are utterly ſinful: And that Mr. M. has confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf by uſing the word <hi>encouragement</hi> in an indeterminate or wrong ſenſe, as many others have done. Yea, I think it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſuch a reader, that the paſſage I am conſidering is ſo far from proving any thing, that it is quite unintelligible, and contains in it, as many abſurdities, at leaſt, as there are ſentences.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this head about encouragement, I would obſerve, that when Mr. M. undertakes to ſhew what encoueagement there is to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, on his plan of commands to do unregenerate duties, he ſeems to have a right notion of encouragement; but finds no more than they do who teach the unregenerate that they do no duty while they continue ſo, and places it upon the ſame bottom they do, in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>To all who with earneſt concern, thus attend on God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed means, the language <hi>ſcripture encouragement</hi> is, may be God will be gracious, who can tell, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> perhaps ſovereign grace may be diſplayed for your help, in this way. It implies in it that God is a God of infinite goodneſs, can exerciſe his mercy towards them thro' Chriſt in this way, conſiſtent with the honor of all his other perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that they are in ſome meaſure in the way in which he is wont to beſtow mercy on periſhing ſinners whenever he does beſtow it; the way in which millions have found mercy; and the way out of which he has determined, in the ordinary diſpenſation of his grace, not to beſtow it.<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 72.</note>
                  </q> I have endeavoured particularly to ſhew that the ſinner has all this encouragement in the uſe of means, in my <hi>tenth</hi> ſection.—And when he again undertakes to ſhew "the uſefulneſs and importance" of the truth he contends for,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 82. notes.</note> he mentions nothing but what is conſiſtent with the doctrine he is oppoſing.</p>
               <p n="3">III. ANOTHER of Mr. M's arguments is in the following words, <q>Again, it is further evident, that the unregenerate are otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to attend on the means of grace, than meerly by being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to repent and believe, in a goſpel ſenſe: Becauſe if they are not, then none of the unregenerate would be required to attend on the means of grace, until they had attained to a competency of ſpeculative knowledge, in order to ſaving faith; ſince till then they
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:011295_0073_0F869F1D82CC27F0"/>
are under a natural impoſſibility of believing; <hi>and ſo of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately required to believe.</hi> And ſince the goſpel does not require any natural impoſſibility, as the condition of life, it muſt thence clearly follow upon this principle, they are not required to attend on means at all.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>I would here juſt obſerve, that I believe Mr. M. will not be able to prove one thing which he here aſſerts, viz. that there is a natural impoſſibility in requiring men to do, what is naturally impoſſible to them. There is no more <hi>natural impoſſibility</hi> in doing this, than there is in requiring any thing elſe, however <hi>unreaſonable</hi> it may be. I know not why Mr. M. aſſerted this, ſince, if it was true, it is nothing to his purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>P. 83, 84, 85.</p>
                     </note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. The word of God requires ſinners to be always ſo friendly to him at heart, as to be diſpoſed and ready to believe every truth which he reveals and propoſes to them, and to have exerciſes anſwerable to that truth; or to receive the love of the truth. They are under no natural impoſſibility of doing this. If they do this they will not attend on means, as do the impenitent and unregenerate; therefore they are not required to attend on means in any one inſtance as ſuch, or with an impenitent unbelieving heart. Mr. M. ſays, very agreeable to truth, <q>God don't make the depraved will of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the rule of his duty: but requires him to reach the appointed end. Make you a new heart and a new ſpirit, for why will ye die? Turn yourſelves and live ye?<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 52.</note>
                  </q> And he allows that <hi>all</hi> under the goſpel are required to pray, and do all other duties in <hi>a gracious manner;</hi> which, he will not deny, implies faith.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 97.</note> How came he, juſt now, in direct contradiction to this, to ſay all are not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required to believe? God does not require men to believe any truth which never has been propoſed to them, and which they have had no opportunity to underſtand: but he requires them to attend to every truth ſet before them, and receive it with a penitent heart, and in the exerciſe of love to him.</p>
               <p>It is true, there are many under the goſpel who have not that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative knowledge neceſſary in order to their exerciſing faith in Chriſt; but this is wholly their own fault, owing entirely to their depraved wills. Were their hearts as they ought to be, they would underſtand and receive every truth as ſoon as propoſed to them: and this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, and nothing leſs. If they did ſo, they would in no inſtance attend on means as do impenitent unbelievers. Though God will not give them a new heart, and bring them to a right temper and diſpoſition of mind, while they are inattentive and ignorant; yet he always requires that diſpoſition of mind which is inconſiſtent with, their inattention and ignorance: for as he does not make the depraved will of ſinners the rule of their duty; ſo he does not make the rule of
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:011295_0074_0F869F1EAB6C7098"/>
their duty the rule of his conduct, in giving or not giving a new heart. Mr. M. ſays <q>If there be ſome under the goſpel that are deſtitute of it</q> (i. e. of a competency of ſpeculative knowledge, in order to faith) <q>as not having opportunity and advantages for acquiring of it, they are not required to attend on means of grace at all.</q> (that is, on my plan)<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 87-88.</note> I anſwer, there is no ſuch inſtance. All under the goſpel have this opportunity and advantage, and their ignorance, impenitence, and unbelief is their own fault. Were they, in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as God requires them to be, they would have underſtood the truth when firſt propoſed, that is, as ſoon as they became moral agents, in the exerciſe of love, repentance and faith.</p>
               <p>If perſons under the goſpel were not required to attend on means until, with all their depravity, ſtupidity and dullneſs, they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a good degree of ſpeculative knowledge; and could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to repent and believe, till in a long courſe of the uſe of means they had attained to this, how can we account for our Saviour's call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon men, when he firſt began to preach to them, to "repent and believe the goſpel?" And why did the apoſtles direct men immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to repent and be converted, and believe on Jeſus Chriſt? If they might preach ſo to perſons who had much leſs opportunity and advantage to get ſpeculative knowledge, than all under the goſpel now have, ſurely this may be required of all now. And this is a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern which all preachers of the goſpel ought to follow, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe another way of preaching and addreſſing ſinners; calling upon them to do a ſet of duties ſhort of repentance and faith, under the notion that the latter are not yet their duty. The truths of the goſpel ought to be clearly preached and ſet before ſinners, and one truth is, that they are required to repent and believe the goſpel as ſoon as propoſed; and that he that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. MR. M. undertakes to prove that the unregenerate are required to do duty in an <hi>ungracious</hi> manner; or, as he expreſſes it, "though they fail and come ſhort of a gracious manner," by aſſerting and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to prove that the regenerate, or children of God, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to do duties in this manner.<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 97.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The argument ſtands thus. Duties are required of the regenerate, or true Chriſtian, which they muſt, and often do conſcientiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, though they have no gracious or holy exerciſes, but come wholly ſhort of the leaſt degree of love to God or man. Therefore the ſame duties are required of the unregenerate, as they may do them without any grace, as well as the regenerate, &amp; as no truly good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſes of heart are neceſſary or required in order to perform them.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe this argument is quite new, and that Mr. M. in advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is perfectly an original. And therefore that I ſhall be the firſt that ever attempted to anſwer it. Indeed, it appears to me to want no great matter of an anſwer.</p>
               <p>In this argument Mr. M. ſuppoſes, not only that a principle of grace may be perfectly dormant and unactive in the true Chriſtian; ſo that in this reſpect he may not differ at all from him who is ignorant
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:011295_0074_0F869F1EAB6C7098"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, and perfectly impenitent, and obſtinately hates his whole character: but that ſuch may and actually do conſcientiouſly attend on the duties of the firſt and ſecond table, and uſe conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and painful endeavours, and their utmoſt efforts to do them in a gracious manner, or in the exerciſe of true love to God and man: and yet not have the leaſt degree of ſuch exerciſe, but fall wholly ſhort of it in all they do, having nothing better in their heart, or more like true Chriſtian holineſs, than the impenitent unbeliever may have: and that when this is the caſe they do that duty, which God requires of them! Such ſuppoſitions as theſe, I conclude, will appear not only weak and abſurd, but very whimſical and ridiculous to the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reader; and more ſo as they are repreſented in Mr. M's book<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 97,—101.</note> than in this abridgement.</p>
               <p>I have often heard them tell of <hi>dead Chriſtians;</hi> by which I ſuppoſe they mean, Chriſtians who have no exerciſes of grace at ſome ſeaſons. But ſuch muſt be <hi>very dead</hi> indeed; I ſhould think "twice dead, and plucked up by the roots," who, when they ſtrain ſo hard, conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly take ſo much pains, and exert their repeated and utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to call up and put forth the exerciſe of grace, are not able to produce the leaſt ſpark or motion of this kind. Mr. M. puts his Chriſtian to as hard a taſk, as Elijah did the prophets of Baal: he may "cry aloud," be in the greateſt earneſt, and put forth his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and efforts to wake up, or recall his grace; but it is either too faſt aſleep to be awaked, or is gone on a journey, &amp; ſo cannot be recalled. However he gives him more conſolation than thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had; for if the Chriſtian utterly fails in his conſcientious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and remains as graceleſs as he who has no grace, he will not loſe his pains: ſeeing he, after all, does his duty.</p>
               <p>But what are theſe conſcientious endeavours to exerciſe grace, or to perform duties in a gracious manner? Do they imply any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of heart towards holineſs, or any actual idea, or liking of that in which holineſs conſiſts? No: for this is the exerciſe of grace. They muſt therefore conſiſt in exerciſes of heart directly oppoſite to holineſs, or in exerciſes and endeavours which are neutral, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined nor tending to the exerciſe of grace; nor to that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly and contrary to it. The former cannot be meant I conclude. Nor can they conſiſt in the latter, for two reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> there are in nature no ſuch exerciſes and conſcientious endeavours, which are perfectly and equally indifferent towards holineſs and ſin, and imply no inclination to one or the other. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If there could be any ſuch, they would be no more endeavours to do duty in a gracious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than in an ungracious and ſinful manner; becauſe, by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, there is no more of an inclination or tendency to the former than to the latter.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture gives us a quite different idea of the Chriſtian from this which Mr. M. has ſet before us. According to that, the Chriſtian is wholly made up of fleſh and ſpirit, two different and oppoſite prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:011295_0075_0F869F1F631AFBF8"/>
and the latter is as conſtantly exerciſed as the former, and is no more dead or aſleep than the former, though it may be exerciſed in a weak and low degree. "The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh: and theſe are contrary one to the other."<note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. V. 17.</note>. The ſpirit is never ſaid to be dead; but on the contrary the Chriſtian has "<hi>crucified</hi> the fleſh, with the affections and luſts,"<note n="‖" place="bottom">v. 24.</note> and "the law of the ſpirit of life has made him free from the law of ſin and death."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. VIII. 2.</note> And there is not one word ſaid in the bible about theſe <hi>graceleſs</hi> duties of Chriſtians; not one exhortation to them, or the leaſt hint about them in all the New Teſtament, where there are ſuch a number of letters wrote to Chriſtians, and ſo many directions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts given to them. I am confident, and every one elſe will be ſo, I truſt, that Mr. M.'s regenerate, dead, <hi>graceleſs</hi> Chriſtian, has no exiſtence in the New Teſtament, nor in nature. The character he gives of ſuch an one being quite unſcriptural, and in itſelf a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>Mr. M.'s repreſentation of this matter, is not only unſcriptural, but a fatal reſting place for many nominal Chriſtians; a refuge of lies, in which many have doubtleſs periſhed. They think they are not to blame for not acting, and doing duties in "a gracious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner." Grace is from God, and they can exerciſe no degree of this without the ſpirit of God, which is not at their diſpoſal, but is given or withheld as God pleaſes. They therefore reſt in their good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and endeavours, and what they call conſcientious performance of duty, as all that is required of them; not conſidering that they are commanded to be "filled with the ſpirit," and always to live and walk in the ſpirit, and bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit; and that not to do ſo, is to oppoſe and quench the ſpirit, and to live after the fleſh. Mr. M. expreſsly ſays, that if Chriſtians, as well as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, are not required to do duty not in "a gracious manner," or without the exerciſe of holineſs, then <q>no chriſtian duty is required of us, but as we are moved by the ſpirit, ſince this can't be done but as moved and aſſiſted by the ſpirit.<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 107.</note>
                  </q> What can be the meaning of this, but that Chriſtians are under no obligation to do duty, in a gracious manner, unleſs when actually moved and influenced thereto by the ſpirit of God; which not being always the caſe, they are not at all to blame for not acting in "a gracious manner;" but have only to wait till God ſhall move them by his ſpirit? Sweet doctrine to many graceleſs Chriſtians, and tends to fix them on the fatal rock, on which multitudes are periſhing!</p>
               <p>THE reaſon Mr. M. gives why theſe graceleſs, unregenerate duties are equally required of the regenerate and unregenerate is remarkable, and worthy of particular notice here. He ſays <q>God don't require theſe things, becauſe they have in them any poſitive virtue, or true moral goodneſs; but becauſe of a <hi>negative</hi> moral goodneſs they have in them; i. e. the abſence of a greater degree of true moral
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:011295_0075_0F869F1F631AFBF8"/>
evil, than there would be in the careleſs neglect of them.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 98, 99.</note>
                  </q> And again he ſays, the reaſon of the requirement of theſe performances is <q>not becauſe they are holy; but becauſe they are <hi>leſs unholy.</hi> There is a leſs degree of true moral evil in the conſcientious performance of them, than in the contemptuous neglect of them, and <hi>therefore</hi> are they required.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 101.</note>
                  </q> On this I have two things to obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr. M. has here reduced his commands to meer <hi>prohibitions</hi> in which God only forbids ſin. And the duty he contends for is nothing but abſtinence from ſin, or not committing it: or rather committing a leſs ſin inſtead of a greater. Undoubtedly God <hi>forbids</hi> all ſin of every degree and kind, but this, I conceive, is quite different from commanding duty. Nor is every inſtance or degree of abſtinence from ſin, or of the non-commiſſion of ſin, doing duty, as Mr. M. here ſuppoſes. A tree or horſe commits no ſin; but none will ſay they do any duty. But a tree does as much duty as any man does in meerly not committing ſin; and a rock has as much "negative moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs" as the beſt man on earth, and much more; and ſo more of Mr. M.'s negative duty, as there is leſs moral evil; yea, the abſence of every degree of moral evil.</p>
               <p>I think Mr. M. has run into all this confuſion and abſurdity by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding prohibitions with commands, and not diſtinguiſhing doing duty, from meerly not committing ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If every inſtance of abſtaining, from any ſin, or greater degree of ſin, that might be committed, is doing duty, as it is according to Mr. M. then all men do ſome duty, ſomething that God requires; for none commit all the ſin that in nature is poſſible, and the ſins of moſt are much leſs than thoſe of the greateſt ſinner that ever lived: all theſe have therefore a great degree of "negative moral goodneſs," or the abſence of a great degree of true moral evil. And the greateſt ſinner of all, has a conſiderable degree of this ſort of moral goodneſs; for it cannot be ſuppoſed that he is as great a ſinner as is poſſible. Yea, will it not follow that moſt of mankind have much more moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and do much more duty, than ſin? No individual commits half the ſin that in nature is poſſible; and there are millions of ſins actually committed, of which he is not guilty. All his ſins put together, are as nothing to the ſins of the whole world of mankind, and of all the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len angels. Now if his not committing all this is negative moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and duty, his ſin hardly bears any proportion to his goodneſs and duty.</p>
               <p>And according to Mr. M. every leſs ſin, every ſin except the greateſt of all that ever was committed, or can be, is in ſome ſenſe required of God, viz. as having a degree of negative moral goodneſs in it, or not being ſo bad and ſinful as ſomething elſe, which might take place in its room. Conſequently God requires and commands every ſin in the univerſe, except it be the greateſt of all; and even that too, if there is leſs moral evil in it, than might have been, on any ſuppoſition. All theſe I ſay muſt be commanded for the ſame reaſon which Mr. M. gives for graceleſs duties being required; for "there is a leſs degree of true
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:011295_0076_0F869F1FC4A1F190"/>
moral evil in them," than in the greateſt poſſible ſin, "and THEREFORE they are required." I leave it to the reader, whether theſe conſequences are not fairly deduced from Mr. M's principles, and way of reaſoning on this head.</p>
               <p n="5">V. MR. M. forms another argument thus. It is a ſin to diſobey and counteract the dictates of natural conſcience; to be without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gratitude to God and our benefactors among men, from a principle of ſelf-love: And to be without natural affection, ſuch as the affection of parents to children, &amp;c. All theſe appear from ſcripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſinful, and even a high degree of wickedneſs. It hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that, acting agreeable to the dictates of conſcience; the exerciſe of gratitude merely from a principle of ſelf-love, and natural affection between parents and children, &amp;c. which are found with the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, as well as others, are duties and required of God: for if they are not required, "the abſence of them would be no ſin: Becauſe "where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion."</p>
               <p>Mr. M. introduces this argument P. 101. And then reſumes it again, and dwells long upon it from P. 109. to P. 113. I have not ſtated it exactly in his words, as this would take up too much room; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is here ſet in as ſtrong and advantageous a light, as it ſtands in his book. The reader who has acceſs to that may ſatisfy himſelf. And he will be ready to judge whether there is any weight in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, when he has attended to the following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Acting contrary to the dictates of conſcience is in all caſes a ſin; becauſe this is acting contrary to love to God. It does not follow as a conſequence, that acting agreeable to the dictates of conſcience is vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or duty; but only that love to God is ſo. In this caſe, the ſin of acting contrary to the dictates of conſcience does not ſtand in oppoſition to acting according to the dictates of it; but to obedience to God's law, which requires love to him. Both of the former may be ſin. It is always contrary to God's law, and is ſin to diſregard the dictates of conſcience, and that may be, and often is a ſin, and directly contrary to God's law, which is agreeable to the dictates of conſcience. Theſe are, in this reſpect, not in oppoſition to each other, but both are in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the divine law. The phariſee who went up to the temple to pray, had lived in obedience to his conſcience, and acted up to the dictates of it; and did ſo in the addreſs he made to God; Yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none will ſay he was doing his duty, and obeying God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; or that God required him to do as he did, when he ſtood praying. To be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Mr. M. will not; for he repreſents him as guilty of high-handed wickedneſs in making this prayer, and even one of the vileſt ſinners on earth. In obeying his conſcience, he diſobeyed God, inſtead of obeying him, or being friendly to him in the leaſt degree. Acting againſt the dictates of conſcience is ſinful, becauſe this is in all caſes acting againſt God: Therefore acting agreeable to the dictates of conſcience is ſin, when perſons doing thus act againſt God, which is the caſe always when they are enemies to him, as are all the unregenerate.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:011295_0076_0F869F1FC4A1F190"/>2. It does not appear that want of gratitude to benefactors, from a principle of ſelf-love only, is any where ſpoken againſt or condemned in the bible. Chriſt repreſents the worſt of men as acting from ſuch a principle.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. V. 46, 47.</note> When St. Paul ſays of the Gentiles "Neither were they thankful;" it does not appear that he ſpeaks of thankfulneſs, from natural principles as Mr. M. expreſſes it, or a principle of ſelf-love; but of that thankfulneſs which God's law requires, and conſiſts in true love to God. It is altogether without foundation, or the leaſt evidence that Mr. M. ſuppoſes that when St. Paul ſpeaks of the Gentiles not glorifying God as God, and not being thankful, he means glorifying God, and rendering gratitude to him upon natural principles, or from ſelf-love. They were bound by the higheſt obligations to glorify God and expreſs their gratitude to him from the higheſt and beſt principles even true love to him, and had no excuſe for not doing it: and it would be perfectly unaccountable if St. Paul quite overlooked this the greateſt of all their crimes, when he was ſetting forth the greatneſs of their wickedneſs, and ſpeaks only of that which was immenſely leſs criminal, and is really no crime, any further that it is contrary to true love to God. I can account for Mr. M's running into this notion no other way but by concluding he ſuppoſed that the Gentiles and all men unregenerate are not obliged to act from any higher principles, than thoſe he calls natural; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> notion which he ſeems to carry with him thro' his book, tho' he ſometimes contradicts it.</p>
               <p>What is called natural affection cannot be ſuppreſſed and rooted out but by the prevalence of a high degree of ſinfulneſs. Therefore to be without natural affection is an argument and evidence of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of a great degree of wickedneſs. It was therefore to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's purpoſe to mention this, in order to ſhew the bad character of the perſons he was deſcribing. This is conſiſtent with there being no command requiring the mere exerciſe of natural affection, or prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, forbidding the want of it. The ſtrong and confirmed exerciſe of pride and ſenſuality (to uſe preſident Edwards's words quoted by Mr. M.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 113.</note>) "tend to overbear and greatly diminiſh the exerciſes of "thoſe uſeful and neceſſary principles of nature." And nothing elſe will do it. Therefore where natural affection is overborn and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, it is a certain evidence of a very bad, vile character. To be without natural affection, and to be monſtrouſly wicked is the ſame thing. Yet natural affection is not a virtue, nor is it in any ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as a duty. They who exerciſe it in the higheſt degree, are herein no more obedient, and do no more duty than the brutes, is whom it takes place as well as in men; as Mr. M. obſerves, to be without natural affection, is <q>falling below even the brutal nature, that is wont to retain that inſtinct of fondneſs to their young.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 113.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By being without natural affection, is intended ſomething more than what is meerly negative, or not being influenced by this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It intends that exerciſe and conduct which is directly contrary to it, which ſhews that it is overborn and ſuppreſſed. Thus the Heathen, in many inſtances, were without natural affection, i. e.
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:011295_0077_0F869F2089745D48"/>
acted directly contrary to it, when they burnt their children to death, as a ſacrifice to their Gods. The ſon is ſaid to be without natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when he puts an end to his aged father's life, that he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit his eſtate. The father is ſaid to be without natural affection when he acts a cruel part to his child, and ſells it into the hands of barbarous men, to get money to enable him to purſue his intemperance and lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In this caſe that wickedneſs, which leads a man to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract natural affection, and ſuppreſs it, is cenſured and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and not meerly the abſence of natural affection. Therefore it does by no means follow from ſuch an expreſſion that the exerciſe of natural affection is required, and is a duty.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Another</hi> argument which Mr. M. offers in favor of commands to the unregenerate duties is, that if there are no ſuch commands &amp; they have no duty to do while impenitent enemies to God, then nothing is required of them, they are left without any law or reſtraint, to indulge their luſts as they pleaſe, without any motive or encouragement to the contrary, and to attend on the means of grace. This leaves ſinners at liberty, and they have nothing to do. He ſays, that upon the principle he is oppoſing, <q>the unregenerate while ſuch, are not required to pray at all; and by parity of reaſon, not required to attend any other duty, ſince they can no more perform them in a gracious manner than they can prayer. And therefore, according to this principle, are <hi>in no ſenſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to perform them.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 107.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And again he ſays, it <q>takes off all reſtraint from the unregenerate, and opens a floodgate to all manner of iniquity.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 117, 118.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I would obſerve here, that when he ſays, the unregenerate, while ſuch, are not required to pray at all, and are <hi>in no ſenſe</hi> required to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any duty, he cannot mean that they are not required to pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> impenitents, and do unregenerate duties; for this would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. The principle he is oppoſing is, that nothing is required of men at duty which they do while unregenerate. And if this is all he means to aſſert in theſe words, they are no more than to ſay, <q>If unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate duties are not required, then unregenerate duties are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;</q> which is to ſay nothing. What he here ſays, he infers as a conſequence from the principle, that no unregenerate duties are required, as an argument againſt it. But the principle itſelf is no conſequence from itſelf, or argument againſt it; for this is only to ſay, if the principle is true, it is indeed true. Juſt as if I ſhould undertake to prove I am not now writing againſt Mr. M. in oppoſition to ſome one who had ſaid I was, by ſaying, this cannot be true, for from this principle it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that I am writing againſt Mr. M.—Beſides, Mr. M. here ſays, that according to this principle they are <hi>in no ſenſe</hi> required to do any duty; which denies that they are under any command to do any duty, if not required to do unregenerate duty.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. ſays things to the ſame purpoſe in many other places of his book; I will mention but one; which is in the following words, <q>And if this perverſion, which, is here given of this text, <hi>ſtrive to enter,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould be received for truth, I cannot but think it would have a very bad
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:011295_0077_0F869F2089745D48"/>
tendency to increaſe ſecurity and negligence about religion, and open profaneneſs among the unregenerate. If this text does not reſpect the unconverted, and enjoin duties upon them, where can there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſage found in the bible that has any reference to them? Let this author produce ſome divine law, requiring the duties, endeavours and exerciſes of the unregenerate, or ſay plainly, <hi>there is nothing required of them in this ſtate.</hi>
                     <note n="¶" place="bottom">P. 50, 51.</note>
                  </q> Here we ſee he ſuppoſes that if any text does not require unregenerate duties, and enjoin ſomething to be done by man while impenitent, <hi>it has no reſpect to the unconverted,</hi> nor <hi>enjoins any duty upon them:</hi> And that there is no medium with him between their being required to do unregenerate duties, and nothing being required of them: And that in this view to deny that unregenerate duties are required, <q>has a very bad tendency to increaſe ſecurity and negligence about religion, and open profaneneſs among the unregenerate.</q> Here I would obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not true that if nothing is required of the unregenerate, which they will do while in that ſtate, then nothing is required of them in any ſenſe. It has been before obſerved, that they are as much under law as the regenerate, and required to practiſe godlineſs and humanity, in the exerciſe of love to God and their neighbour. They cannot be excuſed from this, and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if ſo, (then there is no ſuch thing as blame in the univerſe; nor any ſuch thing as law and moral government. For according to this, no perſon can be obliged to any thing which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> not inclined to do. Therefore he can be under no law but his own inclination and will; nor in the leaſt to blame while he follows this, which every one always does.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. does repeatedly aſſert that the unregenerate are required to be holy, and to do duty in a right and holy manner. But he ſeems in theſe paſſages mentioned, and others, to forget all this, and take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the contrary is true, elſe he never could have expreſſed himſelf as he has. And I appeal to the judicious reader to judge, whether his whole book does not owe its exiſtence, to his latent maxim in favor of the unregenerate, viz. That they cannot be required to do any thing which they may not do in a ſtate of unregeneracy, ſo are to blame only for the neglect of ſuch duties, and for walking in thoſe ways that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them; this being the maxim he builds all upon, tho' he has ſometimes aſſerted the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This being the caſe, every thing being required of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that is in itſelf deſirable, good and excellent, and urged with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the greateſt good, even of eternal life, if they hearken and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the leaſt degree of ſincerity; and with the moſt awful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings of eternal deſtruction, if they obſtinately perſiſt in impenitence and rebellion; nothing can be more ſuited to awaken and alarm them, to deter them from ſin, and excite them to duty.

And if theſe truths are kept out of view, nothing remains by which the ſinner can be convinced of his true ſtate, and thoroughly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened. How then could Mr. M. imagine that to preach this to the unregenerate, with all that is implied in it, and nothing elſe, "would have a very bad tendency to increaſe ſecurity and negligence in religion, and open profaneneſs among the unregenerate?" It is moſt certain that if this is left out of view, and nothing but unregenerate duties are preached up, not one ſinner will be awakened &amp; convinced. And if they are preached up, as they often are, &amp; as Mr. M. does, (at leaſt in his book) as being that in which the duty of the unregenerate principally, if not wholly conſiſts, and that their ſin chiefly lies in the neglect of them, they being not much if at all to blame for not loving God and not embracing the goſpel; it has the greateſt tendency to keep ſinners in ignorance, ſecurity eaſe; and if it does not make them negligent of all religion, it tends to lead them to neglect and oppoſe all true religion.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. and they who join with him, are wiſer than John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt; &amp; if he was wiſe and right in his way of preaching, they are not ſo. He ſaid not a word of unregenerate duties, but preached and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated nothing ſhort of repentance, true repentance,—that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with which the remiſſion of ſin was connected,<note n="¶" place="bottom">Luk. III. 3.</note> that repentance which implied a preparedneſs of heart to receive and believe on Chriſt, when he ſhould be revealed.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Act. XIX. 4.</note> He required of all his hearers <hi>good fruit,</hi> fruits meet for repentance, on pain of eternal damnation,<note n="§" place="bottom">Luk. III. 8, 9, 17.</note> and ſaid not a word to them of any doings ſhort of this, even repentance and faith on him who ſhould come after him. Indeed, when he was aſked by perſons what they ſhould do in order to conduct as penitents<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> what fruits they ought to bring forth, which were meet for repentance, and a proper manifeſtation of it? he told them what external conduct they muſt go into, in order to this,<note n="†" place="bottom">Luk. III. 10,—14.</note> But this was not directing them to impenitent unregenerate doings, but pointing out the exerciſe and fruits of that repentance, which he required.</p>
               <p>And had this preaching any tendency to ſecurity and open profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Did this "take off all reſtraint from the unregenerate, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a flood-gate to all manner of iniquity?" No; quite the reverſe.

               <p>IF Mr. M.'s ſervant ſhould deſert his ſervice and run from him, and he ſhould ſend a meſſenger after him to perſuade him to return, with offers of pardon upon his ſubmiſſion, and threatenings of death if he refuſed: if when the perſon he ſent ſhould overtake him, and the ſervant ſhould refuſe to return one ſtep back, and draw his ſword upon him to oppoſe him; he ſhould, inſtead of perſiſting in requiring him to return, direct and perſuade him to do ſomething agreeable to his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and conſiſtent with his hating his maſter and obſtinately refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to return: Would Mr. M. think he was faithful to his truſt, or that
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:011295_0078_0F869F216487E208"/>
this had more of a tendency to awaken the ſervant to a ſenſe of the evil caſe he was in, or promote his return? Would it not be the moſt proper, and likelieſt way to rouſe the attention of the ſervant, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his going off yet further, to keep up the maſter's demand, and ſhew the unreaſonableneſs and crime of refuſing to comply;—the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſequences of his returning, and the dreadful evil that a refuſal would bring upon him, &amp;c.? Certainly the ſervant would have no heart to make himſelf merry in his ſuppoſed liberty, or be diſpoſed to go out of the hearing of theſe things, ſo long as he had any realizing belief of them, and thought there was any hope in his caſe, while he attended, however unwilling he ſhould be to obey his maſter's orders, and return.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the ſinner did his duty while he continued a perfectly impenitent enemy to God and the Saviour in attending on means, &amp;c. and he is told that God commands him to do theſe things with ſuch a heart as he has, ſeeing he is unwilling to repent and return to God, and obſtinately oppoſes it; and he ſhould be urged to do them from this conſideration; it would not have the leaſt influence upon him, or be any motive to him to comply. The ſinner has no regard to duty, as ſuch, and is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to do any thing merely becauſe it is duty: this will never be a motive with him to take one ſtep, or to exert himſelf ſo much as to lift up a finger. So far as he is influenced by this conſideration, he is not an impenitent; but has true reſpect and love to God, and is diſpoſed to return to him and embrace the goſpel. He is, by the ſuppoſition, only ſeeking his own intereſt, and cares nothing about God or duty to him, in themſelves conſidered, and for their own ſake; if he does, the point is gained, and it will be enough to tell him, it is his duty to repent and believe on Chriſt, and there will be no need to deviſe a lower ſet of duties for him which he may do merely from a principle of ſelf-love, and as an enemy to God, could there be any ſuch duty: for this is at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to urge him to do duty, not becauſe it is his duty, and without any regard to it as ſuch. There is therefore a plain contradiction and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, in the very propoſal. The perſon is ſuppoſed, and known to have no regard to his duty, and to care nothing about it, as ſuch; if he had, it would be enough to tell him, it is his indiſpenſable duty to love God and embrace the goſpel. But while he has no regard to this, he will be influenced and governed by ſome other motive in all he does, and not at all by this. Nothing but a principle of ſelf-love can be applied to in this caſe, which has no regard to duty, as ſuch; but his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. If he can be thoroughly and feelingly convinced that it is for his own intereſt to avoid one thing and do another, this will be a forcible and ſufficient motive to induce him to do it. But if not, and it ſeems to him to be for his own intereſt to act contrary to duty, he will pay no regard at all to the command, how much ſoever it is urged upon him; it is quite equal with him whether he does his duty, or not. He can no more be influenced or bound by obligation and duty, than the man poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with devils could be reſtrained and confined with fetters and chains. He will break all theſe bands; however great and ſtrong they are, he will eſteem them as ſtraw and rotten-wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="unknown:011295_0079_0F869F21F6CE9BF0"/>As the unregenerate are wholly under the influence of ſelf-love, and ſeek their own intereſt only, they regard duty only as it does, in their view, tend to their own intereſt. And in this view they may have a ſort of deſire to do their duty, as the moſt likely way to eſcape evil, and obtain the good they want. But however high their regard to duty in this ſenſe riſes, they yet have no regard to it for its own ſake, or conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idered meerly as duty; but purely for their own ſakes, as they conſider their own intereſt to be connected with it. If therefore it is for the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intereſt of the unregenerate to avoid all open vice, and diligently attend on the means of grace, it being the only likely way to eſcape eternal deſtruction, and attain endleſs happineſs, and they can be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced of this, it will be the greateſt, and <hi>only</hi> motive that can be ſet before them to induce them to this, and will certainly and effectually influence them: And the conſideration that this is their duty, if it was ſo, would not add the leaſt grain to the motive. It is a matter of perfect indifference with them whether it is duty, or ſin, if they may anſwer their own ends by it, and promote their own intereſt.</p>
               <p>God knew this to be the ſtate of the ſinner, and has ſo contrived and ſuited things to this, in the revelation he has given, without ſaying a word to them of doing any duty while they continue impenitent, that as ſoon as their conſciences are awakened, and they begin to ſee in what a ſtate they are, they will forſake the courſes of the ſecure profligate, and attend on the means of grace.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. and others have in their great wiſdom deviſed another me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of treating with ſinners, by trying to perſuade them to do their duty while perfect enemies to God, if they had a true regard for their duty, and deſire to do it for its own ſake; when their unregeneracy and all their ſinfulneſs conſiſts, in the want of ſuch regard to duty, and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart to it. In this they are therefore guilty of the abſurdity of ſuppoſing ſinners have ſome true reſpect to God, that is, ſome true love to him, and his law, while they are obſtinate and perfect enemies to him, and have never had the leaſt degree of repentance of any of their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. And this way of treating ſinners, is ſo far from having any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to their good, that it tends to keep them in ignorance and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and always has this effect where there is nothing to prevent its genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine influence.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I end this ſection, I would obſerve the phraſe, <hi>conſcientious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duty,</hi> which Mr. M. uſes ſo often with reſpect to the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and the regenerate, when they have no grace, or are not in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it, is very ambiguous, and tends to give a wrong idea of the caſe. I think the natural and proper import of the phraſe is, a perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of duty in ſincerity and out of true reſpect to the duty as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If he who is only an eye ſervant, and has no true reſpect to his maſter, but hates him and his ſervice, behaves obediently in his maſter's preſence, merely becauſe he is in his maſter's hands, and fears his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure and the red; no one perhaps will think this may be properly called, a <hi>conſcientious performance of duty.</hi> But this is as properly and as much ſo, as the beſt performances of the unregenerate, or of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:011295_0079_0F869F21F6CE9BF0"/>
whoſe grace wholly fails them, if any ſuch there are. If Mr. M. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends any more by this phraſe, which I conclude he does, he has only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on himſelf and his reader. Men may act agreeable to their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, i.e. not know that what they do is contrary to the command, but think they are doing what is right, as Saul did when he perſecuted the church; and yet not come up to the conſcientious performance of duty, any more than the ſervant juſt mentioned, if they act from the ſame principles.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>IN which ſeveral paſſages in Mr. M's book are attended to, which have not been particularly conſidered in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſections.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I TOOK ſome pains to prove in my remarks on Dr. Mayhew's ſermons, that the words, "I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them,"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ezek. XXXVI. 37.</note> do not mean the prayers of the unregenerate for a new heart.<note n="¶" place="bottom">See Enq. P. 61,—70.</note> And Mr. M. has taken as much or more pains to prove the contrary, in a long marginal note.<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 72,—85.</note> I ſhall not trouble my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or the reader ſo much as to take notice of all he ſays, on this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It may ſuffice to ſay that he has not attempted to anſwer what I have ſaid to eſtabliſh my ſenſe, unleſs it be groſsly to miſrepreſent it; which he ought in all reaſon to have done, ſince he undertook to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me. I ſhall therefore conclude I have a right to think my ſenſe of the text, and arguments to ſupport it ſtand good, notwithſtanding all he has ſaid, till Mr. M. or ſome one elſe, ſhall ſhew wherein their weakneſs lies. The miſrepreſentation I ſpeak of is this, he repreſents my ſenſe of the text in the following words, <q>I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, i. e. by the godly few; to do it for them, i. e. to beſtow on theſe godly few a new heart. Or the conſtruction muſt run thus, to do it for them, i. e. not for them, but for others that were unregenerate.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 75, 76.</note>
                  </q> Whereas I give no ſuch ſenſe of the text, or any thing like it. I undertook to prove, by many parallel places that the thing which God would be enquired of to do it for them, was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from their captivity, and reſettlement in their own land in peace and proſperity; and ſaid not a word of a new heart as the thing to be aſked for. Nor do I ſay that by the houſe of Iſrael are meant "the godly <hi>few.</hi>" It may mean the godly <hi>many,</hi> notwithſtanding any thing I ſay. Mr. M. ſuppoſes that <q>a great number of Iſraelites were bro't to true repentance, and the body of that people were reformed.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 76.</note>
                  </q> He indeed ſeems to ſuppoſe this took place after their return to their own land. The truth of the caſe is, this took place in a degree, and in many inſtances before any of them returned. And after great numbers had returned, they were in their own land in a ſtate of great affliction and diſtreſs for many years, in which time they humbled themſelves before God, and earneſtly ſought

deliverance, and confeſſed and put away the ſins that had been found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and entered into Solemn covenant to renounce all ways of ſin, and cleave to God and ſerve him. They appeared to have a new heart, humble, penitent, obedient heart, while they confeſſed their ſins and earneſtly enquired and ſought of God the deliverance they wanted. There were propably many, even <hi>great numbers</hi> of true penitents; theſe with the reſt of the people, who were reformed and in profeſſion true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, were the <hi>houſe of Iſrael,</hi> who enquired of God, and earneſtly and ſolemnly beſought him (the godly with true ſincerity, and the reſt only in appearance) to return their captivity, deliver them from their diſtreſſes, &amp;c. This leads me to obſerve another groſs miſtake Mr. M. has made here. He ſays I deny that by the houſe of Iſrael in the text are meant the ſame people who under this phraſe are ſpoken of in the preceeding context.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 76, 77.</note> For this aſſertion he had not the leaſt reaſon, as I am ſure it is not true; as any one may be, who will read what I have wrote on that argument.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I leave this <hi>long note,</hi> I ſhall remark upon a number of other paſſages in it: not pretending however, to mention every one that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me very exceptionable.</p>
               <p>He ſuppoſes the prayers and ſeeking of the unregenerate are ſpoken of in the following words, "I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf thus. Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke. Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Jer. XXXI. 18.</note> 
                  <q>He ſays, "Tis evident that while unconverted he thus bemoans him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, confeſſing the juſtice of God's chaſtiſement, his own ſtubbornneſs and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I obſerve Mr. M. here repreſents the unregenerate ſinner as being converted already; he is became ſubmiſſive, pliable and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>eachableneſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the juſtice of God in his eternal damnation. And being quite reconciled to turning to God, and having a very good will in the matter, he cries to God to do that for him, which he cannot do himſelf, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever well diſpoſed he is towards it. This is the light in which many ſet the unregenerate who are awakened to a concern about their eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and in which multitudes view themſelves, and imagine they are doing their utmoſt and crying to God, to do that for them, which they are quite willing, and would be glad with all their hearts to do, but it is utterly beyond their power. It is impoſſible that the ſinner who has this notion of himſelf, ſhould feel himſelf wholly to blame for not turning to God, and be ſenſible that not embracing the goſpel is the greateſt of all ſins, or that he deſerves to be damned for it</p>
               <p>The unregenerate ſinner is ſo far from being of this character, that he is properly repreſented by the foregoing words, "Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed <hi>as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke.</hi>" The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinner is always like a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:011295_0080_0F869F2331E66DE8"/>
who will not ſubmit to the hand of his maſter, but is perfectly untoward and oppoſite, and only attempts to get out of his hands. But as ſoon as he comes to a better mind, and has a new heart, he condemns and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moans himſelf, and ſenſible of his perverſeneſs, and the oppoſition of his heart to God, he heartily cries, "Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned." This is the prayer of a regenerate ſinner, ſubmitting to God, after a courſe of obſtinate rebellion, and feeling his own perverſeneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God for all moral good, as no unregenerate ſinner ever did.</p>
               <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, the regenerate are turned already, why ſhould they pray to God to turn them? I anſwer, they are turned in a low and imperfect degree, and now ſee unſpeakably more of the perverſeneſs and obſtinacy of their hearts than ever an unregenerate perſon did. They need the continuance of the influence which has changed their hearts in ſome degree, and to be turned more and more. Thus David prays, long after he was a good man, "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new a right ſpirit within me."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. LI. 10.</note> The chriſtian needs to be turned, as really as any other man, and ſees his need of it more, and heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires it. Why then ſhould he not pray for it? Would Mr. M. or any other man, think it improper and ſtrange, if he ſhould hear a number of profeſſed chriſtians uſe this expreſſion in prayer, "Turn us, and we ſhall be turned"? Has he not uſed it, or expreſſions of the ſame import, times without number?</p>
               <p>Mr. M. ſays, <q>He is repreſented as converted, while he ſtands praying for it, as is <hi>inconteſtibly</hi> clear from the following words, <hi>For thou art the Lord my God,</hi> ſurely after that I was turned I repented, and after I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh, &amp;c.</q> The whole that Ephraim is repreſented as ſaying here appears to be one continued addreſs to God, which may be diſtinctly read over in leſs than half a minute. It is but two ſentences; the petition "turn thou me" is urged by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. "For thou art the Lord my God." Surely this is not the language of the unregenerate. He then proceeds to ſpeak of the change that had paſſed upon him, ſince he was as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke, and was the ground of his coming to God with this humble petition as he now does, and is a repreſentation of the temper of mind with which he now addreſſed God. He, crying to God with this temper of mind, as a friend to his character, and a penitent, returning ſinner, is accepted and obtains favor: God immediately ſays, "I will ſurely have mercy upon him." Mr. M. in order to make it <hi>inconteſtibly clear</hi> that he was converted while he ſtood praying, takes part of the firſt ſentence, which is the reaſon and argument with which the petition is urged, "For thou art the Lord my God," and adds it to the next ſentence; becauſe it would not do to put theſe words into the mouth of an unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: by which he has broken and ſpoiled the ſenſe of the whole. If he "is repreſented as converted while he ſtands praying for it," he was converted in the middle of a ſentence. He ſaid "Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned." And then ſtopped, becauſe he could go no further while unconverted; and when he got converted, he finiſhes the ſentence
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:011295_0081_0F869F238B51A0F8"/>
he had began, and urges the petition he had made in an unconverted ſtate, by an argument be could not uſe while unconverted; which peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was granted before he mentioned the argument. He therefore uſed the argument when there was no need of it or of ſo much as making the petition; for he had already got what he aſked for. If he could not make this petition after he was converted, how could he after this back it up, and plead to have it granted, even immediately upon its being granted?—I was agoing to ſay what I think is <hi>inconteſtibly clear</hi>—But I forbear, and leave it to the reader.</p>
               <p>I WOULD make a brief remark upon what he ſays on the prodigal. He ſuppoſes his coming to himſelf, and conſequently ſeeing that there was bread enough and to ſpare in his father's houſe, and reſolving to go and confeſs his ſins to his father and aſk admiſſion into his houſe; and his actually doing this, is deſigned to repreſent the unregenerate under convictions. His words are, <q>He now began to be in want, felt himſelf in a famiſhing condition for want of bread: this put him in earneſt upon thinking what he had done; and as all hope of relief that now remained was from his father; he earneſtly looked out for help in this way, and found relief. All this is a lively repreſentation of the ſinner's being brought to a feeling ſenſe of his periſhing want of the bread of life, and that God only has it in his power to beſtow: and therefore will grant earneſtneſs to look to God for it, as one that ſeeks bread, when life is at ſtake.<note n="¶" place="bottom">P. 79.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here he makes the unregenerate ſinner, who is under the dominion of his luſts, an enemy to God and the Saviour, and ſo blind that the goſpel is hid from him: he makes ſuch an one, I ſay, to have his eyes opened to ſee the wonderful fullneſs there is in Chriſt for ſinners, and to deſire and long for a ſhare in it, as a hungry man longs for bread; to look to God, and actually go to him for it; loathing himſelf for his ſins, and earneſtly longing to be God's ſervant, and dwell in his family. In ſhort, he makes the unregenerate ſinner come up to every thing which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to his finding mercy, according to Chriſt's repreſentation of the matter by the prodigal; and all that to which the promiſes of God's favor are every where made in the goſpel. And Mr. M. may be challenged to tell what more ever takes place in a ſinner, in order to his finding mercy, than he here ſays the unregenerate come to. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here ſee again what little reaſon Mr. M. had to thank me for prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there are no promiſes to the doings of the unregenerate; and that all I ſaid to prove this, is, as it conſiſtent with his notion of the character and doings of ſuch as it is with Dr. Mayhew's; and as is any thing contained in my ſection on means. No ſuch thing can be proved conſiſtently with what he ſays here, and in many other places: But the contrary is the undeniable conſequence.</p>
               <p>The prodigal in all he did alter he began to be in want, till he came to himſelf, repreſents an unregenerate ſinner, under awakenings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of conſcience. In this ſtate he took methods to help himſelf, which were vain and wholly failed him: But had not the leaſt inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:011295_0081_0F869F238B51A0F8"/>
of returning to his father's houſe. This blinded him to the fullneſs of it, and the deſirableneſs of dwelling there. This is a ſhort but true and ſtriking repreſentation of the ſtate of the unregenerate, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever awakenings and convictions they are under. They begin to be in want; they feel themſelves in a miſerable, periſhing ſtate; and this is the ſole ground of all their uneaſineſs and exerciſes. They ariſe and exert themſelves, but ſpend their money for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which ſatisfieth not.<note n="¶" place="bottom">Iſai. LV. 2.</note> They ſee not their true ſinfulneſs and unworthineſs; ſo do not confeſs. They have not the leaſt inclination to return home to God, however pinched they may be on every ſide with a ſenſe of their own want. But as ſoon as they have a new heart, their eyes are opened, and they come to themſelves; they ſee what fools they have been: what guilty wretches they are; what full and rich proviſion is made for the moſt wretched and vile in Chriſt the Mediator, and in theſe views, return home to God, and as humble penitents fly for refuge to ſovereign mercy.</p>
               <p>It is plain therefore that our Saviour intended to repreſent the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinner by the prodigal, when he came to himſelf, &amp;c. And we have reaſon to admire the preciſion and clearneſs of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he here makes. None but a teacher ſent from God could have ſpoken theſe words. But they never were underſtood nor can be, by thoſe who differ from this divine teacher in their notions of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the unregenerate as much as Mr. M. appears to do. And, by the way, if Mr. M. had no better notion of the unregenerate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſinner, than is given in this parable, by the prodigal before he came to himſelf, he would never have thought of his growing ſo much better, or leſs ſinful; nor been ſo much offended at his being ſet in ſo bad a light in my ſection on means.</p>
               <p>But Mr. M. has made more ſad work yet, I think, in what he ſays on the parable of the phariſee and publican.<note n="*" place="bottom">Luk. XVIII. 9,—14.</note> He ſays our Saviour in the publican meant to give the character of an awakened, convinced, unconverted ſinner, in diſtinction from a proud, ſtupid, ſelf-righteous ſinner; and takes conſiderable pains to prove it.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 79,—82.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Our divine teacher in this ſhort parable exhibits two different and oppoſite characters, in which the exerciſes and character of the true Chriſtian are in a very clear and ſtriking manner expreſſed, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all other religious exerciſes and characters on earth. In the publican we have the character which is repreſented through the Old Teſtament, as the diſtinguiſhing character of the godly, to whom promiſes of the divine favour are conſtantly made. Confeſſion of ſin is repreſented as peculiar to thoſe who find mercy.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. XXVIII. 13. Pſal. XXXII. 5.</note> The true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, who ſhare in his mercy, and are the objects of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar favour, are the humble, thoſe of a broken heart and contrite ſpirit.<note n="§" place="bottom">Pſal.

CXLVII. 11.</note> All this is expreſſed in the publican's prayer, "God be merciful to me a ſinner." It is not poſſible for a man to ſay theſe words, conſidered in their proper ſenſe and latitude, underſtandingly and heartily, unleſs he is a true penitent, and in a true ſenſe of what ſin is, and what it deſerves, with a humble, broken, contrite heart, flies to the ſovereign mercy of God, as revealed and offered to ſinners in divine revelation, and makes this his only hope and refuge. And in this are ſummarily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all the exerciſes of true Chriſtian piety. What is expreſſed in theſe words "God be merciful to me, a ſinner," is the very ſoul and ſpirit of the fifty-firſt Pſalm, in which not an unregenerate ſinner, but DAVID, an eminent ſaint, expreſſes the humble, penitent, pious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of his heart. This pſalm is, as it were, epitomiſed, with ſo much judgment and preciſion, and the very ſpirit of true piety, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed through the whole of the Old Teſtament, is ſo comprehenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſummed up in this ſhort ſentence, which Chriſt puts into the mouth of the publican, that it is one ſtanding evidence, among ten thouſand others, that he was a divine teacher. No man, unleſs divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, would ever have tho't of thus diſtinguiſhing all true piety from that which is not ſo.</p>
               <p>But ſo great is the blindneſs of men, ſuch are their prejudices, that when this is done to their hand by him who ſpake as never man ſpake, they overlook all the inſtruction that is given, and cannot ſee any part of the character of the godly, or the leaſt expreſſion of true piety in the words. But think they rather expreſs the heart of a friend to ſin, an enemy to God, and an obſtinate oppoſer of his wonderful mercy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſinners in Jeſus Chriſt. Who would expect to find Mr. M. among theſe, who has had ſo long a time, and been under ſo many advantages to find out what is the ſpirit of true Chriſtian piety, and what are the exerciſes of the ſaint in his approaches to God?</p>
               <p>But let us attend to the reaſons he gives againſt the meaning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this parable, which I have endeavoured briefly to eſtabliſh, and in favour of his own.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſays "there does not appear any thing in the publican's prayer concluſive of his being a ſaint, no diſtinguiſhing character of a ſaint." I am ſorry this did not <hi>appear</hi> to him, ſince I am ſure nothing but prejudice or ſome worſe cauſe could prevent it. But enough of this before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He queries what inſtruction is here given worthy of a divine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, if the parable is underſtood in the ſenſe he oppoſes? "Is it that the prayer of a ſaint, put up in faith, is more acceptable to God than the prayer of one of the vileſt ſinners upon earth?"<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>WHY was the phariſee one of the greateſt ſinners on earth? He was a reformed ſinner, and did many duties from a principle of ſelf-love and natural conſcience. He had tenderneſs of conſcience, and was very exact and careful to avoid all known ſin, and do all known duty. Why did not God take a favourable notice of him, and expreſs his approbation? Mr. M. will ſay perhaps, he truſted in his own righteouſneſs to recommend him to God.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Why ſhould he not do this? How can this be ſo great a ſin, ſince this was, according to Mr. M. worthy of God's <hi>favourable notice?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. The awakened convinced ſinner has as much of this ſame ſpirit and diſpoſition as the phariſee had. It is true, his conſcience is convinced that his own righteouſneſs will not avail for his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but this is not in his favour, but rather againſt him, as he continues of this diſpoſition of heart, and indulges it, under all the light and conviction he has, and is actually attempting to recommend himſelf by his own righteouſneſs and doings; this being as agreeable to his heart, as it was to the phariſee. And his heart oppoſes the way of acceptance by a Mediator, at leaſt as much as the phariſee did.</p>

ANS The inſtruction given is very great, and moſt important and intereſting. It does not teach us indeed, what prayer is moſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and pleaſing to God for it's own ſake, or conſidered in itſelf; for in this reſpect all ſinners are perfectly on a level, and the holieſt prayer is no more acceptable than any other. The holieſt ſaint that ever was, is no more acceptable to God in his perſon or offerings, than the vileſt ſinner on earth, conſidered in any other view than as united to Chriſt, and truſting in his merit and righteouſneſs alone to recommend his perſon and offerings; for both are, in any other view under the curſe of God, and proper objects of the divine diſpleaſure and abhorrence. But our divine teacher here tells us, in a very plain, familiar, ſtriking way and manner, what is that character, and what are thoſe exerciſes in which the ſinner comes to God, ſo as to find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and obtain mercy through a Mediator, as diſtinguiſhed from every character, and all the exerciſes which fail of this. Or with what temper and exerciſes the true Chriſtian draws near to God, and lives by faith in Chriſt, from firſt to laſt; and in what true Chriſtian humility and piety conſiſts, as it is diſtinguiſhed from every thing elſe, and points out the only way to heaven, in diſtinction from all by-paths. This I endeavoured briefly to illuſtrate juſt now. Wo to him who has not yet this inſtruction, either from this, or ſome other paſſage of ſcripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He aſks "Is this the whole truth? Does it agree with the ſcripture account in general, of the difference between a ſaint and a ſinner?" What has been ſaid before is an anſwer to this. And it is not a little ſurprizing that ſuch a queſtion could be aſked. But the next words are more ſhocking ſtill. <q>Is it not the character of a ſaint to lift up his eyes with his heart to God in prayer; to draw near with full aſſurance of faith, and come boldly to a throne of grace? All which are directly the reverſe to the character here given to the poor, dejected publican.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="unknown:011295_0083_0F869F29B4CC1D00"/>ANS. The publican had a great degree of the aſſurance of faith' which conſiſted in truſting in the mercy of God, while his great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs was in full view. There is no true aſſurance of faith but this. And he was bold indeed to come to God for mercy, and make this his only refuge, bringing nothing in himſelf but ſin, and a clear and affecting view of his amazing, infinite guilt &amp; vileneſs. This is all the true Chriſtian boldneſs that ever any one had or exerciſed in coming to the throne of grace. There is no other boldneſs but that of the phariſee, ſet in direct oppoſition to this of the publican. He who does not like, and exerciſe the boldneſs at the throne of grace, which is deſcribed in the character of the publican; but exerciſes another ſort of boldneſs before God, has certainly nothing but a phariſaical boldneſs, whatever name he may call it by. I ſee not why Mr. M. ſhould not, like the phariſee as a ſaint, had he not been called by ſo bad a name, and expreſsly condemned by our Saviour. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he had that very boldneſs which Mr. M. means by Chriſtian boldneſs, ſo far as his idea of it differs from that which appears in the publican. And I know not why Mr. M. cannot well ſay and do juſt as the phariſee did; only <hi>call</hi> it <hi>humble boldneſs,</hi> inſtead of <hi>proud boaſting.</hi> The publican is ſaid not ſo much as to lift up his eyes to heaven, not to denote <hi>dejection,</hi> but humility and faith, in oppoſition to the pride and boldneſs of the phariſee; even that chriſtian humility, without which, there is no true confidence and boldneſs at the throne of grace.</p>
               <p>It is to be hoped that Mr. M. daily makes this prayer &amp; comes to the throne of grace with that very faith and boldneſs, which is recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the character of the publican, and that he has been advancing in this for many years, however unaccountably he has overlooked it on this occaſion, and wrote in ſuch a manner, that I know not how the humble chriſtian can read it, and enter into the true ſpirit of it without being ſurprized and ſhocked in a manner that is not eaſily expreſſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He ſays, tho' "This man went down to his houſe juſtified," i. e. actually accepted and pardoned, it does not follow that he was ſo when he prayed; but he might be converted ſoon after, even before he got down to his houſe. This is therefore no evidence that he did not make an unconverted prayer; and is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt his ſenſe of the parable, that it ſtrongly ſupports it, and ſhews the efficacy and ſucceſs of the prayers of the unconverted; ſo is an inſtance more to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>ANS. Chriſt here exhibits a character in the publican, and theſe words are predicated of this character, and nothing elſe, and are the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs aſſertion, that they who have <hi>this character</hi> are accepted and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And they who, becauſe they like not this character, will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine and form another, quite different one, about which, Chriſt ſays not one word, and apply theſe words to that, are very preſumptuous, and ſet their own wiſdom up above that of a divine Teacher. They who take this liberty will make wild ſteerage indeed!</p>
               <p>The words immediately following, which Mr. M. has entirely neglected,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:011295_0083_0F869F29B4CC1D00"/>
are worthy of particular notice. "<hi>For</hi> every one that exalteth himſelf, ſhall be abaſed; and every one that <hi>humbleth</hi> himſelf ſhall be exalted." Theſe words fix the ſenſe of the parable, if nothing elſe did. The phariſee exalted himſelf; the publican humbled himſelf; therefore was juſtified, and exalted. Here Chriſt does in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs manner declare that all who are of the character exhibited in the publican, and do as he did, do humble themſelves, and ſhall be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Here then Mr. M. has again found an abſolute promiſe of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to his <hi>humble,</hi> unregenerate ſinner; and muſt according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation hold to ſuch promiſes. We might from this, and other inſtances of the like kind, ſafely conclude he had renounced the book he formerly wrote to prove the contrary, had he not mentioned it in his preface to this with approbation, and thanked me for eſpouſing the ſame cauſe, and finiſhing the debate. But as the caſe now ſtands, it is a glaring inſtance, among many others of the moſt groſs inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with himſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. thro' his whole book, and in the paſſage I am now upon, frequently ſpeaks of his awakened ſinner, as the <hi>humble</hi> ſinner, and often as <hi>legally humbled.</hi> This is not a ſcripture expreſſion, and it is difficult to know what he means by it, unleſs it be true humility, or elſe ſomething directly contrary to it. The ſcripture every where ſpeaks of the <hi>humble</hi> perſon, as one who by his humility is diſtinguiſhed from the ungodly, and as one who is intereſted in God's favor, as our Saviour does in the words under conſideration.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ahab and Rehoboam and the princes of Iſrael are ſaid to <hi>humble themſelves.</hi> 2 Chron. XII. 6, 7. But this has reference only to their external conduct; the appearance and profeſſion of true humility which they put on, and not to any thing in their hearts. If they had really and heartily humbled themſelves, they would have been exalted and ſaved forever: But as they did this only externally, God gave them, an anſwerable external deliverance, and that only.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I PASS to another paſſage in this remarkable <hi>note.</hi> Mr. M under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to repreſent the ſtate of an unregenerate ſinner, with reſpect to his deſires of the ſalvation offered in the goſpel, by a perſon who has a mortification, ſo that it is neceſſary the limb ſhould be cut off in order to ſave his life. In this caſe, from his love and deſire of life, he on the whole, earneſtly deſires, and cheerfully ſubmits to the operation.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 88, 89.</note> This, Mr. M. ſays, is "a plain ſimile." I anſwer, it is not ſo, nor at all to the purpoſe, unleſs the unregenerate do on the whole deſire the ſalvation which the goſpel offers: yea, deſire it as a man, in danger of death, deſires life, and do cheerfully ſubmit to the terms of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and actually chooſe and embrace Chriſt and his righteouſneſs as offered in the goſpel, in order to eſcape damnation.</p>
               <p>MR. MILLS's notion of faith, is, I think, worthy of ſpecial remark. He does not undertake to deſcribe faith, and particularly ſhew what it is: but he repeatedly ſuggeſts what may lead us to his notion of it.
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:011295_0084_0F869F2A818E73E8"/>
He, ſpeaking of perſons inſiſting that the unregenerate are required to pray in faith, adds, <q>A thing as impoſſible in nature, as for the ſame thing to be, and not to be at the ſame time; not only becauſe faith implies regeneration, but alſo <hi>becauſe there is no promiſe for the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate to ground their faith upon,</hi> as the author has abundantly proved.<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 42.</note>
                  </q> And again, ſpeaking of the ſame thing, he ſays, <q>Beſides, what have the unregenerate, while ſuch, to ground an act of faith in prayer upon? ſince, as the author hath well proved, they have no title to any of the promiſes.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 94.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>What is faith, then, according to him? why plainly this, a peſon's really believing that God has promiſed life &amp; ſalvation to him, or that he has an intereſt in the divine promiſes: for if faith was any thing elſe but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a perſon might believe before he has any promiſe made to him, or is intereſted in any promiſe; which Mr. M. here ſays he cannot, and that it is as impoſſible as for the ſame thing to be, and not to be at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>It follows from this that ſinners muſt be intereſted in the promiſes, before it is poſſible for them to believe, or do any thing in faith. For if there is no promiſe made to any thing lower than faith, and ſhort of that, ſo that the ſinner may be intereſted in the promiſe, before he believes, he never can believe, becauſe in order to his exerciſing faith, he muſt be intitled to the promiſe. But Mr. M. agrees, and has earneſtly contended that there is no ſuch promiſe. Therefore, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him it is abſolutely impoſſible, as impoſſible, as that the ſame thing ſhould be and not be at the ſame time, that there ever ſhould be any ſuch thing as faith exerciſed by any in this world, whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate or unregenerate: for none have a title to any promiſe before they believe.</p>
               <p>It alſo hence follows that it is not the duty of the unregenerate to believe, and ſo not their duty to exerciſe any true holineſs; nor are they in the leaſt to blame for the neglect of all this; it being abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible to them. And if faith and repentance are not their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unbelief and impenitence are no ſin. No wonder then Mr. M. has eſpouſed the cauſe of the poor, innocent, unregenerate againſt me, who had charged them with great guilt and vileneſs in continuing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent unbelievers, &amp; had repreſented this as the greateſt ſin of which they could be guilty. This is perfectly wrong and abuſive, if his account of faith is right. And no wonder he is zealous to find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of unregenerate duties to be done; for according to him nothing elſe is their duty; and if they have no unregenerate duty to do, they have nothing to do, and nothing is required of them; it being moſt unreaſonable and abſurd to call upon them to repent and believe.</p>
               <p>But if faith is a cordial belief of the truths of divine revelation; or ſeeing them to be what they are <hi>with approbation of heart,</hi> ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wanting in order to this but a right taſte and temper of mind, or a wiſe and underſtanding heart; then this is the duty of all, for the neglect of which, none have the leaſt excuſe; and all may be moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:011295_0084_0F869F2A818E73E8"/>
called upon to believe, and threatened with God's higheſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure and eternal damnation, if they neglect it. But if Mr. M.'s account of faith is right, none of theſe things are true. Who can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this, and many other things which Mr. M. has ſaid agreeable to it, and not think that at bottom, he believes the unregenerate are not at all to blame for unbelief, or any thing in which unregeneracy conſiſts, even tho' he has never expreſsly aſſerted it, and has more than once granted the contrary?—But I paſs to another thing which is worthy of particular notice.</p>
               <p>MR. MILLS, after he has ſaid much to prove that the unregenerate are commanded to do unregenerate duty; at length deſires it may be noted to prevent miſtakes &amp; objections <q>that in what has been, or may be ſaid of the unregenerate's being required to pray, &amp;c. he would be underſtood to mean ſuch of the unregenerate as are <hi>viſibly related to God in covenant;</hi> at leaſt, admitted by baptiſm, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trained up under the advantages of the goſpel, laid under ſolemn vows to deny ungodlineſs, &amp;c. Theſe, all theſe, whether regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or unregenerate are required to pray and attend on all other religious and <hi>chriſtian duties, as above.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 97.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He keeps this in view, and reminds the reader near twenty times as a matter of great importance to be obſerved, that he is ſpeaking of "God's covenant people." His "viſible covenant people, viſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to God in covenant."</p>
               <p>It is difficult, I think to know what he means by this. But let his meaning be what it will, it does not appear to what purpoſe he makes this obſervation, or what miſtakes and objections it tends to prevent. Does he mean to exclude all others from any obligations to do duty, and as not being required to do any duty at all? It ſeems he does: But for what reaſon? If his arguments prove that there are unregenerate duties required of any, they equally prove they are required of <hi>all,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſibly in covenant or not. Has Mr. M. nothing to ſay to others; muſt not they be required to attend on means, pray and do other duties? muſt they be left to abandon themſelves to all wickedneſs, and have nothing required of them? What does he mean by this diſtinction? Does he ſuppoſe that none are under any obligation to any duty, until they of their own accord enter into covenant with God, and ſolemn engagements and vows to do it? If there are any commands requiring ſomething to be done by the unregenerate, while they continue ſuch, being impenitent enemies to God, no reaſon can be given why all ſuch, whether "viſibly related to God in covenant" or not, are not requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do theſe duties.</p>
               <p>But why does he ſay, "Theſe are required to pray, and attend <hi>other religious and chriſtian duties?</hi>" What he aſſerts, and attempts to prove is, that they are required to do <hi>unchriſtian</hi> duties: duties which perſons are to do, not with a chriſtian, but with a perfectly unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſpirit; not as chriſtians, but as enemies to Chriſt. And how can theſe be called <hi>chriſtian</hi> duties?</p>
               <p>By thoſe who are "viſibly related to God in covenant," he means,

I conclude, if the words have any meaning, thoſe who have entered into covenant with God, by profeſſedly giving themſelves up to him, as his friends and ſervants, to be obedient to him in all things, as his people and ſervants, &amp; as the diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt. None but ſuch are viſibly related to God in covenant. None but ſuch put on the profeſſion and appearance of God's people, nor are in <hi>appearance</hi> (which I ſuppoſe is the ſame with being viſibly ſo) in covenant with God.

It is therefore impoſſible that he who is viſibly unregenerate, can be of God's viſible covenant people, as impoſſible as it is, that one ſhould be a true chriſtian in appearance and profeſſion, who at the ſame time <hi>appears</hi> to be an open enemy to Chriſt. There is therefore the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt abſurdity, in addreſſing and teaching thoſe who are "viſibly related to God in covenant," as tho' they were unregenerate, and appeared to be ſo, or directing and exhorting them to unregenerate duties. Therefore if ſuch directions and requirements are made to any, they muſt be made to the viſibly unregenerate, and not to thoſe who are God's viſible covenant people, or the viſible friends and ſervants of Chriſt. Mr. M. is therefore ſo far from "preventing miſtakes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving objections" in theſe words, that he has himſelf made as groſs a miſtake as he well could, and opened a door to the greateſt objections, while he confines unregenerate duties to the viſibly regenerate, and at the ſame time calls them <hi>chriſtian</hi> duties; and excludes all the viſibly unregenerate, to whom alone exhortations and commands to unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate duties can be made, if to any, as not being the proper ſubjects of ſuch exhortations and commands. The covenant of grace, the chriſtian covenant, by entering into which men become "viſibly related to God in covenant," propoſes and requires no duties to be done by them, as viſibly unregenerate and enemies to God, but <hi>chriſtian duties,</hi> which are incumbent on them as Chriſtians. Their entering into this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant therefore lays them under no obligations to act as the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and do duties as ſuch; but the contrary. If they might before this, while viſibly unregenerate, be exhorted and commanded to do unregenerate duties; they cannot now; upon their becoming viſible ſaints, and viſibly related to God in covenant, they are to be treated as ſaints, and not as unregenerate, and the duties of the chriſtian cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which they are to do in the character of Chriſtians, are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated oh them, and no other.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. however appears to be of a different opinion; he thinks the unregenerate may ſincerely and heartily enter into covenant with God, and do chriſtian duty with no better a heart than they have, and not pretend, profeſs or engage any thing more than an unregenerate perſon may heartily do, conſiſtent with his being unregenerate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:011295_0085_0F869F2AF8F87CE8"/>
to be ſo. However inconſiſtent this is in itſelf, it is in a meaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Mr. M.'s notion of the unregenerate, under awakenings and convictions of conſcience. He conſiders them to be ſo humble, peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and obedient; ſo well diſpoſed towards their duty, and deſirous and inclined to obey and ſerve God, and do all that they can; and as little or nothing to blame for not embracing the goſpel or doing any thing that implies regeneration and ſaving converſion; that it is no wonder he thinks they may heartily give themſelves to God with a deſire to ſerve him, and do all their duty, waiting on God in this way, to do that for them, which they, (poor innocent creatures!) <hi>cannot,</hi> work in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which they would be glad with all their hearts to do, if it was in their power. All who have ſuch notions of the unregenerate, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talk of their covenanting with God and being his viſible covenant-people, while they are viſibly unregenerate; and think the unconverted may ſincerely and properly do and be all this, and heartily perform ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties which are required of them; with much more ſuch like jargon.</p>
               <p>But they who conſider the unregenerate as impenitent and obſtinate enemies to God and Jeſus Chriſt, who with all their hearts oppoſe and reject the goſpel, for which they have no excuſe, but are as voluntary and as wholly blameable in this, as in any external acts of ſin; and that theſe external acts, ſuch as lying and profane ſwearing, derive all their odiouſneſs and blame from this ſinfulneſs of heart, and (as being fruits of it: and that unregeneracy itſelf, or that in which it conſiſts, is a moſt odious, blamable, ſcandalous wickedneſs, and that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, overt act of ſin is properly ſcandalous, in any other view than as an evidence and fruit of the former: I ſay, they who view things in this light, and have this notion of the unregenerate, which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavoured to ſhew is the true one, will never talk in the language of Mr. M. which I am conſidering. They have no notion that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with God, and being God's viſible covenant people, is ſo conſiſtent with the character of the unregenerate, that they have any right externally to enter into this covenant. They are ſenſible that ſuch an appearance and profeſſion, and viſible covenant relation to God becomes none but the true Chriſtian; and if the unregenerate take on them this appearance and profeſſion, they lie to God and man, in a moſt aggravated and ſhocking manner; are guilty of mocking God, and of groſs hypocriſy: and ſo do that which is much more vile and provoking in God's ſight than no profeſſion, or pretence to that which implies love to duty, and to God. And they know the unregenerate do not deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and live ſoberly and righteouſly in this world unleſs it be in appearance and pretence, which is moſt contrary to the truth, and the worſt ſort of lying.</p>
               <p>I SMALL conclude this ſection with obſerving that Mr. M. has in the latter part of his book a great deal to ſay about "ſome that are, or have been public teachers." He charges thoſe with holding ſeveral things which I ſhould think did not concern me, was it not that I am ſome how blended with them, as if we were one and the ſame. I know not what right Mr. M. had to do this. I have no connexions with them that
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:011295_0086_0F869F2BB66A57F8"/>
I know of, nor do I think I am obliged to anſwer for what they have ſaid. It is enough if I can anſwer for myſelf.</p>
               <p>I have heard there have been ſome religious jars and contentions of late years, in the county in which Mr. M. lives, and one or two mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have been depoſed in the tumult. Theſe things he attributes to the "new divinity" which he often mentions; and to "ſome who are or have been publick teachers." Theſe, it ſeems have raiſed diſputes to the greateſt height, divided towns, broke ſocieties and churches, "ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated affection among dear brethren," &amp;c.<note n="¶" place="bottom">P. 121.</note> Mr. M. has himſelf been very zealous and active in theſe affairs; and it has been though, by many, that he, with ſome of his brethren who joined with him, have overacted their parts, and have been themſelves very much the blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cauſe of theſe diviſions and breaches, which might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or healed, in a great meaſure at leaſt, had they conducted with that prudence and judgment, that brotherly tenderneſs and caution which became them.</p>
               <p>But be this as it may, I ſee not what connexion theſe things have with any thing I have wrote. They took place chiefly before my ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on means was publiſhed, and "thoſe who are or have been public teachers," if I can gueſs who they are, have been as far from approving that ſection as Mr. M. himſelf. And I think his jumbling theſe things together as he has done, has no tendency to give light in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy between him and me; but is ſuited to lead thoſe who have not been particularly acquainted with theſe matters, into a miſtake.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Mills's INCONSISTENCIES with himſelf.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A NUMBER of theſe have been mentioned and particularly pointed out in the foregoing ſections: I ſhall juſt mention them here, under the head of Inconſiſtencies, and point out others which have not been conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In P. 16, 17, he inſiſts that <hi>internal</hi> light and conviction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, does not aggravate the guilt of the ſinner. And yet, in P. 30, he repreſents ſinning againſt the light of conſcience as the great and chief aggravation of the ſinners guilt. And, in P. 68, ſay; "It is readily granted that he that ſins againſt a greater degree of light, is in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect a greater ſinner."</p>
               <p n="2">II. Tho' he grants that he who ſins againſt a greater degree of light, is in that reſpect a greater ſinner; and that ſins againſt the light of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are the greateſt ſins: yet. P. 63, he repreſents him to be the greateſt ſinner, whoſe conſcience is perfectly blind and ſtupid.</p>
               <p n="3">III. He ſays the greater ſinfulneſs of the inhabitants of Bethſaida, &amp;c. by which they were worſe than the Tyrians and Sidonians, conſiſted in their not being brought to legal repentance and external reformation,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:011295_0086_0F869F2BB66A57F8"/>
by the preaching of Chriſt and his mighty works;<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 12, 13.</note> and yet he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſays,<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 34, 35.</note> theſe very perſons did repent and reform under the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of John Baptiſt, Chriſt and his apoſtles, and by the mighty works done among them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. He inſiſts upon the neceſſity of the influences of the ſpirit of God, in order to bring men to an awakened, convinced ſtate, or to what he calls legal repentance and humiliation. And yet he ſuppoſes the Tyrians and Sydonians would have been actually brought to this, without any ſuch influence, and by the bare uſe of the external means which the Jews enjoyed, and that Chriſt himſelf aſſerts this.<note n="¶" place="bottom">P. 12, 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. He quotes the words of the Weſtminſter and Savoy confeſſions with approbation, in which it is ſaid "the works done by the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate <hi>cannot pleaſe God.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 5, 6.</note> And yet he ſays of Ahab, Jehu, and the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites at Mount Sinai, who were unregenerate, that God took <hi>a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable notice</hi> of their works, and gave <hi>his expreſs approbation</hi> of them.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 31.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. In what he ſays concerning the ſcribe,<note n="[a]" place="bottom">P. 26—28.</note> he ſuppoſes that a perſon cannot be ſaid to be near, or not far from the kingdom of God, on account of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight ſpeculative knowledge. In direct contradiction to this, he ſays elſewhere,<note n="[b]" place="bottom">P. 61.</note> "It is evident and certain that every degree of knowledge, that is neceſſary in order to a ſtate of grace and ſalvation brings them in ſtate one degree nearer to it."</p>
               <p n="7">VII. He ſays, I have not ſo much as once mentioned the ſinner's breaking off from his ſins, as that whereby he is more in the way of mercy, than going on in them,<note n="[c]" place="bottom">P. 58.</note> And yet he repeatedly ſays<note n="[d]" place="bottom">P. 16, 54, 55, 58, 59.</note> that in my account of what renders a ſinner more likely to be ſaved, <hi>reformation of life,</hi> to the higheſt degree the unregenerate are capable of, a diligent attendance on means, and all there is in a common work of the ſpirit of God, are implied.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII He calls my ſenſe of Luke XIII. 24. a <hi>new</hi> ſenſe,<note n="[e]" place="bottom">P. 47.</note> and at the ſame time repreſents it as the Arminian ſenſe. And it appears to have been his own ſenſe, above twenty years ago, if he was <hi>then</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with himſelf.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. He inſiſts upon it, that the doctrine that impenitent unbelievers grow more guilty and vile in the uſe of means, under awakenings and convictions, has a very bad tendency, and is matter of great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a painful attendance on means, and encouragement to ſinners to abandon themſelves to careleſſneſs and vice. Yet he ſays that their appearing to themſelves to grow worſe, which is commonly, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the caſe with thoſe under genuine convictions, is no matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, but the contrary. The latter is in direct contradiction to the former; for if their looking on themſelves as growing worſe, is no matter of diſcouragement to them, then their really growing worſe cannot be ſo.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Though he inſiſts much upon it, that God requires duties of the unregenerate, which they are to do as ſuch, and which are to be done without the exerciſe of any true holineſs or goodneſs; yet, in the midſt
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:011295_0087_0F869F2CE4035088"/>
of all this, he turns right againſt himſelf, and ſays, God requires <hi>good duties, goſpel holineſs,</hi> and that God does not abate his demands of ſinners by reaſon of their "prevalent indiſpoſition of heart, and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of will to do right;"<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 115.</note> that "God don't make the depraved will of the creature, the rule of his duty; but, on the dreadful penalty of damnation, requires him to reach the appointed end. Make you a new heart and a new ſpirit, for why will ye die?"<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 52.</note> That God does not require theſe duties as they come marr'd out of their hands.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 115.</note> And yet he ſays in the ſame page, God does require them as they come out of their hands, becauſe they are leſs ſinful than the omiſſion of them would be.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Mr. M. is a zealous aſſerter that there is not one promiſe in the whole Bible, to the doings of the unregenerate; yet, in direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to this, he repreſents them as doing that to which expreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made, and applies ſuch promiſes to them.<note n="*" place="bottom">See P. 70, 72.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. He ſpeaks of denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, &amp;c. as the fruit and exerciſe of holineſs, which the unregenerate never attain to<note n="¶" place="bottom">P. 52.</note> But, in contradiction to this, he elſewhere repreſents the unregenerate as doing all this.<note n="‖" place="bottom">See P. 84, 97, 120.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="13">XIII. He aſſerts that many under the goſpel, are under a natural impoſſibility of believing, and therefore cannot be required to believe at preſent.<note n="[a]" place="bottom">P. 83.—86.</note> But, directly contrary to this, he elſewhere aſſerts, that all theſe are required to pray in faith; to make them a new heart, and turn to God, and believe, on pain of damnation.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">See P. 52, 97.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="14">XIV. He repreſents the unregenerate as not required to do any thing, if they are not required to do unregenerate duties<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">P. 50, 51, 107.</note> Yet contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this, he repeatedly ſays the unregenerate are required to be holy, and to do duty in a right and holy manner, as has been juſt now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. He ſays, "the utmoſt attainments of the unregenerate have nothing in them pleaſing to God, nothing that can recommend them to his favour."<note n="§§" place="bottom">P. 93.</note> He alſo ſays, that theſe very attainments have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them of which God takes a <hi>favourable notice,</hi> and which have his expreſs approbation.<note n="††" place="bottom">P. 31, 32.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="16">XVI. He inſiſt upon it that they who have no light and conviction of conſcience, have as much to anſwer for, and are as guilty in God's ſight, as they who have this in the greateſt degree:<note n="**" place="bottom">P. 63.</note> yet, directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this he ſays, "It is readily granted that he that ſins againſt a greater degree of light, is in that reſpect a greater ſinner."<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">P. 68.</note> And that light and conviction of conſcience "is a great and precious favour from God, and endearing grounds of thankfulneſs;"<note n="{inverted †}{inverted †}" place="bottom">P. 59.</note> conſequently if abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, renders a perſon more guilty than if he had it not.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. He repreſents the awakened, convinced ſinner as reforming <hi>all</hi> known ſin, and as coming up to all known duty.<note n="¶¶" place="bottom">P. 7, 28, 56, 109.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:011295_0087_0F869F2CE4035088"/>
But he elſewhere repreſents ſuch as ſeeing themſelves guilty of more ſin than they were ſenſible of before. The law comes and ſin revives;<note n="§‡" place="bottom">P. 92.</note> and ſays, <q>The <hi>great impurity and ſinfulneſs</hi> attending the ſinner's beſt duties, after his utmoſt efforts, is the very means God is wont to make uſe of to humble them.<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 100.</note>
                  </q> How can they ſee the great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their beſt duties, when they avoid all known ſin, and do all known duty!</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. He repreſents one end of awakenings and convictions to be ſinners being "fully convinced that in them dwells <hi>no good thing.</hi>
                  <note n="§‖" place="bottom">P. 92.</note> But he elſe where ſays there is ſome ſort and kind of <hi>goodneſs</hi> in theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of the unregenerate.<note n="†‖" place="bottom">P. 57.</note> How then can they be "fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there is <hi>no good thing</hi> in them?</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. He ſays the unregenerate are required to break off from all known ſin, and every thing in the way of embracing Chriſt, even the ſecret pride of the heart.<note n="‖{inverted †}" place="bottom">P. 109.</note> This is certainly to come out of a ſtate of ſin; which in the preceeding page, he ſays is not required to be done antecedent to faith in Chriſt, or "otherwiſe than by the medium of the goſpel, in the way of faith."</p>
               <p n="20">XX. He repreſents the ſtreams to be nothing to the fountain; the acting out of ſin to be as nothing to the fountain of ſin in the heart.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 11.</note> This is directly contrary to what he ſays of the reformed ſinner, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this account only ſo much leſs guilty and vile than others, or than he was before; even ſo as to become in a great degree innocent. And he inſiſts that ſuch external reformations, or cutting off theſe ſtreams of external ſin, are of ſo great account as to over-balance, the aggravated guilt which ſuch contract, by continuing in unbelief and rejection of the goſpel, under all the greater light they now have.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. Mr. M. blames me much for ſpeaking of any end to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the uſe of means, by the unregenerate, which is ſhort of ſaving grace, or true holineſs; and ſays that God requires them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on means to this end.<note n="[a]" place="bottom">P. 51, 52.</note> But when he comes to tell what end means anſwer, and to what end God commands ſinners to attend, he gives a different and contrary account of the matter, and ſays the end the uſe of means anſwers to them, is to convince them of their ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humble them, &amp;c.<note n="[b]" place="bottom">P. 91, 92, 100.</note> And that "they are not required to God's gracious acceptance, but to <hi>other</hi> wiſe and holy purpoſes worthy of God, ſuch as the advancement of his declarative glory in the world, &amp;c.<note n="[c]" place="bottom">P. 101.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Mr. M. is guilty of contradiction in repreſenting the Phariſee who went up to the temple to pray, &amp;c. as one of the vileſt ſinners on earth, merely becauſe he truſted in himſelf that he was righteous, and thought himſelf better than others; while he himſelf inſiſts upon it that ſuch who refrain from all known ſin, and do all known duty, as the Phariſee did, are in fact better than others, and that God takes a favourable notice of them, and has a peculiar reſpect to them on this account. And particularly repreſents the young man who came to
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:011295_0088_0F869F2D3647F730"/>
Chriſt to learn <hi>what good</hi> thing he ſhould do to inherit eternal life; and was to all appearance as ſelf-righteous as the Phariſee. I ſay, repreſents him as of ſo lovely a character, as to attract Chriſt's reſpect and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I believe Mr. M. will find it difficult to tell wherein the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference lies in theſe two characters, by which the former is the vileſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner on earth; the latter very deſireable and amiable.</p>
               <p>To theſe inconſiſtencies I ſhall add ſeveral, in which Mr. M. has been guilty of contradicting in his <hi>inquiry,</hi> what he has aſſerted in his former treatiſe, called "A vindication of goſpel truth," &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. In his <hi>vindication,</hi> he ſpeaking of St. Peter's words to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, "Repent, and pray God, if <hi>perhaps</hi> the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee," ſays, "This <hi>perhaps,</hi> as here uſed, imports in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed only a ſuſpicion of the truth of the man's repentance, and not any doubt of God's forgiveneſs, in caſe his repentance were ſincere.<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 76.</note> But in his <hi>inquiry</hi> he aſſerts the contrary, and builds his argument from theſe words on this aſſertion.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 70, 71.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. In his vindication,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 17.</note> he ſays, <q>The ſcripture no where puts mankind upon ſeeking their everlaſting happineſs, in any other way than that of <hi>well doing,</hi> truly ſuch in the account of God, i. e. <hi>doing his commandments;</hi>
                  </q> that is, as the unregenerate never do, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his meaning in the words which I ſhall quote directly.

               <p n="25">XXV. He goes on to ſay in his <hi>vindication,</hi>
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">P. 18.</note> 
                  <q>certainly none will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that <hi>well doing</hi> in the account of God, or (which is the ſame thing) doing his commandments, is what agrees to the unregenerate, under the guilt and dominion of ſin.</q> He has contradicted this two ways in his <hi>inquiry.</hi> He has done it by inſiſting that the unregenerate <hi>do God's commandments,</hi> and may keep them perfectly and be in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect perfectly obedient, while they are under the guilt and dominion of ſin; even all the commands to unregenerate doings. He alſo contradicts this by repreſenting Jehu as <hi>doing well</hi> in God's account, when all that he did is conſidered and ſpoken of as the doings a man unregenerate.<note n="¶" place="bottom">P. 32.</note>
               </p>

               <p>The reader will here obſerve how much more orthodox Mr. M. was in theſe important points, when he wrote his former book, than he is

               </argument>
               <p>IT is hoped that what has been ſaid, is ſufficient to ſhew that what Mr. M. has deſigned chiefly to oppoſe in his <hi>Inquiry,</hi> are important truths, and therefore that what he advances and attempts to ſupport, are real and hurtful errors: And the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> tendency of ſome things he has advanced has been mentioned and pointed out. But I ſuppoſe it will be proper and uſeful more particularly to attend to this matter, and conſider what is the natural tendency of this book, all taken together, ſo far as it is received and has influence.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I THINK it fully appears, from the view we have had of Mr. M.'s book, that it tends greatly to the diſhonour of Chriſt and his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. It does ſo in repreſenting ſinners more to blame for other ſins, than for the ſin of unbelief, and rejecting Chriſt and the goſpel; yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or if the ſinner is little or nothing to blame for the latter, if he reforms all other known ſins. This view of the matter Mr. M.'s book gives; no one will ever learn from this, that the ſin of rejecting Chriſt and the goſpel at heart, and that with direct acts of oppoſition and enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, is a greater ſin than injuries done to our neighbour: but he will find the contrary through the whole book implicitly or expreſsly aſſerted; and that he has often denied that there is any crime in the former. Thus he has juſtified the wicked in the greateſt ſin he is guilty of, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his ſide in the great and chief controverſy between Jeſus Chriſt and ſinners.</p>
               <p>Now what could be more diſhonourable to Chriſt and the goſpel than this, and what could ſet his character and the great ſalvation in a more unworthy, mean and contemptible light! It has been obſerved in what a different light divine revelation ſets this matter; not only that men
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:011295_0089_0F869F31A3F96578"/>
are without excuſe and wholly to blame for not heartily embracing Chriſt and the goſpel; but that this is immenſely the greateſt ſin that men can be guilty of, in compariſon with which any other ſin, is not to be mentioned: and it is eaſy to ſee in what a grand and honorable light this ſets Jeſus Chriſt. And is it not as eaſy to ſee that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doctrine, which is Mr. M.'s, equally degrades and diſhonors this glorious character?</p>
               <p>In this Mr. M. has fallen in with the inclination and humour of a fallen world. Mankind are backward to be convinced of the ſin of unbelief, and of not heartily receiving Chriſt, and embracing the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; they are inventing a thouſand pleas and excuſes in their favor, in oppoſition to ſuch convictions. They will be convinced of any thing almoſt, rather than this. And when any are convinced in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience, that this is altogether their crime, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that they are guilty of, this truth is, beyond moſt others, oppoſite and galling to their hearts. All this is owing to their not having any love to Chriſt, nor a view and ſenſe of his worthy and glorious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Mr. M. has joined hands with them in this matter, and all he has ſaid tends to prevent this conviction; to juſtify and quiet the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the pleas and excuſes he is making in his own favour. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think his book may be juſtly looked upon as an attempt to exalt, flatter and juſtify ſinners, at the expence of the honor of the glorious Redeemer. I own I view the matter in this light; and this has been a ſupporting and animating conſideration to me in the midſt of all the oppoſition made to the doctrine I have advanced on this head, by means of Mr. M.'s book, or any other way; and in the pains I have taken to ſupport this doctrine, in oppoſition to Mr. M.'s objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for I conſider myſelf as pleading the cauſe of Chriſt and attempting to exalt and honor his character, in oppoſition to a ſelf-juſtifying world; and to condemn and abaſe the ſinner, however im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and deficient the attempt may be.</p>
               <p n="2">II. MR. M.'s book tends to prevent ſinners coming to any proper, true, and thorough conviction of their guilt and vileneſs, and the ſtate they are in; and the whole drift and ſpirit of it is in direct oppoſition to this. This I have taken notice of in the foregoing ſections, and it appears from what has been obſerved in the laſt particular. The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners oppoſition and enmity of heart againſt Chriſt and the goſpel is kept wholly out of ſight, through the whole of Mr. M.'s book, and the moſt that he ſays, ſuppoſes that there is no ſuch thing in the heart of an awakened, convinced ſinner; and is in direct oppoſition to its being the greateſt of all ſins, if there is any ſuch thing. Therefore wherever Mr. M.'s book is believed, and has influence, there will be no true genuine conviction of ſin; and ſo there can be no converſion to God. And he who is brought to genuine, thorough conviction of ſin will renounce and diſcard Mr. M.'s book, ſo far as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it, as what is moſt directly contrary to the truth. There is no medium between this and loſing his convictions. Mr. M.'s book is therefore juſt as miſchievous and hurtful in its tendency; as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> an
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:011295_0090_0F869F32D6B90058"/>
attempt to prevent ſinners conſciences being thoroughly awakened and convinced; or to remove ſuch conviction wherever it takes place.</p>
               <p n="3">III. MR. M.'s book exactly coincides with the inclination of the ſinner's heart, who is in ſome degree awakened and thoughful about his eternal intereſt, and has reformed external ſins, and betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to external duty; and tends to flatter ſuch to their eternal deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and give them that eaſe and reſting place, which muſt be taken from them, or they will periſh forever.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as a ſinner's conſcience is awakened, he reforms his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conduct, and betakes himſelf to external duty, with a view to diſtinguiſh himſelf from others, by his doings, to grow better, and do ſomething to abaſe the divine anger and diſpleaſure againſt him; and if he believes Mr. M.'s book, he will think he has obtained his end, and his conſcience will be quieted, and he will reſt in a great meaſure eaſy and ſecure; for now he has forſaken <hi>all</hi> known ſin, and does all known duty, and God is leſs angry with him; yea, takes a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable notice of him; and on this account he is in a likely way to be ſaved. What can ſuch an one have to diſquiet his conſcience? He has done his utmoſt, and waits at the foot of ſovereign mercy for God to do the reſt, he not being at all to blame for not having a new heart and embracing the goſpel. In this reſting place Mr. M.'s book fixes and ſecures him, where many thouſands have periſhed eternally!</p>
               <p>Mr. M. has therefore, by his <hi>poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>abor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> only provided a refuge of lies for the ſinner to fly to and reſt in, which is perfectly agreeable to his heart, while an enemy to Chriſt, and the great ſalvation. Nor can he poſſibly be driven from this on his plan, and ſo long as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves what he has written. There are multitudes of ſecure ſinners now in New-England, and elſewhere, who have had ſome awakenings of conſcience, and ſerious thoughtfulneſs about their ſouls and eternal intereſt, and are in their view avoiding all known ſin, by doing all duty; and are reſting here, and in their own imagination waiting on God to do that for them which they cannot do of themſelves, and which they think they are not at all to blame for not doing. And here they will periſh, unleſs driven from this refuge of lies, which they are as fond of as is the open profligate of his way of ſinning. For men will love that which gives them eaſe and comfort. Such will therefore be pleaſed with Mr. M's book, and love it juſt as much as they love their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſe. And nothing will drive them from this fatal reſting-place but a clear conviction of that which Mr. M. has kept wholly out of ſight through his book, and has at leaſt implicitly denied in all he has ſaid in oppoſition to me, viz. that the ſinner is wholly to blame for not embracing the goſpel immediately; and that his want of a heart to do this, and the oppoſition of his heart to it, is by far the greateſt crime he ever was guilty of, for which God is very angry with him, and his wrath abideth upon him, and he is every moment expoſed to ſink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an aggravated deſtruction. As ſoon as they are convinced of this, they will ſee there has been no ſincerity in all their reformations and doings; but all the exerciſes of their hearts have been a direct and
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:011295_0090_0F869F32D6B90058"/>
ſtrong oppoſition to all that God requires of them; eſpecially to the important, merciful declaration, which implies the whole he has to ſay to ſinners "This is my beloved ſon, in whom I am well pleaſed: HEAR YE HIM" They will ſee that they have an amazingly hard and obſtinate heart, for which they have no excuſe; that their neck is an iron ſinew, and their brow braſs; which appears in a more clear and ſtriking light now than ever, in that they perſiſt in oppoſing and rejecting the moſt kind invitations of the goſpel, under all the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their conſciences, and terrifying apprehenſions of the wrath to come. It is needleſs to ſay that ſuch a perſon will reject Mr. M.'s book, at the ſame inſtant that he is delivered from his former deluſions, and is by theſe convictions driven from the fatal reſting place juſt mentioned.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. MR. M.'s book tends to diſcourage and drive to deſpair every ſinner who has any good degree of true, genuine conviction, if it ſhould be believed by ſuch, unleſs it drives away his convictions, and he returns to a degree of ſecurity and eaſe.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved before, that this muſt be the caſe, according to Mr. M.'s own conceſſion: for he allows that <q>ſinners, under deep and genuine convictions, have been ready to look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as greater ſinners than heretofore; yea, perhaps, as growing daily worſe and more hard-hearted.</q> This being the caſe, when ſuch hear Mr. M.'s doctrine, that the deſign of the uſe of means is to render them leſs guilty and vile, and that this is the great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to uſe means, that hereby they may be in the way of duty and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and become leſs ſinful, ſo as to obtain God's favourable notice and approbation, and on this account be more in the way of God's mercy, and, in the diſpoſition and exerciſes of their minds, get nearer to the ſtate of a good man, and ſo be more likely to be ſaved: I ſay, when he hears this doctrine, and ſtill views himſelf in the light in which Mr. M. grants all ſuch are ready to view themſelves (and I add in which ſuch always view themſelves, as it is agreeable to the real truth, and not to ſee it, is to be greatly deluded; ſo not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der genuine convictions) ſo far as he pays any regard to it, it will ſtrike diſcouragement and deſpair through his heart. And the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous goſpel which offers ſalvation to the chief of ſinners, as freely as to the leaſt ſinner in the world, which can be the only relief and remedy to ſuch an one, will be wholly hid from his eyes, until he renounces the chief and leading doctrines of Mr. M.'s book, as groſs and fatal deluſions.</p>
               <p n="5">V. MR. M.'s book is ſuited very much to pleaſe Arminians and Semi-arminians, and to ſupport and ſtrengthen them in their oppoſition to the truths of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>It is certain that all theſe are, with no ſmall degree of zeal on his ſide of the queſtion in this controverſy; and it is eaſy to ſee the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they are ſo. Mr M. has repreſented his awakened, reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner in a light very agreeable to their notion of ſuch. He is a humble ſinner, who, with tenderneſs of conſcience and trembling at
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:011295_0091_0F869F3422DFD370"/>
God's word, reforms all known ſin, and complies with all known duty. He does his utmoſt, and ſeeks the Lord with trembling, and truſts in his mercy, making this his only plea. All this the ſinner comes to on principles of nature, and in this way obtains the divine approbation and favourable notice, and has nothing further to do, but thus to wait on God. And what reaſon has ſuch a perſon for any diſtreſs and terror of conſcience? He is prepared to be comforted, and told that all things are well, and he has nothing to do but to hold on in this way of duty. This is exactly agreeable to their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſets human nature in its fallen ſtate in the light in which they repreſent it. They indeed may think that ſuch are good Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and in the ſure way to heaven, and have nothing to ſay about regeneration, and a new heart by the immediate influences of the ſpirit of God, in order to bring ſuch perſons to the exerciſe of what is called true grace after they have attained to all that has been mentioned. And tho' Mr. M. does not appear fully to agree with them in this, yet they have, many of them at leaſt, ſenſe and diſcerning enough to ſee that herein he is quite inconſiſtent with himſelf, and that if the things he chiefly inſiſts upon, are allowed and eſtabliſhed, the fundamentals of their ſcheme are eſtabliſhed, and the reſt will follow of courſe. They can therefore patiently bear with a number of Mr. M.'s inconſiſtent whims (as they think them) about regeneration, ſaving grace, &amp;c. while they are only mentioned incidentally, and not much inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and theſe things which are important articles in their ſcheme are earneſtly contended for; ſeeing if the latter are eſtabliſhed, the former cannot be maintained, but will of courſe be neglected, if they do not fall into general contempt.</p>
               <p>I would particularly obſerve here, that the doctrine that they who are the leaſt ſinners and have done moſt duty, are on this account moſt likely to be ſaved, which runs thro' Mr. M.'s book, contains the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and ſoul of the Arminian ſcheme, and if followed in all its juſt conſequences, will ſubvert every important doctrine of Calviniſm. For according to this, God in ſhewing mercy to ſinners has reſpect to their moral character, &amp; by diſtinguiſhing themſelves from others, &amp; mending their moral character by becoming leſs ſinful, and doing thoſe things by which they obtain God's approbation, they <hi>recommend</hi> themſelves to his mercy, as more fit and proper objects of it than others whoſe moral character is worſe, and who are greater ſinners in God's ſight.—It is eaſy to ſee this turns every thing in this affair into the Arminian channel. It entirely ſhuts out the doctrine of God's ſovereignty in the exerciſe of his ſaving mercy towards ſinners, having mercy on whom he will have mercy, without reſpect to any thing in their moral character, as being better or worſe. And it founds the determinations of God with reſpect to the ſalvation of one man rather than another, on ſomething foreſeen in his moral character, by which he has done ſomething to diſtinguiſh himſelf from others. It introduces the Arminian notion of juſtification by works; for according to this, their own moral character, and thoſe things by which they are loſs ſinful, do recommend them to God's ſpecial favor, and are the reaſon and ground of their obtaining mercy rather than
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:011295_0091_0F869F3422DFD370"/>
others. But the ſinner is certainly juſtifiable by that which recommends him, and is the ground and reaſon of his finding mercy rather than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, tho' it be but a negative righteouſneſs, and leſs ſinfulneſs. And if this is of ſuch avail with God, how much will poſitive virtue and goodneſs avail to recommend? And it follows from this that man is not in ſuch a loſt, helpleſs, depraved ſtate as Calviniſts have generally repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him to be; but has thoſe good principles, in the exerciſe of which he may do his duty, and diſtinguiſh himſelf, ſo as to become one towards whom God's mercy more readily flows out, than towards another.</p>
               <p>Mr. M. has appeared greatly alarmed at my eſpouſing what he ſays is the Arminian ſenſe of a ſingle text. He might reaſonably be much more alarmed, if he ſhould ſee his own performance in a true light, and find that the moſt that he had ſaid, is in ſupport of that cauſe. If he ſhall not be made ſenſible of this, we may not expect to hear from him much more of the peculiar doctrines of Calviniſm.</p>
               <p n="6">VI MR. M. has by this performance pleaſed and ſtrengthened all thoſe who are fixed upon a ſelf-righteous bottom, who have never ſeen their own true guilt and vileneſs, and are thinking themſelves better than others, eſpecially thoſe whoſe external moral conduct is not ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and good as their own.</p>
               <p>We have reaſon to think there are many ſuch profeſſing Chriſtians. This may be the caſe, whatever ſect or party they belong to; and let the principles they eſpouſe, or profeſſion they make be what they will. They do at bottom think themſelves better than others, on ſome account or other, however inſenſible they may be of it themſelves, and have ways to hide it from their own eyes, or from others. No wonder if ſuch are well pleaſed with Mr M.'s book, and zealouſly eſpouſe his cauſe; for what he has ſaid is agreable to the diſpoſition and feelings of their hearts, and to their experiences. But it is difficult to conceive how the true Chriſtian, or the unregenerate under genuine convictions, can approve of the leading ſentiments in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Indeed Mr. M. has granted that the latter cannot, or is not like to do it; for he is ready to look on himſelf as a greater ſinner than heretofore; and there is no other way for him to think himſelf to grow better, and leſs ſinful, but to loſe his convictions, and relapſe into his former deluſions; ſo no other way to reconcile him to Mr. M.'s book; unleſs it be by his becoming a true convert, and embracing the goſpel. But will this do it? He now has his eyes opened, in a ſenſe and degree in which they were not before under the deepeſt and moſt clear convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in an unregenerate ſtate, to behold the aſtoniſhing worthineſs and glory of Jeſus Chriſt, who has practiſed the moſt amazing condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and goodneſs towards him, and always ſtood at his door and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and freely offered himſelf to him; and he beholds with wonder and aſtoniſhment the wiſdom and glory of the goſpel, and the greatneſs and excellence of the ſalvation which is by Chriſt; all which he has oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, rejected and deſpiſed, under all the ſcene of awakening, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and diſtreſs which he has paſſed through.

And will he in theſe views look back on that horrid ſcene of quarrelling with God, and reſolute, fixed oppoſition of heart to the perſon who now appears ſo glorious in his eyes, and aſtoniſhingly good and kind, in which he reſiſted and ſtrove with all his might againſt the inlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, awaking influences of the ſpirit of God: I ſay, will he now think he was through all this growing leſs ſinful, than he was in a ſtate of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and doing his duty, tho' not from the higheſt principles, yet on the good principles of nature; and that by thus growing better, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained God's favourable notice and approbation, and made approaches to the ſtate and temper of a good man; and ſo got more and more in to the way of mercy, until he arrived to thorough converſion! No ſurely. He will view himſelf in a light directly contrary to this, to a degree not eaſily expreſſed. How then can he approve of Mr. M's book?</p>
               <p>I can eaſily ſee how ſuch an one as our divine Teacher characteriſes in the Phariſee ſhould think the awakened, convinced ſinner is become leſs ſinful than he was before, and that God is more ready and inclined to ſhew mercy to him on this account; and that he will look on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much better than any open profligate whatſoever, and ſwell in his own thought of himſelf, and in his confidence of acceptance with God on this account. But I am quite miſtaken in my notion of a true Chriſtian, if he is ready to look on an impenitent rejecter of Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der genuine convictions as growing better, or on himſelf as on the whole a leſs ſinner than the moſt ſecure, deluded, and openly vicious ſinner that he is acquainted with: Nor is it eaſy to prove that he is in fact ſo: Conſidering his ſuperior light and advantages, and the great and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing obligations he is laid under by God's goodneſs to him; and conſidering the poor returns he makes, the weak and low degree of right exerciſes of heart; and the great and dreadful degree of oppoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions and exerciſes; and the unſpeakable degree of ſinful deficiency in all his right and holy exerciſes, in which he falls ſo vaſtly ſhort of the perfect rule of his duty: I ſay, if we take into view all this, perhaps it will be by no means clear that he is on the whole leſs guilty and vile, than he was in a ſtate of unregeneracy; but be this as it will, it is hard to conceive how he, in the affecting view of the dreadful degree and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing aggravations of his own ſins of omiſſion and commiſſion, ſhould be <hi>ready to think</hi> himſelf a leſs ſinner than others, or than he once was. Therefore he is in no danger of uſing the language which the Phariſee did before God. "God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are,—or even as this publican." At the ſame time I ſee not why all who underſtandingly approve of Mr. M.'s book ſhould not uſe this very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and why this muſt not be the language of their hearts, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever words they uſe.</p>
               <p>If any profeſſing Chriſtian is diſpoſed to look on himſelf a leſs ſinner, leſs guilty and vile in God's ſight, than he was in a ſtate of ſecurity in his youth; and that he has been growing a leſs ſinner ever ſince he was firſt awakened, and looks round on profligate ſinners, as on the whole much more vile than himſelf; and approaches to God with this view of himſelf, as being on this account more in the way of God's mercy,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:011295_0092_0F869F34C29243A0"/>
and a more fit and proper object of it: I ſay, if he views himſelf in this light, and has anſwerable exerciſes of heart, (which is indeed agreeable to the ſpirit of Mr. M.'s whole book) he is, I think, a ſtrange ſort of Chriſtian, even as ſtrange a one as was the phariſee when he went up to the temple to pray.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. M. M.'s book is ſuited to pleaſe all thoſe who think themſelves good Chriſtians, and are excuſing themſelves in their deficiencies, and want of the exerciſes of love to God, and every chriſtian grace, from their utter inability, and want of power to exerciſe and perform theſe things: and tends greatly to ſupport and ſtrengthen them in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wicked way.</p>
               <p>There are many, we have reaſon to think, of this ſort. The doctrine of man's inability to do any thing ſpiritually good and holy of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf they imbibe as a certain and important truth: And as they hold it, is very agreeable to their corrupt hearts; for they at bottom think they are under an inability, or want of power to be holy, which does really excuſe them for not living in the conſtant exerciſe of faith, and love to God. So that the doctrine, as they hold it, is not true, and is as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the corrupt heart of man, as any that was ever invented. Hence it undoubtedly is that many are ſuch zealous defenders of it, and have it ſo much in their mouths, that man can do nothing of himſelf, &amp;c. And when this doctrine is ſet in a true, ſcriptural light, and it is inſiſted upon that man is under no inability to any good exerciſe, but what conſiſts in the perverſeneſs and wickedneſs of his heart, for which he has no manner, no degree of excuſe; that he has full power and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to do every thing that God commands; to embrace the goſpel, and be perfectly holy, were it not for his indiſpoſition of heart and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to do it; and that the whole difficulty lies here, and is juſt the ſame as in any other caſe, where a perſon is backward and unwilling to do what is propoſed to him; only as it may be greater in degree, more perfect and fixed; and therefore that this inability, and inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, voluntary, aggravated wickedneſs, are one and the ſame thing; and the more of this ſort of inability there is, the more vile is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and ſo much more guilty and inexcuſable: I ſay, when they hear this, they are greatly diſpleaſed and alarmed, and cry out of it as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm, or a very bad and dangerous doctrine; becauſe it deprives them of their ſweet reſting place and refuge to which they have been uſed to flee, and get eaſe to their conſciences, and avail themſelves of an excuſe, ſo as not to feel themſelves guilty for that which is indeed their greateſt ſin, and the chief of all their wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Such perſons as theſe, inſtead of confeſſing their ſins, are hiding them from their own eyes, and excuſing themſelves in that for which they ought to be greatly aſhamed and bluſh before God; ſo have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been in any good meaſure convinced of ſin, but are really juſtifying themſelves before God in their greateſt wickedneſs: And they are of a ſpirit and temper as contrary to true Chriſtianity, as can well be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:011295_0093_0F869F3577D434B0"/>
And the doctrine of man's impotency, as they hold it, is really as contrary to the truth, and as agreeable and pleaſing to corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as are any of the Arminian doctrines which aſſert man's ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to all that is required of him; and more ſo in ſome reſpects.</p>
               <p>All ſuch will no doubt, like Mr. M's book, and be agreeably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and ſtrengthened by it. But this is only to confirm them in a wicked courſe, highly diſhonorable to Chriſt and the goſpel; in a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which, if perſiſted in, will prove ruinous to them, whatever great experiences, and remarkable diſcoveries and comforts they may boaſt of.</p>

                  <p>IN which Mr. Mills's ſpeaking againſt METAPHY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SICAL REASONING AND ARGUMENTS, is brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MR. M. has not expreſsly aſſerted that any of my reaſoning in ſupport of what he oppoſes is <hi>metaphyſical;</hi> much leſs has he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to point out any particular inſtances of <hi>metaphyſical reaſoning</hi> in any paſſage of mine, upon which he remarks. However, he often ſpeaks of <hi>metaphyſics, metaphyſical ſubtelties, abſtruſe metaphyſical reaſoning,</hi> &amp;c. with diſapprobation, and in ſuch a manner as will lead the reader to think he has to deal with an antagoniſt, who is very metaphyſical. Now metaphyſical reaſoning is the ſame in his account, with abſtruſe, unintelligible, fallacious and deceitful reaſoning, on which there is no dependance, and ought to be wholly diſregarded and avoided. The moſt remarkable paſſages of his on this head are the following.<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 30, 31.</note> 
                  <q>Here removing <hi>as far as poſſible from</hi> all <hi>abſtruſe metaphyſical reaſoning,</hi> and far fetched conſequences, at leaſt doubtful and uncertain; of which kind experience teacheth that what is called demonſtration in one age, is rejected in another; and what is called ſo by one man is of no validity with another; and oft times with the ſame man at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dates of his life: let us, I ſay, removing as far as poſſible from theſe things, &amp;c.</q> Again,<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 103.</note> 
                  <q>Another ground of this miſtake, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me, is too great a fondneſs for, and dependence upon concluſions come into, as the reſult of ſubtile metaphyſical reaſoning, as tho' they were certain, and might be depended on; while nothing is more common than miſtakes in theſe caſes, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved here, that what he condemns, and profeſſes to keep at the greateſt diſtance from, under the name of <hi>metaphyſical reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> includes all reaſoning that can be uſed by men; for it is common for men to make miſtakes in reaſoning, in whatever way they reaſon:
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:011295_0093_0F869F3577D434B0"/>

Therefore to keep at the greateſt poſſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from all reaſoning of which theſe things may be predicated, is the ſame as to keep at the greateſt poſſible diſtance from all reaſoning whatever.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is worthy to be conſidered perhaps, whether Mr. M. has helped himſelf, or his reader by all this caution; and whether he has not, after all, fallen into ſuch a way of reaſoning, whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be called metaphyſical or not, as is of no validity with himſelf in different dates of his life, and by which he has repeatedly reaſoned himſelf into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions at the ſame time of life. Of this the reader who has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the foregoing ſections will judge. If by <hi>abſtruſe metaphyſical reaſoning</hi> be meant nice diſtinctions where there is no difference, or uſing words without any diſtinct and clear ideas; affirming and denying the ſame thing at different times, and drawing oppoſite conſequences from ſame premiſes; miſtaking and miſrepreſenting the thing about which the queſtion is perhaps Mr. M.'s <hi>Inquiry</hi> is as remarkable an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſuch <hi>metaphyſics</hi> as any this age has produced.</p>
               <p>But if by <hi>metaphyſical reaſoning</hi> and arguments, is meant making cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and clear diſtinctions between thoſe things which really differ, and carefully examining thoſe ſubjects to the bottom which have been treated in a confuſed, intricate manner, or have been thought by many quite abſtruſe and unintelligible, there is no reaſon why any one ſhould try to keep at a diſtance from this, or avoid it in any inſtance; for to do ſo, is only to confuſe and bewilder himſelf, and to take a method to keep himſelf in ignorance with reſpect to the moſt important and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting ſubjects. And it will be evident to any one who will allow himſelf to think, that the holy ſcriptures cannot be in any good meaſure underſtood, and the conſiſtence of one paſſage with another diſcovered, if ſuch reaſoning as this is neglected. And this is, in effect, laying aſide all clear reaſoning on any ſubject, and to make reaſon itſelf a very uſeleſs thing, and to ſubſtitute ſomething elſe in the ſtead of reaſon.</p>
               <p>Many have conceived ſuch an averſion to what they call metaphyſics, and carefully keep at ſuch a diſtance from every thing which to them is abſtruſe, uncertain and difficult to be underſtood, that they are never like to know any thing that requires cloſe attention of thought, and any degree of accurate reaſoning; or make any progreſs in the moſt uſeful knowledge. And, what is worſe, they do what they can to prevent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from entering into a free, critical and painful inquiry after truth, eſpecially thoſe who are in their youth, and are coming upon the ſtage, by gravely cautioning them againſt meddling with metaphyſical ſubjects, and dark, abſtruſe matters; and directing them to attend only to the things that are plain and eaſy, and require no metaphyſical arguments to inveſtigate or ſupport them. Unhappy is the young ſtudent in
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:011295_0094_0F869F364CFCB8E8"/>
divinity who has this advice, and is influenced by it: For by acting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this maxim, and endeavouring to keep at the greateſt poſſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from metaphyſics in this ſenſe, he will have but little more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than what he has by tradition; and this too will chiefly conſiſt in a ſet of orthodox words, without having any intelligible meaning to them. If cloſe and accurate reaſoning falls into diſcredit, and a care to make clear and nice diſtinctions, and the utmoſt pains to enter deep into important ſubjects, and ſearch them to the bottom, are neglected; the mind muſt have very little true knowledge, and can come to no proper ſatisfaction and certainty about any thing, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires reaſoning; and is under a neceſſity of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT has been the way of almoſt all ſects and parties when they have found themſelves unable to ſupport their cauſe by reaſon, and have been oppoſed and preſſed with reaſons and arguments, which they have not been able fairly to anſwer, to cry out againſt ſuch reaſoning, and to endeavour to bring it into diſgrace, by calling it by ſome ill name. Thus the Quakers, and almoſt all enthuſiaſts when urged with moſt clear &amp; demonſtrative reaſons againſt many of their abſurd notions, which they have not been able to anſwer, have endeavoured to ſupport themſelves, by calling <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> reaſon,</hi> and repreſenting it as ſomething directly contrary to the bible, and all true religion.</p>
               <p>And Pelagians and Arminians have been in too many inſtances treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo by their opponents, the profeſſed Calviniſts. The former have gloried in their reaſoning againſt the latter, as unanſwerable demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The latter inſtead of detecting the weakneſs, fallacy and abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the reaſoning of the former, and maintaining their cauſe on this ground, as well they might; have endeavoured to defend themſelves from this weapon by bringing it into diſgrace, and rejecting it under the name of <hi>carnal, unſanctified reaſon,</hi> &amp;c. This has been ſo far from humbling or giving them the leaſt conviction of their errors, that it has had a contrary effect to a very great and, ſenſible degree. And no wonder; for this was the direct tendency of it, as it is an implicit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that they felt themſelves worſted at reaſoning.</p>
               <p>Some of the latter, however, eſpecially of late, have undertaken to <hi>reaſon</hi> with the former; and have defended the principal doctrines of Calviniſm, and have been able to ſhew that they can be ſupported by the ſtricteſt reaſon and argument, and are agreeable to the reaſon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of mankind, as well as to the holy ſcriptures: and have detected the weakneſs and fallacy of much of the reaſoning of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and have made it appear that many of their principal tenets are contrary to all reaſon, and imply the greateſt and moſt palpable abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Upon this the former unable to defend themſelves any longer with their boaſted reaſon, have affected to run down all reaſon and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments uſed againſt them, only by calling them <hi>abſtruſe, metaphyſical</hi> reaſoning and notions.</p>
               <p>And in this ſome profeſſed Calviniſts are joining with them to keep
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:011295_0094_0F869F364CFCB8E8"/>
up the cry of <hi>metaphyſics,</hi> either becauſe they are too indolent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atentive to attend to cloſe and accurate reaſoning; or find ſome of their own tenets in which they are inconſiſtent with themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by arguments which they are by no means able to anſwer. And thus Sandeman and his followers, ſenſible that they cannot ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their ſcheme of religion by reaſon, and confute what is urged againſt them from this quarter, are well on their guard againſt any reaſoning, eſpecially that which they cannot anſwer, and endeavour to keep themſelves in countenance by exploding it under the name of <hi>vain philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>carnal reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is allowed that reaſon maybe abuſed and perverted to bad pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as well as any thing elſe; and men may reaſon very plauſibly, and with the pretence and appearance of great exactneſs and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and clear demonſtration, and yet their arguments be at bottom very weak, ſophiſtical and abſurd. In this caſe, it becomes the friends of truth to detect and ſhew the weakneſs, fallacy and abſurdity of the reaſoning, inſtead of rejecting it all only by calling it <hi>abſtruſe meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical reaſoning,</hi> &amp;c. For the beſt and cleareſt reaſoning may be called by ſuch names, as well as any thing elſe, and often has been. And when any one takes the latter method, he will not be wronged, I conclude, if we determine that he does it purely becauſe he is not able to anſwer the argument, and finds himſelf worſted at reaſoning.</p>
               <p>The cry againſt <hi>metaphyſics</hi> has of late been increaſing; by which thoſe who make it would condemn, and prejudice people againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in divinity which they either do not underſtand, or diſlike, and yet are unable to ſhew it to be contrary to ſcripture or reaſon. Yea, ſome ſpeak againſt teaching and vindicating thoſe truths and doctrines, which they acknowledge to be agreeable to ſcripture, and contained in it, merely becauſe they are, they ſay, metaphyſical niceties, and ſo abſtruſe and difficult to be underſtood, that it is much beſt to ſay nothing about them; and not trouble people with things, which they never can underſtand.</p>
               <p>It may be eaſily accounted for, if this out-cry is made by thoſe who would prevent attention to doctrines which they diſlike, but cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute; or by lazy, ſuperficial thinkers, who are not willing to be at the pains to think cloſely upon any ſubject: and at the ſame time have ſuch an opinion of their own knowledge &amp; penetration, as to conclude that what <hi>they</hi> do not underſtand, no one elſe does, or ever can. But it is difficult to ſay why any others ſhould join with them, and it is a pity that they ſhould be influenced by them.</p>
               <p>Every truth in the bible is dark and abſtruſe to all thoſe who do not underſtand it. And tho' ſome doctrines are more eaſily underſtood than others; yet none can be well and clearly underſtood without thought and attention of mind: And ſome of the moſt important doctrines never will be underſtood by lazy, ſuperficial, inaccurate thinkers. The bible was never deſigned to be underſtood by thoſe who will not be all attention to it, and ſtudy it with that exact and
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:011295_0095_0F869F36F7EDA468"/>
accurate tho't and reaſoning, by which they may diſtinguiſh the things that differ. He only who will thus "cry alter knowledge &amp; lift up his voice for underſtanding; ſeek for her as for ſilver, &amp; ſearch for her as for hid treaſures," ſhall underſtand what are the doctrines of Chriſtianity, &amp; find the knowledge of God. So far therefore as the cry of <hi>metaphyſics</hi> prevails, &amp; people are hereby held back from thinking for themſelves, and are prejudiced againſt every thing which they now do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and againſt all attempts to explain and vindicate any truth contained in the bible, becauſe at firſt thought it is dark and abſtruſe to them, and they do not underſtand it; juſt ſo far the bible is locked up from them, as really as it is from the common people in the church of Rome. And it is perhaps worthy of particular notice, that the objections made by Papiſts againſt the bible's being read by common people, are nearly the ſame with thoſe, which are urged by thoſe who are for excluding all metaphyſical reaſoning from matters of religion, viz. That they will not underſtand it; being very incompetent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of theſe things, they will only puzzle and confute their own minds; or they will reaſon themſelves into error; think differently from one another, and ſo get into hurtful and endleſs diſputes.</p>

            <p>THE reader who has been at the pains carefully to peruſe the whole of the foregoing treatiſe, will find the unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſet in a dreadful and very ſhocking light.

And all means uſed with him: all the light and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he has, &amp; all his awakenings, and convictions of conſcience, ſerve to aggravate and increaſe his guilt and vileneſs; and all his ſtrivings and prayers, are very ſinful and vile, provoking and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable in God's ſight. He is every hour ſinking deeper into guilt, and after his hard and impenitent heart-treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom.

Upon this view of the matter, the queſtion will naturally ariſe. What ſhall he do? If one ſhould be told that he may find this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſked more than once in the bible, and immediately anſwered by inſpired men, ſhould we not expect he would eagerly ſearch to find what the anſwer is, and reſt ſatisfied in it? The anſwer is, "Repent and be baptized.<note n="§" place="bottom">Acts II. 38.</note> Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts XVI. 31.</note> This divinely inſpired anſwer to this important queſtion is plain and eaſy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. This is the awakened, convinced ſinner's next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate duty: and not to do this immediately; but to do ſomething elſe inſtead of it, is to rebel againſt Chriſt, which rebellion is aggravated and criminal in proportion to his degree of light and conviction.</p>
            <p>It is his indiſpenſable duty immediately to take all that blame to himſelf which belongs to him, and to juſtify God, and his law which condemns him, and heartily approve of it; entirely to give up all his old objections which his heart has made againſt God, and his ways, as wholly groundleſs and infinitely criminal; and heartily to renounce all his pleas in his own favor, whereby he has juſtified himſelf, and by which he has been oppoſing God and quarrelling with him; and on which he has really been placing his whole dependance; which, had they been right, would have wholly excuſed him, and caſt all the blame on God, and his law. I ſay it is his immediate duty to give up all theſe objections and pleas, which his whole heart, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely criminal, and to feel and acknowledge that he has done nothing but treaſure up wrath, and that he is moſt juſtly condemned to eternal deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And as there is no hope in the caſe of ſuch a ſinner, but what ariſes from the truth of the goſpel, even the free and ſovereign grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, therein revealed; and as the greateſt ſinner is as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invited as the leaſt to come to Chriſt, and receive pardon and ſalvation without money and without price; it is the ſinner's duty without delay, to drop all his prejudices, and diſaffection to Chriſt and the goſpel, which have heretofore blinded his eyes, and hid the all-convincing evidence of it's truth and glory from his heart; and to admit the evidence of the truth and divinity of the goſpel, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with all his heart that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that God has raiſed him from the dead, with a hearty approbation of his character, and ſubmiſſion to him, and truſt in him as his Lord and Saviour, his prophet, prieſt and king, being heartily devoted to his ſervice, his intereſt and glory.</p>
            <p>All this, I ſay is the ſinner's immediate, indiſpenſable duty, which is to "repent and believe the goſpel." To this he is therefore to be exhorted and urged by all proper motives; and all the inſtruction given him ought to be with a view to this. And unleſs he complies with this, and repents and turns to God, all means and advantages, all light and conviction; all his exerciſes, ſtrivings and exertions, will ſerve to ſink him deeper into deſerved perdition. So long as the ſinner believes this, and has his attention kept up to it, in a view and ſenſe of the dreadfulneſs of damnation, he will be pained at heart,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:011295_0096_0F869F3C67B14528"/>
in a view of his dreadful caſe, and will find no eaſe till his heart gives up every point of controverſy between him and his Maker, and he heartily embraces the goſpel. And to exhort him, and ſet him to do any thing ſhort of this as his duty, in doing which he will become leſs ſinful and abate the divine diſpleaſure againſt him, and be waiting on God, &amp;c. is to divert him from that truth which is of the higheſt importance to him to be attended to; and to give him that eaſe and reſt, which muſt be taken from him, or he will periſh forever.</p>
            <p>If we will look into the bible and carefully examine that, we ſhall find that ſinners are no where exhorted to any thing ſhort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and turning from ſin to God, or to any thing which does not imply this. This is what Moſes and the prophets exhort to; And Chriſt and his apoſtles inculcate this on ſinners as their next and immediate duty, and exhort to nothing ſhort of this. How then can any who have the bible in their hands, be at a loſs how to addreſs ſinners, and not know what exhortations are to be given to them?</p>
            <p>SOME perhaps may think that by dropping all exhortations to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſome doings and duty ſhort of repentance and embracing the goſpel, we condemn all the revivals of religion and ſuppoſed conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that have taken place in former times in New-England, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; as they ſuppoſe theſe have taken place under the preaching which has inculcated unregenerate duties, and this is the only preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which has been ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>ANS. If the matter is well examined into, it will doubtleſs be found that whenever there has been any remarkable revival of religion, which has been attended with ſuch appearances and viſible effects, as to give reaſon to believe it was in any meaſure genuine, it has been under the inſtruction and preaching which has principally inſiſted upon the guilty loſt ſtate of the ſinner, his utter inexcuſableneſs in rejecting Chriſt and the goſpel; the great and aggravated wickedneſs of all his exerciſes and doings while he continues in impenitence and unbelief: the ſufficiency and willingneſs of Chriſt to ſave all that come to him; and the exhortations which have been principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon have been to come to Chriſt, and embrace the goſpel. And under ſuch preaching, and in the view of theſe truths ſinners have been awakened, and hopefully converted. Therefore at ſuch times eſpecially the complaint has been wont to be made, which is made by many now, viz. That ſinners were called upon and moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhorted to repent and believe, but were not told <hi>how</hi> they ſhould do this, by being directed to a ſet of duties ſhort of faith, by which they ſhould obtain it.</p>
            <p>And if at ſuch times there has been a mixture of preaching diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from this, and contrary to it, and there have been exhortations to unregenerate duties; there is not the leaſt evidence that this has had a good tendency; but we have reaſon to conclude that it has done hurt rather than good, ſo far as it had any influence.</p>
