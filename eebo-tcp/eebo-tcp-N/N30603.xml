            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A LATE elaborate Author tells us,
<q>The Deſign of Colonies is to trade on more advantageous Conditions, than could otherwiſe be done with the neighbouring People, with whom all Advantages are reciprocal. It has been eſtabliſhed, that the State which has founded the Colonies, alone ſhall trade in the Colonies; and that from very good Reaſons; becauſe the Deſign of the Settlement was the Extenſion of Commerce, not the Foundation of a City, or a new Empire. Thus it is ſtill a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law of <hi>Europe,</hi> That all Commerce with a foreign Colony, ſhall be regarded as a mere Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly, puniſhable by the Laws of the Country. It is likewiſe acknowledged, that a Commerce eſtabliſhed between the Mother-Countries, does not include a Permiſſion to trade in the Colonies; for thoſe always continue in a State of Prohibition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Diſadvantage of a Colony that loſes the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Commerce, is viſibly compenſated by the Protection of the Mother-Country, who defends it by her Arms, or ſupports it by her Laws. From hence follows a third Law of <hi>Europe,</hi> That when a foreign Commerce with a Colony is prohibited, it is
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040619_0003_1016714608914878"/>
not lawful to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Seas; except in ſuch Caſes as are excepted by Treaty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The great Diſtance of our Colonies, is not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience that affects their Safety; for if their Mother-Country, on which they depend for their Defence, is far diſtant, no leſs diſtant are thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by whom they may be afraid of being conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Beſides, this Diſtance is the Cauſe, that thoſe who are eſtabliſhed, cannot conform to the Manner of living, in a Climate ſo different from their own; they are obliged, therefore, to draw from the Mother-Country, all the Conveniencies of Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> to render the <hi>Sardinians</hi> and <hi>Carſicans</hi> more dependent, forbid their planting, ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or doing any Thing of the like Kind, under Pain of Death.</q>
So far my Author.</p>
            <p>We are told, this Continent was firſt diſcovered to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> by <hi>Sebaſtian Cabot,</hi> a <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer, who lived at <hi>Briſtol.</hi> In the Year 1497 he was ſent by King HENRY the Seventh, to make Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the <hi>Weſt-Indies; Columbus</hi>'s Succeſſes, five Years before, having ſet all the trading Nations in the World, upon Expeditions into <hi>America,</hi> in Hopes of ſharing the Treaſure of the new diſcovered World, with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 25th of <hi>March,</hi> 1584, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Letters Patent from Queen ELIZABETH, to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, plant, and enjoy, for himſelf and ſuch Perſons as he ſhould nominate, themſelves and Succeſſors, all ſuch Lands, Territories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they ſhould diſcover not in the Poſſeſſion of any Chriſtian Prince: And this Company was the firſt of that Kind that was eſtabliſhed in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Settlement was carried on with much Zeal and Unanimity. The Form of Government conſiſted of a Governor and twelve Councellors, incorporated by
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040619_0004_10167147AF4E8CC8"/>
Name of <hi>The Governor and Aſſiſtants of the City of</hi> Raleigh, <hi>in</hi> Virginia: But Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> that great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector and Furtherer of thoſe Diſcoveries and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being under Trouble and Diſgrace at Court, after an infinite Expence, beſides the Hazard and Loſs of many Lives, gave over all Thoughts of proſecuting thoſe Deſigns. And the King, in 1606, did incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate two Companies in one Patent, to make two ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Colonies; the firſt to Sir <hi>Thomas Gates, &amp;c.</hi> Adventurers of the City of <hi>London,</hi> with Liberty to begin their firſt Plantation and Seat, at any Place upon the Coaſt of <hi>Virginia,</hi> between the Degrees of 34 and 41; and for the ſecond Colony, to <hi>Thomas Hanham, &amp;c.</hi> of the Town of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> with Liberty to begin their firſt Plantation or Seat, at any Place upon the Coaſt of <hi>Virginia,</hi> between the Degrees of 38 and 45. But (as the Author of <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Virginia, by a Native of the Place, obſerves) they were no ſooner ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in all this Happineſs and Security, but they fell into Jarrs and Diſſentions among themſelves; which continuing, the <hi>Virginia</hi> Adventurers, were under the Neceſſity of petitioning his Majeſty for a new Patent, with Leave to appoint a Governor. In Conſequence of which, they re-ſettled all their old Plantations that had been deſerted; made Additions to the Number of the Council; and called an Aſſembly of Burgeſſes from all Parts of the Country, which were to be elected by the People, in their ſeveral Plantations. Theſe met the Governor and Council in <hi>May,</hi> 16<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0, and ſat in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation in the ſame Houſe with them: And this was the firſt General Aſſembly that ever was held there. This, however, had but little Effect; for the ſame Author tells us, That
<q>the fatal Conſequences of the Company's Mal-adminiſtration, cried ſo loud, that King CHARLES the Firſt coming to the Crown, had a tender Concern for the poor People that had been
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040619_0005_10167149AA3B0CE8"/>
betrayed thither and loſt; upon which Conſideration he diſſolved the Company in 1626, reducing the Country and Government unto his own immediate Direction, appointing the Governor and Council himſelf, and ordering all Patents and Proceſs to iſſue in his own Name, reſerving only to himſelf, an eaſy Quit-Rent of <hi>Two Shillings</hi> for every Hundred Acres of Land: He likewiſe confirmed the former Methods and Juriſdictions of the ſeveral Courts, as they had been appointed in the Year 1620; and was pleaſed to eſtabliſh the Conſtitution to be by a Governor, Council, and Aſſembly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This, however, was the firſt regular Form inſtituted for the Government of the Colonies, and has been the Plan for every other of his Majeſty's Colonies.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty and his Miniſters having the Proſperity of this Colony at Heart, and with great Reaſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the vaſt Addition it brought into the Revenue; not leſs, it is computed, than <hi>Twenty Million,</hi> ſince its firſt Settlement; all due Attention was given to the Legiſlature, and each kept ſtrictly within its own Sphere of Action: And Matters went ſmoothly on till the Year 1676, when <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Rebellion happened. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has read the Hiſtory of thoſe Tranſactions, will eaſily ſee how far the Aſſembly intereſted themſelves in that Affair, which coſt the Crown and Colony upwards of £. 200,000, and brought the Colony almoſt to an End. The Words of my Author are,
<q>The King, when he was informed of this Rebellion, was ſo far from hearkening to the Pretences of <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that he ordered a Squadron of Men of War to be fitted out, and a Regiment of Soldiers to embark on board it, for <hi>Virginia:</hi> But <hi>Bacon</hi> was dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sir <hi>John Berry</hi> arrived with his Squadron; and his Followers returned every one to their own Homes, with Fear and Trembling. The Governor having
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040619_0006_1016714C82B32D68"/>
made ſome falſe Steps in the Affair, as it is ſuppoſed, the Matter was not ſo ſtrictly enquired into.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have the Fate of this Colony; <hi>Firſt,</hi> in the Diſſolution of the Company, for their Abuſe of the Powers they were entruſted with; and <hi>next,</hi> by being almoſt brought to Deſtruction, by the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the Aſſembly gave <hi>Bacon.</hi> As to their Conduct ſince, it ſhall be taken Notice of hereafter.</p>
            <p>The Northern Colony, or <hi>Plymouth</hi> Adventurers, eſcaped a Diſſolution, by their Friends at Court, but were not leſs guilty of the Abuſe of their Powers; as may appear from the following Letter; upon which I ſhall make no further Comment, than to requeſt the ſerious Peruſal of it, by thoſe our pretended Patriots; — let them conſider in Time, what a perverſe, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and obſtinate Diſobedience to his Majeſty's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Commands, may bring upon us. We have, I doubt, but few Friends at Court, and fewer, I doubt, at the Board of Trade: How, indeed, can we expect it, from our Behaviour, after ſo many gentle Admonitions from both? But to the Letter, which is in very few People's Hands.</p>

            <p>How this Affair ended, I have not been able to learn from any Part of their Hiſtory. Moſt People, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, know what Amendments in their Conſtitution, from Time to Time, have been made, and for what Reaſons: The laſt was thought ſevere; but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate was given them, either to take it upon thoſe Conditions, or they were to have no Charter.</p>
            <p>Numerous Inſtances of the Encroachments and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of Power in our Colony Aſſemblies might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which I ſhall wave; what the Event will be, is hard to determine: The many Complaints, however, that have gone, and daily going Home, upon this Su<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ect, have created Impreſſions with his Majeſty, his Miniſters, and the Parliament, not at all in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Our Neighbour Colony is, at preſent, in the Hands of the Potter; in what Shape they may turn off the Wheel we ſhall ſoon know. My Intention in this, upon the Whole, is no more, than to convince, if poſſible, our Aſſembly that they are in the Wrong, and do make a bad Uſe of their Power; in which if they perſevere, it will infallibly bring our Conſtitution and Privileges into Danger. This, at leaſt, is my Way of thinking. As this is a Subject of no ſmall Importance to me and mine, as well as, I conceive, to us all, I hope a little Warmth (ſhould it ſo happen) will be pardoned.</p>
            <p>Previous to this it may be neceſſary, as few of our Aſſembly-men have had the Advantage of a Liberal Education, or the Opportunity of Books to inform themſelves of the Nature of Government (<hi>eſpecially that of our own,</hi>) to preſent them with a ſhort Sketch of it, which I accidentally met with; and is as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:040619_0010_1016715ABAE7ECF0"/>
               <q>The Deſign of Civil Government is to ſecure the Perſons and Properties, and Peace of Mankind, from the Invaſions and Injuries of their Neighbours: Whereas, if there were no ſuch Thing as Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt Men, the ſtronger would often make Inroads upon the Peace and Poſſeſſions, the Liberties and the Lives of thoſe that were weaker; and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Confuſion and Diſorder, Miſchiefs and Murthers, and ten Thouſand Miſeries would over-ſpread the Face of the Earth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In order to this general Good, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Perſons of Men, with their Peace and Poſſeſſions; Mankind have been led by the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Reaſon and Self-Preſervation, to join them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into diſtinct Civil Societies; wherein, as by a Compact, expreſſed or implied, every ſingle Perſon is concerned in the Welfare and Safety of all the reſt; and all engage their Aſſiſtance to defend any of the Reſt, when their Peace or Poſſeſſions are invaded; ſo that by this Means, every ſingle Member of the Society has the Wiſdom and Strength of the Whole engaged for his Security and Defence: To attain this End moſt happily, different Societies have choſen different Forms of Government, as they thought moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to obtain it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The moſt regular Mixture ſeems to be that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the choſen Repreſentatives of the People have their diſtinct Share of Government. The Nobles, or great Men, have their Share; and a ſingle Perſon, or the King, has his Share in this Authority; and all agreed upon by the whole Community. This is called a mixed Monarchy; and herein theſe three Eſtates of the Kingdom, are ſupported by mutual Aſſiſtance, and mutual Limitations; not only to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the common Peace, the Liberty of the Nation from Enemies, but to guard it alſo from any dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:040619_0011_1016715EA6254A10"/>
Inroads that might be made upon it, by any of theſe three Powers themſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such is the Happineſs of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> under the King, Lords, and Commons.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Here let it be noted, That whoſoever has the Power of making Laws, whether the King, Nobles, or the People, or al theſe together; yet ſtill the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Execution of theſe Laws, muſt be committed to many particular Magiſtrates or Officers; and they are uſually fixed in a Subordination to one another; each of them fulfiling their ſeveral Poſts, throughout the Nation, in order to ſecure the general Peace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In all Forms of Government there is, as before hinted, a Compact or Agreement between the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and the Governed, expreſſed or implied, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Governors ſhall make it their Care and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to protect the People in their Lives, Liberties and Properties, by reſtraining or puniſhing thoſe who injure, attack, or aſſault them; and that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſubmit to be puniſhed, if any of them are found guilty of thoſe Practices; and alſo that they oblige themſelves to pay ſuch Homage, Honours and Taxes; and yield ſuch Aſſiſtance to the Governors, with their natural Powers, and their Money or Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, as may beſt obtain the great Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the common Safety of the whole Society.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For this Purpoſe, therefore, each Perſon, by his Compact, willingly abridges himſelf of ſome Part of his original Liberty or Property, for the common Service of the Society of which he is a Member: And he engages himſelf, with his Powers and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to defend and preſerve the Peace, and Order and Government of the Society, ſo long as he and his Fellow-Subjects are protected by it, in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their natural Rights and Liberties. The
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:040619_0012_101671612976AF60"/>
very Reaſon of Man, and the Nature of Things, ſhew us the Neceſſity of ſuch Agreements</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>From this View of Things it appears, that tho' no particular Form of Government, beſides the antient <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> could claim divine Right, yet all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is from God, as he is the Author of Reaſon and Nature, and the God of Order and Juſtice: And every particular Government which is agreed upon by Men, ſo far as it retains the original Deſign of Government, and faithfully preſerves the Peace and Liberties of Mankind, ought to be ſubmitted to, and ſupported by the Authority of God, our Creator, who, by the Light of Reaſon, hath led Mankind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Civil Government, in order to their mutual Help and Preſervation, and Peace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In this Senſe it is, that the two great Apoſtle, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> vindicate Civil Governors, and demand Subjection to them, from Chriſtians. Rom. xiii.1. <hi>&amp;c. Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God. The Powers that be, are ordained of God: Whoſoever, therefore, reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God; and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation,</hi> (i. e. <hi>are condemn'd;) for Rulers are not a Terror to the good Works, but to the evil.</hi> 1 Pet. ii.13. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit yourſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake; whether it be to the King, as ſupreme, or to Governors, as to them who are ſent by him, for the Puniſhment of evil Doers, and the Praiſe of them that do well.</hi> What St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, is, <hi>ordained of God, i. e.</hi> in general; as Civil Government, or Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it <hi>the Ordinance of Man, i. e.</hi> in particular; as to the ſeveral Forms of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which Men agree upon or appoint: And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, God has left to Men to agree upon and appoint the particular Forms: And ſo far as any of them
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:040619_0013_10167163172D6920"/>
purſue and attain this End, they muſt be ſubmitted to, and ſupported as an Ordinance both of God and Man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What Connection there is between this System, and the Conſtitution of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> let thoſe acquainted with it, judge: — A Conſtitution envied and admired by every State and Power on Earth; and which No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has been able to injure, or ever will be able to injure, but thoſe inteſtine Encroachments and Diviſions amongſt themſelves; and while the Ballance of that Power, lodged with the three Branches, is kept in a due Poiſe, will laſt as long as Time laſts. Of this glorious Syſtem we are but a very faint Reſemblance; if any at all, it is the moſt diſagreeable Part of it, that, <hi>viz.</hi> of encroaching upon the two upper Branches of the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature; in this we have ſhewn a good Deal of Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But more of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>We are no more than a little Corporation, in the ſame Manner as a Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council are impowered, by his Majeſty's Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to form Rules and Orders for the Government of a City, in its ſeveral Wards and Diſtricts; even ſo; tho' in ſomewhat a higher Degree, and more extenſive Sphere; but all to the ſame Purpoſe is a Governor, Council and Aſſembly, to govern a Colony, in its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Counties and Precincts, by the ſame Power: Every Law or Rule made, that is not peculiarly adapted to their reſpective Communities, has no Meaning; and every Law made, that in any Shape claſhes or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres with the Laws of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> are, <hi>ipſo Facto,</hi> void. By this I underſtand, that the Liberties and Properties of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects abroad, eſtabliſhed and cemented by the Treaſure and Blood of our Anceſtors, Time out of Mind, is not left to the Caprice and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of a Colony Aſſembly.—<hi>O Fortunati!</hi> I would not, therefore, adviſe our worthy Aſſembly, or their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:040619_0014_101671686712F5D0"/>
Leaders, to profane thoſe ſacred Terms, either to frighten or miſlead the Ignorant. Our Liberties and Properties are out of their Reach; they have Nothing to do with them: Every Subject within the King's Dominions, the meaneſt as well as the greateſt, have a Right to the common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and the Great Charter, eſtabliſhed and confirmed, as Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coke</hi> tells us, by two and thirty Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is only declaratory of the fundamental Grounds of the common Law, and no more than a Confirmation or Reſtitution of the Privileges which were previouſly claimed and due thereby; and all this we were intitled to, before Aſſemblies had a Being, and which our Poſterity will enjoy when they are no more. I would, therefore, adviſe thoſe Gentlemen, for the Future, to drop thoſe parliamentary Airs and Stile, about Liberty and Property, and keep within their Sphere, and make the beſt Uſe they can of his Majeſty's Inſtructions and Commiſſion, becauſe it would be High-Treaſon to ſit and act without it. This is our Charter; and we may, if we pleaſe, be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy in the Privileges we enjoy from it; that alone, of having it in our Power to tax ourſelves, is invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; of this, I doubt, we ſhall never be truly ſenſible, till, by ſome Miſ-conduct of our own, we come to loſe it. If we abuſe, or make a wicked Uſe of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Favours, we are, of them, but Tenants at Will; we only hold them during Pleaſure, and good Behaviour. In moſt Corporations, where there appears an Abuſe of Power or Neglect of Duty, a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſet Things to rights; in our Caſe it is not wanted, tho', (as that great Lawyer Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale,</hi> has remarked, in Relation to the Iſland <hi>Jerſey</hi>) we are Parcel of the Dominions of the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; we are no Part, nor ever were, of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> but a Peculiar of the Crown; and by a natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:040619_0015_1016716CA9739668"/>
Conſequence, exempted from parliamentary Aids. Thus you ſee our Dependence and the Reaſon of it, is altogether upon his Majeſty's Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. If we don't approve of our preſent Syſtem of Government, let us pray for a better: In the mean Time, let us not contemptuouſly treat thoſe Favours the Crown has been pleaſed already to confer upon us. That this is the Caſe, is but too obvious.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution, or Frame of Government the Crown has been pleaſed to favour us with, is by a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Council of his own Appointment; and to which, by his Directions, are added the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the People; of which his Majeſty's Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Inſtructions are the Baſis. This is an Emblem, or faint Repreſentation of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſtitution; and will, with equal Propriety, anſwer all the good Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes intended, if we have but Sagacity enough to make a proper Uſe of it. Here are three Branches in the Legiſlature, whoſe Powers are ſufficiently diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pointed out to them; and while the Ballance is duly kept up, that is, while each of the Branches keep candidly and ſtrictly within its own Sphere of Action, without encroaching, infringing, or maliciouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, for any particular Ends, to vilify or leſſen the Powers of any other of the Branches, we may conclude ourſelves in a happy Way; on the Contrary, if we ſee any one of the Branches, aſſuming to itſelf any Part of that Power, originally lodged, and intended by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to be lodged with the other Branches, and ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling vehemently, out of all Meaſure and Character, for more Power than ever was intended it, you may conclude, that every Step taken for that Purpoſe, is a Nail in our Coffin, and tends to an Alteration, if not a Diſſolution of the Conſtitution. That each, in their Turns, have attempted this, is beyond Diſpute. Thoſe Attempts from a Governor, can only be by Fits and
<pb n="17"
                   facs="unknown:040619_0016_1016716F2A914B08"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
Starts, out of Pique or Prejudice to Particulars; they cannot long ſubſiſt: He may be guilty of ſome few Acts of Oppreſſion; but conſidering he has not only the other two Branches of the Legiſlature to check him, but even his own Commiſſion and Inſtructions, nay, even the whole Body of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and one particularly adapted to the Purpoſe, which makes him accountable in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> for any Miſ-conduct here. There Mr. <hi>Lowther</hi> was called to an Account for Acts of Oppreſſion, and was like to have payed ſeverely for it, had he not ſcreened himſelf by the Act of Grace. He was allowed, upon a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Complaint, to come home to defend himſelf; at the Concluſion thereof, he was committed by the Council-Board, till he entred into a Recognizance with Sureties <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> £ 20,000; and was alſo ordered to be proſecuted by the Attorney-General. From hence I would infer, that no Governor, from any Acts of his <hi>qua</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, can indanger our Conſtitution. From a Council we have not much to apprehend, even if they were to join any one of the other Branches, provided the third keeps it's Ground. The Council are in the Nature of Moderators between the Extreams, without whoſe Concurrence they have no Power to act: Should they, however, neglect their Duty, or abuſe the Powers they are intruſted with, they are accountable to his Majeſty, and a Suſpenſion ſoon puts an End to their Being.</p>
            <p>From an Aſſembly, if we value our Conſtitution, we have every Thing to dread; they have the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> on their Side, which greatly preponderates in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and will be doing (I wiſh I could ſay fairly) what every other monied Perſon does; that is, turn it to their own particular Advantage; and in this Kind of Traffick our Aſſemblies have, of late Years, ſhown great Dexterity, even ſo far as greatly to leſſen that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:040619_0017_10167171368EDBA0"/>
Dignity and Power, ſo eſſential to Government, lodged with their Superiors, the Governor, and Council; and to add to our Misfortune, there is no Remedy, at preſent, in Being, to cure this Miſchief, but either a great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, or a total Diſſolution of the Conſtitution; diſſolving an Aſſembly is none, but the moſt effectual Method to continue the Miſchief: This we may learn, in ſome Meaſure, from an Advertiſement of their own, or from ſome of their Friends, of the 17th of <hi>February,</hi> in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> in theſe Words,
<q>Notwithſtanding the utmoſt Efforts of the Court Party had been exerted, yet our two late Members carried the Elections by a very great Majority; and thus, I am perſuaded, it will be, ſhould we have an Election every Month in the Year, for we are determined not to be worried out; and we know our Intereſt too well, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived either by Paper of Parchment.</q>
I cannot conceive what this Advertiſement refers to, unleſs it be to the King's Commiſſion, which, if I miſtake not, is on Parchment, as the Inſtructions are on Paper.</p>
            <p>Thus it is evident, a Diſſolution is no Cure for the Abuſe of Power in an Aſſembly: And this brings to my Mind an Obſervation of a noted Author, on this Point, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That when the Ballance of Power is duly fixed in a State, Nothing is more dangerous or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than to give Way to the firſt Steps of popular Encroachments; which is uſually done, either in Hopes of procuring Eaſe and Quiet from ſome vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious Clamour, or elſe made Merchandize, and merely bought and ſold. This is the breaking into a Conſtitution to ſerve a preſent Expedient, or ſupply a preſent Exigency; the Remedy of an Empirick, to ſtifle the preſent Pain, but with certain Proſpect of ſudden and terrible Returns. When a Child grows eaſy and content by being humour'd; and when a Lover becomes ſatisfied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſmall Compliances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:040619_0018_10167176A1928738"/>
further Purſuits; then expect to find popular Aſſemblies content with ſmall Conceſſions. If there could one ſingle Example be brought, from the whole Compaſs of Hiſtory, of any one popular Aſſembly, who, after beginning to contend for Power, ever ſat down quietly with a certain Share; or if one Inſtance could be produced, of a popular Aſſembly, that ever knew, or propoſed, or declared what Share of Power was their Due; then might there be ſome Hopes, that it were a Matter to be adjuſted by Reaſonings, by Conferences, or Debates: But ſince all this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly otherwiſe, I ſee no Courſe to be taken, in a ſettled State, but a ſteady, conſtant Reſolution, in thoſe to whom the Reſt of the Ballance of Power is intruſted, never to give Way ſo far, to popular Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as to make the leaſt Breach in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through which a Million of Abuſes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, will certainly, in Time, force their Way.</q>

               <q>Moſt of the Revolutions of Government, in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> began from the Abuſe of Power in thoſe ſelected for the Preſervation of the People; which generally ended in the Tyranny of a ſingle Perſon. This ſhews the People are their own Dupes.</q>

We have, from the Infancy of Times here, been nurſed up and indulged, at an infinite Expence to the Crown, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:040619_0020_1016717AC6F595F0"/>
People of <hi>England:</hi> Even at this Day, they are at the Expence of £. 10,000 Sterling, yearly; and have been at no leſs, for any Thing I know, every Year ever ſince we had a Being, for our Preſervation. We are exempted from all parliamentary Aids; we have never added any Thing to the Revenue of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as ſome of our Neighbour Colonies have done, of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Sums: Our Plan of Government is from that of <hi>Old-England</hi>; the moſt complete Syſtem known; to which, if any Additions can poſſibly be made, we have it in our Power to make them: We have it in our Power to tax ourſelves, as Conveniency ſutes; which bears no Proportion to thoſe Taxes paid by a like Number of our Fellow-Subjects, in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> Can mortal Men expect, then, to be happier? or any reaſonable Man or ſet of Men, wiſh for, or endeavour at a Change?</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee what grateful Returns we have made, on our Parts, for thoſe Favours.</p>
            <p>A general Retroſpection into the Proceedings of our Aſſembly, is a Taſk I have neither Inclination nor Leiſure to undertake; and ſhall, therefore, leave it to thoſe who may hereafter have the Curioſity to collect the Debates of that Houſe, for the Benefit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; and ſhall only content myſelf with giving a ſhort Specimen of their Conduct for — Years paſt.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſion and Inſtructions directed to his Excellency the Governor, but intended for the Good of the Whole; which, by the Bye, I cannot help thinking, that if they were in every Body's Hands. as a Family-Piece or Houſe Bible, and not cooped up like the <hi>Sibylline Oracles,</hi> to which Recourſe was only had upon extraordinary Emergency, it might be of mighty Uſe; the People would become acquainted and in Love with their Conſtitution! they would there ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through the Whole, the benevolent Intentions of our
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:040619_0021_1016644890DCBDF0"/>
most gracious Sovereign the King, and our Mother-Country: Whereas, at preſent, they are repreſented, by ſome of our Dealers in Po<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ticks, as big with that Monſter, <hi>Prerogative,</hi> a Thing which ſome of our weak Members are taught to dread as much as ever Children were that of <hi>Raw-Head and Bloody-Bones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus by wicked Inſtruments, for wicked Purpoſes, are weak Minds impoſed upon; for whoſe Sake I ſhall endeavour to explain the Word, which, I doubt, is but ill underſtood, even by thoſe the Perverters of it: If I am miſtaken, I ſhall readily ſtand corrected.</p>
            <p>There is, in every Family, a Sort of Government without any fixed Rules; and indeed it is impoſſible, even in a little Family, to form Rules for every Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; and therefore it is better conceived than expreſſed; but perfectly underſtood by every Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual belonging to the Family. The Study of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Maſter, is for the Good of the Whole; all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals are to him; he has a Power, from the Reaſon and Nature of Things, to check the Inſolent, or Indolent, and to encourage the Induſtrious: In ſhort, the whole Affairs of the Family are immediately under the Care or Direction of the Father or Maſter; and this is a natural Prerogative, known and acknowledged by every Man living, who has ever had a Family, or been any Ways concerned in a Family, in all Ages and in all Places. His Majeſty, as he is our political Father, his political Prerogative, from the like Circumſtances and Reaſons, is equally neceſſary. And this political Authority has been allowed the ſupreme Director, in all States, in all Ages, and in all Places; and without it, there would be a Failure of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>In the Commiſſion and Inſtructions, as I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, there are ſome Powers in the Crown, which it cannot diveſt itſelf of, that, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Militia, Guards, and Garriſons; and tho' his Majeſty has given
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:040619_0022_1016717FB7536808"/>
particular Directions for the Regulation of the Militia here, (a Part ſo eſſential to every State and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) yet our late worthy Aſſembly thought fit to drop it altogether; for which, as they have given us no Reaſons, they muſt give us Leave to gueſs; and I think there can be but two, that, <hi>viz.</hi> of leſſening the Power of the Captain General; or that the Road to thoſe Commiſſions, is not generally through the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly-Houſe.</p>
            <p>It is plain the Intention of the Crown, in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, was to bring it up, as near as poſſible, to that of the original Plan. All Monies raiſed by Parliament, are iſſued by Warrant from the Lords of the Treaſury. His Majeſty has been pleaſed to direct, that all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies raiſed in the Colonies, ſhall be iſſued by Warrant under the Hand of the Governor in Council. What due Regard has been paid to this Inſtruction, is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and the Reaſon plain; becauſe, otherwiſe, the Aſſembly would, in a great Meaſure, loſe thoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications for Gratification of Services done, or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done, by their Friends and Dependents; of which they take upon themſelves to be the ſole Judges, in Derogation of the Power lodged with the other Branches of the Legiſlature, and Violation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Commands.</p>
            <p>This will appear in a clearer Light, from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of our late Aſſembly, and the Council's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to his Excellency, upon that Point; to which I beg Leave to refer. But, as I have met with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs in the Proceedings of a neighbouring Colony, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Subject, done with great Spirit and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, I ſhall make no other Apology for inſerting ſo much of it, as relates to the Subject; and is as follows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of the Aſſembly are ſenſible, that what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to, under this Head, was wholly new, and not to be met with in any former Exciſe Act; ſo they could not be ignorant of his moſt ſacred Majeſty's Inſtruction in this Reſpect; his Excellency having cauſed the ſame to be laid before them, previous to their paſſing the Act; and conſequently they might well believe, that no Member of the Council could conſent to the paſſing this Bill, with ſuch Clauſes in it, without juſtly forfeiting, at the ſame Time, his Place at this Board.</q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>All which the Council would have left out of the Bill; and an unanſwerable Argument, why they muſt neceſſarily inſiſt upon their being left out, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Council think proper to inſert, immediately after thoſe Words in the Bill, the King's thirty-fourth Inſtruction to the Governor; by which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it will, at firſt View, appear what a direct Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition there is in one to the other. The Inſtruction is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are not to ſuffer any publick Money whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to be iſsued, or diſpoſed of, otherwiſe than by Warrant under your Hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by and with Advice and Conſent of our ſaid Council: But the Aſſembly may, nevertheleſs, be permitted, from Time to Time, to view and examine the Accounts of Money, or Value of Money, diſpoſed of by Virtue of Laws made by them, (which you are to ſignify unto them) as there ſhall be Occaſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Theſe Words in the Inſtructions, the Council think too plain and full to be miſunderſtood; and that they are not capable of any other Meaning than that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, in which they have been, and are taken by the Members of this Board; who cannot, therefore, ſuffer themſelves to be taught otherwiſe. Thus we find the Royal Inſtructions ſay, <hi>No publick Money what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſhall be ſuffered to be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>

than by Warrant under the Governor's Hand, by and with the Advice and Conſent of the Council.</hi> But the General Aſſembly of his Majeſty's Iſland, on the contrary, ſay, That no Warrant or Order for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhall be obtained, till the Accounts of the Perſons ſeeking ſuch Order, have been firſt said before them, to be by them inſpected, regulated, and approved of: And if the Governor and Council ſhould preſume to iſſue any ſuch Order, in Purſuance of his Majeſty's Inſtructions, the Gentlemen do ſtrictly enjoin and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Treaſurer not to pay or allow of any Order, to be granted or obtained; nay, if the Treaſurer ſhould, by Inadvertency or otherwiſe, pay any ſuch Order, the Gentlemen of the Aſſembly have ſtill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remedy behind; and do, therefore, ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join and require, the Committee of publick Accounts, not to allow the ſame to the Credit of the Treaſurer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Royal Inſtructions make it neceſſary, for all thoſe who are intitled to any publick Money, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for it to the Governor and Council; but the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of this Province will have it, that Application ſhall be firſt made to them for it. The King's Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſay, That the Governor and Council, and they only, ſhall be Judges of what Warrants are proper to be iſſued for any of the publick Money: But di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his Majeſty's Subjects, who are of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly here, inſiſt, that they will be the Judges; and that no Order for publick Money ſhall iſſue, till their Judgment has been obtained for it. The Royal Inſtructions permit the Aſſembly only to view and examine the Accounts of Money, after it has been diſpoſed of; but theſe Gentlemen contend for a View, Inſpection, Regulation, and Approbation of them, before; and that too, with the ſtrongeſt Words of Defiance, — <hi>any Law, Uſage, or Cuſtom to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary notwithſtanding.</hi>

               <q>Such Contrarieties as theſe, betwixt the Royal Pleaſure, ſignified in the Inſtructions, and that of the General Aſſembly, may well be thought enough, without any more, to determine the Opinion of this Board; and no better Reaſon, certainly, can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Members of his Majeſty's Council, for their refuſing their Aſſent to any Bill, than that the paſſing of it would be contrary to the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. But as the Members of the Council are aſſured, that the Gentlemen of the Aſſembly are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a great and dangerous Miſtake; and that they are now aiming at what can have no other Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency (tho' we do not charge them with any ſuch Intention) than to ſubvert the Conſtitution of the Iſland, as ſettled by his Majeſty's Commiſſion and Inſtructions, and to render the Council altogether unuſeful in the Government; they cannot paſs over this Head without obſerving, that this Attempt of the Aſſembly, is not only a bold Innovation here, but is alſo very contrary to the Uſage of Parliaments in <hi>England</hi>; where, tho' it is admitted, that bills of Aids and Subſidies do generally begin with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and they uſually lay the Rates and Duties on Merchandize, yet they have Nothing to do with the Application of the Money, as far as we may preſume to judge by their Practice. If they are afterwards appriſed of any Miſapplications or Abuſes, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is, to addreſs the King, (as the Aſſembly may do here) that the ſeveral Officers concerned in the ſame, do lay the Accounts before the Houſe, that they may examine into them, and be therefore enabled to take ſuitable Meaſures for bringing the Offenders to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Puniſhment, or for preventing the like Abuſes for the Future; but that is all. And will the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of this Iſland, aſſume Powers not attempted, nor even claimed by a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Houſe of Commons? For
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:040619_0027_1016718DD80955E8"/>
Gentlemen to ſet up for Judges of what does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, and to aſſume to themſelves the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Privileges of the Council Board, we cannot think at all becoming; but, on the other Hand, are ſatisfied it muſt lead to Confuſion, and in the End, if a timely Stop be not put to it, produce the worſt of Conſequences.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Members of the Council would be glad to know what there is in the Nature of thoſe Accounts, that they may not be ſuppoſed capable of judging of them, as well as the Aſſembly? or why this Board may not be preſumed to have as tender a Regard for the Intereſt of the Iſland, and to the due Diſpoſition of its publick Money, as the Aſſembly? They think they may reaſonably aſk, how it comes to paſs, that the Gentlemen of the preſent Aſſembly ſhould be deemed the only Perſons fit to be truſted with the publick Affairs? or what Security the Country will have, that the ſame would be ſafer in their Hands, than where the King has been pleaſed to place them?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentlemen go on to obſerve upon the Agent Bill.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The ninth Amendment is to the following Cláuſe of the Bill, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>For the Payment of ſuch Sum or Sums of Money, as from Time to Time, upon the Addreſs of the General Aſſembly of this Iſland, ſhall, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Governor, or Commander in Chief for the Time being, by and with the Advice and Conſent of the Members of his Majeſty's Council, be made pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch Perſon or Perſons, as the preſent General Aſſembly of this Iſland, ſhall or may appoint to be their Agent or Agents, to regulate the publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this Iſland, in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                  </q>
Which Clauſe diſcovering the ſame Spirit of Encroachment with the laſt, the Council found it neceſſary to alter, and inſtead thereof, to inſert what follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>For the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:040619_0028_10167192511D0AE0"/>
of the Salary of ſuch Agent or Agents of this Iſland, in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as ſhall or may, at any Time hereafter, be appointed, and given by any Law for that Purpoſe.</q>
And this, they apprehended, would anſwer all the good Purpoſes of the other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being liable to any of the Objections. By theſe Words, if the Legiſlature, at any Time during the Continuance of the Act, judge it proper to have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents for the publick Service, here is sufficient Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made to pay them out of the publick Money: But the Council could not, nor can on any Account, conſent to the Clauſe, as it ſtands in the Bill; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Money is not to be paid but upon the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the Aſſembly: <hi>Secondly,</hi> For that the Words are too general and indefinite; <hi>for the Payment of ſuch Sum or Sums of Money, as ſhall, from Time to Time,</hi> &amp;c. whereby the Aſſembly might have it in their Power to give away immenſe Sums for that Purpoſe, or under that Pretence: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe the Money is made payable to ſuch Perſon or Perſons, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent General Aſſembly ſhall or may appoint to be their Agents. And here the Members of his Majeſty's Council cannot forbear expreſſing their Amazement, that the Gentlemen of the Aſſembly ſhould take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves to appoint Agents of their own, as they call them, when, at the ſame Time, they ſay, it is <hi>to negotiate, tranſact, and carry on the publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this Iſland, in</hi> Great-Britain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What! are all thoſe publick Affairs to be carried on by their Agents, without any Concern of the Governor and Council?

What is this but to aſſume, in Effect, an arbitrary and independent Power, and ſo far to render the

            <p>The Event of this Affair was, that the Bill, or a Draught of the Bill, with the Council's Reaſons for their Amendments, were ſent Home; and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſoon received an Order, grounded on a Report of the Honourable the Committee of his Majeſty's Privy-Council, for rejecting the Draught of the Bill, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the conſtant Uſage of that Iſland, and of all other his Majeſty's Colonies, and derogatory to the Royal Prerogative; which being expreſsly ſaid to be adviſed by their Lordſhips, with Intent to diſcourage Attempts of the like Kind for the Future.</p>
            <p>While theſe Matters were in Agitation at <hi>Barbados,</hi> the ſame Diſputes were carried on in <hi>New-England,</hi> but, if poſſible, with ſtill more Obſtinacy, tho' with ſomewhat more Colour of Reaſon, becauſe of their Charter, which they pretended was infringed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions: They, therefore, were not ſatisfied with the Royal Determination, but thought fit to apply to the Parliament; as appears from the printed Votes of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Houſe of Commons.</p>

            <p>To this I have only to add, by Way of <hi>Query</hi>; — Should an Aſſembly, choſe by the People as Truſtees and Guardians of their Conſtitution and Privileges, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo clear a Declaration of his Majeſty's Sentiments, continue to inſult his Majeſty's Government, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly rejecting every Order and Inſtruction that does not ſute their Taſte or Humour? And are they not accountable to the People, for the Conſequences of their Conduct? Surely no One can think otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall go on to ſhew, in a few more Particulars, the Intention of the Crown, in forming us upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plan.</p>
            <p>The Bill for the Payment of the Debts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, has been ſufficiently animadverted upon, by the Addreſs of the Council here, as well as what may be collected from that other of <hi>Barbados.</hi> The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication Act, as it is called, comes next to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: It is, indeed, an Original; and from the very Face of it, appears to be calculated in direct Oppoſition to his Majeſty's Inſtructions, and the very Form and Nature of our Conſtitution: Every Officer of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is there named by the Aſſembly, with his Allowance tacked to the End of it; which being a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:040619_0031_1016719A5260E520"/>
Money Bill, is, with them, ſacred and not to be touched with profane Hands; and with this Proviſo too, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That if any of them die or are removed, ſo much of the aforeſaid Allowances to be paid, as ſhall be at that Time due; and no more.</q>
If an Officer, then, dies or is removed, the Governor, it is true, may put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Place; but he can have no Salary or Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, till the Aſſembly pleaſe; and that Allowance is juſt as they pleaſe to like the Perſon. It is not a new Thing with ſome of our Aſſemblies, to add or ſubſtract a Figure in the Salary of of the Officers, according to the Nature of the Application; and even to drop an uſeful Office, upon Occaſion, if they diſapprove of the Officer; witneſs the Weigh-Maſter General's Office. This, I think, is an Encroachment with a Witneſs, as it creates a Dependence of all the Officers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, upon an Aſſembly; which, of Courſe, quite inverts the very Order and Nature of Government.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to defray the neceſſary Services of the Government, Eſtimates are laid before the Houſe of Commons, of which they, if they pleaſe, may judge of the Neceſſity, as well as of the <hi>Quantum</hi>; the Funds, however, are raiſed; but the Application is left to his Majeſty. If there are any Miſapplications, it is with the Commons to enquire; and Nothing is more dreaded, than a parliamentary Scrutiny.</p>
            <p>The Diſpoſition of Officers, is an inherent Right of the Crown; and is, indeed, a Part of that Power lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Branch of the Legiſlature, in order to keep up the Ballance; and without it, it would loſe of its Weight. It is his Majeſty's Intentions, that we ſhould follow the ſame Method; but, thoſe Intentions our Aſſemblies have treated according to their uſual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance.</p>
            <p>The proper Appointments of the Civil Liſt, for his Majeſty's Support, is for Life; which, from long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:040619_0032_1016719BE4B67000"/>
is found moſt conducive to the Benefit of the Community.</p>
            <p>It is his Majeſty's Royal Will and Pleaſure, that there be paid to his Governor and Captain General, £. 1200 Sterling, yearly, out of his Revenue ariſing in his ſaid Province; and it is his expreſs Will and Pleaſure, that all Laws made for the Supply and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Government, be indefinite, and without Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as to Point of Time: As the Commiſſion is, the Meaning I think is plain, that it ſhould laſt, at leaſt, as long as the Commiſſion; and in this Senſe, moſt of thoſe Colonies immediately under his Majeſty's Direction, have taken it; and accordingly, as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, obſerve it, and enjoy Peace and the Favour of the Crown, while <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> are, at preſent, famous all over his Majeſty's Dominions, for worrying one another, and Contempt of Royal Orders and Inſtructions: But inſtead of this, our Aſſembly tell him he may take £. 1200, if he pleaſes, but it ſhall be at 40 <hi>per C.</hi> Diſcount; and even that, but from Year to Year; it is this or Nothing; there is no Alternate. This, however, is paying no great Compliment to his Majeſty's expreſs Royal Will and Pleaſure, and but poor Returns of Gratitude for <hi>Ten Thouſand Pounds</hi> Sterling, laid out upon us yearly, by his Majeſty. That of a yearly Support is but of a late Standing; it was not ſo from the Beginning. From this Period, however, we may date the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all our Confuſions. Five Years was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Method; and I believe I may challenge the moſt ſanguine Party-Man, to point out any dreadful Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that attended it. This, I ſay, was the Method, this ought to be the Method, and this will be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, however terrible, at preſent, it may appear; and if we do not follow it, it will be done to our Hands; or we ſhall have no Peace in o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r <hi>Israel,</hi> and the King no Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:040619_0033_1016719D782922E0"/>Can any Thing be more abſurd, than to imagine a Governor, ſent abroad to govern a People, and to be ſupported according to the Dignity of his Office, and under certain Reſtrictions and Inſtructions, eſſential to that Government; but to obtain that Support, every Inſtruction muſt be given up, one after another, or have no Support? which is juſt throwing the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor into their Hands: This has been the Practice for many Years, and his Majeſty and his Miniſters know it too; what the Event will be, Time only can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Some Remedy muſt be found, or the People will at laſt govern.</p>
            <p>A Governor is no ſooner appointed, than the firſt Queſtion is, Into whoſe Hands ſhall I throw myſelf? the Anſwer is ready, Into whoſe but ſuch as can beſt manage the Aſſembly. Hence Prime Miniſters and Courtiers are eſtabliſhed; and, of Courſe, Anti-cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers: Hence Parties are formed; and thus the Peace of the Publick is deſtroyed, honeſt Neighbours ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Ears, and all Good-fellowſhip excluded the Society; Elections are carried on with great Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, and at a vaſt Expence, as if our Alls were at Stake: And what is all this for? Is the publick Good really the Point in View? or is it to ſhew how dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly the one Side can manage the Aſſembly for him, and the other againſt him? Let us be told what mighty Advantage the Publick has reaped from that repeated Round of Squabbles we have been peſtred with, with no other View than to diſtreſs a worthy Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Thus, I think, the Reaſonableneſs, and even the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſupporting a Governor, according to his Majeſty's Royal Will and Pleaſure, that is independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of any Body but himſelf, is evident, as it will deſtroy all thoſe Sources of Contention.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Virginia,</hi> the <hi>Two Shillings</hi> Sterling, upon every Hogſhead of Tobacco exported, makes the Support
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:040619_0034_101671A2D214C0F0"/>
eaſy to the People, who are at this Time, and like to continue in all Duty and Obedience. It is the ſame in the <hi>Leeward-Iſlands,</hi> from the <hi>Four</hi> and an <hi>Half per C.</hi> and we hear of no <hi>Fraca's</hi> amongſt them.</p>
            <p>A gentle Tax upon Lands here, would anſwer all theſe Purpoſes, relieve the Merchant, and encourage Trade, at this Time in a languiſhing Condition.</p>
            <p>If a Man of Worth and Honour falls to our Share, (which indeed, as Matters ſtand at preſent, we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect) he will, if ſupported according to his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, naturally incline to do us all the good Offices in his Power, if we ourſelves don't take Pains to prevent him; and he, the Council, and General Aſſembly, will have that Time, hitherto ſpent in trifling Squab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to think of ſecuring us from abroad, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Trade and Induſtry at home.</p>
            <p>The Manner of our ſupporting our Judges, is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ridiculous and abſurd. It is agreed on all Hands, that thoſe Offices ought to be held for Life, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both of Crown and People, and under no Bias; but our Aſſembly are determined to keep them too, under their Thumbs; and tell them, we will allow ſo much for this Year, but if you do not behave as we think you ſhould do, we will give you leſs next Year, and perhaps Nothing at all. This would have little Weight with a Man of Fortune and Integrity, in that Office; but might prove too powerful a Temptation to ſuch as have Nothing elſe to depend upon. As the Commiſſions, therefore, for good Reaſons, are for Life; ſo ought, for the ſame Reaſons, the Salaries to be.</p>
            <p>I have been informed, that in <hi>New-England,</hi> there was a long Debate in the Houſe, whether the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Salary ſhould be paid at the Beginning or at the End of the Year, that they might be the better able to judge of his Good-Behaviour; and, if I am not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, it was carried for the latter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:040619_0035_101671A62BD7E080"/>The <hi>Jerſey</hi> Aſſembly, not many Months ago, waited upon the Governor with the Revenue Bill, inſiſting, that the Council had Nothing to do with it; and had he paſſed it in that Manner, can any Body doubt, but that their next Vote would have been to exclude both Governor and Council. Thoſe are great Strides in our Aſſemblies towards —</p>
            <p>But to go on with our Act.</p>
            <p>Whoever will be at the Pains to compute the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the Salaries, and compare it with thoſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances made to Aſſemblies, and their immediate Dependents, will readily ſee how far the one comes ſhort of the other.</p>
            <p>There are Twenty-ſeven Aſſembly-men, to whom the Law allows to ſome <hi>Ten,</hi> to ſome <hi>Six,</hi> and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Four Shillings</hi> a Day; take the Medium at 7 <hi>ſ.</hi> and this amounts to £. 9:9:0, every Day from their ſetting out, to their Return to their Homes; and this is a Tax immediately out of the Farmers Pockets; all others are upon the Merchant (a Point that may be diſcuſſed at another Time;) beſides £. 300 to a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, yearly, tho' his Majeſty has appointed one for that Purpoſe, and £. 200, yearly, to an Agent of their own. The Incidents on both Sides may be left out in the Computation. We ſhall be told, perhaps, that ſome of theſe Gentlemen, don't take up their Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but ſure They won't openly declare this, becauſe, in my humble Opinion, it is down-right Bribery, as I cannot conceive the Difference between ſaying, I will <hi>give</hi> you ſeven Shillings a Day, if you chuſe me; or, I will <hi>forgive</hi> you ſeven Shillings a Day, if you chuſe me. —So much for this extraordinary Act.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, out of a tender Regard for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lives and Properties of his Subjects here, has given Directions, that proper Proviſion be made for Indian Affairs; but our worthy Aſſembly, that
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:040619_0036_101671A7E72F5B58"/>
their Conduct may appear of a Piece, have made none; I ſhall not enquire into the Reaſons; they ought, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to be very good Ones, to ſatisfy the People; becauſe, in Caſe of a Rupture with <hi>France,</hi> it muſt have very fatal Conſequences; and it is not impoſſible, (conſidering how indefatigable the <hi>French</hi> are in this Matter) but that <hi>Freſh-Water</hi> may become our Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier: I can ſee Nothing to hinder them, without our Indians, from driving the whole Country in before them. How far the Authors of this Neglect may be anſwerable for thoſe Conſequences, at the great Day of Accounts, I am not Caſuiſt enough to determine; and ſhall, therefore, leave it to their own Conſciences.</p>
            <p>I have but one Thing more to obſerve upon, in this Act, and that is, That neither Governor nor Council can command one Shilling of the publick Money, if that Shilling would ſave the Province, while the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker has it in his Power, by Order of the Houſe, to diſpoſe of it as he pleaſes, without being accountable to any but themſelves.—<hi>See the laſt Clauſe but one, in the Act.</hi>—How conſiſtent this is with the Nature of our Conſtitution, or, indeed, any other Conſtitution, I ſhall leave to thoſe more judicious to determine.</p>
            <p>As I have but little Hopes of any Remedy for thoſe Evils, on this Side of the <hi>Atlantick,</hi> I would have it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted, by a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, That whereas great Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities and Confuſions have ariſen from the preſent Methods taken for the Support of Government, and Officers of the Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Be it Enacted,</hi> That all Lands hitherto granted, or that ſhall be granted by his Majeſty, ſhall pay at the Rate of <hi>One Shilling</hi> for every Hundred Acres, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath, in Lieu of all other Rents or Reſervations whatſoever; applicable only towards the Support of Government and the Officers of the Crown; to be iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by Warrant, according to Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:040619_0037_101671A98FDDCC50"/>As to what may be objected in Relation to the giving up the Quit-Rents; they are but a Trifle to the Crown, and will ever be a Canker in the Eſtate of the Subject. From 1664 to 1710, they are but of very little Importance. The Counties of <hi>New-York, Weſt-Cheſter, Dutcheſs,</hi> and <hi>Albany,</hi> that is, all the Eaſt Side of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, extending along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver about 170 Miles, does not, by an accurate Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, pay above £. 90 Sterling, to be collected from ſeveral Thouſand Hands. The Reſt of the Counties are much upon the ſame Footing; and I may, I think, venture to affirm, that, had it not been for the vacating two Grants; one, <hi>viz.</hi> to Mr. <hi>Evans,</hi> and the other to <hi>Dell<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>Bayard</hi>; the Quit-Rents would not have defrayed the Expence of collecting them; nor would the Province have been half ſo well ſettled.</p>
            <p>Governors, during that Period, were under no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions. Grants of Lands, and Reſervations, were in Proportion to the Gratifications to a Governor. The greateſt Part of the Grants, during that Time, are to pay ſuch Quit-Rents, as hereafter ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Laws of this Country; which is juſt ſaying, you ſhall pay when you pleaſe. There are, however, ſome Pepper-Corns, ſome Wampum, Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and Beaver-Skins aſcertained.</p>
            <p>Since 1710, 2 <hi>ſ</hi> 6 is reſerved upon every Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Acres; but as Grants are not eaſily come at by a poor Man, the Rich have generally engroſſed them, not with a View of ſettling the Lands, but of parcelling of them out to the beſt Bidders. Thoſe Grants, and, of Courſe, the Reſervations, by theſe Means became ſo divided and ſubdivided, that at laſt, it will become impracticable, if not impoſſible, either for the Officer to collect, or the Poſſeſſor to pay, tho' never ſo willing, with any Certainty or Regularity. In many of the old Grants, the Shares of the Poſſeſſors
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:040619_0038_101671ADDF351AF0"/>
does not amount to the tenth Part of a Penny; and they muſt go perhaps a great Way to pay that, or be proſecuted; or if any one of them ſhould even be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to pay the Whole, they have no Remedy againſt thoſe concerned. A poor Man in the <hi>Moba<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ok</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, poſſeſſed, perhaps, of fifty Acres, muſt go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of two Hundred Miles every Year, to pay fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pence, or be proſecuted; the Event of which may be fatal to ſuch a Perſon. This will, in Time, create great Uncertainty and Confuſion in that Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In Lieu, therefore, of which, I humbly conceive, that <hi>One Shilling</hi> upon every Hundred Acres, would relieve the Subjects, amply ſupport Government, the Officers of the Crown would become independent of Aſſemblies, Trade would be relieved, and thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant landed Gentlemen, would be obliged to pay their Proportion of that Expence.</p>
            <p>From good Hands I underſtand, that a Perſon poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of two Hundred Acres, pays more to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, than ſome of thoſe poſſeſſed of their Hundred Thouſands.</p>
            <p>In order to put our Indian Affairs upon a proper Footing, I would have all Monies, raiſed upon the Retailers of Liquors, (being a Sort of a voluntary Tax through the whole Continent be made a perpetual and unalienable Fund for that Purpoſe. If this Affair, of ſo much Importance to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt, be left much longer to the Caprice of Aſſemblies, we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gueſs what will be the Conſequence. And that all Duties upon Indian Goods ceaſe, and the Trade left open to all his Majeſty's Subjects, except thoſe that take the Road to <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I conceize, that Trade carried on between <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>Canada,</hi> is attended with very pernicious Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt, I cannot help thinking, with Submiſſion, but that an effectual Stop might be
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:040619_0039_101671B08812CD90"/>
put to it by the following Method. By the 12th of <hi>Ch.</hi> II. no Alien, or Perſon not born within the King's Allegiance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall exerciſe the Trade or Occupation of a Merchant or Factor in any of his Majeſty's Plantations, upon Forfeiture of all his Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let an Officer, therefore, be poſted at <hi>Albany,</hi> who is to publiſh the above Clauſe; giving Notice, that in three Months, all Goods, Wares, or Merchandize ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or imported, from or to <hi>Albany,</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> or their Factors, the Natives, not under his Majeſty's Allegiance, will be ſeized; the Proof to be put upon the Owner.</p>
            <p>There are two Objections to this; <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the <hi>French</hi> are not ſupplied from us, they will fall upon other Means of ſupplying themſelves, which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the Conſumption of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures: But the Abſurdity of this Objection has already been ſufficiently expoſed, (<hi>See the Papers relating to an</hi> Act <hi>of the Aſſembly of the Province of</hi> New-York, for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Indian Trade, <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> for prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the ſelling of Indian Goods to the <hi>French,</hi> viz. <hi>of</hi> Canada; <hi>and Mr.</hi> Colden<hi>'s</hi> Hiſtory of the <hi>Five Nations</hi>) I ſhall take no further Notice of it.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond Objection, that this will be acting contrary to that Freedom of Commerce with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, mutually ſtipulated by the Articles of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht</hi>; to this I have only to ſay, that the <hi>French</hi> underſtand not that Treaty in ſuch Light; as appears by their diſcharging our Traders from trading, upon any Pretence whatever, within their Territories, under ſevere Penalties; witneſs the Treatment thoſe three <hi>Philadelphia</hi> Traders met with lately, for trading at <hi>Ohio,</hi> only pretended to be within their Territories; whereas neither <hi>Engliſh</hi> nor Indians, admit it to be ſo; and the <hi>Ohio</hi> Indians will ſuffer all the Extremities of War rather than admit it to be ſo.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:040619_0040_101671B2F9B18800"/>By this Time, I preſume, I am reckoned a mighty Governor's Man, (an invidious Diſtinction) and no Friend to Aſſembly-men. As to the firſt, I own it, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I find the Laws are ſevere (where Laws govern) againſt ſuch as induſtriouſly endeavour to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Jealouſies between the ſupreme Magiſtrate and the People: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe no Piques or Prejudices ought to eff<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce Good-Manners, due to every Superior, eſpecially a Supreme Magiſtrate: And <hi>laſtly,</hi> Becauſe in the whole Courſe of my Obſervations, I never knew any one Individual get any Thing by it, but a little Vanity and a great Deal of Vexation.</p>
            <p>As to Aſſembly-men, there are thoſe whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. One whoſe only Aim is at the Honour, Safety, and Intereſt of his Country; and who on this Mark conſtantly keeps his Eye fixed; who dreads not the Frowns of an enraged Governor, or the horrid Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of a poſſeſſed Multitude; who ſmiles to ſee ſo many (in all Appearance) honeſt and thinking Men, jog on like a Gang of Pack-Horſes; who truly enjoys all that Freedom in his Actions, which he thinks his Duty to procure for, and defend his Country-men in; One, in ſhort, who is directed, influenced, or biaſſed by none; and while he is in his Country's Service, thinks the moſt glorious Epithets the World can fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, are thoſe of a rigid, inflexible, ill-natur'd, honeſt Man.—And ſuch a one who would not revere?</p>
            <p>But, as a certain Gentleman obſerves:
<q>I think, <hi>ſays he,</hi> there is hardly to be found through all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a greater Difference between a repreſenting Commoner in the Function of his publick Calling, and the ſame Perſon, when he acts in the common Offices of Life; here he allows himſelf to be on a Level with the Reſt of Mortals; here he follows his own Reaſon and his own Way; in ſhort, here his Folly and his Wiſdom, his Reaſon, and his Paſſions, are
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:040619_0041_101671B4C15F5D38"/>
all of his own Growth, not the Echo of other Men: But when he is got near the Walls of his Aſſembly, he aſſumes and affects an intire Set of very different Airs; he conceives himſelf a Being of a ſuperior Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to thoſe without, and acting in a Sphere where the vulgar Methods for the Conduct of Life, can be of no Uſe: He's liſted in a Party where he neither knows the Temper nor Deſigns, nor perhaps the Leader; but whoſe Opinions he follows and maintains with a Zeal and Faith, as violent as a young <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieldian</hi> does thoſe of a Methodiſt, whoſe Sect he is taught to profeſs: He has neither Opinions, nor Thoughts, nor Actions, nor Talk, that he can call his own; but all conveyed to him by his Leader, as Wind is through an Organ: The Nouriſhment he receives, has not only been chewed, but digeſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes into his Mouth: Thus inſtructed, he follows the Party, right or wrong, thro' all its Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and acquires a Courage and Stiffneſs of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, not at all congenial with him.</q>
Such a One, if any ſuch there be, I moſt heartily deſpiſe.</p>
            <p>The Raging of the Sea and Madneſs of the People, are put together in Holy-Writ; and the Wrath of a King, to that of the Raging of a Lyon: But his Favours are as the Dew upon the Graſs, which that we may endeavour, every one in his particular Station, to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and deſerve, are my ſincere Wiſhes.</p>
