            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE <hi>Words</hi> begin a Triumphant <hi>Pſalm</hi> of <hi>David</hi>'s, the <hi>Subject</hi> whereof is the Majeſty and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Mercies of God, diſplay'd in the Salvations of his Church, paſt and to come. The <hi>Triumphs</hi> of the GOD of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are here Celebrated, in a <hi>Style</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>Lofty</hi> like the <hi>Place</hi> wherein He dwells, and <hi>Great</hi> as the <hi>Works</hi> they praiſe. There is a Mixture of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Propheſie,</hi> a <hi>Review</hi> of the Glorious things which God had wro't for his Church from the days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and a Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the greater Salvation by the MESSIAH to come; His Victorious and Triumphant <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention,</hi> and leading <hi>Captivity Captive. v.</hi> 18.</p>

The <hi>Occaſion</hi> of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſeems very obvious, tho' particular-Paſſages in it are Intricate and Perplex'd; ſo that One of the <hi>Criticks</hi> ſaid of it, <q>that there are almoſt as many Shelfs and Labyrinths in it, as there are Verſes and Words, and that it merits to be called the Tryal of the Wits of Interpreters, and their diſgrace:</q> Yet (I ſay) the Occaſion of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſeems very plain, and that it was Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for and uſed at that Illuſtrious <hi>Solemnity</hi> in <hi>David's</hi> Reign, the Tranſlation of the <hi>Ark of the Covenant</hi> from the <hi>Houſe of Obed-Edom</hi> unto <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> for the words of the <hi>Text,</hi> which are the <hi>Exordium</hi> of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> are the very ſame that <hi>Moſes</hi> always uſed at the <hi>Removal</hi> of the <hi>Ark:</hi> Numb. 10.35. <hi>And it came to paſs when the Ark ſet forward, that Moſes ſaid, Riſe up,</hi> LORD, <hi>and let thine Enemies be ſcattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then was the <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> being the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Lords <hi>Prophet,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Ruler</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Ancient as the <hi>firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> of His Church, and the days of their <hi>Travels</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> where the Lord <hi>Led his People like a Flock, by the hand of Moſes and Aaron.</hi> As ſoon as the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was <hi>reared up,</hi> and the <hi>Ark of the Teſtimony</hi> was in its place, <hi>&amp;c, Then a Cloud covered the Tent of the Congregation, and the Glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle. The Cloud of the Lord was upon it by day, and Fire was on it by night, in the ſight of all the Houſe of Iſrael,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001294_0005_0FB27C0707CC6238"/>thro'out all their Journeys. And when the Cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle, the Children of Iſrael went onward in all their Journeys: But if the Cloud were not taken up, then they Journyed not, till the day that it was taken up.</hi> No doubt it was a very joyful ſight to that People when the <hi>Cloud</hi> roſe up, God therein appearing to 'em to be making good his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and leading them to <hi>Canaan:</hi> And the <hi>Phraſe</hi> agree to their very <hi>ſight, Riſe up Lord!</hi> for there was a viſible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to their <hi>Senſes</hi> of his doing ſo, as the <hi>Cloud was taken up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very probable, that this <hi>Form of Prayer</hi> at the <hi>taking up</hi> of the <hi>Ark,</hi> was by Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to be <hi>for ever uſed</hi> on this Occaſion and Solemnity, as often as the <hi>Levites</hi> ſhou'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be called in all future Generations to Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in <hi>Bearing the Ark:</hi> At leaſt 'tis paſt doubt that <hi>Moſes</hi> at firſt ſpake theſe words by <hi>Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and Inſpir'd <hi>David</hi> retaining them as the moſt Apt and Ancient, and the beſt that could be on the great Occaſion.</p>
            <p>This Famous <hi>Prayer</hi> conſiſts of <hi>two Petitions,</hi> one giving the Reaſon of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let God ariſe.</hi> It is ſpoken after the manner of men, as when we implore ſpeedy Succour of another, we ſuppoſe his <hi>Riſing</hi> and haſt'ning to our Relief. 'Tis a <hi>Phraſe</hi> uſual in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Significant of Gods affording timely and preſent Help unto His People who truſt in him; and equally of his taking ſpeedy Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001294_0007_0FB27C0ACFFE9AC0"/>great to ſuffer it, and he had a more juſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a right Truſt in God, then to build meerly on the outward ſign of Gods Preſence and Power.</p>
            <p>The <hi>other Senſe</hi> is in words expreſſed: <hi>Let God ariſe, and let his Enemies be ſcattered, let them alſo that hate him flee before him.</hi> This is the Expreſs <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the Petition, that the Enemies of God might be put to Confuſion and Flight, be bro't to Ruine and Deſtruction upon his <hi>Ariſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve here, <hi>That the Enemies and Haters of God are One;</hi> and ſo likewiſe are the Enemies of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> One: thoſe that hate his <hi>Church</hi> hate <hi>him,</hi> and 'tis a moſt Conſolatory Coſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Great GOD holds 'em to do ſo.</p>
            <p>Yet note, that they are conſidered here as <hi>Gods Enemies,</hi> and not <hi>Ours</hi> perſonally: The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of his Name and Glory, his Truth and Cauſe, his Church and Kingdom, and that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placably; <hi>As ſuch,</hi> Vengeance is here impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on them, and againſt ſuch we may &amp; ought to pray: 'Tis <hi>beſt</hi> to carry 'em to God, &amp; leave 'em to his Judgments written againſt 'em.</p>
            <p>And you cannot but remark the high <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> &amp; flaming <hi>Zeal,</hi> which this Prayer breathes: Such a Zeal for Gods Honour, and ſuch Love to his Intereſt and People, as God who is here invok'd is wont Himſelf to expreſs. And what a <hi>Noble Truſt</hi> and Dependance on God alone is here expreſſ'd! <hi>Let God ariſe!</hi> they look to Him, they build on his Appearing for them, and not
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001294_0008_0FB27C0D25A544A0"/>on any <hi>Arm of Fleſh. Finally,</hi> The words ſpeak a moſt glorious <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Confidence; Let God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, let his Enemies be ſcattered, i. e.</hi> Let God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and they <hi>will</hi> be ſo, they <hi>ſhall</hi> be ſo, there needs nothing more to diſcomfit 'em: and ſo indeed the <hi>Hebrew</hi> runs, in the <hi>Future Tenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have as <hi>briefly</hi> as I cou'd <hi>fully,</hi> ſet this Copious Prayer in its true Light: You eaſily ſee how fruitful it is of Noble &amp; Divine <hi>Truths,</hi> and how many rich <hi>Obſervations</hi> I might offer from it; I ſhall ſelect <hi>One</hi> only, the plain <hi>ſcope</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> and what I deſigned in the Choice of it: Namely,</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>That the People of God ought by Earneſt &amp; Fervent Prayer to be ſeeking to Him for the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and Deſtruction of His and His Churches Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PRAYER is our <hi>Duty,</hi> and our rich <hi>Priviledge</hi> in all Caſes and Circumſtances whatſoever. We <hi>owe</hi> this to God, and His Honour calls for it; we <hi>need</hi> it our ſelves, and 'tis an unſpeakable Favour, Mercy and Advantage to us. The Command is, Eph. 6.18. <hi>Pray always with all Prayer, &amp; Supplication in the Spirit, watching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with all perſeverance:</hi> Phil. 4.6. <hi>In every thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

(Who <hi>is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,</hi> Eph. 3.20.)

            <p>
               <hi>Prayer</hi> is the leaſt <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> that can be of God, his Providence, his Written Word, and all Spiritual Bleſſings in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and the leaſt <hi>Teſtimony</hi> we can give of a Religious Reverence &amp; Veneration toward Him; of Gratitude, Love, Truſt and Submiſſion to Him; and ſurely there can be no more meet and proper, or Nobler Uſe of <hi>Speech,</hi> which Faculty is given us for this End, to utter aloud the devout Motions &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of our Minds, in way of Homage to the Great GOD, and for His Honour &amp; Glory.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Fervency</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. 8.26, Col. 4.12. St. Luk. 22.44. 1 Theſ. 3.10.</note> muſt accompany all our Prayers, if we expect they ſhou'd be acceptable and Prevalent. St. <hi>James</hi> puts theſe two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001294_0010_0FB27C10C411FE00"/>Jam. 5.16. <hi>The Effectual Fervent Prayer of a Righteous Man availeth much:</hi> And the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſayes, <hi>With my whole heart have I fought thee,</hi>—<hi>I entreated thy Favour with my whole heart,</hi> Pſ. 119. 10.18. This is but decent and neceſſary, becauſe the <hi>Object</hi> to whom we addreſs in Prayer is the Moſt <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi> GOD, whoſe Name is <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Fearful,</hi> and before whom the <hi>Serephims cover their Faces!</hi> Tis an awful thing to have to do with the Supream <hi>Majeſty</hi> of Heaven and Earth! we ſhou'd not dare to trifle with Him! Moreover, The <hi>things we ask</hi> in Prayer are of the laſt <hi>Weight and Importance,</hi> and if we have a preſſing ſenſe of our <hi>Needs,</hi> and a real <hi>Deſire</hi> of the Bleſſings we requeſt, we cannot but be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſervent in Spirit. In a word, Prayer is a Sacred Exerciſe of great ſeriouſneſs and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and nothing can be more Indecent &amp; Criminal than a light and common, a cold and indifferent frame of Spirit in it; But the Mind ought to be Intent, Deſire Strong, the Affections vigorouſly moving, Grace in its lively Exerciſe, and then (like <hi>Iſrael</hi>) we <hi>Wreſtle</hi> with God and <hi>as a Prince</hi> we do <hi>prevail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I cou'd not but hint of <hi>Prayer in General,</hi> and now have the ſame thing to obſerve and make good of that particular <hi>Branch</hi> of Prayer, the <hi>Imprecation</hi> of Judgment upon the Enemies of God. I ſhall therefore ſhow, that this is <hi>one Part of Prayer,</hi> and that we ought to be <hi>Earneſt and Fervent</hi> in theſe Addreſſes to God.</p>

I. <hi>Imprecation of Judgment on the wicked Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God and his Church is one part of Prayers;</hi> &amp;c we ought to make it <hi>one Article</hi> in our Petitions, that God wou'd blaſt their Deſigns &amp; Attempts againſt his Truths, and Wayes, and Intereſt, confound their wicked Counſels, Scatter 'em in their evil Enterprizes, bring down their Power and Pride, and execute the Judgments written againſt them. We have many <hi>Examples</hi> of this part of Prayer in the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſal. 5.10, 7, 6.9.59, 13.69.24. &amp;c. 79.10, 11, 125.5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </note> eſpecially in the <hi>Book of Pſalms:</hi> I will mention two only, Pſal. 94.1, 2. <hi>O Lord God, to whom Vengeance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, ſhew thy ſelf! Lift up thy ſelf thou Judge of the Earth, render a Reward to the Proud! Lord, how long ſhall the wicked, how long ſhall the wicked triumph?</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 83.1, 2. <hi>Keep not thou ſilence O God: hold not thy peace and be not ſtill, O God. For lo, thine Enemies make a tumult, &amp; they that hate thee have lift up the head.</hi>— v. 13, 15, &amp;c. <hi>O my God, make them like a Wheel: as the ſtubble before the Wind.—So perſecute 'em with thy Tempeſt, and make 'em afraid with thy Storm.— Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let 'em be put to ſhame, and periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can it be ſaid, that theſe Prayers do not <hi>agree to the Spirit of Chriſtianity.</hi> They did agree to the Unequal'd Meekneſs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; to the exalted Devotion of <hi>David:</hi> Nay they do agree
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001294_0012_0FB27C151DF9F340"/>with the Goodneſs of that Frame, which we are ſure the <hi>Bleſſed Spirits</hi> in Heaven are always in; for ſo <hi>the Souls of them that</hi> are <hi>Slain for the Word of God,</hi> are repreſented to be <hi>crying with a loud Voice,</hi> Rev. 6.10. <hi>How long, O Lord, Holy &amp; True, doſt thou not judge and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth!</hi> And thus the <hi>Divine</hi> heard the <hi>Angel of the Waters ſay,</hi> Rev. 16.5, 6. <hi>Thou art Righteous, O Lord, which art, and waſt, and ſhalt be, becauſe thou haſt judged thus: For they have ſhed the Blood of Saints and Prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</hi> Now if both Prayers and Praiſes are utter'd on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in Heaven above, are they not decent and becoming, and agreeable to pure Religion, in the Church here below?</p>
            <p>But you will expect that I do both <hi>ſtate and limit</hi> this point, and then offer ſomething in <hi>Proof</hi> of it. Take then a few <hi>Rules</hi> about pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt others, even the moſt wicked Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, and then a few <hi>Reaſons</hi> to prove it to be lawful, decent and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Rules,</hi> which we ought to govern our ſelves by in this Caſe, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt be ſure that we do <hi>ſimply conſider 'em as Gods Enemies and not our Own,</hi> and that there be no private Grudge on perſonal accounts. For this wou'd ſpoil our Prayers, and be an Asking God to gratify our private <hi>Spleens,</hi> which he abominates in us. Therefore we muſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly confider thoſe, whom we pray againſt,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001294_0013_0FB27C174CFC3FD0"/>as the Publick Enemies of Gods Truth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt therefore <hi>be ſure that we can prove 'em to be ſo,</hi> before we venture to pray againſt 'em. This will put reſtraint upon a <hi>haſty Zeal,</hi> which is apt to miſtake, and to judge them whom Chriſt receives. 'Twill alſo manifeſt a due ſenſe of our Ignorance and <hi>Fallibility;</hi> and prevent many a bitter Reflection, full of ſhame and ſorrow, the certain fruit and puniſhment of Vain-Confidence and Criminal Raſhneſs. I wiſh that all <hi>Parties among Proteſtants</hi> wou'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly lay this <hi>Rule</hi> to heart, leſt in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Honeſty of their Hearts they run into the <hi>Diſciple</hi>'s Error, Luk. 9.49. <hi>Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out Devils in thy Name; and we forbad him, becauſe he followeth not us. And Jeſus ſaid, Forbid him not: for he that is not againſt us, is for us.</hi> You muſt obſerve, that <hi>Moſes</hi> in the firſt Uſe of our <hi>Text,</hi> pray'd againſt thoſe Enemies and <hi>Nations,</hi> whom he know God had devoted to deſtruction, and whom <hi>Iſrael</hi> were going to root out, and take poſſeſſion of their Land: And a like Warrant we have to pray againſt the <hi>Romiſh Antichriſt,</hi> the Daughter of Babylon that is to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. However ſure we are that a <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> do deſerve the Judgments and Rebukes of Heaven, as Publick Enemies of the true Wayes of God, yet if there has been any thing of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal.</hi> Oppoſition, Conteſts, Affronts Wrongs
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001294_0014_0FB27C1DC5D26AE0"/>either given or received, <hi>Be ſparing, ſuſpicious, and lay Reſtraint upon thy ſelf:</hi> Dare not to truſt thy own heart, where 'tis ſo eaſily partial and byaſſed, leſt Regards to <hi>ſelf</hi> are blended with thoſe to Heaven, and Heaven be diſhonour'd and offended. And if men are apt to juſtifie and guide themſelves by the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> Example in this Caſe <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>As</hi> Pſalm 7.35.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>4.55.59.69.70.109, &amp;c.</note>, we muſt know that as we have not his <hi>Grace,</hi> ſo much leſs have we his Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Guidance and <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> to ſafe-guard and warrant us. Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> therefore tells us, <q>That <hi>David</hi> and the other <hi>Prophets</hi> are no Examples for us to follow in this matter, for they knew by a Prophetick Spirit Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions concerning the Perſons whom they prayed againſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We muſt be ſure <hi>that it be not from a Spirit of Cruelty,</hi> nor from any <hi>want of Charity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,</hi> nor from a <hi>delight in the Griefs and Ruine</hi> of any of our Fellow-Creatures, that we Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Judgments on them. When we are <hi>forc'd</hi> into it, it ſhou'd be only from a ſenſe of Duty to God, and what we owe unto His Honour, Cauſe and Members: It muſt not be from Ill-will to men: it ſhou'd be from a grieved Spirit, that the Wickedneſs of men neceſſitates it, that men will bring down the Wrath of Heaven on their own Heads, and will not live in Holineſs,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001294_0015_0FB27C240CBD6DC8"/>and in Peace, and be happy. And then we do <hi>Imprecate</hi> in a Gracious Spirit, like that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Good God does <hi>Inflict</hi> Judgment, <hi>Who does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of men.</hi> So the <hi>Prophet</hi> cou'd denounce the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt <hi>Moab</hi> in the Spirit of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction for her, Iſa. 16.11. <hi>My Bowels ſhall ſound like an Harp for Moab, and mine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts for Kir-hareſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. When we pray againſt the Enemies of God, <hi>ſome</hi> have tho't it ſhou'd rather be for "their <hi>Reſtraint</hi> than for their <hi>Hurt,</hi> but to be ſure it ſhou'd be for their <hi>Conviction and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, rather than Deſtruction.</hi> We ſhou'd pray for their Repentance, and Recovery from the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of their Wayes, and from their bloody Counſels: that God wou'd Enlighten their Minds and turn their Hearts: that the <hi>Light</hi> from Heaven might <hi>Strike them to the Ground,</hi> and the <hi>Scales fall off</hi> from their <hi>Eyes:</hi> that if it pleaſe God he wou'd yet uſe 'em, as he did Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting <hi>Saul,</hi> to be eminently Serviceable to the Truths which they deſtroy: And <hi>finally,</hi> that God wou'd even <hi>judge</hi> 'em with this merciful Intention, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> pray'd of old, Pſal. 83.16. <hi>Fill their Faces with ſhame, that they may ſeek thy Name, O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Vengeance muſt <hi>not</hi> be <hi>Abſolutely</hi> impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on any, <hi>but on ſuppoſition of their Implacable Malignity</hi> againſt God, which God only knows; or where he has <hi>Revealed</hi> it to be ſo, and has
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001294_0016_0FB27C250AF3D540"/>expreſsly <hi>devoted unto deſtruction:</hi> As we know that the <hi>Great Whore</hi> and <hi>Mother of Abominations</hi> is; As to which Accurſed Intereſt in general therefore, Charity and Pity are ſhut out for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In all ſuch Prayers againſt the Enemies of God and His Church, <hi>we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a perfect Submiſſion</hi> to the Will and Good Pleaſure of God; leaving it to Him to judge in <hi>his own Time Way and Manner,</hi> not daring to <hi>preſcribe</hi> our Tho'ts to Him, nor pretend to be <hi>privy</hi> to His; <hi>When, Where</hi> or <hi>How</hi> His Decrees ſhall take place, be bro't about or effected. All this we muſt for Ever ſubmit to God in <hi>Adoring Manner,</hi> with humble and contented Minds: 'Tis eno' for us aſſuredly to Believe that <hi>His Day</hi> is coming, that the <hi>Viſion</hi> is for an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time and will not tarry, and to have Hearts to pray with Earneſtneſs and Joy, <hi>Even ſo Come, Lord Jeſus! Come quickly!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such <hi>Rules</hi> as theſe we ought to go by in praying againſt the Enemies of God and of His Church. I paſs,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To name ſome <hi>Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which do prove it <hi>Lawful and Decent, Neceſſary and a Duty</hi> to pray againſt 'em.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a proper and fitting Expreſſion of Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin and Errer. Theſe</hi> are found among the Enemies &amp; Haters of God; the Habitations of <hi>Ignorance and Cruelty</hi> are there. Here are <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> cheriſh'd, maintain'd and defended:
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001294_0017_0FB27C272E5D2FB8"/>Here <hi>Impoſtures</hi> are hatch'd, vended and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Here the <hi>Truth</hi> is blaſpheem'd and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd; damnable <hi>Hereſies</hi> are furiouſly propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Violence and Force; the <hi>Blood of Saints</hi> thirſted after and greedily drank down: Hence come the <hi>Diſcords,</hi> Confuſions and <hi>Wars</hi> in the Earth; they come of <hi>Mens Luſts,</hi> and Errors Originally of Hell, <hi>Adopted</hi> and carefully nurs'd up by the <hi>Romiſh Apoſtacy,</hi> Her fruitful, Spurious, acknowledg'd <hi>Iſſue.</hi> The Death of theſe we ought to ſeek, the Extirpation of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and of Luſt, which deſtroy mens Souls, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, and turn the World upſide down. Surely we ſhou'd pray for a ſtop to be put to ſuch <hi>Guilts! O let the wickedneſs of the Wicked come to an End, but eſtabliſh the Juſt!—For her Sins have reached unto Heaven, and God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred her Iniquities;—therefore ſhall her Plagues come in one day—.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is but a meet Expreſſion of Love to the Church and Members of Chriſt in the World.</hi> The Church's Preſervation, defence and ſafety, Eſtabliſhment and Inlargement, Purity and Reformation, Peace and Tranquility, Comfort and Joy, do depend on the Judgment of its implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Their fall is the Church's Security and Triumph, <hi>Rejoice over her, thou Heaven, and ye Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle and Prophets!</hi> the <hi>Perſecuted Saints</hi> are herein deliver'd, honour'd and Avenged; to <hi>Them</hi> we owe our firſt and ſuperiour Love, next unto what we owe to the LORD Himſelf, nay
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001294_0018_0FB27C2815EABF90"/>he reckons it to Himſelf, and it is our Love to His Name and Glory. For <hi>Zions ſake</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhou'd <hi>not hold our peace, and for Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems ſake</hi> we ſhou'd <hi>not reſt, until the Righteouſneſs thereof go forth as brightneſs, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp</hi> that <hi>burneth.</hi> Iſai. 62.1. This was a ſtrong <hi>Motive</hi> to the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And Laſtly, <hi>The Glory of God, and of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt is greatly conſulted in ſuch Prayers.</hi> The Glory of the <hi>Being and Providence</hi> of God is ſo: for by <hi>this</hi> it appears terribly to a wicked and Infidel World, that there is a God, and that <hi>Zions</hi> God reigns; that <hi>Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous, verily he is a God who judgeth in the Earth! and that He whoſe Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is Jehovah is the Moſt High over all the Earth!</hi> v. 4. <hi>Extol him that rideth upon the Heavens by his Name</hi> JAH, <hi>and rejoyce before Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God has the Glory of his <hi>Holineſs and Juſtice,</hi> and his Holy <hi>Angels</hi> laud him for Ever, ſaying, —<hi>They are Worthy!</hi> And of His <hi>Truth,</hi> both in his Promiſes and his Threatnings, <hi>Even ſo, Lord God Almighty! true and Righteous are thy Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to the Great Glory of Divine <hi>Power:</hi> eſpecially when theſe Enemies of God are High and Mighty upon Earth, and they are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001294_0019_0FB27C2987FDEDD0"/>made to know that there is a God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them: So God gets Himſelf a <hi>Name</hi> on a haughty <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> a blaſpheeming <hi>Senecharib,</hi> and a vaunting <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> He makes the <hi>One</hi> to know—<hi>Who is the Lord,</hi> and puts a <hi>hook into the</hi> Others <hi>Noſe,</hi> and cauſes <hi>the Virgin, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion, to deſpiſe him, to laugh him to ſcorn, &amp; to ſhake the head at him;</hi> &amp; the <hi>Laſt</hi> He humbles, and forces to confeſs that there is <hi>A Moſt High,</hi> the <hi>King of Heaven,</hi> to <hi>Praiſe, Extol &amp; Honour</hi> Him, whoſe <hi>Dominion is Everlaſting,</hi> all whoſe <hi>Works</hi> are <hi>Truth,</hi> and His <hi>Ways Judgment,</hi> &amp; thoſe that walk in <hi>Pride He is able to abaſe.</hi>

            <p>Moreover, God has the Glory of his <hi>Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Mercy</hi> to His Church: <hi>He confirms his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance when it is weary,—and prepares of his Goodneſs for the poor.</hi> v. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Finally, <hi>The Wiſdom</hi> of God is ſure to ſhine forth Gloriouſly: <hi>Myſterious Wiſdom,</hi> in defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deep Polices, craft and ſubtilty of man, turning their Counſels backward, and taking them in their own <hi>Snares!</hi> Surprizing his Church with Salvations in Unexpected Way and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! ſnatch'd from <hi>among the pots,</hi> v. 13. and on a ſudden rais'd &amp; beautify'd <hi>as the Wings of a Dove cover'd with Silver, &amp; her Feathers with yellow Gold.</hi>

            <p>For theſe <hi>plain Reaſons</hi> we ought to be ſeeking to God in Prayer for the Overthrow and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of His &amp; his Church's Enemies: <hi>theſe</hi> are the <hi>Ends</hi> of ſuch Prayers, the proper <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> to 'em, and what do juſtifie us in 'em; not

            <p n="2">II. <hi>Unto Fervency and Earneſtneſs in ſuch parts of Prayer;</hi> which ſhou'd have been the <hi>Second Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head of Diſcourſe,</hi> the <hi>Text</hi> breathing a very ſenſible <hi>Zeal and Flame;</hi> as alſo the <hi>Elect, whom God will avenge,</hi> are ſaid to <hi>Cry day and night.</hi> If we ſhou'd not be Zealous againſt <hi>Sin,</hi> and in Earneſt when the <hi>Glory</hi> of God lies at ſtake, and if we ought not to be hearty and fervent in Love to Chriſt and his Intereſt, what ſhou'd Inſpire us to be ſo?</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>The Enemies of Chriſt &amp; of his Church are zealous in their Oppoſition and Enmity.</hi> Zealous in their Idolatrous <hi>Invocations,</hi> and in numbring their Ridiculous Prayers, like the <hi>Prieſts of Baal</hi> in <hi>Elijahs</hi> time, who together with their <hi>Antick Geſtures,</hi> and <hi>bloody Rites,</hi> held their <hi>Yell</hi> from Morning to Evening, <hi>O Baal, hear us!</hi> Furious (like <hi>Jezabel,</hi> their Patroneſs) in hatred of the Truth, and perſecuting the Prophets of the Lord to Death, to exterminate pure Worſhip from the Earth!

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. If Imprecation ſhou'd be made againſt the wicked Enemies of God and his Church, in Solemn Prayer unto God, we learn thence <hi>how Prophane it is to uſe this Mode of Speech on light and trivial Cauſes, how horrid and cruel it is to make our Neighbours the Objects of 'em, and how Unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Monſtrous a thing 'tis to make them againſt our ſelves.</hi> The leaſt that can be ſaid of it in either of theſe Caſes is, that 'tis a profane <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Name of God in vain:</hi> But one wou'd never gueſs it, if 'twere not ſo often prov'd, that men cou'd turn a thing ſo Awful and Solemn into a Jeſt and Play, nor dare to direct the <hi>Poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lightning</hi> to their own heads, or wiſh it on their Neighbours. Yet this vile Uſe do men too often make of <hi>Imprecation,</hi> ſometimes wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly, ſometimes maliciouſly, always prophanely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some</hi> cruelly &amp; unnaturally Imprecate againſt <hi>their own Souls,</hi> on trivial Cauſes and in a ſtrange kind of Jeſt &amp; Sport, wiſhing <hi>damnation</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves every day they live! the <hi>only Prayer</hi> they ever make it may be! Others in Vexation and diſcontent do the ſame to their <hi>Limbs or Life;</hi> &amp; God, whoſe holy Name is impiouſly profan'd.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001294_0022_0FB27C2F77922688"/>hears their hideous Wiſhes, and ſometimes judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>ſeals</hi> and affixes an <hi>Amen</hi> to 'em, ſaying, Yes, Profane man, equally an hater of thy ſelf and Me, inherit the wiſh'd Curſe.</p>
            <p>Sometimes men beſtow their direful Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>on Others,</hi> ſportively very often, and often from paſſion and ſudden wrath, and too often from a bitter Malignity, and Implacable hatred of their Perſons. A Crime that Chriſtianity ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deteſts, whatever our Provocations may be, ſtrictly requiring us to <hi>love our Enemies</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give men their treſpaſſes, to bleſs them that curſe us, and to pray for them that deſpitefully uſe us.</hi> Ro. 12.14. <hi>Bleſs them which perſecute you, bleſs and curſe not.</hi> Not but that we may have a ſorrowful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of Wrongs, and may go to God, with whom 'tis beſt to leave our ſelves and others.—<hi>I Mourn in my complaint and make a noiſe, becauſe of the Voice of the Enemy, becauſe of the Oppreſſion of the Wicked; for they caſt Iniquity upon me, &amp; in Wrath they hate me.—They curſe inwardly: My Soul, wait then only upon God, for my Expectation is from Him.—Do thou for me, O God the Lord, for thy Names take: becauſe thy Mercy is Good, deliver thou me.—That they may know that this is thy Hand, that thou, Lord, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>Sometimes theſe barbarous and bloody <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations</hi> have put on the <hi>Reverend Face of Sanctity</hi> and Religion, &amp; Zeal for God &amp; His Truth: &amp; ſo the Men of one <hi>Party, Sect</hi> and <hi>Opinion</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion have, with much ſolemnity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>Indeed there was <hi>among the Jews a Form of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration or Imprecation,</hi> ſcil. GOD DO SO, AND MORE ALSO. The moſt Eminent Saints us'd it, but in a devout and awful manner, &amp; upon weighty and ſerious Occaſions: And ſo us'd, it was properly a part of Religion, as much as the taking an <hi>Oath</hi> is when we are called to it; for <hi>this</hi> alſo is a ſolemn Appeal unto God, and a <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Invoking his holy Vengeance</hi> in caſe of Falſhood, which Vengeance does therefore follow Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

            <p>But as every act of Religion may be abus'd and profan'd, and then looks horrid, ſo do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Imprecations more eſpecially; it is ſo Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and daring a Diſhonour to the Name and Authority of God.

            </p>
            <p>But how many Graceleſs Creatures are there, who make a Trade of this and other Acts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs, and repent not, nor do their hearts ſeem to ſmite 'em.

II. <hi>Here is a Serious and Affectionate Call to Prayer, for our People, and Churches, and for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Chriſt in the World.</hi> For what is it to Pray againſt the Church's Enemies, but to be lifting up a Prayer for the Church it ſelf? 'Tis in effect the ſame thing, and they are mutually imply'd in each other. The ſame Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments incite equally to either, and therefore the proper <hi>Inference</hi> &amp; <hi>Exhortation</hi> from the preceding <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> is this, <hi>Pray for the Peace of Jeruſalem!</hi> Pſal. 122.7, 8, 9. <hi>Peace be within thy Walls, and Proſperity within thy Palaces. For my Brethren and Companions ſake I will now ſay, Peace be within thee. Becauſe of the Houſe of the Lord our God, I will ſeek thy Good.</hi> So in the ſame Breath wherein the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prayes, <hi>Remember,</hi> O <hi>Lord, the Children of Edom,</hi> he took ſpecial care himſelf not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>Jeruſalem, If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem, let my right hand forget her Cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jeruſalem above my chief Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Millions of Prayers are daily going up to God from his Church, in every part of the World, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Enemies; and ſuch hands as <hi>Moſes</hi> held up High and Steadily in the <hi>Mount,</hi> and hearts like his breathing out <hi>this Short Petition,</hi> wou'd utterly ſcatter every <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and put the Haters of the Lord to a perpetual Rout.

IV. If we may Pray againſt the Enemies of God and his Church, for their Overthrow and Deſtruction, <hi>Then alſo we may Seek and Endeavour their ruin and downfal in</hi> LAWFUL WAR. 'Tis you ſee what we can Pray over, and may truſt in God for his Bleſſing on. For tho' Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty abhors the Principle of Propagating the Truth by Force of Arms; or of making War on others becauſe they are the avowed Enemies of God &amp; his Church; yet if thro' the over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God we come to be in a juſt War with ſuch, we may the more confidently hope that God will make it Subſerve to his own Glory in their Overthrow, and we can plead before Him, that they are <hi>His Enemies,</hi> and Pray that He wou'd <hi>Ariſe and Scatter 'em.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This gives the GOVERNMENT Confidence in their <hi>Councels</hi> againſt the <hi>Enemy,</hi> and heartens the Chriſtian <hi>Souldiers</hi> in their <hi>Marches</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements;</hi> to be <hi>Strong</hi> and to <hi>Play the Men,</hi> for the People and Cities of their God; for as many Prayers are following 'em, So who knows what <hi>Arms</hi> God will uſe for the Fall of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> againſt whom ſo many Prayers are continually aſcending. What we may Pray for, we may alſo endeavour, at the plain and loud Call of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

            <p>It behoves us therefore to judge our ſelves this day before the <hi>Lord our God:</hi> Have we been a People faithful in his Holy Covenant? Or are we a penitent and reforming People? If not, what Confidence have we that God will hear and bleſs us? What Efficacy are our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers like to have? What hurt will they do our Enemies, if we be as wicked as they? as <hi>barren</hi> under better <hi>Means,</hi> and as <hi>Cold</hi> and dead under more <hi>Awakenings!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Traitors</hi> that we are to God, to our ſelves, &amp; Countrey! We ſide with our Enemies in their ill deſigns upon us, by retaining our provoking Luſts! we betray and deliver up the Intereſt of Chriſt! we provoke God to forſake the Land, and the <hi>Ark will not ſave us!</hi> We ſhow no real Regard to our Churches, nor to our <hi>Brethren in the Field!</hi> We blaſt our own Prayers, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh worſe Enemies within us, than thoſe that can invade us from without!</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore put away the <hi>Accurſed thing</hi> from among us, or our <hi>Trouble</hi> is from our ſelves, and <hi>God will trouble us.</hi> Let us be <hi>zeal us and repent.</hi> Eſpecially lay out your <hi>Zeal</hi> againſt <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:001294_0032_0FB27C4FC49DF608"/>and for <hi>Practical Godlineſs.</hi> Let us join heart and hand for <hi>Truth and Holineſs,</hi> &amp; againſt the open <hi>Neglect,</hi> I had amoſt ſaid <hi>Contempt,</hi> of Divine <hi>Inſtitutions.</hi> Let us be Spirited [to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and eſtabliſh <hi>Government</hi> in our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,] and to maintain a <hi>Godly and ſtrict Diſcipline. Finally,</hi> Let our <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> ſee to the <hi>Execution</hi> of thoſe good <hi>Laws,</hi> which we have againſt <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Wickedneſs,</hi> and to provide for Religion and <hi>Literature</hi> in After-Generations; that there may be an Inſtructed and Godly Seed after us, excelling us, as They have done who are gone before us.</p>
            <p>Then wou'd the LORD awake for our Help, and put our Enemies to a perpetual Reproach; the <hi>Haters</hi> of the Lord ſhou'd <hi>ſubmit</hi> themſelves, and our <hi>Time would be for ever!</hi> He would <hi>Set up his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi> with us, and His <hi>Soul would not abhor us!</hi> He wou'd <hi>Walk among us, and be our God, and we ſhou'd be His People!</hi> The <hi>Cloud</hi> of his merciful Protection wou'd <hi>cover</hi> us, and <hi>reſt</hi> over us!
