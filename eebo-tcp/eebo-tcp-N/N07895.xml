            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>WO branches of the popiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, viz. the infallibility and ſupremacy claimed by the biſhop and church of Rome, were handled by the two aged and learned divines <note n="†" place="bottom">The Rev. EDWARD WIGGLESWORTH, D. D. late HOLLIS Profeſſor of Divinity; and the Rev. Mr. THOMAS FOXCROFT, of BOSTON.</note>, whom I have the honor to ſucceed in this department of the <hi>Dudleian Lecture.</hi> It is now propoſed, by divine aſſiſtance, to offer ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the idolatry of that church; it being one of the capital errors objected againſt her. This branch of the controverſy alone is ſo fruitful, that it would require many diſcourſes to handle it in all its extent and variety. This learned audience will, therefore, expect nothing more in a ſingle diſcourſe, tho' long, than a general idea of popiſh idolatry; an imperfect ſketch, the outlines of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010068_0004_0F7C75854942E538"/>Idolatry conſiſts in general in the ſervice of idols, or falſe, imaginary deities. But this, like all other crimes, admits of various degrees. The worſhip of a creature under the formal notion of its being the true God, excluſively of him, is the groſſeſt kind of idolatry. The worſhip of any creature in common with him, as though it were equally God, is a lower, but ſtill very high degree of it. A third ſpecies thereof is paying ſuch ſervice to creatures, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of religion, as God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and as they are unworthy of; although it may be profeſſedly paid to them, not as gods, but in ſubordination to him, as the ultimate object of worſhip. It is alſo idolatry to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the true God by images, or under any ſuppoſed material repreſentations of him. And it may be laid down as a general rule, that all ſuch practices as the ſcripture hath condemned as idolatrous in Jews or Pagans, are equally idolatrous in profeſſed Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Proteſtants have not accuſed Papiſts of the firſt and groſſeſt kind of idolatry, or worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping idols excluſively of the true God; but they have charged them with all the others: And to make good this old accuſation, is the buſineſs now before me. In the proſecution of which, a ſummary account will be given of the doctrine and practice of the church of Rome reſpecting the worſhip of the euchariſt, ſaints and angels, pictures and images.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:010068_0005_0F7C7585E82B4F58"/>Chriſtians early began to ſpeak too myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, not to ſay unintelligibly, concerning the euchariſt, or Lord's ſupper. They did ſo more and more, till the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, and the worſhip of the ſacrament, were fully eſtabliſhed. The council of Trent, confirmed by pope Pius IV, and conſidered as an authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſtandard of popery, defines the doctrine of the church of Rome as to this, and many other points, more particularly than had been done by any former council. In ſeſſion 13th that council declareth as follows: 'Principio do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet ſancta ſynodus,' &amp;c. <hi>In the firſt place the holy ſynod teacheth, and openly and ſimply pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that in the pure ſacrament of the holy euchariſt, after the conſecration of the bread and wine, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, true God and man, is truly, really and ſubſtantially contained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecies</hi> [or appearances] <hi>of thoſe ſenſible things</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Conc. Trident. Seſſ. 13. cap. 1.</note>. This great myſtery is increaſed in chapter 3d of the ſame ſeſſion, where the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil attempts to explain it. It is there ſaid, 'Statim poſt conſecrationem,' &amp;c. That <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after conſecration, the true body of our Lord, and his true blood, exiſt under the ſpecies of bread and wine, together with his ſoul and Divinity; his body indeed under the ſpecies of bread, and his blood under the ſpecies of wine, by virtue of the words</hi> [of conſecration;] <hi>but the body itſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecies of wine, and the blood under the ſpecies of bread, and the ſoul under both, by virtue of that natural connexion and concomitancy, by which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010068_0006_0F7C7586B4103F40"/>the parts of Chriſt the Lord, who preſently roſe from the dead to die no more, are united together; and alſo the Divinity, becauſe of the admirable hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical union thereof with the body and ſoul. Wherefore it is moſt true, that one and the ſame thing</hi> [or as much <note n="*" place="bottom">tantumdem.</note>] <hi>is contained under either ſpecies, and under both: <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> whole and perfect Chriſt exiſteth under the ſpecies of bread, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every part of its ſpecies; alſo under he ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of wine, and under its parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus theſe venerable fathers. And this wonderful change of the bread and wine is ſaid, in the next chapter, to have been <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently and properly called tranſubſtantiation.</hi> It follows, chapter 5th, 'Nullus itaque dubitandi locus relinquitur,' &amp;c. <hi>There is therefore no room left for doubt, but that all the faithful of Chriſt, according to the practice ever received in the catholic church, ſhould in reverence give the worſhip of latria, which is due to the true God, to this moſt holy ſacrament. For neither is it therefore the leſs to be adored, becauſe it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt the Lord, to be taken</hi> [or eaten and drunk] <note n="‡" place="bottom">ut ſumatur.</note>. Thus the council: And in the <hi>Roman ritual</hi> this ſacrament is honored with the title of our <hi>Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt be obſerved here, that the church of Rome diſtinguiſhes worſhip into latria, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, hyperdulia and coadoration. By the firſt of which, latria, they underſtand the higheſt kind of worſhip, or that which is due to God alone. And the council of Trent expreſly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010068_0007_0F7C75876CA594A8"/>declares, that the euchariſt is to be worſhipped therewith. The doctrine and practice of the church of Rome in this reſpect are exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to each other. The euchariſt is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by them in the moſt ſolemn manner, with proſtrations, prayers and incenſe. The hoſt is often carried in proceſſions, with the greateſt ſolemnity: And thoſe who are but caſually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent where it paſſes along, are obliged to kneel down, as in an act of worſhip to God; unleſs, perhaps, they will run the riſque of the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or of being knocked on the head by the devout rabble that attend it. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It is well known, that the chief accuſation againſt the old reformers, was, that they denied tranſubſtantiation; tho' ſome even of thoſe who ſuffered death, particularly John Hus and Jerom of Prague, did not differ materially from the church of Rome in this point; as plainly appears from Monſ. Lenfant's <hi>Hiſtory of the council of Conſtance.</hi> And what great ſtreſs the church of Rome lays upon this doctrine, as a moſt diſtinguiſhing and eſſential article of faith, will further appear from the canons, i. e. curſes, of the council of Trent, ſeſſ. 13. Some of which are here faithfully tranſlated, partly with that view, and partly with a view to give the unlearned reader a clearer idea of what the church of Rome holds, as to this matter. They are as follows.</p>
                  <p>Canon I. 'Si quis negaverit,' &amp;c. 'If any one ſhall deny, that in the moſt holy ſacrament of the euchariſt the body and blood, together with the ſoul and divinity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are truly, really and ſubſtantially contained, and therefore whole Chriſt; but ſhall ſay, they are in it only as in a ſign, or figure, or in virtue; let him be <hi>anathema.</hi>'</p>
                  <p>Can. II. 'If any one ſhall ſay, that the ſubſtance of bread and wine remain in the holy ſacrament of the euchariſt, together with the body and blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and ſhall deny that admirable and ſingular converſion of the whole ſubſtance of bread into body, and of the whole ſubſtance of wine into blood, the ſpecies [or appearance] only of bread and wine remaining; which converſion, indeed, the catholic church moſt fitly calls tranſubſtantiation; let him be <hi>anathema.</hi>'</p>
                  <p>Can. III. 'If any one ſhall deny, that in the venerable ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the euchariſt whole Chriſt is contained under each ſpecies, and under the ſeveral parts of each ſpecies; let him be <hi>anathema.</hi>'</p>
                  <p>Can. VI. 'If any one ſhall ſay, that in the holy ſacrament of the euchariſt, Chriſt the only begotten Son of God is not to be adored with the worſhip of latria, even external;—let him be <hi>anathema.</hi>'</p>
                  <p>So important a doctrine is this, in the church of Rome: And more perſons, it is apprehended, have ſuffered death from her for denying it, and refuſing to worſhip the euchariſt, than for any other ſuppoſed hereſy whatever.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:010068_0008_0F7C75881F8A8DF0"/>Their doctrine and worſhip being harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in this reſpect; it follows, that if the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation is falſe, their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip grounded thereon is idolatry. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the deſign of this diſcourſe to enter into a particular diſcuſſion of that doctrine, or the arguments by which it is defended: It ſhall ſuffice to obſerve a few things with relation thereto.</p>
            <p>This doctrine is as plainly abſurd, ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, and impoſſible to be true, as any one that can be imagined. For what can be more ſo, than that bread and wine ſhould be changed into the very body and blood of Chriſt; while yet all the known properties of bread and wine remain, without the ſubject or ſubſtance; and none of the peculiar properties of fleſh or blood are perceived? What more impoſſible, than that this bread and wine ſhould alſo be changed, at the ſame time, into an human ſoul, and into the very ſubſtance of the Deity? This
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010068_0009_0F7C75890B7CC3F0"/>doctrine ſuppoſes alſo, that the ſame undivided body of Chriſt may be wholly in heaven and wholly on earth, and in ten million different places on earth, at the ſame time. It ſuppoſes, that tho' the bread is wholly changed into body, and the wine wholly into blood; yet both the body and blood of Chriſt, the ſoul and Divinity, exiſt wholly and perfectly under each of the ſpecies ſeperately conſidered, and under every part thereof, be they ever ſo minute and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: Every apparent crumb of conſecrated wafer, and each drop of conſecrated wine, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſmall, contains whole, intire Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſpecies; body, blood, ſoul and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and yet it is owned, that there is but one Chriſt! Beſides; this doctrine ſuppoſes, that when our Lord inſtituted the ſupper, he took his whole body into his own hand, which was but a part of it; put himſelf into his own mouth, ſwallowed down his intire body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſtomach, and at the ſame time gave his body and blood to be wholly eaten and drunk by each of his apoſtles! Could the moſt fertile imagination invent groſſer, more ridiculous, or more impious incongruities?</p>
            <p>The evidence of ſenſe is the moſt certain, that we are capable of; and by this we know that tranſubſtantiation is falſe. The Romaniſts do not pretend to deny, but that all the five ſenſes bear teſtimony againſt it, as much as they poſſibly could if it were falſe, or if the bread and wine remained after the juggling, hocus-pocus

               </note> trick, which they term conſecration. It is, therefore, at beſt weak and puerile, in ſuch a caſe as this, to urge the teſtimony of ſcripture, or divine revelation. For the truth of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian revelation itſelf depends on the truth of certain facts, by which there was an appeal made to the ſenſes of men; particularly the miracles and reſurrection of our Saviour. The evidence of ſenſe being ſet aſide as precarious, it cannot be proved that ever our Lord uttered thoſe words, 'This is my body'; that he had any body at all; or that there was ever ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world, as 'the man Chriſt Jeſus,' in diſtinction from a mere phantaſm, or, in the language of our adverſaries, from the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of a man. Thus does the church of Rome, by this doctrine, ſubvert the very foundations of chriſtianity. We cannot be more certain, that any one thing in nature is what it appears to be, and not another, the moſt different therefrom, than that true bread and wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after conſecration; and conſequently, that tranſubſtantiation is the groſſeſt impoſition and inſult, that ever the prieſthood itſelf put upon the ſuperſtitious credulity of mankind.</p>
            <p>This doctrine then, being plainly falſe, the church of Rome is certainly guilty of idolatry, in worſhipping the euchariſt as true God. For what is idolatry, if it be not ſo, to believe a creature to be the Creator, and to pay divine homage thereto accordingly? Beſides; when,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010068_0011_0F7C758DD9117330"/>to juſtify their worſhip of the euchariſt, ſo often objected againſt as idolatry, they alledge tranſubſtantiation; making this ſuppoſed change the ground of their worſhip; this is an implicit acknowledgment, that their worſhip would actually be idolatrous, if there were no ſuch change: For why is this alledged, to exculpate themſelves, if their worſhip of the euchariſt would not be idolatry without it?</p>
            <p>Some Roman-catholics have, indeed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly owned this conſequence. Coſterus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, a learned jeſuit, expreſſeth himſelf very ſtrongly, as cited by doctor H. More. Saith he, <q>The errors of thoſe were more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, who worſhipped ſome golden or ſilver ſtatue, or ſome image of any other materials, for their God, as the heathen worſhipped their gods; or a red cloth hung upon the top of a ſpear, as is reported of the Laplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; or ſome live animal, as of old the Egyptians did; than thoſe who worſhip <hi>a bit of bread,</hi> as hitherto the Chriſtians have done all over the world, if the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation be not true.</q> Thus do ſome Roman-catholics fully agree with us in this conſequence; but others deny it. And the ſubſtance of what the latter ſay, is, That tho' tranſubſtantiation ſhould be falſe; yet the Deity is certainly there preſent in the bread and wine, ſo that they do not miſs of the proper object of adoration, while they ſeem to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thoſe material objects: And, that they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010068_0012_0F7C758E574D1680"/>cannot be juſtly charged with idolatry, becauſe they do not intentionally worſhip a creature, knowing it to be ſo, but firmly believing it to be true God. Thus they try to exculpate themſelves, on the very diſagreeable ſuppoſition that tranſubſtantiation is an error, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility miſtaken; whether effectually, or not, may appear from the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p>The divine nature is eſſentially every-where; intimately and equally preſent in all ſenſible objects throughout the univerſe. And if mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the divine preſence in an object, will excuſe its worſhippers from idolatry, then all other creatures may be worſhipped without idolatry, as well as the euchariſt; provided the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers intentionally direct their devotions ultimately, not to theſe objects abſtractly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, but as ſymbols of the Deity preſent in them. This is a plain conſequence, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome Roman-catholics. Thus, no perſon, who is a believer in the true God, an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent being, can ever be guilty of idolatry, how many material objects ſoever he may worſhip in the ſame ſenſe that the Romaniſts worſhip bread and wine in the euchariſt. Tho' each of theſe objects is ſuppoſed to be God, and worſhipped under that perſuaſion; and tho' the votary would be miſtaken in this reſpect; yet he would not miſs of the proper object of adoration, becauſe, the worſt come to the worſt, God is preſent therein, whom he intends to worſhip; which is ſufficient to clear
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010068_0013_0F7C758F30981FE0"/>him from idolatry. For example; if one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould worſhip the ſun, another an image of wood or braſs, a third a man, a fourth a beaſt, and the fifth a devil, even with latria; each of the devonioniſts being ſo infatuated as to believe the object of his worſhip the living and true God; Roman-catholics could not, upon the principle aforeſaid, charge them with idolatry; or do it without condemning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They would, indeed, be miſtaken, but not idolaters; becauſe it was their intention to worſhip the true God.</p>
            <p>But all idolatry, when people are ſincere in their worſhip, ſuppoſeth ſome miſtake, or error in the judgment, either as to the object or the act of worſhip. Without ſome erroneous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions there can be no idolatry: And, as a learned divine hath juſtly obſerved, where this ſin is committed the <hi>moſt in good earneſt,</hi> there is the greateſt miſtake in the judgment of the worſhipper. But they who alledge, that a miſtake with reſpect to tranſubſtantiation, if it be really one, excuſes the worſhippers of the bread and wine from idolatry, becauſe they think they are worſhipping God; do in effect ſay, that idolatry cannot be committed by any one, who is ſo erroneous as to believe the creature he worſhippeth to be God moſt high. This is quite abſurd: For according to this way of reaſoning, the more ignorantly and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly any worſhip mere creatures, believing their proper Deity, and the more devoutly they adore
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010068_0014_0F7C758F9EEA3710"/>them; ſo much leſs liable they are to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of idolatry. But the direct contrary is manifeſtly true: By how much more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely any believe a creature to be the true God, and worſhip it as ſuch; by ſo much the more groſs is their idolatry. Let us ſuppoſe, for illuſtration, that among the Iſraelites of old, who worſhipped golden calves, there were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of different opinions; that ſome adored them merely as ſymbols, or repreſentations of the true God; but that others were ſo ſottiſh as to believe the calf, to which they bowed down, was really Jehovah himſelf under the appearance or <hi>ſpecies</hi> of a calf; even the very God that created, and brought them out of Egypt. Now, on this ſuppoſition, would any ſenſible man ſay, that the former were, indeed, guilty of idolatry, but not the latter; becauſe they believed this four-footed beaſt to be their Creator? Ought it not to be ſaid, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that they were, for that very reaſon, more brutiſh idolaters than the others, who worſhipped it only as an image or ſymbol of the Godhead? Or let us apply this to the heathens. The ignorant vulgar, who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſenſible objects as real deities, were ever and juſtly accounted more ſottiſh idolaters than thoſe ſpeculative perſons, who had no ſuch high opinion of theſe objects, but worſhipped them merely as repreſentations of the gods; or rather, as ſome of them ſeem to have done, of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous powers, virtues and perfections of one
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010068_0015_0F7C759082FB07F0"/>almighty, ſpiritual and inviſible being. Thus, if among the ancient Perſians ſome adored the riſing ſun, only as the moſt glorious ſymbol of the Deity, and a principal mean or inſtrument of his munificence, while others worſhipped it as being itſelf God; the idolatry of the latter was certainly more groſs than that of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. By the ſame rule, the more ſincerely any believe tranſubſtantiation, and worſhip the euchariſt as God; the more ſottiſh is their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Their idolatry would be leſs ſcandalous, tho' real, if they worſhipped it merely as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Deity, or a ſacred memorial of our redemption by Chriſt. And here it is natural to obſerve, that the idolatry of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts is more groſs in this reſpect, than that of the Iſraelites in worſhipping golden calves, or than many perſons, even among the Pagans, were chargeable with. There is no good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, that the Iſraelites believed a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calf, which they had juſt made, to be the true God, their Creator; as the Papiſts do, bread and wine. And it is certain, that ſome of the more intelligent heathens diſclaimed, with much indignation, the thought of worſhipping any material objects, otherwiſe than as ſymbols of the Deity; while the vulgar adored them, as having divinity belonging to them. So that popiſh idolatry, in this reſpect, approacheth nearer to that of vulgar Pagans, than to that of the more enlightened among them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, none of them were ever ſo brutal and ſavage, as to eat what he took for a deity: at
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010068_0016_0F7C759121A119B0"/>leaſt we read of no ſuch ſect as that of God-eaters, even in the moſt barbarous nations and ages. And it is certain that the Egyptians, who worſhipped many ſorts of animals, roots and vegetables, that were good for food, as gods; yet thought it impious at once to adore and devour them: But the Papiſts, it ſeems, are leſs delicate, or ſqueamiſh.</p>
            <p>Let me diſmiſs this part of the ſubject with a remark of the late Dr. Middleton, agreeable to what was juſt now ſaid, in his excellent <hi>Letter from Rome,</hi> ſhewing an exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity between popery and paganiſm in many particulars. <q>As to that celebrated act of popiſh idolatry, the worſhip of the hoſt, ſaith he, I muſt confeſs, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find the leaſt reſemblance of it in any part of the pagan worſhip: and as often as I have been ſtanding by at maſs, and ſeen the whole congregation proſtrate on the ground, in the humbleſt poſture of adoring; I could not help reflecting on a paſſage of Tully, when ſpeaking of the abſurdity of the heathens in the choice of their gods: <hi>But was man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ever ſo mad as to take that which he feeds upon for a god</hi>? <note n="§" place="bottom">

                  </note> This was an extravagance reſerved for popery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: And what an <hi>old</hi> Roman could not but think too groſs even for Egyptian idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to ſwallow, is now become the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of worſhip, and the moſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing article of faith, in <hi>modern</hi> Rome.</q>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010068_0017_0F7C7592440386E0"/>LET us now proceed to the worſhip of ſaints and angels, as practiſed in the ſame church; by which the charge of idolatry will be further fixed upon her.</p>
            <p>The worſhip of demons, or the ſouls of renowned perſons after their deceaſe, is a very ancient ſpecies of idolatry; as ſome ſuppoſe, even more ancient than the flood. Be that as it may, this became afterward almoſt an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal practice. For it is paſt diſpute, that the greater part of the gods and goddeſſes worſhipped by the heathens, were demons; deceaſed heroes and kings, the inventors of arts, and other famous perſons, male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male. This kind of worſhip was ſtrictly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to the Iſraelites; but yet they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fell into it, in conformity to their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then neighbours. Chriſtianity, which was deſigned to be the religion of the world, not of one nation only, was particularly adapted to put an end to this, and all other kinds of ſuperſtitious, falſe worſhip among the Gentiles; and to eſtabliſh that of one God, by one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, thro'out the earth. <q>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus; who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. ii. 6.</note> And <q>there is none other God but one. For tho' there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010068_0018_0F7C7592B6D54AE0"/>all things, and we by him; and one Lord, Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. viii. 4, 5, 6.</note> The primary buſineſs of the apoſtles, when they went among the Gentiles, was to convert them from the worſhip of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and other idols, to the faith and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God. <q>We preach unto you, ſaid they, that ye ſhould turn from theſe vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unto the living God, which made heaven and earth, and the ſea, and all things that are therein</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts xiv.</note>. During the apoſtolic age, and ſome time after, Chriſtians in general were ſo averſe to the worſhip of demons, and all other ſorts of idolatry, that they determinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed any compliances with the worſhip of their heathen neighbours, even at the expence of their blood. They conſidered the worſhip of angels and demons as inconſiſtent with the religion which they profeſſed; and as what would have been an implicit renunciation of it. But the church of Rome is, in effect, for reconciling theſe things together; even the <hi>temple of God with idols.</hi> For many ages paſt, the worſhip of demons, or angels, and the ſouls of dead men and women, has been fully eſtabliſhed therein, and as much practiſed as ever the like worſhip was among the heathens. The chief difference is, that the Romaniſts do not call the ſaints or angels gods and goddeſſes; though, for aught that appears, they attribute as much power to them at leaſt, as the pagans did to their inferior deities; and depend as much upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:010068_0019_0F7C7593B64061C8"/>The riſe and progreſs of this ſpecies of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the Chriſtian church, was briefly as follows. The martyrs were juſtly held in great honor after their deceaſe. The caemete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or places of their burial, uſed to be much frequented, even from the earlieſt times: There the people prayed, not to them indeed, but to God; and ſometimes ſung hymns in honor of their memory. All this was done for ſome time, without any thought of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping them, though not wholly without ſuperſtition. But an extravagant, and even idolatrous veneration for them ſucceeded, at leaſt as early as the fourth century. For Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius, who lived at the latter end of it, as Dr. Middleton has obſerved, publicly charged the ruling clergy with paganizing and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, on account of ſeveral heatheniſh cuſtoms then in the church; particularly the veneration of ſaints and reliques. <q>We ſee, ſays he, in effect, a pagan rite introduced into our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, under the pretext of religion; when heaps of wax candles are lighted up in clear ſun-ſhine, and people are every-where kiſſing and adoring, I know not what, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible duſt, preſerved in a little veſſel, and wrapped up in precious linnen. Theſe men do great honor truly to the bleſſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, by lighting up paultry candles to thoſe, whom the Lamb in the midſt of the throne illuminates with all the luſtre of his majeſty.</q> It is ſaid that Jerom, who attempted to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010068_0020_0F7C75941E0F2508"/>Vigilantius, neither diſowned theſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, nor denied that they were borrowed from the pagan worſhip; but juſtified them by ſaying, <q>That was once done to idols, and was then to be deteſted; but this is done to the martyrs, and is therefore to be received.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Letter from Rome,</hi> the latter end.</note>
               </q> So it ſeems, that even in Jerom's opinion, what was deteſtable ſuperſtition and idolatry when done by Chriſtians in honor of the martyrs: There needed only to transfer the veneration from thoſe idols to the ſaints, in order to render it laudable, at leaſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible: The kind of worſhip might be retained, if the particular objects of it were changed, and chriſtian demons introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of pagan demons!</p>
            <p>But worldly policy, as well as ſuperſtition, had ſome hand in eſtabliſhing ſaint-worſhip. When Chriſtian teachers became corrupt and worldly-minded, thro' the indiſcrete zeal, or, perhaps, policy, of Conſtantine the Great, they aimed more at increaſing the number of nominal Chriſtians, for ſecular ends, than that of real ones; or preſerving their religion in its original purity and ſimplicity. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, obſerving how attached the Pagans were to the worſhip of their gods and demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods, to their magnificent temples, images, and the feaſts kept in honor of their deities; the Chriſtian leaders were for bringing them over,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010068_0021_0F7C7596E5F8C788"/>by imitating many of their cuſtoms. Then ſpacious churches were built, ſumptuouſly adorned, and dedicated to the martyrs; pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, images and altars were brought into uſe therein; and the formal invocation of ſaints encouraged. Thus Chriſtians rivalled, if not ſurpaſſed Pagans, in their own way, with a view to bring them over to the faith of Chriſt, at leaſt to a profeſſion of it. By which temporizing policy, as biſhop Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet obſerves, chriſtianity came at laſt to be little or nothing elſe but 'reformed paganiſm,' as to its external worſhip: Or, as Turretin ſays, <q>the empire was brought over to the faith, but the church alſo infected with the pomp of the empire; the Pagans were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſt, but the Chriſtian worſhip depraved to the faſhion of paganiſm. <note n="*" place="bottom">See more relating to this, <hi>Letter from Rome,</hi> ſub fin.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The worſhip of ſaints prevailed more and more until the Reformation, tho' not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all parts, nor without oppoſition. It continues in the church of Rome to this day, nearly in as high credit as ever. <note n="‡" place="bottom">That the ſaints are to be invocated, and feſtivals and temples conſecrated to them, is an <hi>article of faith</hi> in the church of Rome, and mentioned as ſuch, in common with the moſt eſſential doctrines of chriſtianity; without the belief of which there is ſuppoſed to be no ſalvation. <q>Septimus articulus eccleſiae Romanae eſt, ſanctos in coelo regnantes eſſe honorandos, ac feſtos dies atque baſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licas illis conſecrandas eſſe.</q> Vid.

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010068_0022_0F7C7597A4D1FEB0"/>from time to time canonizing new ſaints, tho' more ſparingly than in ſome ages paſt; juſt as in old pagan Rome they were from time to time enrolling more dead men in the number of the gods. They erect oratories and altars to them, proſtrate themſelves before their ſhrines, and burn incenſe to them; all nearly in the ſame manner, that the Pagans did to their factitious deities. And the Pantheon at Rome, formerly the temple of all the gods, is now dedicated to Mary and all the ſaints. They alſo make formal vows and prayers to them for bleſſings temporal, ſpiritual and eternal. Why might they not as well offer ſheep and oxen in ſacrifice to them, as pay them ſuch worſhip as this; and yet be free from idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</p>
            <p>Let me inſtance in a few of their hymns and prayers to the ſaints, by way of ſpecimen. To St. Nicholas they addreſs themſelves as follows: 'Ergo pie nos exaudi,' &amp;c. <hi>Therefore graciouſly here us, who are intent on praiſing thee, leſt we are ſubjected to the fraud of the enemy; bring us help. Deliver us from all evil; conduct us in the right way; and after this life, introduce us into eternal joys.</hi> To St. Agnes thus: 'Ave, Agnes glorioſa,' &amp;c. <hi>Hail, glorious Agnes; preſerve me in the right faith, O ſweet and beloved virgin, I intreat thee with prayers. Grant to all, that they may in perfect charity worſhip God, by whom thou waſt elected.</hi> They have longer forms of devotion to other ſaints; in which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly implore of them almoſt every bleſſing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010068_0023_0F7C7597F9B5D590"/>that can be named; at leaſt as many and great ones as the Pagans uſed to pray for to any of their gods, not excepting their Jupiter optimus maximus; altho' they call this worſhip, which they pay to the ſaints in common, only dulia, in diſtinction from latria. But their worſhip of the virgin Mary they term hyperdulia; by which it is not eaſy to know what they mean, only in general, that it is ſomething more extravagant and outrageous than their worſhip of other ſaints, or of angels. In her <hi>Roſarie,</hi> as it is called, that is, a kind of <hi>liturgy</hi> for the virgin Mary, and in other devotional books, they give her the following titles: Queen regent of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, miſtreſs of angels, mother of grace, mother of mercy, mother of God, the hope of the world, the truſt of ſinners, the repairer and ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of deſpairing ſouls, the giver of ſpiritual grace, the female ſaviour of the world, the healer of the ſick, the confirmer of the juſt, the reſtorer of them that go aſtray, the helper and hope of the deſolate, a moſt ready helper; and the like.</p>
            <p>They ſeldom ſpeak of the merits and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt, but in conjunction with thoſe of Mary; and in language that expreſſes their hope of ſalvation by her's, as truly as by his<note n="†" place="bottom">See particularly, in the <hi>Ritual</hi> the offices called the <hi>ſacrament of repentance,</hi> and the <hi>viſitation of the ſick</hi>; alſo the prayer for a woman after child bearing.</note>. They ſolemnly confeſs their ſins to God and to her, in the ſame breath; as may be ſeen in ſeveral parts of the <hi>Ritual.</hi> They ſometimes beſeech
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010068_0024_0F7C7598A582CC68"/>her to exerciſe the authority of a mother, and to <hi>command her ſon.</hi> And in the office intitled <hi>Ordo commendationis animae,</hi> the dying perſon is directed to pray to her in theſe terms: 'Maria, mater gratiae', &amp;c. <hi>O Mary, mother of grace, mother of mercy, do thou protect me from the enemy, and receive me in the hour of death.</hi> Let me here ſubjoin a prayer or hymn to Mary out of the <hi>Roſarie,</hi> as follows: 'Reparatrix ſalvatrix', &amp;c. <hi>Thou female repairer aud ſaviour of the deſpairing ſoul, the ſhowerer down and beſtower of ſpiritual grace, heal my wounds, I pray, I fervently deſire; and grant the gifts of grace to the ſoul that calleth upon thee: That I may be chaſte and modeſt, gentle, valiant, ſober, godly, regular, circumſpect, a ſtranger to revenge, well inſtructed, and guarded by the divine ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; conſtant, grave and pleaſant, benign, lovely, prudent in heart, careful to ſpeak the truth, hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, ever cleaving to God in pious works.</hi> Part of another of theſe admirable collects in the <hi>Roſarie,</hi> is as follows: 'Cor meum illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina', &amp;c. <hi>Enlighten my heart, thou refulgent ſtar of the ſea, and ever defend me from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the enemy.

            <p>They have another approved book among them, called the <hi>Mary-Pſalter,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalter of our Lady,</hi> the work of their ſeraphic doctor Bonaventure, and himſelf, if we can believe ſo ſtrange a thing, both a ſaint and a cardinal; in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010068_0025_0F7C7599671B2390"/>which book the devotional pſalms of David are turned into forms of prayer and praiſe to Mary: So that, with ſome little variations, the ſame devotions which David offered to the King of heaven, they offer to the <hi>Queen of heaven,</hi> at once, according to their divinity, his mother, ſpouſe and daughter. Part of one of theſe pſalms is thus paraphraſed: 'In te, Domina, ſperavi', &amp;c. <hi>In thee, Lady, have I hoped; I ſhall never be confounded. Receive me to thy favor; incline thine ear unto me, and rejoice me in my trouble. Thou art my ſtrength and my refuge, my conſolation and my protection.

               <q>There is no one who can be ſaved, O moſt holy virgin, but thro' thee—
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010068_0026_0F7C759A450DA3E0"/>Mary, indeed, opens the boſom of her mercy to all; ſo that the whole univerſe receives out of her fulneſs: The captive, redemption; the ſick, a cure; the ſad, comfort; the ſinner, pardon; the juſt, grace; the angle, joy; the whole Trinity, glory.</q> The learned writer laſt named, very pertinently remarks, that <q>when Jeremiah rebukes the people of Iudah for <hi>burning incenſe to the Queen of heaven,</hi> one can hardly help imagining, that he is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically pointing out the worſhip now paid to the virgin; to whom they actually <hi>burn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe</hi> at this day under that very title <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid.

'Salve Regina; Ave Regina coelorum; Domina angelorum'—</note>.</q> It is alſo well known that their churches, eſpecially in Italy, are filled with votive tables and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to Mary and other ſaints, for ſuppoſed cures and deliverances wrought by them; in like manner as the heathen temples were adorned, in honor of the gods and goddeſſes. And Dr. Stillingfleet relates, that there was once a diſpute among ſome Romancatholics, whether the <hi>Lord's prayer</hi> might, or might not, be uſed to the ſaints. <q>And it was well reſolved, and very ſubtilly, ſays he, that ultimately, principally, primarily and ſtrictly, they might not; but <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> leſs <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>largely,</hi> and <hi>relatively</hi> they might.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With ſuch-like vain diſtinctions they amuſe themſelves, impoſe upon the ignorant, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to palliate their idolatrous worſhip of ſaints and angels. They ſay, they do not call
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010068_0027_0F7C759B4219D780"/>them gods, or worſhip them with latria; but with an inferior worſhip. The council of Trent ſays, in ſeſſion 25th, 'Sanctos una cum Chriſto regnantes', &amp;c. <hi>That the ſaints reigning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Chriſt, offer up their prayers to God for men: that it is good and profitable humbly to invocate them, and to fly to their prayers, help and aid, for bleſſings to be impetrated of God by his Son</hi>', &amp;c. By which cautious manner of ſpeaking, it ſeems the council was a little afraid, either expreſly to condemn or to juſtify ſaint-worſhip in all its enormous extent, or in the manner in which it was then, and is now actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally practiſed. I muſt crave leave to make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral remarks, relative to this point.</p>
            <p>The diſtinction between latria and dulia, on which the church of Rome lays ſo much ſtreſs, is an arbitrary one, without any ſolid foundation in ſcripture. But taking their own explanation of theſe terms, the diſtinction will not excuſe them from idolatry. People may be guilty of this, by paying an unwarrantable worſhip to ſaints and angels, or other creatures, tho' they do not adore them as equal to God in nature and dignity, but worſhip them as inferior to him. We are, indeed, to give honor, or, if they pleaſe, worſhip, which is an equivocal term, <note n="*" place="bottom">This word is divers times uſed in ſcripture, to expreſs the honor that may be juſtly due, and paid to creatures.</note> to all thoſe to whom it is due; and in ſuch manner and meaſure as it belongs to them, either by the expreſs appointment of God, or by natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and right, in virtue of the known relation
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010068_0028_0F7C759BC5213F68"/>in which they ſtand towards us. But the thing inſiſted on is, that that ſervice and reſpect, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be called honor only, or worſhip, which the church of Rome pays to ſaints and angels, is unwarranted by reaſon, contrary to ſcripture, and properly idolatrous. Tho' the holy angels are all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter to the heirs of ſalvation; yet we are forbidden to worſhip them thus. <q>Let no man beguile you of your reward, ſays the apoſtle, in a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary humility, and worſhipping of angels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding into thoſe which he hath not ſeen<note n="†" place="bottom">Col. II. 18</note>
               </q>— When John fell at the feet of an angel, paying him too profound a reverence; tho' it cannot be ſuppoſed, that he thought the angel was God, or meant to worſhip him as God, he received a check from him: 'See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-ſervant', &amp;c. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev XIX 10. and XXII 8.</note> And the council of Laodicea, convened anno 320 or 321, expreſly condemned the worſhip of angels under the name of <hi>idolatry,</hi> and as a <hi>forſaking our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Conc. Laod c 35</note>. Now, ſurely, if even angels are not to be bowed down and prayed to by us, tho' we know they miniſter to us, and are a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior order of beings; much leſs are the ſaints to be thus worſhipped. We are to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but not worſhippers of them, who thro' faith and patience inherit the promiſes; unleſs thinking and ſpeaking of them with honor, and imitating their virtues, be to worſhip them. We know not that they have any concern with
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010068_0029_0F7C759C5E515E28"/>human affairs, or that they have any knowledge of what is paſſing in this lower world. But we are ſure, neither they, nor the angels are omniſcient, omnipotent or omnipreſent: Which conſideration alone ſhews the folly, at leaſt, of worſhipping them in the manner the Papiſts do. Beſides; the worſhip of demons [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] is condemned by the apoſtle. <q>I would not, ſays he, that ye ſhould have fellowſhip with demons. Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. 1 Cor. X. 19 — 22.</note>.</q> And giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heed to 'doctrines of demons', is one cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of thoſe who ſhould 'depart from the faith' in the laſt days. Now, this Greek word certainly ſignifies an angel or ſpirit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad. For Socrates, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, of which he boaſted, ſurely meant not the devil, or an evil malicious being, but a good genius, angel or ſpirit; and all the popiſh ſaints are properly demons<note n="*" place="bottom">This is clearly evinced by many learned Proteſtants; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Mr Joſ. Mede, in his <hi>apoſtacy of the latter times.</hi> See alſo Sir Iſaac Newton<hi>'s Obſervations on Daniel and the Apocalypſe,</hi> ch 14 Part I.</note>. It is well if ſome of them are not demons even in the bad ſenſe of the word.</p>
            <p>Moreover; tho' they do not give their ſaints the titles of dii and deae, gods and goddeſſes; yet they call them divi and numina; as the Pagans of old Rome called dead men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men after their apotheoſis <note n="‡" place="bottom">If the indignation of the reader will not be too much raiſed, it may be an agreeable amuſement to him to compare the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pagan and popiſh inſcriptions, exhibited by Dr. Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in oppoſite columns, to ſhew how nearly Papiſts have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted the language, as well as ſpirit of paganiſm; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed the ſame powers, characters and attributes to their ſaints, which had formerly been aſcribed to heathen deities.

               </note>. And it appears
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010068_0030_0F7C759EC22729A8"/>from the example before produced, that they directly implore of them the greateſt bleſſings of time and eternity; health of body and mind, guidance in the true faith, ſpiritual grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the devil, deliverance from all evil, ſalvation from the pains of hell, a gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception at death, and admiſſion to the joys of heaven. They may, if they pleaſe, call this only dulia and hyperdulia: But what more, what greater or better do, or can they, pray for to God himſelf? Theſe are bleſſings, which he alone can beſtow. And when they pray thus to the ſaints, expreſſing their confidence in their protection in the ſame terms, in which good men uſe to expreſs their's in the power, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010068_0031_0F7C759F8A802BE0"/>and grace of God; this is really giving divine honors to them: And if latria, as they ſay, is the worſhip that belongs excluſively to God; then this is plainly latria, whatever they may call it. To give ſuch worſhip as this to the ſaints, is an implicit aſcription of divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to them, while they are explicitly owned to be but creatures. It is a kind of worſhip, which ſuppoſes them to be omnipotent, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient, and omnipreſent; ſince He alone, who is poſſeſſed of thoſe perfections, can be ſuppoſed to hear prayers at all times, from all parts of the earth at the ſame time; and able to grant ſuch bleſſings. How poor an evaſion is it then, for Romancatholics to ſay, they neither call the ſaints gods, nor worſhip them with ſupreme worſhip? For is not this to ſuppoſe them really gods? And is not that even ſupreme worſhip, which can, with propriety, be given only to God almighty? It is of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, except as a matter of criticiſm, whether this be called latria or dulia: And if they are guilty of an apparent inconſiſtency in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as well as of idolatry; it much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns their own infallibility to clear it up, than it concerns us.</p>
            <p>Beſides; this diſtinction might ſerve ſome pagan idolaters as well as it does them; all thoſe, who acknowledged one God, as ſupreme. For him alone they profeſſedly worſhipped with ſupreme honors, anſwering to the latria of the Papiſts; the others they worſhipped as ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, with a worſhip anſwering to dulia or hyer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulia.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010068_0032_0F7C75A020A1BE98"/>But can we think that the apoſtle Paul would have been ſatisfied with ſuch an apoloy as this? Suppoſe an Athenian Sophiſt, for example, had ſaid to him: <q>Altho' you ſee us worſhip, and offer ſacrifices to, many inviſible beings, male and female; ſo that you conſider us as polytheiſts and idolaters; you are miſtanken, for want of attending to our learned diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. You muſt know then, that ſome of us at leaſt, own one ſupreme and moſt perfect being: Him only we intentionally honor with latria; the reſt we worſhip only with dulia, or hyperdulia, as ſubordinate to him. Obſerve well this diſtinction, good Maſter Paul; and you will then ſee we are no idolaters, how many demons, demi gods and goddeſſes ſoever we worſhip.</q> Now, one may be pretty cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the holy apoſtle's ſpirit would not have been leſs 'ſtirred in him', for an apology of this ſort, than when he came to Athens, and 'ſaw the city wholly given to idolatry'<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts XVII. 16.</note>. Nor is an apology of this kind more ſatisfactory from the mouth of a modern Romaniſt, than it would have been from that of an old Athenian.</p>
            <p>One cannot well help remarking here, by the way, the great diſingenuity and aſſurance of thoſe Romancatholics, who pretend that they pray to the ſaints only as friendly interceſſors, to pray for them. Were this true, it would not excuſe them; but nothing can be more falſe. And indeed, they are ſo much given to deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notorious facts, and aſſerting known falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010068_0033_0F7C75A0DDCFE988"/>in their diſputes with Proteſtants; that a famous ancient hieroglyphic in Dioſpolis, ought, methinks, to be inſcribed in all their churches; the nearer the pulpit or altar the better. In that hieroglyphic a young child ſignified coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; an old man, going out of it; an hawk, the Deity; an hippopotamus, hatred; and a crocodile, impudence. All which, being taken together, in the Egyptian manner, expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this uſeful leſſon; <hi>O ye that come into the world, and that go out of it, God hates impudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never did any pagan idolaters implore greater bleſſings of their ſupreme, or ſo great of their inferior deities, or demons, as the Romancatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics implore directly of their ſaints, eſpecially of Mary. But it has ſometimes been ſaid by them, that there is a material difference in this reſpect: That thoſe dead men and women, whom the heathens worſhipped, were ignorant of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon, and black with crimes in their life-time; whereas thoſe that are worſhipped in the church of Rome, were very holy perſons, adorned with many ſhining virtues, the workers of miracles, the ſpecial favourites of heaven; and the like. Be it ſo: But the queſtion is not, who were the beſt, the moſt worthy of imitation, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable remembrance; but whether any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or dead men, were they ever ſo holy, can be thus worſhipped without idolatry? True, it is more fooliſh and wicked to adore an ill man thus after his deceaſe, than a wiſe and good one: But yet the latter is as truly idolatry as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If the Pagans were idolaters in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010068_0034_0F7C75A1AB8196A8"/>their deceaſed kings and heroes, it was neither only nor chiefly, becauſe they were wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but becauſe they were demons, or dead men; creatures that ought not to be thus wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, altho' they had been virtuous &amp; good. And ſince the Romaniſts pay the like, if not greater honors, to dead men and women, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; this muſt, for the ſame reaſon, be ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in them alſo.</p>
            <p>But it may be remembered, that ſome of thoſe men, whom the Pagans deified, had really been great benefactors to their reſpective countries and ages; teachers of agriculture, and other uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arts; the deſtroyers of tyrants, and other wild beaſts and monſters; the founders of cities and empires; wiſe legiſlators; upright judges, and good kings, the fathers of their people. In which reſpects they had at leaſt as good a title to great honors, both living, and after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, as ſome of the popiſh ſaints; I think a much better. For divers of thoſe, who adorn the Roman kalender, were but ignorant enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, ſcarce better than madmen; perſons who never did any thing worthy of applauſe. Was Symeon Stilites worthy of ſignal honors for having his ſtation thirty years on a high pillar, like a ſtatue on its pedeſtal? or the more like a god? Was Anthony, for peaching to birds, beaſts and fiſhes? Was Francis, for hearing Chriſt's voice, as they ſay, come from a crucifix <note n="*" place="bottom">This circumſtance is mentioned by bp. Stillingfleet, as from cardinal Bonaventure.</note>; and being ſo tranſported with pious zeal or ſomething
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010068_0035_0F7C75A25EFC8690"/>elſe, as to throw away his breeches? Were others, for wearing out much hair-cloth and whip-cord on their backs, and no ſhoes on their feet, for many years? or for thoſe numerous ridiculous feats, which knaves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and fools believed, as miracles? But other popiſh ſaints had, if poſſible, even leſs ſanctity than theſe; being rebels, traitors and aſſaſſines; the peſts of ſociety, and diſturbers of kingdoms. Were not Oſiris, Hercules and AEſculapius, Vulcan, Rhadamanthus and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus, at leaſt as worthy to be enrolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the gods, as Ignatius Loyola, Garnet and Thomas á Becket, among the ſaints? It is more abſurd to worſhip ſuch contemptible and wicked perſons as ſome of the popiſh ſaints were, than ſome of thoſe, whom the Pagans deified; or even than to worſhip the ſtars and elements, which are ſo uſeful to us. And <q>I would gladly know, ſays one, why I may not as well honor God by giving worſhip to the ſun, as to Ignatius Loyola, or St. Francis, or any other late canonized ſaint?—The ſun is a certain monument of God's goodneſs, wiſdom and power, and I cannot be miſtaken therein; but I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be certain of the holineſs of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I am to give divine worſhip to. For all that I can know, Ignatius Loyola was a great hypocrite; but I am ſure that the ſun is none; but that he ſhines, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates perpetual influences, to the huge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the world. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Dr. Stillingfleet.</note>

               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:010068_0036_0F7C75A3657FF5D8"/>But to have done with ſaint-worſhip; the doctrine and precepts of ſcripture are clearly againſt this practice of the Romaniſts. And what ſcripture example there is of it, which they may think worthy <hi>their</hi> imitation, I know not; except, perhaps, it be that of the wicked rich man in hell, who earneſtly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saint Abraham, but in vain, to ſend Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus to cool his tongue with a drop of water. But, methinks, it is time enough for men to follow this example, when they come into that place of torment themſelves, and deſpair of God's hearing their prayers. A dreadful extremity! to which we pray our adverſaries may never be reduced: And if there is any ſuch place as the purgatory they talk of, we ſhould be rejoiced, if there were any good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope they might eſcape even that alſo— For, by their own account, it is a very tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, round-about and painful way to heaven.</p>
            <p>THERE is time to add but little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worſhip of pictures and images. This was probably introduced into the church in the fourth century, in common with other bad cuſtoms; and ſpread faſt, tho' not without oppoſition. In the eighth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury the indignation of many was ſo raiſed againſt it, that they deſtroyed all the images in churches, where-ever they could; and were therefore called the <hi>Iconoclaſts.</hi> They chiefly occaſioned the calling of the ſecond
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010068_0037_0F7C75A4220B6888"/>council of Nice, anno 787; in which they were cenſured, and the worſhip of images confirmed; eſpecially as that council expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <q>the image of the Lord and God, our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; nextly that of our immaculate lady the mother of God, of the venerable angels, and then thoſe of all the ſaints.</q> The council, however palliates this idolatry by ſaying, they did not mean to give images the worſhip of latria, but an honorary adoration, as to a type; which redounds to the honor of the prototype. 'Imaginis enim honor,' &amp;c. <hi>For the honor of an image ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates on the prototype; and he that adores an image, alſo adores therein what is repreſented by it.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Con. Nicaen. II. Act. 7.</note> This council alſo ſpeaks of the great benefit of pictures and images, in edifying the people, eſpecially the vulgar, who could not read. <note n="*" place="bottom">The author here ſubjoins a tranſlation of a paſſage or two, by which the ſenſe of Romancatholics as to the worſhip of cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes, and other images of Chriſt, may further appear; as alſo, what is meant by coadoration, a term uſed, but not explained, in this diſcourſe. 'Nec inde ſequitur, hoc poſito, imagines', &amp;c. Nor does it follow, this being ſuppoſed, that images are to be retained only to help the memory, as modern heretics would have it: for memory is purely hiſtorical, and memory exciteth to render worſhip to God and the ſaints; but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this notion images would be kept for that latter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance [<hi>only.</hi>] Nevertheleſs the other opinion is more probable, and more agreeable to the ſynod, that images ſhould be honored even in themſelves, and ſhould be the material ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative object of veneration, and not only the exemplar, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in them, or at the preſence of them; becauſe when the council ſays, that images are to be adored, but not with latria, it intends that another thing ſhould be adored beſides the exemplar only; for ſince Chriſt ſhould be adored with true latria, the ſynod would not deny the worſhip of latria to his image, if indeed in the adoration of it, not his image, but Chriſt himſelf were adored, to whom no other adoration beſides that of latria, belongeth. So that it intimates hereby, that ſome adoration belongeth to images, diſtinct from the veneration and honor of the prototype, and which, in the kind of worſhip, is inferior.—An image is honored two ways. Firſt, as it is itſelf the material terminative object of worſhip, but the prototype the cauſe for which it is worſhipped. Secondly, ſo that the image is honored together with the prototype; yet ſo that the prototype ſhould be primarily honored, the image ſecondarily, as the royal robes are honored together with the king; and that is called coadoration rather than adoration. Thus I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in my mind him that was crucified, together with the croſs [<hi>perhaps not always</hi>] and in adoring the Crucified with a direct intention, the croſs itſelf is coadored in the ſame act. <hi>Suma concil. omn.</hi> Opera &amp; ſtudio M.

               <hi>That the Divinity is not therefore figured, as tho' it could be ſeen with bodily eyes, or expreſſed by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors or figures</hi> [a good reaſon why it ſhould not be at all attempted.] <hi>Moreover,</hi> adds the council, <hi>let all ſuperſtition in the invocation of ſaints, in the veneration of reliques, and in the ſacred uſe of images, be taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a plain conceſſion, that they <hi>figure the Divinity,</hi> even while they acknowledge it cannot be ſeen, or expreſſed by <hi>figures</hi> or <hi>colors</hi>: Which might, perhaps, paſs for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in any church, but an infallible one. But not to ſtand on ſuch niceties with them;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:010068_0039_0F7C75A5A17A2508"/>to make and worſhip any picture or image of Chriſt, conſidered as God, which is what they chiefly intend here, is idolatry; and directly contrary to the ſecond commandment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be latria, or dulia only, that is paid thereto. And the diſtinctions, of which the Papiſts ſerve themſelves, would ſerve as well to juſtify the Iſraelites of old, provided they worſhipped golden calves only as ſymbols or types of Jehovah; intending this honor ſhould terminate on him, as the prototype. Upon the ſame principle, thoſe Pagans who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped images, not for their own ſake, but as ſuppoſed repreſentations of the inviſible God, could not be charged with idolatry, how often ſoever they might kiſs, proſtrate themſelves before, and offer incenſe and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to them. Some pagan worſhippers of idols and images could, probably, have made ſuch a plea as truly, and with a much better grace, than thoſe of the Romancatholics who have the holy ſcriptures; in which all image-worſhip is plainly forbidden. And, indeed, the leaders in the church of Rome have ſhewn a conſciouſneſs, that ſcripture was againſt them in this reſpect, by leaving the ſecond commandment wholly out of thoſe which are deſigned for common uſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the laſt of the ten into two, to compleat the number.</p>
            <p>As to other pictures and images; if it be idolatry to worſhip ſaints and angels, as it is
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010068_0040_0F7C75A82E851E60"/>practiſed in the church of Rome; it is even more ſo, to worſhip their images. As ſome have juſtly obſerved, they are guilty of double idolatry in this reſpect; firſt, in worſhipping ſaints and angels themſelves, and then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring their images, with the like external worſhip of prayers, proſtrations and incenſe: for either of theſe things would be idolatry, without the other. The ſame arguments which prove, that the Pagans worſhipping the images of their demons, or inferior deities, was idolatry, will alſo ſhew the idolatry of the church of Rome, in worſhipping the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of angels and ſaints, who are, ſtrictly and properly, their demons. The more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſort of pagans did not aſcribe divinity to their images themſelves; nor honor them with a more profound reverence, internal or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, than Romancatholics pay to theirs. Nay, ſome of them were intirely againſt the uſe of any images in their religious ſervices; as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give people too groſs conceptions of the Deity. And when the council of Trent ſo gravely injoins, that all <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ſaints and reliques, and in the <hi>ſacred uſe of images,</hi> ſhould be <hi>taken away,</hi> ſtill encouraging theſe practices themſelves; it is as anti-ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and irrational as if thoſe fathers had decreed, that men ſhould commit fornication, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unchaſtity; theft and robbery, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuſtice; murder, without breach of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and blaſphemy, without impiety. The
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010068_0041_0F7C75A8EC7EEE20"/>
               <hi>ſacred uſe</hi> of theſe vices, is hardly a greater ſoleciſm than the other. The ſuperſtition of this kind of worſhip cannot be taken away, without taking away that worſhip itſelf. Nor is there any better foundation for a diſtinction between the uſe and abuſe thereof, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the uſe and abuſe of lying and adultery, inceſt and perjury. Indeed, the leaders in the church of Rome find all theſe crimes very <hi>uſeful</hi> in their turns, and ſubſervient to their own ends, when kept under their diſcrete and ſkilful management: So that, in their opinion, laying them wholly aſide might, perhaps, be the greateſt poſſible abuſe of them. For what would then become of their diſpenſations, pardons, indulgencies, and I know not what; the wicked <hi>craft, by which they have their wealth</hi>?</p>
            <p>THE patience of this learned and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table audience ſhall be requeſted no longer, than while I ſubjoin a few reflexions.</p>
            <p>If then, the church of Rome be groſly ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous in the ſeveral reſpects aforeſaid; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſhonouring God, and the one Mediator whom he hath appointed, by an undue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of, and dependence upon, many creatures; it follows, that ſhe is ſo far from being the only true church, and chaſte ſpouſe of Chriſt, that ſhe is a moſt corrupt one, a filthy proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, who hath forſaken her firſt love, and is
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010068_0042_0F7C75A9257A92F0"/>become, indeed, the 'mother of harlots.' Some Papiſts expreſsly own, that <q>if the church of Rome is guilty of hereſy, much more, if guilty of idolatry, it falls under the apoſtle's excommunication, Gal. I. 8.</q> And if ſhe be not actually guilty of both, it will be difficult at leaſt, I believe abſolutely impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to ſhew what church or perſon ever was, that named the name of Chriſt. If ſoundneſs of doctrine and purity of worſhip are eſſential marks of a true church, as they allow; we muſt look for them, not in that of Rome, but elſe-where; unleſs we proceed upon the quaint maxim of one who ſaid, that whoever would find what he is in ſearch of, muſt look for it <hi>where it is not,</hi> as well as where it is. And if theſe marks are wanting, another, which they likewiſe boaſt of, muſt alſo fail them; viz. holineſs: At leaſt, it is not eaſy to ſee how that can be an holy church, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever catholic it may be, in which ſuch abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable idolatry is publicly authorized, and univerſally practiſed.</p>
            <p>It further appears from hence, what great danger there is of perdition in the communion of this church; every true ſon and daughter of which is, and muſt be, an idolater. The wrath of God has not been revealed from heaven more frequently, or in more awful terms, againſt any one claſs of ſinners, than againſt idolaters. And one of the moſt diſtinguiſhing characters of the great apoſtacy from the faith, foretold, is
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010068_0043_0F7C75AA04E06DA8"/>idolatry, will-worſhip, a voluntary, affected hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and worſhipping of angels and demons. 'The Spirit ſpake expreſly, that in the latter times ſome ſhould apoſtatize from the faith, giving heed to erroneous ſpirits, and doctrines concerning demons, thro' the hypocriſy of lyars, having feared conſciences; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from meats, which God,' &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. IV. 1, 2, 3. The author has followed the learned and excellent Mr. Joſ. Mede's tranſlation of this paſſage, which is unqueſtionably the moſt grammatical and proper.</note> It is ſo much eaſier to find all theſe characters in a certain church now in the world, than the marks of a true one; that there is hardly any room to doubt about the right application of them.</p>
            <p>The ancient Babylon was famous for idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; of which it ſeems to have been the firſt ſeat after the flood; perhaps was the principal, for a conſiderable time before either Egypt or Phoenicia obtained the infamous preheminence. If ſo, this ſuggeſts one intelligible reaſon, why the apoſtate, idolatrous party in the chriſtian world ſhould be deſigned by the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, under the title of Babylon: And even the Romancatholics generally own, that Rome is the Babylon of the new teſtament; only they ſay, it is Rome pagan, not chriſtian. Which, tho' ſaid without any good reaſon, and even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſtrong evidence, was yet neceſſary for them to ſay; unleſs they would farther own, that the moſt dreadful curſes in the whole bible are
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:010068_0044_0F7C75AAA60F5110"/>pointed directly againſt themſelves; for theſe are pointed againſt Babylon. Nor is it wholly unworthy of remark, that the modern Babylon alſo nearly reſembles the ancient in reſpect of the particular kind of death, which ſhe inflicts on thoſe, who renounce her idolatrous worſhip. In the ancient, they who would not fall down and worſhip idols, were caſt into a furnace of fire: In the modern, burning to death is the ordinary puniſhment for ſuch diſſenters and ſchiſmatics; <hi>and in her is found the blood of prophets and of ſaints.</hi> The former was a moſt inhuman enemy and perſecutor of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: But yet, where ſhe ſlew her thouſands, the latter has ſlain her ten thouſands. So much does the pretended only true and unerring church exceed the ancient Babylon in execrable cruelty, perſecution and tyranny!</p>
            <p>Altho' there had been no other weighty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the church of Rome, beſides her idolatry, this alone would ſufficiently juſtify thoſe who have renounced her communion: <q>For what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?</q> or his worſhip, with that of bread, demons and images? But ſo enormouſly antichriſtian is this church in many other reſpects, that we might almoſt reckon idolatry itſelf among her leſſer errors and abominations! In one view of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, or merely as it affects civil ſociety, it is far from being the greateſt. No perſon, ſurely, can ever want good authority to leave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſuch a church. A warrant for it may
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010068_0045_0F7C75AB6244E748"/>be found in almoſt every page of the bible; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Revel. xviii. Where, after a deſcription of Babylon as 'fallen,' or apoſtatized; as become the habitation of demons [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird, &amp;c. it follows, <q>And I heard a voice from heaven, ſaying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: For her ſins have reached unto heaven, and God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered her iniquities.</q> This is ſufficient warrant to come out of a church, whether Rome or any other, to which the characters of Babylon actually agree. And how much ſoever the church of Rome may curſe thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or imprecate upon them the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Peter, Paul, the <hi>Queen of heaven,</hi> and the other ſaints; we may be pretty ſure, that they have neither power nor inclination to harm us on this account; that they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtroy us themſelves, nor pray God to do it. They who invocate them to this end, in ſolemn form, and ſupport and propagate what they miſ-call religion, by perſecution, fire and ſword; have far more reaſon to fear the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations of thoſe ſaints that were ſlain for the word of God, and for the teſtimony which they held; whom John ſaw under the altar, while they <q>cried with a loud voice, ſaying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. VI.</note>
               </q>—O Babylon, if thou
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010068_0046_0F7C75ACFA6EC550"/>feareſt not the imprecations of thoſe ſaints, who have been ſlain in and by thee, for the teſtimony which they held againſt thy idolatry, and other abominations; at leaſt fear him, whom all ſaints and angels adore. Thou haſt made kings and nations drunk with the wine of thy fornication; and thyſelf with the blood of the martyrs of Jeſus. And tho' thou glorifieſt thyſelf, and liveſt deliciouſly by fraud, oppreſſion and blood, ſaying, <hi>I ſit a queen, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow</hi>; yet know, that thy day is coming: <hi>For ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth thee</hi>!<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev.

            <p>Deteſtable as the idolatry of the church of Rome is, there are other of her principles and practices, as has been intimated, which more immediately affect the peace and order of civil ſociety, the honor of princes, and the liberty and common rights of mankind. Our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with her is not merely a religious one: It is not, on our part, only a defence of the worſhip of one God by one Mediator, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to that of a thouſand demons or idols; of the authority of the ſacred oracles, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to that of idle legends and traditions; and of ſober reaſon in oppoſition to the groſſeſt fanaticiſm: But a defence of our laws, liberties, and civil rights as men, in oppoſition to the proud claims and encroachments of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons, who under the pretext of religion, and ſaving mens ſouls, would engroſs all power and property to themſelves, and reduce us to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010068_0047_0F7C75ADF3CC9EC0"/>the moſt abject ſlavery: It is a defence, if I may ſo expreſs it, of the common rights of ſeeing, hearing, touching, ſmelling, taſting; all which popery attacks and undermines, by the doctrihe of tranſubſtantiation; and would take them from us, as a means of making us dutiful ſons, or rather wretched ſlaves of the church. We muſt not ſee, taſte or ſmell, but as the church is pleaſed to give us leave. If ſhe ſhews us a morſel of bread, or a drop or two of wine, after the prieſt has played a few tricks with it; we muſt believe it is no longer bread or wine, but God. And whatever elſe ſhe declares, we muſt implicitly receive it on her authority, on pain of being burnt in this world, and damned in the next! So important is this controverſy, as the honourable founder of this lecture well knew; having himſelf written and publiſhed a learned diſſertation relative thereto.<note n="‡" place="bottom">On 'ſlaves, and ſouls of men, Rev. XVIII. 13.</note> Altho' we had no regard for true religion, yet we ought in reaſon and prudence to deteſt the church of Rome, in the ſame degree: that we prize our freedom. Her laws, more arbitrary than thoſe of Draco, are, in effect, like his, all written in blood. Popery and liberty are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible; at irreconcileable enmity with each other. May gracious Heaven ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from the one, and bleſs us with the other: At leaſt, if we are ever to be ſo unhappy as to loſe our liberty, God grant the loſs may not be aggravated, by having it taken from us either by lordly, tyrannical prieſts, or by
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:010068_0048_0F7C75AE738F95C0"/>thoſe of the laity, from whom we have the beſt reaſon to expect the defence and ſecurity of it.</p>
            <p>Popery is now making great ſtrides in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; as great, perhaps, as it did in the reign either of Charles or James the ſecond: I pray God, things may not at length be brought to as bad a paſs! Thouſands of weak and wicked Proteſtants are annually perverted to an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, horrid ſyſtem of tyranny over the bodies and ſouls of men; which leſs deſerves the name of religion, than that of an outrage on the ſenſes, and moſt valuable rights of men, and a ſatire upon God. If we may believe thoſe who pretend to know, and probably do, popiſh prieſts, jeſuits, and other emiſſaries, are very open and bold in our mother-country of late years, meeting with no vigorous oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And even <hi>popiſh biſhops reſide there, and go about to exerciſe every part of their function, without offence.</hi> It ſeems, there is far leſs good old proteſtant zeal than were to be wiſhed and expected: Many, who call themſelves prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, look upon popery as an harmleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing, notwithſtanding its inherent, reſtleſs, intolerant malignity, and moſt deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tendency. Heaven only knows what the end of theſe things will be; the proſpect is alarming!</p>
            <p>The agents of Rome, ever reſtleſs and ſchem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>compaſs ſea and land to make proſelytes</hi>; going about continually from country to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>ſeeking whom they may devour</hi>: And, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:010068_0049_0F7C75AF1D9A7208"/>there is no proteſtant country, in which there are not ſome of them, at leaſt lurking, if they dare not diſcover themſelves. We ſhould not be <hi>ignorant of their devices</hi>; nor ever off our guard againſt them. May this ſeminary of learning, may the people, miniſters and churches of New-England, ever be preſerved from popiſh, and all other pernicious errors. Our Saviour, on a memorable occaſion, ſaid to the tempter, <q>It is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</q> If our popiſh tempters are not confounded and ſilenc'd with the like anſwer, it ſeems as if they had even leſs modeſty than he, who once ſaid, as the church of Rome now, in effect, faith; <hi>If thou wilt fall down and worſhip ME, all ſhall be thine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude: They who would keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pure from ever ſpecies of idolatry, muſt not only abſtain from the worſhip of idols in the common groſs ſenſe, as practiſed by Pagans and Papiſts; but alſo from an inordinate love of this world, its pleaſures and enjoyments; and love God ſupremely. The apoſtle ſtiles a covetous man 'an idolater':<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. V. 5. and Col. III. 5.</note> For there are many that make gold their hope, and ſay unto the fine gold, 'Thou art my confidence,' even before it is formed into an image by art, and man's device. By the ſame rule, all other wicked men are in ſome ſenſe idolaters. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever uſurps that place, that preheminence in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:010068_0050_0F7C75B17720DAA0"/>the affections of men, which is due to God alone; that is their idol, that is their God. How many idolaters are there then, even among proteſtants? They only, who love God above all things, worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth, whatever church they live in commuion with. May ſuch worſhippers, whom the Father ſeeketh, be increaſed in every church, to his glory; even till 'THE MAN OF SIN,' whoſe coming is after the working of ſatan, with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh, ſhall finally be conſumed by the breath of the Lord, and <q>deſtroyed with the brightneſs of his coming! <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Theſſ.
