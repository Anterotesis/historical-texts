            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOUR Diligence and Tenderneſs in bringing up my Children, will always command my utmoſt Endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to ſerve you. And as I cannot but approve, ſo I recommend this your laudable Deſign, of compiling a Collection of Songs, ſo fit for the Capacities of Infants. both in Words and Tunes, by which they are often, lull'd to Reſt, when croſs, and in great Pain. The firſt Songs are very ſuitably compos'd for a Baby: but pray be careful, not to ſing them too loud; leſt you frighten the Child, when you deſign to lull it to Sleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or divert it: For you know, great Care ought to be obſerved as to the early Senſe of Children, ſome arriving
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021089_0005_0FB2388AC87325A0"/>
to a Knowledge, and Notice of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals and their Sounds, much earlier than others.</p>
            <p>And now I am ſpeaking of Frights, I will recommend a Method that is very uſeful, to prevent them in ſome Caſes, ſuch as in making them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with Domeſtick, or other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, as the Dog, Cat, Horſe, Cow, &amp;c. by perſuading them to ſtroke, or touch them, as they happen to fall in their Way, which will make them as they grow up, bold in their Carriage, to all ſuch Creatures, otherwiſe tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous to a Misfortune.</p>
            <p>But this in particular, I inſiſt on, above all others, that you never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Bull Beggar, Tom Poker, Raw Head and Bloody Bones, &amp;c. leſt you make ſuch frightful Impreſſions on their tender Minds, as may never be eradicated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:021089_0006_0FB2388C497B7D80"/>
There is another Concern I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to their bodily Preſervation; that is, as many of the following Songs while the Nurſes are ſinging them, are attended with dancing, or exerciſing Infants, I ſeriouſly intreat all who have the Care of Children, not to ſwing them by the Arms with their Heels backwards, leſt they diſlocate their Backs, which has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been the Ruin of many a fine Child.</p>
            <p>I hope your experienced Siſter Nurſes will not be diſpleaſed, as my Deſign is not to direct them: But as it very often happens, that young Girls are intruſted with the Care of Children, I think theſe Precautions, and Songs, may be of Uſe to them, as they have been to,</p>

               <p>The Method I propoſe, is, that you firſt ſhew the Child, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Animals one at a Time, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce its Sound, as for Example,</p>
