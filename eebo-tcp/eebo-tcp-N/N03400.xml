            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Told you in the Cloſe of my <hi>Second Letter,</hi> that if Mr. <hi>G.</hi> thought fit to write again, and would ſeriouſly and fairly attend to the real Merits of the Cauſe, I would willingly attend him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but if he was reſolved to go on Scoffing and Reviling, I ſhould endeavour to find ſome better Method of ſpending my Time, than to take any further Notice of him: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in hopes, I ſuppoſe, that I would have done with him, and being reſolved to have the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004148_0004_1003B93C9F48BE48"/>
laſt Word; he has choſe not only to go on in his reviling Method, but has, if poſſible, gone a much further Length in his injurious and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Manner of treating us than he did before.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not therefore think it worth my while to write any particular and diſtinct Reply to his Remarks; not becauſe there would be any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Difficulty in confuting every Syllable of them; but becauſe there is ſcarce any thing new of Reaſoning in them, (nothing indeed worth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning but what is ſufficiently confuted already, in the very Letter which he pretends to anſwer;) and becauſe the purſuing ſuch a bitter, reflecting, bantering, uncharitable Diſpute as he has gone into, in the manner it deſerves, may rather tend to increaſe than mitigate that unchriſtian Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in you towards us, which his Management of the Controverſy has a ſad Tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and which therefore I ſhould rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to draw a Veil over than to expoſe. For it is indeed a moſt melancholy thing in the Eyes of all ſerious Chriſtians, that one who profeſſes himſelf a Miniſter of the Goſpel of Peace, ſhould, at all adventures, give himſelf up in ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned Manner to excite among Chriſtians a mortal Hatred and Averſion one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>He ſays, p. 1. <hi>It hath been juſtly obſerved, that ſuch as lie in wait to deceive, make it their firſt work to move the Paſſions of their Readers and Hearers.</hi> In which Words he hath unhappily deſcribed his own Character and Practice; for I appeal to you all that read his Book, (which I believe will be but few,) whether he hath aimed at much elſe
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004148_0005_1003DCD9F6900480"/>
than to raiſe and enflame the Paſſions of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and thoſe of the worſt Sort, even the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Anger, Malice, Hatred, Contempt and Ill-will, than which nothing can be more ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>But tho' I do not deſign any particular Anſwer to this new Scold of his, yet in Compaſſion to ſome who may otherwiſe be miſled and impoſed upon by certain bold Aſſertions and artful Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, I have, tho' very much againſt my own Inclinations, been prevailed upon to make a few <hi>Obſervations</hi> upon his <hi>Remarks,</hi> chiefly with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to certain pretended Facts, which are as directly contrary to Truth as Darkneſs is to Light.—</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>firſt</hi> thing I ſhall take Notice of is, p. 85, 87. wherein he aſſerts, that <hi>I confeſs ſome things are unlawful in the Church of</hi> England: Now as to this I deſire you to read that Paſſage in my <hi>Second Letter,</hi> p. 46 and ſee with your own Eyes, which will ſoon convince you how far Mr. <hi>G.</hi> is from the leaſt Regard to Truth: for you will then be ſenſible that there is not the leaſt Ground for that Aſſertion. Read alſo p. 33. and firſt Letter p. 13. where I challenge him and all the World to prove that there is any thing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our Church, and p. 35. and many other Places there are to the ſame Effect. — I allow indeed that unlawful things impoſed would be a juſtifiable Reaſon of Separation; but I am far from ſaying or thinking, and as far is he from proving, that there is any ſuch thing in our Church: And when I ſay, <hi>that was our Caſe:</hi> he
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004148_0006_1003B944133F3B18"/>
can't but know, I mean (not that any thing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in the Church, but,) only that ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things were wanting among you which were a juſtifiable Reaſon for our leaving you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In p. 5. He calls <hi>Bohun</hi> an <hi>honeſt Man</hi> and ſays <hi>he is informed he is of our Communion.</hi> — Now it is certain he can't be an honeſt Man, becauſe he muſt know that he ſpeaks falſe in ſaying, that <q>
                  <hi>Our Biſhops give Licences to Midwives to Baptize, and to Men to have two Wives, and to commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and practice Knavery</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. — And I have it from a Gentleman of great Character and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in <hi>London,</hi> that he is reputed an Infidel, and conſequently of no Communion: — And when I find fault with ſome of your Miniſters for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending and ſcattering about that, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the like abuſive Books, he knows I don't mean the whole Body of them; for I know, and he may know that there are many of them that do abhor ſuch Books, and his own among the reſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He charges me, in p. 6. with <hi>reflecting on the Father of Spirits,</hi> becauſe I ſay, <q>He that is not convinced by the mighty Reaſoning of <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Chillingworth</hi> appears to me to have a Mind of a very odd make.</q> — Now as to this, he knows I am far from thinking that God made his Mind ſo oddly who is not convinced, and that what I mean is, that it ſeems to me he muſt, by perverſly indulging his Prejudices, have made himſelf obſtinate and impregnable againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction: — It is not God that make Men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, but they make themſelves ſo</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004148_0007_1003DCE21CC353B8"/>4. In p 7. He does in effect charge me with <hi>barefaced wilful Perjury,</hi> becauſe I ſaid "God is my Witneſs and you alſo, that he had charged me falſly in ſaying, <hi>I had repeatedly railed againſt you either from the Preſs or Pulpit.</hi> — Now as to this, I am content to leave it to your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and ſtill appeal to you all that have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known my manner of Life, whether any thing has ever been my Practice that could juſtly be charged with Railing? and conſequently, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his dreadful charging me at this Rate be not unſupportably abuſive?</p>
            <p n="5">5. In p. <hi>ibid.</hi> He ſays, I charge him <hi>with exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Rioting,</hi> as tho' I meant Drinking; when he knows I meant, not Drinking exceſſively, but another Sort of Riot, even that of malevolent Paſſions and Evil-ſpeaking, which you all know to be true. — And on this Occaſion he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates as if I were at the head of <hi>Bonfires and drinking ſtrong Drink</hi> on the Evening of Gun-powder Treaſon; when you all know that I never had any Concern in thoſe Diverſions, and that there were at leaſt five of you to one of my People that were preſent on thoſe Occaſions, when I cannot underſtand there ever paſſed any thing but what was very innocent.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In p. 9. He denys that he repreſented the Church of <hi>England</hi> in that odious and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abuſive manner I mentioned, calling <hi>it not Chriſt's Church but the Devil's.</hi> — Now you all know that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read them, that he meant the Church in thoſe Verſes: And I have them to ſhew in his own hand-writing, and I dare appeal to you all
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004148_0008_1003B94960CC4938"/>
whether they can admit of any other Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to his own Conſcience, both that he was the Author of them, and that this was his meaning.</p>
            <p n="7">7 In p 10 He <hi>challenges all Mankind</hi> to <hi>ſhew any thing whereby he ever diſcovered the leaſt Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or Inclination to conform to the Engliſh Modes of Worſhip and Government.</hi> — Now as to this I have a Letter by me in his own hand-writing, that I am ready to ſhew you at any Time, which he wrote for one of his Pariſhioners to a Gentleman in <hi>Boſton,</hi> wherein, with all the good Wiſhes imaginable for the Churches Proſperity <hi>and Succeſs in this Land,</hi> that Gentleman is deſired to ſend <hi>the beſt Books in Defence of the Worſhip and Government of the Church of</hi> England.—Now I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you all whether the Writer of that Letter had not ſtrong Inclinations to Conformity: tho' we are very thankful that he never did actually conform, ſince he appears to be a Perſon of ſuch a virulent Temper.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In p. 12. He ſays <hi>I encouraged a Perſon to preach every Sabbath Day,</hi> who confeſſedly <hi>had no Power.</hi> — Now as to this it is far from being true: And that very Gentleman himſelf told the Perſon who inſpected the Preſs, upon his Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into this Matter, that I never directed or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him to preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is very ſtrange that he would let it paſs when he knew it to be not true: Nor did I ever direct him or any one elſe to do any thing beſides what a meer Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might do, and what the Society that ſent me hither, both approves and rewards. — As
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004148_0009_1003DCEE052E2C00"/>
to what Mr. G. himſelf did, I aſſure you I had it from one of your own Miniſters who condemned his Proceeding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as being generally eſteemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry irregular and inconſiſtent with your Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He ſays, p. 15. That <hi>one of your Miniſters did undertake to defend his Remarks, and did it ſo rourdly that I had little to ſay;</hi> and that <hi>I declared, that it is not Epiſcopal Ordination I ſtand ſo much upon, and that if I were a Dioceſan I ſhould not oblige any that had Presbyterian Ordination to be re-ordained.</hi> Now as to theſe Articles there is no truth at all in either of them; and I appeal to all that were preſent at that Converſation, (and there were ſeveral of both Perſuaſions,) that that Gentleman being once and again urged to defend him, he utterly declined it, and ſaid <hi>he had no Buſineſs to defend Mr.</hi> G<hi>'s Notions,</hi> or to this Effect. — And the Gentleman himſelf has ſince declared to me before ſundry Evidences, that he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported me as giving up Epiſcopal Ordination, or ſaying were I a Dioceſan, I would not inſiſt on Reordination: So that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> is left alone to ſtand the Author of theſe notorious Untruths.</p>
            <p n="10">10 On this Occaſion he ſays once and again, p. 86. That <hi>he is well ſatisfied we never had Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Ordination.</hi> — Now this is very ſtrange indeed, for when he diſputed once with one of our Brethren on this Subject before ſeveral Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that Gentleman, to convict him, ſhewed him his Letters of Orders with the Biſhop's Hand and Seal, and he owned it was ſo: How then can he now ſay he is well ſatisfied of the contrary, when
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004148_0010_1003DCF709AD4B80"/>
he knows otherwiſe? — And becauſe you are made to believe we never were ordained by the Biſhop with Impoſition of Hands, &amp;c.

He ſays, <hi>The firſt Reformers took the Prayers of the Church out of the Popiſh Maſs-Book.</hi> Now in this there is a moſt wretched De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion; for the Truth of the Matter is this: Our Reformers had no Regard at all to the Popiſh Books as ſuch, but to the Holy Scriptures, and the ancient Liturgies of the primitive Church, which were uſed long before the Times of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, from whence ſome Forms of Prayer had been continued down through the corrupt Times of Popery; but ſurely they were never the worſe for having been uſed by the Papiſts, any more than the Pſalms, the Scripture-Leſſons, the Lord's-Prayer, the Creed and the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: The Papiſts have done no harm to the

Pſalms and Leſſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by uſing them; neither for the ſame Reaſon could any of thoſe ancient Prayers be the leſs excellent and uſeful becauſe they had been uſed by them: And beſides theſe a great Part of the Prayers of our Church were compoſed by thoſe holy Martyrs and Confeſſors themſelves: For this ſee <hi>Sparrow, Comber</hi> and <hi>Wheatly</hi> on the Common-Prayer, which I will any Time ſhew you.</p>

            <p n="17">17. But there is one Thing here, I can't but take Notice of; and that is, <hi>p.</hi> 75, where he ſays, <hi>I rob every Man of his own perſonal Judgment of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion;</hi> and that I teach that <hi>when lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity has interpoſed, every one muſt ſacrifice the Peace of his Conſcience to the Peace of the Church.</hi> — Now this is moſt notoriouſly falſe, for it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to what I did teach you in my <hi>Second Letter, P.</hi> 40. My Words are, "<hi>You will ſay, What, May we not judge for our ſelves? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Yes, We not only may, but ought to judge for our ſelves, and ſee to it, that there be nothing required of us by Authority that is evidently contrary to the Word of God.</hi> — And he knows that it is not any deliberate reaſonable ſetled Judgment of Conſcience, much leſs Peace of Conſcience, that I hold it our Duty to ſacrifice to the public Peace, but only <hi>little Doubts and Scruples</hi> about Things of ſmall moment, as I abundantly ſhew, <hi>P.</hi> 41, 42. And in this all good Caſuiſts agree. <hi>See</hi> A. Bp. Sharp's <hi>Diſcourſe of Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. I told you that we are not obliged to read one Syllable of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> on the Lord's-Day. —To this he moſt falſly ſays, (tho' he pretends to have the Calender open before him) <hi>That there is no Proviſion made that Apocryphal Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may not be read on the Lord's-Day,</hi> P. 89. Than which nothing can be ſaid more contrary to

Truth; for there are other Leſſons appointed for every Sunday in the Year, as he might have ſeen if he would have opened his Eyes. A Man might as well look up to the Meridian at Noon in a clear Day, and at the ſame Time inſiſt on it that the Sun don't ſhine. — And here he ſays I would have you believe that we read none but <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus;</hi> whereas I never aimed at any ſuch thing, but only mentioned them as ſuch Parts as we do read, not that we read no other.</p>
            <p>But there is no End of obſerving to you the many groſs Untruths and injurious Miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of both the Church and me that abound throughout his Pamphlet: I might ſoon collect an hundred at leaſt, and it would be very eaſy to confute them all; but you may readily ſee, from thoſe that I have taken notice of, what Judgment to make of the reſt, and how little Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is to be given him in any thing that he ſays. The Truth is, and I am ſorry I am obliged to ſay it, that of all the Writers of Controverſy I ever read, (and I have read a great many) I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found one ſo full of Rancour, ſo diſingenuous, or that had ſo little Regard to the Truth and Right of Things as this Man: He little cares what he ſays, ſo that he may but throw Dirt, and raiſe an Odium, and caſt a Contempt on his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, and bring Hatred and Ill-will upon us: And I do again heartily pray God to give him Repentance and Forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>One thing however I muſt further take Notice of, and that is relating to the Predeſtinarian Controverſy, p. 123. where he ſays that <hi>the very
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004148_0016_1003DD1C5AF419C8"/>
Doctrine which I deny,</hi> i. e. abſolute perſonal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, <hi>is the Doctrine of all the foreign reformed Churches, and even of the univerſal Church of Chriſt.</hi>— Whereas he can't but know that it is only <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s Part of the Reformation that ever taught this Doctrine, and thoſe that follow him, and that <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Melancthon</hi> and the Churches that they reformed, which were by far the greater Number, ever diſclaimed it, except a few rigid People among them; and the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> or <hi>Aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> Confeſſion, which is the Summary of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine, and which was received by his Part of the Reformation, has none of this Doctrine in it, but what is indeed inconſiſtent with it: Now this Confeſſion is generally received in the whole Kingdoms of <hi>Denmark, Norway, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> in ſome Parts of <hi>Poland,</hi> and all the Proteſtant Churches of the <hi>High Germany,</hi> and the Doctrine taught in all theſe Churches, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> is, That <hi>God decreed to elect to Eternal Life thoſe who he foreſaw would ſo co-operate with his Grace as effectually to repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and perſevere in Well-doing, and to reject thoſe who he foreſaw would abide impenitent in their Sins.</hi> (vid <hi>Apell. Evang.</hi> cap. 4.) And this is the ſame with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s and ours, not to mention the whole Greek Church, comprehending a vaſt Body of Chriſtians, and this is agreeable to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of all the Fathers, and the univerſal Church of Chriſt in its pureſt Times, the firſt 300 Years, both Eaſtern and Weſtern; and I challenge him to ſhew any of the ancient Writers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, of any Note, down to the Days of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that ever taught the Doctrine of abſolute perſonal Decrees. — As to what he quotes from the 9th of <hi>Romans,</hi> it relates not to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004148_0017_1003DD27A1BF09C0"/>
the eternal State of particular Perſons, but to the Election or Rejection of whole Nations and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this World, whereby they become or ceaſe to be the peculiar Covenant People of God, as will plainly appear if you carefully attend to the Scope and Deſign of the Apoſtle's Reaſoning.</p>
            <p>In p. 126. He ſays he <hi>hopes all he has ſaid fully proves that the Doctrine of abſolute Predeſtination is really the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England. — I anſwer, very far from it: all that he has proved is, that a few private Men or particular Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the latter End of Q. <hi>Eliſabeth</hi>'s Reign, and ſome part of that of K. <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Firſt,</hi> were of that Opinion; and pray, who ever denied it? On the other hand, for theſe, (taking in the whole, both at the Time of the firſt Reformation, as I ſhewed before, and ever ſince) there have been, I believe I may ſay, at leaſt fifty to one of the contrary Opinion, who were nevertheleſs as true Churchmen as the others; for neither the one, nor the other of theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were ever yet impoſed in our Church, as Terms either of Communion or Ordination. — There was indeed, as I allowed, a ſtrong Party towards the End of Q. <hi>Eliſabeth</hi>'s Reign, who laboured hard to get the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but were reprimanded for it, and the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of them never could be obtained, nor were they ever allowed to be the Doctrine of our Church. And happy it was for us that they could not gain their Ends, for had they been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed they would have created ſuch Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Confuſion as would have ſoon broken the Church in pieces.—For all theſe things and many more, let me again beg of you to read Dr.

            <p>Indeed Mr. <hi>G.</hi> endeavours to invalidate the Authority of Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> p. 42. from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Mr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> who ſays <hi>He was an Author that had no Regard to Truth.</hi> But in Anſwer to this, I would recommend to you the learned Dr. <hi>Grey,</hi> who in his Anſwer to <hi>Peirce,</hi> (who, by the way, was an abandoned <hi>Arian,</hi>) does abundantly prove in multitudes of Inſtances, that <hi>he had no Regard to Truth:</hi> And in reading this Book, which you may have of me, you will find a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to every thing that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> here writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, which he has, in a great meaſure col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the writings of this Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> whom Dr. <hi>Grey</hi> anſwers: There you will find the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Heath</hi> and <hi>Cummin</hi> abundantly confirmed, p. 32 from <hi>Strype</hi>'s Life of A. Bp. <hi>Parker,</hi> p. 244. — Read alſo Dr <hi>Grey</hi>'s and Dr. <hi>Maddox</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to Mr. <hi>Neal</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of the Puritans,</hi> who do abundantly convict him and Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> of many groſs and notorious Untruths: And I challenge Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to ſhew any Inſtances wherein theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, or Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> either, have miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things: No, they never were, and never will be anſwered.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, Let me beſeech you in faithfulneſs to Truth, to God and your own Souls, to examine carefully both Sides of the Queſtion, and particularly I beg you will ſo far do me Juſtice, as to read over faithfully my <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Letter,</hi> together with his pretended Anſwer to it, and then you will ſee how far it is from

being any juſt Anſwer at all. — He ſays, p. 127. That <hi>he has gone through the principal Paſſages, and has not ſilently paſſed by any thing worthy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi> — Whereas, if you compare them exactly together, you will find that he has paſſed by the greateſt Part, and things of the greateſt Weight and Moment, and that where he does remark, his Remarks mainly conſiſt in ſcoffing and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Language, and where he pretends to reaſon, his way is firſt moſt abuſively to miſrepreſent me, and then to fight in the Air with his own Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and in a Duſt of his own raiſing: otherwiſe there is nothing new, but the ſame things over and over again, which have been anſwered a thouſand times, and (as I ſaid) even in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he pretends to confute, to which therefore as being yet ſafe and ſound I will refer you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating you to conſider ſeriouſly how poor an Account you will be able to give of your Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Inquiry, if you do not candidly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially read on both ſides, and procure all the helps that are offered you for your Information, and if you do not lay aſide all party Affections, and ſeek after Truth and Right for their own Sakes, and that you may know and do the Will of God, and be ſaved.</p>
            <p>He ſays, p. <hi>ult.</hi> If <hi>I am ſilent, he is reſolved how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to go on writing.</hi> — Let him go on and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, ſince he knows not how or when to hold his Tongue. You ſee from what I have here laid before you how little Regard is due to any thing he ſays: Let him then, if he pleaſes, go on Scribbling, Reviling and Scolding to the End of his Life: — This I am ſure of, he will never be able to prove that ours is an unlawful, or unſafe

The more he, and others like him ſtrive to ſet you againſt it, the more they will awaken your Attention towards it, and put you upon looking into it and <hi>ſearching the Scriptures</hi> with the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> (Acts 17.11.) to <hi>ſee whether theſe things are ſo,</hi> at leaſt thoſe of you that are generouſly diſpoſed to conſider things impartially and think and judge for your ſelves: And we are well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that the more you acquaint your ſelves with the Church, and ſeriouſly attend to it ſo as to know what it really is, the more you will be reconciled to it and be in love with it, as find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Truth and original Simplicity of the Goſpel is indeed with us, and in much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Perfection than with you.</p>
