            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>TRue Prayer is an Ordinance of God, and a Duty which God requires of Man, to be performed by the Power of his own gift, which came by Jesus Christ, who hath commanded all men to <hi>watch and pray,</hi> in a believing frame of Spirit, which is that that God requires of all men, and all men that are in perfect Obedience to God, they watch and pray by the assisting Power of Gods Spirit, by which they are made able to resist the Devil in the hour of Temptation, but they who are in Unbelief of Gods Power by Jesus Christ, <hi>That they shall never be made free from sin in this Life,</hi> they cannot pray by the Spirit of God,

the Prayers of all unrighteous men, who pray in their own time, and in their own wills.</p>
               <p>But some may then query, Whether the Unrighteous are not commanded to pray? <hi>Ans.</hi> The hearts of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous desire the return of the Wicked, that they may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the evil of their way, and serve the Lord in Truth and Righteousness, and that the Wicked are to pray, which will not discharge any part of their Disobedience to God, until they come to forsake their Unrighteous way of sinning against the gift of his Grace, and divine Light of his Spirit, which remains their Condemnation for sin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. By which it is evident, that the Prayer of a wicked man availeth not before the Lord, that is, while he remaineth in the known Life of Sin, which he prays against, but let the wicked forsake their way, and the Unrighteous <hi>Man his Thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and unto our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Isa. 55 7. So that where men live in known sins against God, and in a belief of its being impossible to be free from sin in this Life, the Prayer of such doth not proceed from the Spirit of God, who hath Commanded his People, not to touch, taste <hi>nor handle with any unclean thing, but to follow the</hi> leadings of Gods holy Spirit, as the Apostles have done for Example, and to mark them which walk otherwayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So every man and every woman is to seek God for themselves; for he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be found of them that seek, him in uprightness of heart; and I do not read that any of the Lords servants in dayes past, were ever lead by the spirit of God, to pray either privatly among People in unbelief of ever attaining that which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which proves, that they are not capable of being Disciples. And in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.14, 15, 16. where they bring Christs say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; which saying is explained in the following Verse, <hi>that whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child he shall not enter therein,</hi> can never reach by Visible Water, which cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the inside of these wise <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine learned Builders,</hi> who ground their unsound Foundation of Sprinkling Infants, in the room of Circumcision, which according to the holy Scriptures of Ttuth, one Tipe did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tipe out another, but every Tipe typified the substance, for Circumcision was a Tipe or Figure, and cutting off the fore-skin was a Figure of the Circumcision and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Fore-skin of the heart.

<pb n="72" facs="unknown:000730_0080_0FAA46766D20EAE0"/>
that is, to dip or sprinkle, according to the nature of the Climate where they live; but to prove their assertion by Scripture they cannot do, which without scripture Proof, they are willing to say something for what they hold, but in what form soever any by their Priests are baptized, there is no effect of their work doth appear, but like Priest like People, all pleading for <hi>A Body of Sin, while they remain in this Life</hi>; which doth manifest, that visible Water is of no effect, notwithstanding these hired Builders, bring Christs words to <hi>Nicodemus, John</hi> 3.5. <hi>that except</hi> a man be born again of Water and Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God. From which words some do infer, that Infant Baptism is of absolute Necessity to Salvation. Now Christ did then speak of that heavenly Water which did regenerate and make new; for through the Power of that Water the Heart came to be made clean, according to the Prophets Saying, <hi>Then will I sprinkle clean Water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your Filthiness,</hi> Ezek. 36.25 By which it is manifest, that visible Water cleanseth not the inside<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is to be cleansed through the washing of Regeneration; <hi>for it is not the washing away of the filth of the Flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 3 21. Now <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism was to decrease, and the Baptism of Christ to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; for Christ was before <hi>John,</hi> whose Baptism made way for the Baptism of Christ to take place; for this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <hi>John</hi> did bear of himself, <hi>That he should decrease, and that Christ should increase</hi>; for <hi>John</hi>'s baptizing was to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>but he that cometh after me shall baptize you with the holy Ghost, Mat.</hi> 3.11.

               <head>CHAP. XI. Concerning the true Sabbath, which signifies Rest, to them who abide in Christ, who is the everlasting Sabbath.</head>
               <p>MAny are the Talkers of the Sabbath, and of the first days Rest, but few are they that come so far in the Work of God, by Faith in Jesus Christ, as to witness their first days Work in him, who is the true and everlasting Sabbath, in whom the faithful have their resting place, they are them which are come to witness the end of their Labour, which have their rest in Christ, the true Sabbath. Now where People in their differing forms of Will Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship rest from their outward Labour one day in seven, calling that the Sabbath Day, thinking thereby that the Lord of Sabboth will accept their will Worship, with their rest from outward Labour, for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

forth more faithfull Labourers, or the Harvest is great, &amp; many unfaithfull Labourers there be,</hi> which hinder others from receiving the Truth, for they have sown divers strange seeds in the Lords Vineyard, where the many Pastors have trodden the Lords portion under foot, and have made his pleasant Portion a desolate Wilderness, which being desolate, it mourneth unto the Lord, for which cause the Lord hath sent his Servants, as in dayes past, to warn the learned wise rebellious Ones from the evil of their way, that People may find ease from under these heavy burdens, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now may it not thus be, that for a greater Evidence or Testimony, that the same thing did likewise happen in the Tree Paradise, <hi>i. e. Adams</hi> heart, as there is the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, which is the Seed, Speech, Council, Knowledge, Wisdom and Will of the Serpent; so there is also the Tree of Life, the Seed, Speech and Counsel of God, or of the Woman; and as God and the Devil are, even so are these two Seeds, or two Trees, so contrary the one to the other, that one brings Life, the other Death; and therefore it is impossible that whoso eats of the one, should at the same time eat of the other, or come unto it, as being seperated by a flying Chrub and a glittering Sword. Thus do I, and also other faithful Writers, interpret whinged Sin and obstinate Disobedience, which is else-where called in Scripture, <hi>a seperation or wall of partition</hi>; for whoso eats of the Tree of Knowledge of
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:000730_0235_0FAA45BF694863D0"/>
good and evil, that is he that greedily swallows down and devoureth humane and diabolical Wisdom, he is already seperated from the Tree of Life, that is, from the Wisdom, Speech and Knowledge of God; and neither of these Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Speeches, Wills or Knowledges can endure the other, neither can the one come from the other, so great is the Gulf between them, being as far divided asunder as Heaven and Hell. He that eats of the Tree of Life, that is, of the Word of God, he is born of God, and cannot dye nor sin, for his Fruit doth eat the Eaten, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late him into his own Nature, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into Life, as else-where the Scripture speaketh of <hi>eating Christs flesh</hi>; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is the same thing to eat Christ, and to drink his Blood, to live in his Word, to believe, to know God and the like; as likewise it is all one to believe in <hi>Adam,</hi> to live in <hi>Adam,</hi> to dye to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, to obey the Seed and Word of the Serpent, and to become Gods; therefore he that eats of the deadly Tree, and cleaves to the Word and Wisdom of the Serpent, being born of Satan, and afflicted, he lives in flesh and blood, and therefore cannot do well, or please God; as contrary wise, the other cannot sin, do evil, or displease God; Therefore he that will have the one, must needs part with the other, they must of necessity go out of the Wisdom of <hi>Adam</hi> and the Serpent, and from the forbidden Tree, that so the Wisdom of the Tree of Life may enter, to abide in them; <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Wisdom of the flesh must dye in them, that Christ may live in them, and the Spirit may have the government; the Life of the one is the Death of the other, and the weakness of one is the strength of the other; <hi>for no man can serve two Masters,</hi> and in vain shall men strive to reconcile <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> and

into the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> that the Serpents seed and word was in <hi>Adam,</hi> made a corporal man; so that now the same thing may be said of them both, and as they are, that are born of God, and in whom the Word of God is made man, or flesh, are called Gods, and one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with God, so all men being sprung of flesh and blood before they be planted into Christ, and are born of the Spirit, they are justly called Devils, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Children and Off-spring of the Devil, whose work they do, therefore that which is only humane, is evil, and that which is devilish, is humane. And again, what is the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> but the wisdom of the Flesh, and the fruit of the forbidden Tree? What is that old Dragon that came out of Hell, and drew down from Heaven with his Tail, a great part of the Stars of Heaven, but only the Wisdom of this Tree, which extolls it self against God, and places his seat with the higest? And what else are the Thoughts of the Flesh? What is sin? what is Arrogance, but the Fruits and Wisdom of this Tree?

How common is it for men to

worship Idols? and what is an Idol, but to worship the true God in a false way? and who is it that saith not to his own reason, knowledge, honesty, art and wisdom <hi>thou art my God?</hi> They do not thus say with their Mouthes, but their whole life, and their idolatrizing Mind saith as much, by their deeds, for they continually sacrifice to their own Drag? and here it is that mortal men deny God, and testifie it by their works, which are without faith, being dead, even as a body is without the spirit; for if by true faith they were alive to God, they would leave vengeance to him, and not so much seek to revenge themselves, which doth manifest they dare not trust God with their cause to avenge for them; if otherwise, why are they anctiously careful? why do they so exercise mischief and fraud, and so deceive one another? why do they make war and strife, right or wrong, for mine and thine? why do they so lye, deceive and flatter one another? why do they forget God and his saying, making no account of his Commandments? wherefore are they so covetously minded, to labour night and day, and to take every opportunity to improve every unrighteous advantage against their Neighbour, to get and heap up the perishing things of this Worlds Riches; truly all this is, because they retain not God in their Thoughts, to believe that he hath any care of them, or that he can provide or will revenge for them, therefore is it as their works do manifest, for them to believe, they must not be wanting in this and the other thing, but that it is most necessary to help and revenge for themselves, <hi>otherwise,</hi> say they, <hi>we might by our Enemies be all killed, or become Slaves and Bond men, and beg our Bread.</hi> And thus it is with them who will not have ought to do with good, and Truth in good earnest; no, they must not be wanting to themselves,

them, but with the wicked it shall go ill.</hi> Therefore study after Righteousness, and covet after the better part, against which, lust to covetousness, cannot prevail; for lust to covet after the Riches of this World, is as natural to the Children of men, as the ground is natural to bring forth Weeds; therefore is it, that men by nature, of their own wills, wisdoms, knowledges, reasons, righteousnesses, and the like, will not come under the cross, to hear and obey <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, to fulfil what the Law required of him to do; so also are they accursed which refuse to bear and obey the Voice of the Son of God, whose gift of divine light is the condemnation of every covetous mans thoughts, words and works; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

wise and prudent of this World, who, through coveting after Money, <hi>the love of which is the root of all evil, in them that will neither enter the Kingdom of Heaven, nor suffer others which are entering, to go therein</hi>; which doth manifest their Covetousness to exclude all love and fear to God, and all love and pity to their Neighbours good. Nay, what sin is it, that Covetousness leads men not to commit? it leadeth them that are covetous to oppress, cozen, deceive, lye, and sell their Conscience for every trifle; also, it leads men to turn from the Faith, betray the Truth, sell it for Money, and to hold the Truth in Unrighteousness; it leads men to forsake all good Religion, to turn Persecutors, which is the greatest Oppression that can be, for it sweeps away the Life and Estate of many men; it leads men to wait as Troops of Robbers, to kill and destroy by the consent of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Laws, which have been made by covetous Usurers. And I may say, Covetousness not only leads men to kill and steal by the high-way, but to rob God of his honour, by stealing his words which he spake by the mouth of his holy Ones, whose words they sell for Money, each looking for his gain from his Quarter, which if any man refuse to pay, open war is prepared against him; and of this, and the like nature doth Covetousness lead men to sin against God, even to the destroying of their peace with him; <hi>for to the Wicked there is no true peace in this life, nor in the Life to come. Covetousness</hi> is one of the chief gates and Inlets to the broad way of <hi>Death, Hell</hi> and <hi>Destruction,</hi> and is so delightful and well-pleasing, that many are led thereby into all manner of Abominations, even to rebel against God and King, and to change the form of Worship at every change in Government. In short, it leadeth Parents to destroy their Children, and Children to destroy their

Parents; also, it leadeth men to lye and swear, and to hold the the Truth in unrighteousness, and to pervert the truth, thereby to turn the cause of the Fatherless and Widdow. Therefore let all men beware of coveting after that which God hath forbidden; for while some have beên coveting after Riches, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows, because it is such a sin, that it draws the soul of him that is over much righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, into perdition; for over much righteous before men, is over much wicked in the sight of God, because its only mans own works, which is plain hypocrisie and deceit, and indeed so are all things which are not done by man in truth and sincerity, with uprightness of heart and mind to God, whose all-seeing eye beholdeth the evil and the good in all men whatever, among whom the heart of some that labour to be rich, is pierced through with many sorrows; for it is written, <hi>They that will be rich, fall into many Temptations, and a Snare, and many foolish and hurtful Lusts, which draw men into perdition</hi>; for lust to Covetousness, is such a subtil Enemy, and the Devils snare is so cunningly contrived, and so full of fair pretences, that let a man be once in love with Money, he knows not which way to wind himself out; for it doth so bewilder, fetter and entangle his mind, even to the destruction of his soul, and loss of body also, yet how vehemently with care and diligence, will men vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Covetousness, because that care and diligence there may be, and ought to be, but the truth is, every covetous man makes care and diligence a cloak for Covetousness, whereby he is sheltered against all reproof; in which state mans life among his Neighbours is not much desireable, neither by the Poor lamented at his Death, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the dividing of his Idol, to whom God hath not
