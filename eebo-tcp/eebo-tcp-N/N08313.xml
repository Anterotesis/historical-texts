            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following pathetic, and moving ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, were, as carefully as poſſible, taken down in characters, as they flow'd from the lips of the preacher to large and crowded au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences; at which were preſent numbers of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſuaſions: many of whom have requeſted copies of the tranſcript; and others have deſired, in the ſtrongeſt terms, that they might be made ſtill more public, by means of the preſs.</p>
            <p>THE writer is deſirous of obliging many, without offence to any individual.—The manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript hath been read and approved of, by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſuperior judgment, who were preſent; and who have join'd in this opinion, that from their being publiſh'd, good may proceed to the well diſpoſed; nor can any kind of harm be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen to accrue from hence.</p>
            <p>AND it is probable that the prejudices which ſome have conceived againſt the faith and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Quakers, (as a people ſeperated from the eſtabliſh'd church,) may be removed, from a diſpaſſionate peruſal of theſe diſcourſes, which is a reaſon, of itſelf ſufficient, for their being made public.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010615_0003_0F81B9B16DDE8208"/>THE writer is not conſcious of having miſtaken the author's ſenſe: And if to the memory of any who were then preſent, there ſhould occur any variations from his immediate expreſſions, the editor is aſſured there can be but few, and thoſe not of moment; he having to the readieſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, joined the moſt perfect attention, tho' in a crowded congregation (where he could have no other reſt, or ſupport, than the hand or the knee.)</p>
            <p>INDEED! the lively force and heart-felt energy with which the ſubſequent exhortations were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, muſt remain from that time wanting: nor is it material to offer, that it is not in the power of the moſt faithful tranſcriber, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey that enforcing part to his readers. The texts, i. e. chapter and verſe, have been ſince added, in order to illuſtrate the work, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it (if poſſible!) more pleaſing.</p>
            <p>THE editor hath likewiſe taken down (by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) two other Sermons, from the ſame preacher; the ſubject: of the firſt taken from the prayer of Augur, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxx. 7, 8, and 9. the other from <hi>Cant.</hi> iv. and 12, and at the cloſe of each, a Prayer; but thoſe will continue in manuſcript, unleſs a public edition of them be encouraged.</p>
            <p>AS the miniſter hath been repeatedly ſolicited, but in vain, to conſent to the preſent publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the reader muſt not wonder that his name is not publiſhed.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been in my mind to adopt the language or ſalutation of Joab to Amaſa; but with ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments different, far different, from thoſe which actuated the treachery of Joab; even thoſe of true and tender affection, and with a mind repleniſhed with that charity, which wiſheth well to all.</p>
            <q>Art thou in health; my brother?</q>
            <p>I COULD wiſh, with all poſſible ſolicitude, to lead every mind preſent, into the moſt careful enquiry, in reſpect to their ſpiritual ſtate of health; and to their immediate relation, and affinity, to that ſupreme almighty Being, who is the juſt and awful judge of quick and dead. I fear it hath proceeded from too anxious a ſolicitude for the health of your bodies, and proſperity of your temporal concerns, that too many of you have too frequently, and in a manner totally, neglected the great concern of your immortal ſouls; which is indeed <hi>the one thing needful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOSE temporal concerns, I ſay, which are of a trifling periſhing nature, have, I fear! interrupted and taken off from this principle concern: your anxiety and application towards the attainment of the treaſures and the enjoyment of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, have occaſioned too great a neglect of your religious duty.</p>
            <p>THE coveniencies of life are, by no means, a contemptible concern, where they are bounded with temperance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd within their proper channel: but as there is a part in us of infinitely greater, of no leſs than eternal moment; it alſo
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010615_0005_0F81B9B2EEF679E8"/>
requires an attention proportionable to its proper worth; for what are temporal concerns, when compared with the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant one of eternity!</p>
            <p>THE <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of the body is ſubject to divers maladies; and when we have done our utmoſt to preſerve it, we ſhall find in the end (and how ſoon that may be none knows) that it is of neceſſity ſubject to the ſtroke of death, and to the incloſure of the grave.</p>
            <p>I HAVE therefore thought it by no means an improper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry for each individual to make, and deeply ponder, What is thy ſtate, or how is it with thee, O my ſoul! who art capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of partaking of immortal joys, and deſtin'd to triumph over death and the grave? <hi>When this earthly, tabernacle ſhall be diſſolv'd,</hi> thy appointment and deſtination, if in proper ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for it, ſhall be made perfect with the whole family of GOD, and be no longer ſubject to the diſeaſes, pains, trials and afflictions of this life, but ſhare the things which are of GOD, <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 23.—</note> 
               <hi>With the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS this is of the moſt infinite importance to the ſons of men, I have thought it my particular duty, upon the preſent occaſion, to put you in mind of the neceſſary enquiry into the ſtate of your ſpiritual health; the conditon of your immortal ſouls: being very apprehenſive that all of you, my brethren, are not in perfect health, who have outwardly the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of health; but that, on the contrary, many are in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtate of diſeaſe and ſtupefaction; have only preſerved a lethargic frame, and are tottering upon the brink of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>THIS enquiry into the preſent ſtate of experience and of advancement in the work of ſalvation, hath branched itſelf out in my view, and divided into ſeveral claſſes, thoſe who are now within the audience of my voice. And, in the firſt place, I intreat the attention of you, the elders, amongſt whom our LORD, as amongſt ſo many ſhepherds, hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided his flock; over whom you are appointed to watch, and and to teach them to perſevere in the path which leadeth to eternal life!</p>

            <p>IF thoſe that have been called with an high and holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as delegated ſhepherds under the one great ſhepherd, walk uprightly in his fear and to his glory; then the ſheep will with them be more likely to be gained upon to follow the great ſhepherd; they will then have a frequent deſire, a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appetite after the divine Manna, which cometh down from GOD out of Heaven: for every life hath its food and its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nutriment; and a ſoul panting after Heaven can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with nothing ſhort of the <hi>food</hi> from Heaven.</p>
            <p>IN the next place, I addreſs <hi>you,</hi> my brethren in the work of the miniſtry, reminding you of its divine inſtitution, all that have enter'd rightly into it <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WE ought to be endued with the ſpirit of wiſdom, of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with ſound minds, which he hath promiſed to them that ask this bleſſing from him, and hath made good his promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Are you in health, my brethren?</hi> are you ſtrongly attached to the promotion and exhaltation of that glorious cauſe which you have embarked in? have each of you a ſhare in and a proper care of the LORD's work? do you watch over the flock attending on your miniſtry, under the great ſhepherd, and with the tenderneſs of goſpel love, <hi>ſeeking to ſave that which was loſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I FREELY confeſs my own ſears, that I am not in a ſtate of perfect health and ſound mind; labouring as I ought in the work of the LORD. As it is a task of the utmoſt importance, I ought to remain ever diffident of my own care, and to watch daily in the diſcharge of a truſt ſo great and important as that of the recovery and preſervation <hi>of the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE proſtration of the ſoul before the GOD and Father of mercies, in a cauſe of ſuch infinite concern, is a continual duty, which can ſcarce ever be ſufficiently diſcharged. The ſecret cry of my ſoul has, after this manner, frequently ariſen,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010615_0008_0F81B9B85B251CA8"/>
"LORD! ſpare thy people and bleſs thine heritage." I am fully perſuaded, my friends, were all the miniſters and elders more bleſſed with ſound health, the minds of the flock would be more fill'd with brotherly kindneſs, and more and more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to that ſtate which I have mentioned, they would know what is meant by the <hi>angels being ſpirits,</hi> and how to underſtand his <hi>miniſters being a flame of fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I COME now to another claſs, whom I mean to addreſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of thoſe within the audience of my voice, who continue in a ſingle ſtate.</p>

               <hi>Are you in health; my brethren and ſiſters?</hi> are you poſſeſt of inward virtue, and of ability to live to GOD, as becometh his ſaints; and which alone will lead you to eternal life; do you aſpire after theſe, with an unabated zeal?</p>
            <p>YOU muſt not expect always to reſt ſatisfied with the good things of this life. The day may come when you will loath the abundance of your temporal poſſeſſions: you will then be concerned that you have ſo indulgently <note n="*" place="bottom">Haggai i. 4<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>RECOLLECT yourſelves in the ſpring time of life; conſider early the importance of this exchange, while you have it in your power to make it Look up to an object more glorious than the preſent world can afford you, even the joys of that eternal inheritance, which <hi>the children of the firſt-born, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of happy ſpirits, the general aſſembly of juſt men already made perfect,</hi> are repleniſhed with.—Pleaſures unſpeakable! that exiſt for evermore!</p>

               <hi>Art thou in health; my brother?</hi>—my dear brethren, are ye fervently engaged in labouring, neceſſary labouring, for the promotion of the cauſe of GOD upon earth?</p>
            <p>O YE parents and heads of families, who are placed as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated ſhepherds over them; timely beware, leſt the blood of your children, or of any part of your charge, fall on your heads: (if through your miſconduct they become corrupted, and their ſouls periſh.)

            <p>THESE precious gifts which he hath given, as pledges of his love, are to be led and inſtructed by them with a proper authority.</p>
            <p>IF the parents experimentally felt the advantages of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual health in themſelves, then would they be concerned that the tender minds of their children ſhould be properly cultivated with the knowledge of the LORD, and a fearful apprehenſion of tranſgreſſing his ſupreme commands. They would teach them to look further than mere temporal acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; even to GOD their Creator. They would bring them up in the nurture and fear of the LORD; in order that their minds might be fill'd from the ſtore-houſe and magazine of boundleſs good, and early enriched with the joys of GOD's ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and <hi>this</hi> would naturally diffuſe the greateſt ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the parents themſelves, to ſee their children become the delight and ornaments of human nature, and fitted for a glorious change! <hi>the company of Angels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> The ties of nature, and the ſtronger ties of gratitude to him who gave the bleſſing, call aloud for teaching the tender minds of your children, to walk in the ſafe and delightful paths of virtue. With what ſatisfaction and compoſure of mind will ſuch parents be enabled to anſwer the great GOD, upon his awful examination to this purpoſe;

Then the ſupreme judge will ſet at his right hand ſuch parents, and they ſhall be united to him in glory.</p>

blood thro' the various ranks, whether miniſters, elders, heads of families, even throughout the various claſſes of mankind.</p>
            <p>I WISH all parents and heads of families would continually walk, hand in hand with their children and families, in the path which leadeth to life eternal; daily watching over, and improving their riſing judgments, with the wiſdom which cometh from above; inſtructing and encouraging them in the contemplation of divine things! perſuading them to believe, as the truth is, that the things of this world are all uncertain, and fading away; that they have everlaſting manſions erected for them in the city of their GOD; where (if they fall not ſhort, or turn not aſide (they will enjoy the company of ſaints and angels for ever more.</p>
            <q>Are you in health; my brethren and ſiſters?</q>
            <p>EXERCISE yourſelves in this your preſent ſtate, differently from thoſe, whoſe faculties are bounded within the narrow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of this world; cultivate, continually cultivate, the minds of your offspring: endeavouring to raiſe in them a proper comprehenſion of the dignity of their natures, and to fix in them early a ſteady belief of their <hi>immortality;</hi> which is of the utmoſt importance to all!</p>
            <p>THE hearts of thoſe are unſound, who live in a perpetual attachment to the pride of life, who are contaminated with the love of the world, wherein their chief happineſs appears to be placed: how can ſuch point out the way to the city of GOD? how can they ſay to their children,
<q>Let us retreat from the world, from this ſcene of corruption: let us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the cares, the ſolicitudes of life: let us aſcend to our appointed home: let us contemplate the joys of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: let nothing ſeparate us from that bleſſed hope</q>
            </p>
            <p>HOW can parents thus addreſs their children, when they have, perhaps, for a long courſe of years, ceaſed to conſider the awful importance of the ſubject; and their own minds continue fixed, and tyed down to the fading enjoyments of life Alas! that the folly and vanity of the ſuperfluous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world ſhould ſo entirely engage and engroſs the attention of any one immortal individual, as to take up almoſt every moment of their precious time!</p>
            <p>HENCE, ſometimes, parents, inſtead of inſtructing the minds of their children, have ſo totally corrupted their own
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010615_0011_0F81B9BA54C2C608"/>
that they have laid obſtructions in the way to the immortal happineſs of their offspring, and, when their children have for a time trod in the ways of religion and virtue, they have been ſo extremely corrupt themſelves, as to oppoſe them in their paſſage; to obſtruct them, with violence, in their way to glory; and thereby aggravated their own guilt beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; alas! what will their puniſhment prove, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of ſo great a neglect and violation of their duty? when he that is the judge of quick and dead ſhall appear in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to render to every man according to his works! May all parents, who are negligent in the diſcharge of their duties, lay it ſeriouſly to heart.</p>
            <p>IN the mean time, may you, my brethren and ſiſters in a ſpiritual relation, continue in a ſtate of lively active health— labouring in the ſure ground of hope; that, <hi>when the great ſhepherd himſelf ſhall appear, you may alſo appear with him in glory.</hi> If you ſo perſiſt, I cannot but yet hope, that your ſtedfaſt continuance will prove the means of ſpreading ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual health, in an eminent degree. For as, on the one hand, minds infected and vitiated <hi>with the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, or the pride of life,</hi> are very apt to ſpread the contagion to all that are round about them: ſo, on the other hand, ſuch as are reſtored by CHRIST, to a ſtate of ſpiritual health, and by him ſteadily preſerved in it, often become inſtrumental in his hand, to diffuſe that bleſſing; from whence, healthy parents have been frequently obſerved to have healthy children.</p>
            <p>I AM convinced that the LORD is at work amongſt the riſing generation; many of whom ſtand convicted in their own minds, of the want of ſpiritual health; and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring the mercy of the GOD of their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>IN order to your attaining it, let me call upon you again, the preſent riſing generation; whoſe ſtations in life may be likely to have ſome little continuance; be ever ſtedfaſt in the performance of your religious duties, that you may become heirs of the kingdom; and have your portion, with the children of GOD.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems to me of the greateſt importance, in relation to the various affairs of life, to form aright the minds of youth; and therefore, I once more entreat every parent preſent, that

you watch over, and carefully nouriſh every ſeed of virtue ſpringing up in the minds of your children, for the ſake of their, and your own, temporal welfare; as well as for the hope and aſſurance of both their, and your own, eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>AND here, let me claſs every ſingle individual; as every ſingle individual is poſting on his way to an eternal ſtate of exiſtence—and that they may be guided by an infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is my earneſt deſire; and be at laſt received into glory! welcom'd thither by their dear redeemer!</p>
            <p>IN this city he hath laid his hand upon one, and upon another.

            <p>WE follow not formally; but we believe in, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, fully convinced, of the doctrines of the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the incarnation, glory, life, death, mighty miracles, and various circumſtances, relative to the holy life of JESUS, <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. liii. 7.—</note>

            <p>WE admire, with humble hearts and minds, the awful tranſactions of that time, when ſweat, like drops of blood, ran from the face of the holy JESUS! when, being in an agony, he pray'd more earneſtly! when he was betray'd, his ſacred head crown'd with thorns! his face ſpit upon! he was moſt ignominiouſly treated, and <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. xi. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>BY virtue of that holy ſacrifice the remiſſion of ſins is gained; the awakening power of that ſentence which is due to ſin is felt in a ſtate of alienation from GOD; and as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if one <hi>died for all, then were all dead;</hi> ſo, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he who was crucified, dead, and buried, likewiſe triumph'd over the grave, and now <hi>ſitteth at the right hand of God,</hi> in a glorified body, to make interceſſion for man, in order that he might effectually purchaſe, and redeem to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a people to the praiſe of his name; and diffuſe, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his univerſal empire, a ſimilarity of opinion and nature, ariſing from the experience of his univerſal redeeming love.</p>
            <p>I AM no Arian, far from it:—I believe in the clear emphatic teſtimonies laid down in holy writ, that CHRIST was more than a prophet. I repeat my belief, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, died, aſcended, and is now come <note n="¶" place="bottom">Heb ix. 28.</note>

Thou haſt followed us in the day of our revolting; and, when we were ſtraying in the wilderneſs, as a moſt gracious and tender ſhepherd Thou didſt lay thy hand on us, not only with judgment, but with mercy; and haſt brought us home again unto thy flock, and thy fold, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us our multiplied tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p>OUR deviations from thy holy path have not been puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inexorable juſtice; but thy conduct toward us has been cloathed with unſpeakable compaſſion. O! Thou ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſhepherd, and biſhop of our ſouls: who haſt looked

upon us, when weltering as in our blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by thy divine power haſt healed us. Thou, that art the phyſician of our ſouls, haſt cared for us, when <hi>the prieſt and the levite</hi> paſt us by.—When caſt out and ſurrounded with the woes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable diſtreſs; when thick clouds covered us,—Thou, in thy abundant love <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xviii. 9</note> 
               <hi>bowed the heavens and came down</hi> to our help, <hi>and all the darkneſs was put under thy Feet!</hi> Thou haſt made the <hi>clouds thy chariot,</hi> and walked <hi>upon the wings of wind,</hi> for our deliverance; when our iniquities, like floods, roſe high, and appeared unto us like to ſwallow us up in everlaſting confuſion! O! adorable condeſcenſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We have no language to expreſs thy mercy, and the boundleſs obligations we lie under to thy Majeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who haſt thus, in the times of unſpeakable anxiety, vouchſafed to appear for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and even when we have wandered from the counſel of thy will and trod in the path of the wicked, <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xliii. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſenteſt forth thy light and thy truth, and didſt lead us back to thy holy hill!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE acknowledge all theſe bleſſings to thy praiſe, O! ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of <hi>Iſrael!</hi> who <hi>ſleepeſt not by day,</hi> nor <hi>ſlumbereſt by night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO Thee we owe all our faculties, and all that is within us; and let them all, we pray Thee, be conſecrated to thy honour: we beſeech that all our ſteps may be directed to Thee; and more and more to thy ſervice. For, Father of infinite kindneſs it hath pleaſed Thee to rank us among thy children; and to make <hi>our dwelling with thy light; our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation with the lifting up of the ſmiles of thy countenance;</hi> and to remove every obſtacle to a perfect communion with Thee: the po<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>BLOT out all our tranſgreſſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forgive us freely, for thy dear Son's ſake! remember us in the midſt of thy mercy! de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, we pray Thee, as Thou haſt graciouſly hitherto done, like a tender Father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:010615_0027_0F81B9C99D9B0A60"/>GRANT we may never forget thy counſel; ſooner cut the thread of our lives, and number us to the ſilent grave!</p>
            <p>MAY we follow Thee, with our whole hearts, ſubmit to the patient reſignation of our all, for thy dear ſervice; and keep us to a happy concluſion in thy favour! it is all we ask, and beg at thy hand: with regard to outward circumſtances, thy will be done! we have no other ſupplication to offer.</p>
            <p>PRESERVE us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in the hollow of thy hand; that from a militant ſtate here, we may paſs to a triumphant one, in thy everlaſting kingdom!</p>
            <p>O LORD! have mercy on thy people, and thy children, when they ſpread their hands towards thy holy habitation. Cloath them with the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to ſly to Thee, their only rock and refuge; and to thy name, that is an impregnable defence; where the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, in all ages, have ever found ſafety!</p>
            <p>REGARD thoſe who are far off, and remain unacquainted with thy name. We pray Thee, let the ſame mercy ſpread to <hi>them</hi> which thou haſt ſhewed unto <hi>us.</hi> Let the diffuſion of thy ſpiritual bleſſings, in and through thy dear Son, flow among them, that they may ſeek Thee; that a holy anxiety of mind may take place, in order to reſt in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that when the various trials and troubles of time are over, they having, through thy abundant goodneſs and ſure ſupport, <hi>fought the good fight, and kept the faith,</hi> may be received by Thee, and be crownd with glory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, in thy everlaſting kingdom!</p>
            <p>Oh Thou that art fairer than the ſons of men! grace flows from thy lips; Thou beholdeſt us when tempted, and ſpeaks to our ſtates with all the language of tenderneſs. Father of mercy! grant that innumerable multitudes may reſort to thy temple, that ſacred houſe, which thou haſt erected to thy honour and ſervice. May the poor, the ſick, and the maimed, the blind, and the naked, inſpired by Thee with holy confidence, look towards <hi>Sion,</hi> and be cloathed by Thee, with the wedding garment; with the righteouſneſs of their dear SAVIOUR!</p>
            <p>THUS, gracious GOD! we are divinely encouraged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate thy name, on the behalf of the church militant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſcattered; that it may flouriſh in peace and ſtability;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010615_0028_0F81B9CA45044188"/>
that, not only in part, but in the whole luſtre of meridian brightneſs and ſplendor, they may commemorate thy glory!</p>
            <p>IN an humble ſenſe of thy mercy and goodneſs to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of thy hands, we thank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thee, that Thou haſt been pleaſed ſo abundantly to manifeſt thy loving kindneſs and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in and amongſt us.</p>
            <p>WE proſtrate ourſelves before the throne of thy Majeſty and grace! we would offer to Thee an humble, grateful ſacrifice of thankſgiving and praiſe, dominion, and every excellent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute! for we know that we have nothing but from thy bounty, who art the rock of our ſalvation!</p>
            <p>TO Thee, Father of infinite mercy! for the multitude of thy mercies, in JESUS CHRIST our LORD!—To Thee, the author of every bleſſing! with the Son of thy boſom; our LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, the Lamb immaculate thro' the eternal ſpirit, be all praiſe aſcribed, now, henceforth, and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
