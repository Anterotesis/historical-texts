         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WAS it then reſerved for a ſtranger to your perſons, and your altars, to addreſs you on this happy reſtoration of your public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? this ſolemn re-eſtabliſhment of your religious aſſemblies? Was it to have been the good fortune of one, to whom you were unknown, but by your ſufferings, to be among the firſt of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, to bring the comfort and conſolation of his word to an afflicted and perſecuted people? to tell them, that he has not forgotten his "loving kindneſſes of old;" that however he ſeemed reſolved to "chaſten them in his diſpleaſure; to caſt off his altar and abhor his ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary; to cauſe the ſolemn feaſts and ſabbaths to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,"
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:043110_0002_101CCC1A1152C0E0"/>
and, "in the indignation of his wrath, to eject the King and the Prieſt;" that however he ſuffers "their city to be left deſolate and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, and every houſe ſhut up, ſo that no man may come in: yet that he will "return again in his mercy, in his appointed time, to have compaſſion upon his afflicted, to comfort his oppreſſed," and to "bring them again every man to his heritage, and every man to his land; to ſay to the priſoners, Go forth, and to them that are in darkneſs, Shew yourſelves; to reſtore their Princes as at the firſt, and their counſellers as at the beginning, and again to give them prieſts according to his heart?" Let it be my firſt care to bleſs his holy name, for having permitted me to join with your retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning clergy in the diſcharge of this pleaſing office. They alſo will add their praiſes to mine. You, my brethren, will not be wanting in gratitude and thankfulneſs to the God of your redemption, and the united voice of prieſts and people will be—"it is good that a man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait, for the ſalvation of the Lord." His ways are inſcrutable, but his goodneſs certain. and without bounds.</p>
            <p>Who that was witneſs of the cruel and diſaſtrous deed of the night before laſt, could promiſe himſelf, that you ſhould be aſſembled this day in the houſe of God, to praiſe him for your wonderful deliverance? Who could have hoped that this temple would remain a monument of the returning favour of heaven, amidſt the horror of the ruins through which you muſt have paſſed to approach it? Which of you could have ſaid to himſelf, that he ſhould ſee theſe doors opened once more for the reception of the faithful, "though as yet but as the ſhaking of an olive tree, and the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done?" Or hear theſe walls, ſo long ſilent and unfrequented, filled again with the praiſes of Him, to whoſe name you had raiſed them? Is not this the Lord's doing? Is not this our God for "whom we have waited? We have waited for him, he hath ſaved us, and we will be glad and rejoice in his ſalvation."</p>
            <p>Suffer me, however, to check for a moment the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:043110_0003_101CABFD169BC010"/>
which theſe different ſenſations of joy and grief, ſo rapidily ſucceeding each other within theſe few days paſt, muſt naturally have raiſed in your breaſts. When the heart, long oppreſſed, and cloſed in affliction, is ſuddenly opened to the impreſſions of joy, only to be overwhelmed as ſuddenly with an additional weight of ſorrow and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may, the tumult within, muſt be too violent to leave much room for calm and uſeful reflections. It ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be my buſineſs to endeavour to ſuggeſt ſuch thoughts as appear ſuitable to this extraordinary occaſion, and to regulate your preſent affections, in a manner that beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the diſciples of Chriſt. This has never been, and I am confident never will be, the pulpit of contention or ſtrife. No "prophets, propheſying lyes in the name of the Lord who ſent them not," ſhall ever turn it into a ſtage for ſedition. The words of truth and life will never be perverted here in promoting violence and bloodſhead, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of conſulting the intereſts of the God of peace to cauſe the religion of the lowly, mild, and meek Jeſus, to ſpeak the language of ambition, ſlaughter and revenge or to conſecrate and deliver out in his name the ſword that is to be plunged by his followers into each others breaſt. Thanks be to the Lord "we have not ſo learned Chriſt." We will neither abuſe his mercy and long forbearance our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by thus daring to proſtitute his awful name; nor ſhall we preſume to deal out the bolts of his vengeance againſt others, whom his juſtice may arraign as guilty of ſuch a profanation. I therefore repeat it again, our only buſineſs will be to ſuggeſt ſuch reflections as ſhould engage the minds of Chriſtians on this occaſion; to exhort you to turn your thoughts to yourſelves; to conſider the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that has been wrought in your favour, and the diſpoſition with which you ſhould receive theſe inſtances of the divine mercies.</p>
            <p>The firſt conſideration that ariſes from the ſubject is the grateful ſenſe you ſhould entertain of the goodneſs of God.</p>
            <p>The immediate impreſſions of gratitude for preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are ſtrong, lively and affecting. We feel them with warmth; we expreſs them with rapture. But it happens
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:043110_0004_101CCC1B9B7C1E18"/>
too frequently that we enjoy them with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> difference, and by degrees totally forget the gracious <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that conferred them. While we are in danger, and fear is upon us, we "call upon the name of the Lord:" Our ſins and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions affect us in their conſequences; and our future obedience, fidelity, and gratitude, are fervently pledged in the hopes of immediate protection and relief. But when the firſt ſenſe of our delivery is paſt, when our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are ſuppreſſed, and danger removed, we are too apt to forget the reſolutions we formed in the hour of diſtreſs; our former paſſions and evil habits too frequently return with our former ſecurity. The God of our ſalvation is forgotten, and repaid with ingratitude, neglect and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>The conduct of individuals is generally ſpeaking, the conduct of the community. Ingratitude for favours, though a diſgrace to our nature, is but too common in the private intercourſes of life; nor are the inſtances leſs frequent of the ungrateful returns which nations have made for public benefits conferred upon them. The odious vice in either caſe receives its agravation in proportion to the mercies we have experienced, the favours we have been bleſſed with, and the character of our benefactor: but ſhould it extend to that beneficent power in whom we move, and have our being, and rob him of the return he challenges from his creatures for his boundleſs mercy and love, it then aſſumes its moſt deformed ſhape: it then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its utmoſt weight and accumulation of guilt.</p>
            <p>All that is ſacred or dear upon earth—your religion, your civil rights and liberties, the enjoyment of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, the freedom of your perſons, the worſhip of your God, the comfort of the ſacraments, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and exhortation of your Miniſters—all that you poſſeſſed, and gloried in as Britiſh ſubjects and as Chriſtians, wreſted from you by violence and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, while "the ſhepherds were ſmitten and the ſheep of the flock ſcattered abroad"—all theſe bleſſings, valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſurely, if there be any ſo on this ſide the grave, and the dearer to you now for having been ſo cruelly deprived
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:043110_0005_101CCBE868162560"/>
of them, hath your God begun to reſtore to you in this your day; and with his ſtreched-out arm, in a manner viſible to every eye, brought you back to a proſpect of happier days, and placed you again under the protecting care of the antient guardians of your religion and liberty. And can it be poſſible that you ſhould ever ſuffer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the divine mercies, thus extended to you, to be blotted out from your minds? It were doing wrong to thoſe who have ſuffered with the fortitude and perſeverance, the loyalty and attachment to their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, which have diſtinguiſhed the friends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in this colony, even to ſuppoſe it. And I ſhould hope that they who have endured ſo long and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a trial, rather than renounce their loyalty, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principles on which that loyalty is chiefly founded, will never hereafter be guilty of any action, or purſue any conduct, that can diſgrace them as good ſubjects, or as virtuous Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But while I thus exhort you to preſerve in your grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgements, to the God of your redemption, let me not neglect a point of equal importance to you, equally acceptable to him. The uſe, which in his gracious providence he deſigns we ſhould make of the miſconduct of others, or of the puniſhments which our ſins may have brought on our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is frequently pointed out in the ſcriptures. His vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations he ſets up as marks to caution us againſt the rocks and ſhelves on which folly and vice have already cauſed ſo many to be wrecked! and wilfully to run upon them is to flight the divine mercy—is an aggravation of all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer guilt, and juſtly expoſes us to ſtill more ſevere effects of the wrath of heaven. The Pſalmiſt, enumerating the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calamities inflicted on the Iſraelites for their incredulity and diſobedience, mentions, as a ſource of additional miſeries to this ſtiff-necked people, that they neglected to profit by their own fatal experience, or the dreadful examples they daily ſaw before their eyes, of the Lord's indignation. They refuſed to humble themſelves beneath the divine chaſtiſement, but continued to provoke their deliverer by freſh proofs of ingratitude. "The wrath of God came
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:043110_0006_101CCC1E8156AAA8"/>
upon them, and ſmote down the choſen man of Iſrael; for all this they ſinned ſtill—therefore their days did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in vanity, and their years in troubles." Entering into theſe views, my brethren, conſider with me the ſteps that have led your country into its preſent calamities— you will be the better enabled to check them in future, at leaſt to decline and avoid them yourſelves. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of others will teach you a leſſon of prudence and moderation to regulate your own conduct.</p>
            <p>"My ſon, fear thou the Lord and the King, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with them that are given to change"—was the excellent rule laid down by the wiſeſt of men. Againſt thoſe who tranſgreſs it, he denounces a ſudden and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable deſtruction. Whatever they may promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, however they may ſeem to proſper for a time, ruin infallible ruin, awaits them when leaſt they expect it; nor is it poſſible to foreſee the miſeries they may entail on themſelves and their deſcendants—"their calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?" The words are remarkable, but they are dictated by wiſdom and ſupported by experience. It has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened from your former proſperous ſtate, and the preſent calamities of this province, from which you happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to reſpire, that no nation upon earth can form a better judgement upon this important queſtion than yourſelves; and I have before me, in this aſſembly, a living example to which alone I need refer.</p>
            <p>Call then to mind the happy and proſperous days this colony enjoyed, when loyalty to your Sovereign, affection for the conſtitution of your parent ſtate, and obedience to the laws you enjoyed under its protection, diſtinguiſhed it above all the other provinces of America. Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was then an object of envy to nations corrupted by the refinements of luxury. Peace was in your dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, plenty in your ſtreets—induſtry diffuſed her bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings through your field with an increaſing profuſion, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving life to all the uſeful arts, and nurturing them daily into maturity and perfection. The produce of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try flowed from your port in a conſtant, uninterrupted
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:043110_0007_101CCBEC4B517218"/>
ſtream, and you received in return the conveniences and comforts of life, and all the elegances which a free and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive commerce can beſtow on a prudent and contented people. A friendly, hoſpitable, and ſocial intercourſe united you together as the members of one family, to the admiration and delight of ſtrangers who reſided among you; you were bleſſed beyond the uſual lot of men; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, completely ſo, did you but know how to value your happineſs, and to preſerve it!</p>
            <p>How different the ſcene to which I muſt call off your attention! what a change of proſpect will the reverſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit! where ſhall we ſeek for that treaſure of happineſs which you could boaſt, when every man ſat under his own vine, and eat his bread with chearfulneſs? Alas! is it not waſted all, and conſumed in viſionary ſchemes, empty and fanciful as the dreams of the morning? Is it not ſquander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away in lawleſs and ungrateful attempts, repugnant to every principle divine and human? in purſuits which plain ſenſe and reaſon condemn, and at which even the impulſes of nature muſt recoil? Peace, frightened from the ſeats where once ſhe loved to dwell, long ſince took her flight from among you. Diſſentions, party rage, public enmities, and private animoſities, uſurped her place, and brought with them a horrid train of mutual fears, diſtruſts, and endleſs jealouſies. By theſe were the confidence and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all ſocial intercourſe deſtroyed; by theſe were the bands of love and friendſhip torn aſunder; by theſe were even the ties of conſanguinity and nature diſſolved. Self-intereſt, ſelf-preſervation, the welfare of poſterity, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ingrafted in the human mind by the beneficient crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, were all confounded and loſt in this dark and diſmal night of confuſion, anarchy, and licentiouſneſs. See in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry perverted from its uſeful purpoſes, and employed in improving the arts of deſtruction. Your plough-ſhares it turned into ſwords, and your pruning-hooks into ſpears, the reverſe of the bleſſing pronounced by Iſaiah. See your fields, once cultivated, the gardens of America, laid waſte, and turned into licentious encampments, and the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſcenes of war; ſee your commerce, your envied com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:043110_0008_101CCC21A18AA3B0"/>
deſtroyed, your property ſeized and diſſipated in ſupport of the cauſe you abhorred—your liberties deſpiſed and troden under foot, and an armed multitude inſulting over your miſeries, turned looſe upon your poſſeſſions, and rioting in your ſubſtance. In vain you looked up to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for ſupport; her ſeats were overthrown, and trampled in the duſt; her rulers diſperſed, and the people abondon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every wild impulſe of humour and paſſion, without laws, without magiſtrates, without form of government. In ſhort, too well might we apply to you the words of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah: "If you went forth into the fields, behold the ſlain with the ſword; if you entered into the city, behold ſhe that was full of inhabitants, and princeſs among the provinces; ſitting ſolitary, and become as a diſconſolate, childleſs widow. Both the prophet and the prieſt went about in a land they knew not! your friends dealt treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly with you, and become your enemies, while you were gone into captivity, becauſe of affliction, and becauſe of great ſervitude."</p>
            <p>To what cauſes are we to attribute this deplore change? Whence is it that you can ſay to yourſelves, ſuch was the happineſs we once could boaſt; ſuch the melancholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe we have experienced! I have heard ſome attribute it to the imperfection of human nature, incapable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying a durable ſtate of proſperity, and often times moſt diſcontended, when bleſſed with the greateſt cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. But I ſhall ſearch for it among the ſources of the decay and fall of all nations, which the ſcriptures of God point out to me. Warrented by theſe, I ſhall not heſitate to aſſert, that if this province had continued "to fear the Lord, and the King, and had not meddled with thoſe who are given to change," the tempeſt would have ſpent its rage at a diſtance from you, and peace, induſtry, and happineſs, would ſtill have bleſſed your dwellings, as they did of old. You, indeed, my friends, ſeem to have been well convinced of this truth. The ſtruggle you maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was vigorous, and for ſome time ſucceſsful—but all were not animated with your ſpirit. The love of novelty or what ever other cauſes the powers of darkneſs beſt can
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:043110_0009_101CCBEDEE113680"/>
tell—for it is impoſſible to account for ſuch folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on any known principles—ſeduced too many from their allegiance to their ſovereign, and their former happy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Britiſh conſtitution, and theſe antient bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers being once removed, all the diſorders that have well nigh overthrown your country, broke in upon you, and the depreſſion of your religion, for the time, followed of courſe. So true it is, that when reſtleſſneſs and diſcontent once poſſeſs the mind, it is impoſſible to foreſee to what extremes a rage for innovation, and a paſſion for change will tranſport their votaries. They are like the "un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit" mentioned in the Goſpel, always on the wing, <hi>ſeeking</hi> a place of reſt, but "never finding it." Exceſſes, at which men would have ſhuddered at their firſt ſetting out, "ſwept clean," and placed in a deluſive point of view by faction and party, loſe their deformity, and daily make way for other exceſſes ſtill more criminal, ſtill more enormous. Theſe diſſatisfied "ſpirits take to themſelves other ſpirits more wicked than themſelves, and the laſt ſtate of theſe men becomes worſe than the firſt." I need not make the application—It is but too manifeſt you have already done it for me.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid that when too many of this province ſuffered themſelves to be ſeduced from their allegiance to their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and their former happy attachment to the Britiſh conſtitution, the depreſſion of your religion followed of courſe. Let me not be miſunderſtood—I mean not to engage in an invidious point of controverſy, which has often been carried to ſuch fatal lengths. Religious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes obtrude themſelves too frequently into ſubjects of more political concern, and ſerve no other end than to widen diviſions, and encreaſe animoſities, which the holy ſyſtem, the intereſts of which they would ſeem to ſupport, would wiſh to allay for ever. Warmed with zeal for their particular tenets, however uneſſentially differing from each other, the paſſions of the diſputants work themſelves into the controverſy, and we are apt to aſcribe their raſh and intemperate dictates to that ſyſtem, the defence of which
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:043110_0010_101CCC24B04D4F88"/>
they have embraced. There is alſo another prejudice which is apt to lead us aſtray in this important matter. As in the different forms of government, at preſent eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout the Chriſtian world, religion is fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally connected with their civil and political inſtitutes; we generally conſider them as going hand in hand, and charge the creed of each particular ſect with the political errors and diſorders of its profeſſors. A church there is, indeed, whoſe principles have been proved by fatal experience to be ſo eſſentially inconſiſtent with every notion of vice and rational government, ſo infallibly introductive of a double ſlavery, forging chains both for the body and mind, that it has been deſervedly branded with this foul imputation, and juſtly abhorred by nations jealous of their liberties. But that among Proteſtant churches, ſuch a charge ſhould be urged and retorted by each other with ſo much viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and animoſity, hath long been a cauſe of grief to every well-wiſher of the reformed religion, and a great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of triumph to their common enemies, both at home and abroad. Let me not attempt to enlarge the breach or be guilty of an error, which I condemn in others. I ſhall only obſerve, that in every age, in every ſtate, there are men of depraved hearts, who put on religion as a cloak to cover their ſiniſter views; or uſe it as a political tool to work upon the minds of the weak and uninſtructed, and all whoſe zeal without knowledge renders them an eaſy prey to the art of ſeducers. Theſe, like the lame and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at the pool of Betheſda, watch the troubling of the waters, that they may be the firſt to take advantage of the public commotions, and on the ruins of the peace and happineſs of their country, pave the way to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement: Men, who declaim againſt every power but that which they have themſelves uſurped; to whom the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the public good, and the intereſts of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is as eaſy as that of religion; and who aſſume both in common with every reſtleſs male content, who in every age, under every government, has deſtroyed the peace of the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>From what cauſe your ſufferings may have originated,

this is not the time, nor the place, to conſider. Too cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that they have now riſen to ſuch a height of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, as needs no words to repreſent to you—you feel it beyond the energy of words. The ſmart of recent wrongs and former injuries, ſpeak a language which thoſe who ſympathize with you in your ſufferings, can never adopt. Whatever the principles of your perſecutors may be, their unrelenting malice is but too notorious; and they have added to all their former exceſſes, a deed of atrociouſneſs which muſt open the eyes of the moſt infatuated, muſt totally alienate even the ſmall numbers, who may have hitherto been deluded into ſome favourable opinion of their cauſe. To what a ſcene were you witneſs the night before laſt! when juſt eſcaped from the ſtorm, and imagining your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves arrived at a port of reſt; labouring to collect toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſmall remains of your fortune that had eſcaped the general wreck; meeting once more and embracing, after ſo long and painful a ſeparation, the objects of your tendereſt affection, or ſolacing yourſelves with the hopes of being ſpeedily re-united to thoſe who were yet detained in bondage from you; congratulating your friends on your mutual deliverance, and the proſpect that was opening to you of returning peace, quiet, and ſecurity.—In this dawn of your hopes and expectations, to awake at the midnight hour, and find your city in flames; to ſee your all, periſhing before your eyes, and to know that your deſtroyers were ſecretly among you, ſpreading the ruin, and exulting in the ſucceſs of their infernal ſcheme!</p>
            <p>This was not the ſudden act of a vanquiſhed and flying enemy, perpetrated in the peeviſh moment of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and defeat, or contrived to favour their eſcape. No, —ſeveral days had elapſed ſince their flight, and quiet ſeemed to have reviſited you under the banner of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers. Even the baſe incendiaries returned among you, wearing the maſk of peace. We hoped that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of their exceſſes—had been convinced of their folly and madneſs, and meant to embrace the proffered clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Sovereign, who was willing to forget the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful revolt againſt his authority, their contempt of his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:043110_0014_101CCC2992BDA738"/>
crown and government, and the inſults offered to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But they cried, "Peace, peace, when their was no peace." The blow they were meditating was the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, from its being thus concealed—they gloried in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it home, and nothing, under Heaven, but the activity of your Engliſh friends, could have prevented the whole city's falling a victim to their determined malice. Yes my friends, ye were witneſſes of it.—Ye ſaw the treacherous adherents of theſe pretended guardians of your rights and poſſeſſions, who came to reſcue you from tyrany and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, armed with firebrands, and under cover of the darkneſs, wrapping your city in flames. Ye ſaw the brave and generous ſervants of your King,—that King, whom you have ſo often heard repreſented as a tyrant, who ſends forth his fleets and armies to enſlave, ravage, deſtroy, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the aſſiſtance of their fellow-ſubjects, in the midſt of the flames, at the hazard of their lives, exerting every nerve to preſerve your dwellings, and poſſeſſions, and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the hands of the dark incendiaries the inſtruments they had prepared for your deſtruction. Had it pleaſed Heaven, that the ſucceſs could have anſwered their zeal, ſo many families, once bleſſed with comfort and affluence would not have been turned out on the world naked, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and ſtripped of their all.—The ſeminary of indigent, merit, where poverty found a reſource againſt ignorance, and where charity reclaimed thouſands from idleneſs and diſſipation to virtue and induſtry, would yet have ſtood.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the fire of Saturday, Sept. 21, a thouſand houſes, nearly one-fourth of the city, were laid in aſhes, Trinity church, the public cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſchool, the Rector's houſe, and a Lutheran chapel, were among the buildings that were conſumed.—The loſs ſuſtained in houſes, &amp;c. by the Corporation of Trinity Church, amounts at a moderate compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to thirty thouſand pounds New-York currency.</note> The manſion of your worthy and reverend Miniſter, whoſe abſence you ſtill regret, and the poſſeſſions appropriated for the ſupport of your clergy, would not have periſhed, and added to the diſtreſſes they have already ſuffered on your account and their own.—But "ye ſmitten and afflicted," who beheld your "deſtruction coming" on you "like a

whirlwind," your own induſtry, and the labour of your anceſtors, ſwept off in the ſpace of a moment, whither could you have fled from the rage of your enemies? Not even the Temples of the Lord were ſacred from their fury —his altars could afford you no ſanctuary. The mother of your churches, the ornament of your worſhip, the firſt edifice which the piety of your anceſtors had raiſed to the God of their fathers, in gratitude for his mercies in a ſtrange land, was marked out for certain deſtruction. Some child of perdition claimed to himſelf the merit of this daring ſacrilege, and involved the ancient and venerable pile in the ſame ruin with which they deſigned to extirpate all the indearments of your Religion, every veſtige of your ancient ſplendor and glory.</p>
            <p>In this ſcene of univerſal danger and diſtreſs, to what can the miniſters of God exhort you? If, ſhould we know "what manner of ſpirit we were of," if we ſuffered any expreſſions that may have fallen from us to be interpreted into a breach of charity, the crown of Chriſtian virtues; or into a deſign of ſharpening the virulence of party, or increaſing animoſities that have already too fatally deſtroyed the peace of your Jeruſalem. To miniſter ſome conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your ſufferings, as becometh the teachers of the Goſpel, who muſt be unworthy indeed of the character thy bear, not to feel for the afflictions of their brethren, who look to them for comfort and inſtruction; to ſet before you "the loving kindneſſes of the Lord," and the redemption he hath wrought in your favour, and to exhort you to make every becoming return for his mercies and love; to point out to you, and warn you againſt the abuſes that have brought ruin upon your country, this has been our only aim. If we have ſucceeded, all our wiſhes are ſatisfied and we ſhall have the conſolation to think that you will ſanctify this day, as becometh Chriſtians, by prayer and thankſgiving; by repentance for paſt ſins, and reſolutions of an amendment of life; by practiſing the duties of that religion, for the intereſts of which you have manifeſted ſuch zeal and attachment; by laying aſide all malice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and deſire of revenge; by committing your cauſe to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:043110_0016_101CCC2CA3F7A828"/>
together as friends and brethren. Let a reciprocation of further accompliſhment of his gracious deſigns. He who can "ſtill the raging of the ſeas," knows beſt how to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore peace and tranquility to your diſtracted country. May he correct the hearts, and reform the underſtandings of your infatuated brethren, who ſtill refuſe to contribute their endeavours towards healing theſe unhappy diſputes. And while their example proves a warning to you—while in their conduct, you conſider the exceſſes to which thoſe may be tranſported, who once paſs the ancient bounds of lawful and ſettled government, may God give you grace to attach yourſelves the more firmly to our happy conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution both in church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>Humbly, and with all due proſtration of heart, I ſhall venture to affirm that your cauſe is his own. It is the cauſe of peace, loyalty, and ſound reaſon, expoſed to the attempts of miſguided men, whom he ſeems to have given over to a blindneſs of heart that hurries them into all the violence and artifice of ſedition, frenzy, and rebellion. Fear not then, my friends, but in his own time "his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will order all things ſweetly." In the mean time, learn to reſign yourſelves to what ever means he may be pleaſed to employ for that end, and humble yourſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his chaſtiſing, but fatherly hand. Would to God I could ſay that the danger were paſt! But treachery, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſtill lurketh amongſt you. Let every man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be careful and vigilant. Nature requires, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion approves, that we ſhould make uſe of the means, which providence hath put into our power for our protection and ſafety. But let this be your chief dependence, that he "who is with you, is greater than they who are againſt you." He, from whom alone your ſafety can come "neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps." Though your enemies may hope "that the darkneſs ſhall cover them, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is no darkneſs with him." He will not let them "have their deſire," nor their "miſchievous imagination proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per." Let the ſenſe of the common danger to which you are expoſed, and the fellowſhip of your paſt ſufferings, ſtrengthen the ties of charity between you, and bind you

the juſtice of God, and waiting with reſignation for the kindneſs and humanity diſtinguiſhing you in this ſeaſon of diſtreſs; to ſoften the rigour of each others ſufferings, and lighten the univerſal burthen of affliction. Be of one heart, and one mind, cleave together—commend yourſelves to the protection of God, and doubt not but he will complete the work he hath already ſo graciouſly begun. And when he "ſhall have plucked out" all ſtrife and enmity from among you, fear not but he will "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and have compaſſion upon you, and bring you again every man to his heritage, and every man to his land."</p>
            <p>I muſt not finiſh as if I meant to diſappoint your expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and not adopt a concluſion which I am convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced you have already anticipated. The allegiance they had ſworn to their lawful Sovereign, and an affectionate attachment to his virtuous character, compelled your clergy to ſhut theſe doors, rather than admit the dutiful addreſſes, which the church enjoins them daily to offer to Heaven for his ſafety. Let us therefore conclude the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of this day, when the freedom of your worſhip is reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored to you, by uniting together with one heart, and one voice, to implore the divine favour and protection for our Sovereign Lord, King George; that God would be pleaſed to give him length of days, and encreaſe of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs—to proſper all his undertakings for the good of his people, and to bleſs him with what his actions prove, and his words aſſert to be, the "<note n="†" place="bottom">See his Majeſty's Speech at the concluſion of the ſeſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Favourite wiſh of his heart; the reſtoration of harmony; and re-eſtabliſhment of order and happineſs in every part of his dominions."</p>
