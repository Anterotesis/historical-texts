            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE intention of the publication before you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to vindicate a cauſe which has been a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal object of your attention, has a conſequent claim to your patronage, I ſhall therefore make no apology for inſcribing it to you. Notwithſtanding the endeavours of ignorant bigots, to repreſent the Slave trade in an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light, I hope this humble attempt to expoſe them, will meet your approbation; and convince the world that the luſtre of your characters is by no means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, but that like pure metal, the more they are rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by thoſe enthuſiaſtic advocates for liberty, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they will ſhine. I am under no perſonal obligations to you—the gratitude I feel ariſes from a nobler ſource— it is a juſt tribute to that generous diſintereſted exertion of benevolence and philanthropy, which has been the principal means of heaping wealth and honours on Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans and Americans, and reſcuing many millions of wretched Africans, as <hi>brands from the fire,</hi> and even compelling them to the enjoyment of a more refined ſtate of happineſs, than the partiality of fate had aſſigned them in their native ſtate.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is well obſerved by ſome author I have read, that the beſt human inſtitutions partake of imperfection; and the moſt excellent conſtitution has its defects.— The liberty of the preſs has doubtleſs ſome advantages; but it may be queſtioned whether theſe outweigh its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies. We may certainly reckon among the latter, the opportunities with which it furniſhes <hi>weak</hi> men of venting the idle dreams of a diſtempered brain; or deſigning ones of carrying on their dark purpoſes, by miſrepreſentation, ſlander, or other miſchievous means. Had it not been for this unreſtrained liberty of the preſs, the taſk I have undertaken would have been probably needleſs; and I had been ſpared the diſtreſs which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends me, in being obliged to expoſe my poor abilities to the publick view. Confiding however in its candour, I will not increaſe my claim on its patience by a long preface. I will only ſay, that in gratitude to the author of "<hi>Slavery not forbidden by ſcripture,</hi> &amp;c." I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to adopt this plan ſo fully, that the following pages may anſwer the purpoſe of a ſecond edition of that celebrated work, with ſome corrections, tranſpoſitions, and emendations.</p>

            <head>PERSONAL SLAVERY ESTABLISHED, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HAVING attentively peruſed ſeveral of the late publications on the ſubject of perſonal Slavery, I think it may not be amiſs if I ſtate, in a ſummary way, the arguments adduced in them for and againſt the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and draw ſuch concluſions, as may be warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the premiſes. The firſt on the ſubject, which I ſhall notice, is a pamphlet intitled,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſiderations on keeping Negroes, &amp;c. by John Woolman.</hi> As his arguments againſt the practice are all drawn from the Old and New Teſtament, and their authority has been long ſince rejected by ſome of our moſt prevailing ſyſtems of politicks, I think it is unneceſſary to ſay more, than that it appears to be the dull productions of a viſionary enthuſiaſt.—The next work in my catalogue, is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A ſhort account of that part of Africa inhabited by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, &amp;c.</hi> The author or compiler of this work has taken great pains to convince us, that he concurs with a number of other authors in condemnation of the Slave-trade, as unjuſt, cruel, and impolitic; and to ſupport
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012935_0005_0F903F2E0772A590"/>
their opinions, relates a number of what he would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are facts. Now as thoſe ſuppoſed facts conſtitute the foundation of moſt of his arguments, if they are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved little need be ſaid to prove his opinions to be idle and nugatory. Thoſe facts are generally the relations of men, who are, or have been concerned or employed in the trade to Africa for Slaves, unſupported by a ſingle affidavit, or any other <hi>legal</hi> proof of their authority; and moreover men ſpeaking in a cauſe in which they are parties; and therefore cannot be ſuppoſed to tell the <hi>whole</hi> truth, even could we ſuppoſe what they have told is truth. I could produce numberleſs authorities from our law books, to prove that no evidence can be admitted but what is well eſtabliſhed <hi>on oath,</hi> and that all offered by parties to the matter in diſpute, muſt be rejected. Such is the law, and the law being allowed to be the perfection of reaſon, it follows that the arguments of our author on the ſubject of ſlavery, are not only unreaſonable, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo illegal, and therefore inadmiſſable.—Proceed we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A caution and warning to Great-Britain and her colonies, &amp;c. by Ant. Benezet.</hi> I will promiſe that on a particular enquiry, I have found that this gentleman has no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, and no concern in trade. We can therefore be at no difficulty in accounting for a certain contraction of ſentiment, evident in his abſtract ideas of right and wrong. They are merely theoretick, and a little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with men and things would convince him, are better calculated for the amuſement of recluſe bigots, than the attention of men endued with a more liberal turn of thinking, and enlarged ideas. The general ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments he has made uſe of, are ſo ſimilar to thoſe of the laſt mentioned piece, that the objections I have advanced
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012935_0006_0F903F2F5143EFE8"/>
in conſidering <hi>that,</hi> are alſo applicable to this. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of a ſermon preached by the Biſhop of Glouceſter, which he has preſumptuouſly tacked to the end of his pamphlet, is ſuch an abſurd rhapſody, as in leſs corrupt times would have deprived the Biſhop of his See. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it has been tenderly winked at, as owing to that intenſe application, which at the time that it opened the treaſures of knowledge to his view, obſcured his facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in uſing them.</p>
            <p>The next piece on the ſubject, which I have met with, is <hi>an addreſs to the inhabitants of the Britiſh ſettlements in America, upon Slave-keeping, &amp;c.</hi> As this piece is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly animadverted on in a judicious and very candid defence of the practice in general, and particularly of the Weſt-India planters from the calumnies it contains, I ſhall ſtate the ſum of the arguments from each, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This laſt tract is entitled,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Slavery not forbidden by Scripture; or, a Defence of the Weſt-India planters from the aſperſions, &amp;c. by a Weſt-Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> As the author's place of reſidence was ſuch, as muſt afford him the beſt opportunities of being well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his ſubject; and it does not appear from the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle page, that he had any concern in the ſlave trade, nor had reaped any advantage from the labour of ſlaves, we cannot heſitate in giving his ſentiments their due weight, in oppoſition to all that has been advanced againſt Slavery, by men who have not had his opportunities. From the obſervations I have already made, I have left but little room to doubt which ſide of the queſtion I eſpouſe; and it will appear further evident from thoſe I may make, as in expreſſing my ſentiments of the addreſs I ſhall be apt, very frequently to uſe the words of the Defence, in adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012935_0007_0F903F2FD857D3A8"/>
this method, I hope I ſhall not incur the charge of plagiariſm, as I believe the eſſence of that crime conſiſts in borrowing from an author without confeſſing the debt. Theſe things being premiſed, I ſhall proceed to conſider the Addreſs not only as it relates to Slavery, but alſo as a moſt ſcandalous and audacious libel on <hi>every</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual inhabitant of <hi>every</hi> iſland in the Weſt-Indies.</p>
            <p>The author of the Addreſs, pretending to aim at the reformation of mankind, points out the practice of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Slavery, as one particular that <hi>he</hi> thinks requires it, and recommends the adoption of a plan that he opines would be likely to aboliſh it, never giving himſelf time to conſider our natural frailties—the impoſſibility of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfection—that there are faults in every human inſtitution, and that till ſelf-intereſt ceaſes to have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the actions of men, propoſals that ſtrike at the very root of their temporal intereſts—their eaſe— their convenience and grandeur, will never be liſtened to. He might as well have poured forth his eloquence againſt the lawleſs ambition of Kings in ſacrificing millions of their fellow creatures—the knavery of Stateſmen—the avarice of Biſhops, Lawyers, Phyſicians and Merchants —the endleſs endeavours of men univerſally to overreach one another, and the continued ſcene of bloodſhed and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty exhibited by moſt of our favourite ſports; all which it is evident, from his not mentioning them, he ſecretly approves; I ſay, he might as well have poured forth his eloquence on all or any of theſe, as exerciſe his declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory powers on Slavery. A man of a liberal and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way of thinking, would have ſeen that they are all but the neceſſary conſequences of the imperfection of our nature; and that his leiſure hours might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employed, than in railing at ſlavery, which at the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012935_0008_0F903F323AAD7FE8"/>
worſt cannot be ſaid to ſacrifice millions for ſo trifling a pittance as a ſmall ſpot of land.</p>
            <p>The Addreſſer abſurdly endeavours to prove from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Slavery tolerated by the Moſaic law, was eſſentially different from that now impoſed on the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans; and gives ſome reaſons (as ſpecious as he can make them) to convince us they might have particular reaſons for the kind of ſlavery they did tolerate. He might as well have inferred that if the advocates for Slavery, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the practice under that law; the other parts of it, in every particular, are ſtill obligatory; and although ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting us to ſome inconvenient ceremonies, would give us a title to many valuable priviledges, as turning off a wiſe we might be tired of, &amp;c. &amp;c. But as I obſerved at ſetting out, the authority of ſcripture is now general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected by men of a liberal way of thinking. I ſhall therefore be more brief on any arguments drawn from it on either ſide, and confine myſelf to ſuch, as in my own opinion, are reaſonable and in point. Is it not highly probable that the Africans we enſlave, are deſcendants of the very ſame Heathen that were <hi>round about</hi> the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, who we all know lived a long time in Africa? If ſo, as they ſtill remain unconverted, are they not yet in the ſame predicament with their anceſtors? And as, without much arrogance we may eſteem ourſelves as Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, or at leaſt deſcended from them, will it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that we are entitled to the liberty of enſlaving the Africans and the Heathen <hi>round about</hi> us alſo? This laſt is a trade we might drive on with very little ſhipping, and may be worthy of conſideration.</p>
            <p>Our author, in attempting to prove the inconſiſtency of Slavery under the Chriſtian diſpenſation, is quite
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012935_0009_0F903F33872D3438"/>
blaſphemous. He would infer that although there is no <hi>expreſs</hi> precept againſt the Slave-trade to Africa or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Slaves; they are both abſolutely repugnant to the very genius and ſpirit of Chriſtianity. Juſt as if we were to imagine any evil was intended to be removed that was not expreſsly forbidden in the New-Teſtament. This would be to ſuppoſe that the lawleſs ambition of Kings ſacrificing millions of their fellow creatures, and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle catalogue of other neceſſary conſequences of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of our nature, before mentioned, are inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the Chriſtian religion. How abſurd is ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning? How impious its author!

            <p>Notwithſtanding his abſurdities, and his being totally unacquainted with the ſubject, I admit his arguments have ſome weight in theſe northern colonies. Truth and juſtice ſhould have very diſtinct ideas annexed to them at the pole, from what they convey under the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial. There is a certain <hi>political neceſſity</hi> by which thoſe ideas ſhould be regulated; and as this neceſſity may be very different in different latitudes, a practice may be meritorious in the Weſt-Indies, which in Canada is far otherwiſe. Had our author and his aſſociates confined their ſlander to their own countrymen, and <hi>expreſsly</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Weſt-Indians from any ſhare in them, I ſhould have had no objection to the diſplay of their abilities. He certainly never conſidered that the inhabitants of the Britiſh iſlands in the Weſt-Indies, hold to the value of £. 22,000,000 in live ſtock, excluſive of quadrupeds and other chattels; and that were his pernicious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, (which thus impiouſly exclude the idea of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical neceſſity) to prevail, they might ſoon be twenty-two millions of money poorer than they now eſteem

themſelves to be.—Rum, Sugar, Rice and Indigo are indiſpenſible neceſſaries of life, and if we exclude Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, we muſt introduce white men in their cultivation, which would never anſwer; for they could not ſuſtain the labour as well as blacks, as this author himſelf is pleaſed, with unuſual candour, to allow; and perhaps it might be rather difficult (eſpecially if they were Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons) to perſuade them to ſubmit, to what their maſters might think a proper correction in compelling them to it. The obſtinacy of their tempers might occaſion an exertion of ſpirit in the maſters, that would ſometimes bring the lives of the latter as well as the former into ſome danger, as without doubt it would happen now and then, that a ſurviving fellow ſervant might be hardy enough to inform, and claim the vengeance of the laws, which in the caſe of white men, may not be ſuffered to remain as they now are. Beſides this, there would be a danger that induſtrious ſervants would frequently become maſters; and if this ever happened in the ſugar colonies, and they were not able to make fifty hogſheads of ſugar each; by joining in the expence, they might obviate the difficulties ariſing from the great expence of ſugar-works; for it appears it is no more worth while to erect proper works for the manufacture of any leſs quantity, than it would be in a wheat country, for every petty farmer to build a mill for the grinding his own grain. By ſuch means in time the great eſtates of the Weſt-Indians would be divided, and many families, who by honeſt induſtry have riſen to affluence, could riſe no <hi>higher.</hi> This would probably diſcourage that profuſion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, for which the Weſt-Indians have been always remarkable, and which has been ſo advantageous to the Mother Country, a conſideration highly worthy of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; even if by ſuch a diviſion of eſtates, the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues

of government were not leſſened, which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be the caſe if the number of <hi>whites</hi> was increaſed, who would undoubtedly conſume more among themſelves. Now the quantity of Weſt-India produce does not only benefit Britain in reſpect to the revenue, but the Sugar, &amp;c. ſent home, by giving employment to the refiners of Sugar, ſailors, ſhip-builders, &amp;c. alſo <hi>creates</hi> an increaſe of its inhabitants; whether by any prolific, or what other quality in the Sugar, &amp;c. I cannot tell; but ſuch is the fact, as I am informed by the <hi>Defence.</hi>

            <p>Was government ſufficiently ſtupid to liſten to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the author of the <hi>Addreſs</hi> and his aſſociates, or any ſuch viſionary enthuſiaſts, and proclaim liberty to <hi>four hundred</hi> thouſand Negroes, who are ſaid to be in the Britiſh iſlands only, it is moſt probable that near <hi>four</hi> thouſand gentlemen Chriſtians, and among them ſome of the richeſt Britiſh ſubjects, would be immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a moſt calamitous ſituation—would be obliged to content themſelves with what they have already ſo equitably acquired by their labour; and one hundred times that number of poor ſtupid Negroes would be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed adrift, and forever after deprived of <hi>their</hi> kind care and protection. What an unchriſtian conduct would this be? I am really quite tired of this writers abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; nor leſs ſhocked at his want of humanity.</p>
            <p>Had he and his aſſociates confined themſelves to the ſuppoſed propriety of prohibiting the African trade in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, I ſhould not have felt the leaſt deſire of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batting their opinions. But he has repreſented the Weſt-India Planters as a ſet of hardened monſters; or at leaſt that many cruel puniſhments are inflicted on their Slaves by <hi>ſome</hi> of them. He little thinks I can trace moſt of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012935_0012_0F903F35DD2ABC60"/>
his malicious hints to the identical perſons he aims at. Does he idly imagine that there is any difficulty in ſeeing that the ſyringe of his venom is principally levelled againſt the Hon. Mr. — of Bar—s, John —, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t—a, Mr. — of St. K—s,—a certain Honourable and worthy gentleman of Jam—ca, who commonly wears blue cloaths, &amp;c. &amp;c. I could point out ſeveral others who are evidently the particular objects of his ſlander, were I ſo diſpoſed; but theſe are ſufficient to ſatisfy the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, that his reflections are altogether <hi>perſonal,</hi> and that his <hi>Addreſs</hi> is written ſolely with a deſign to ſpread them. As to his particular inſtances of barbarity, he does not mention one that is well ſupported by proof, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit the poſſibility of the facts, as the author of the <hi>Defence</hi> aſſures us <hi>he</hi> never was an eye-witneſs of one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſtance as particularized in the <hi>Addreſs,</hi> &amp;c. and yet with a candour that is ever the companion of truth, he does allow a <hi>few</hi> inſtances of the kind mentioned, had happened. One or two more of theſe fanatic writers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce authorities for ſome of their aſſertions of this ſort. I would not offer to impeach the credit of Sir Hans Sloan, but he was certainly a milky tempered man, whoſe mind was not properly impreſſed with the idea of the <hi>political neceſſity</hi> of ſuch a conduct to keep ſlaves in <hi>proper</hi> awe; and I muſt ſay, I think as he had received civilities from many gentlemen in Jamaica, and conſiderable additions were there made to his collection of natural curioſities, his character as a <hi>gentleman</hi> would have ſhone quite as conſpicuouſly, had he ſuppreſſed ſome of his reflections on their behaviour to their ſlaves.—The deſerving part of the Negroes will maintain their good behaviour, and

the worthleſs from motives of fear take care <hi>never to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> puniſhment; ſo that the little ſeverity commonly uſed among them is <hi>unmerited</hi> and merely <hi>in Terrorem.</hi> But when they are faulty, and you omit correction, they will ſurely <hi>laugh</hi> heartily at your folly. If you are fooliſh enough to be indulgent and eaſy with them, they will not only exerciſe their riſible faculties, but become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat villains; and the chances are ten to one that your particular favourites are the ringleaders in every inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Notwithſtanding all this, ſuch is their clemency and forbearance, that the moſt ſevere penalties are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on any one who chaſtiſes a Negroe without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the proprietor, or if he ſhould unluckily be in England, why then rather than you ſhould be <hi>laughed</hi> at (which we all know is very provoking) a formal complaint to his Manager, who is always or <hi>generally</hi> a gentleman by birth or education, will anſwer the purpoſe. The whip with which the driver always follow the Negroes while at their work, is only carried as a badge of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſo little uſed, that like Edward the Confeſſor's ſceptre, it may be handed down to ſucceeding generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Another objection of our ſagacious <hi>Addreſſor</hi> is point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſeverity of the laws in the ſouthern colonies and iſlands, reſpecting Negroes. His ignorance accompanies him in every line; and yet I admit that at firſt ſight, many of them do really <hi>appear</hi> harſh, and give an idea <hi>rather</hi> unfavourable of the clemency of their legiſlatures; but on examination, the harſhneſs of this firſt <hi>appearance</hi> will entirely vaniſh; they will appear excuſeable and abſolutely neceſſary to the <hi>good</hi> government, and ſafety
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012935_0014_0F903F3898308910"/>
of the white people. Thus the <hi>looming</hi> of the fogs of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, when diſpelled by the winds of <hi>political neceſſity,</hi> will no more deceive us.—The diſproportion of whites and blacks is there very great; and ſelf-preſervation, that firſt and ruling principle of human nature, has made them jealous and <hi>perhaps</hi> ſevere in their laws, but they are but mere <hi>threats</hi> as it were, and only held up, as the drivers whip, to intimidate delinquents. They are found to be eſſential in the very <hi>being</hi> of thoſe colonies. Is it not ſtrange that thoſe thunder headed ſcribblers cannot view them through the medium of this political neceſſity on which I have ſo clearly inſiſted?—Slaves are never <hi>capitally</hi> puniſhed but for the moſt flagrant crimes, nor condemned without the cleareſt proof; nay, ſuch is their tenderneſs on this head, that I have known a humane gentleman frequently to conceal the moſt attrocious crime, rather than ſuffer the unhappy perpetrator to be puniſhed with <hi>death.</hi> To ſuppoſe that maſters would chooſe to forfeit their ſervice forever, which is the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable conſequence of a <hi>capital</hi> puniſhment, would be to prove them deſtitute of common ſenſe as well as compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In ſome caſes we allow ſlaves have been burnt or gibited alive, but neither of theſe modes of puniſhment, nor any other <hi>ever</hi> uſed among them, can come under the idea of ſeverity, it we reflect on what Ravailac, Damien, and others have ſuffered for murdering, or attempting to murder Kings, or even that <hi>cruel</hi> Iſraelitiſh practice of boreing the ear of a Slave with an awl, and obliging him to do all his work <hi>faſtened</hi> in that ſhocking manner to a door poſt, which 'tis probable he was obliged to drag after him, when he had occaſion to move.</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:012935_0015_0F903F39AC763F78"/>The charge of ſtarving their Slaves is as groundleſs, and may as eaſily be refuted. Would you, wiſe Sir! eſteem it good policy to ſtarve a yoke of oxen, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſeed time and harveſt, on the labour of which you depended for bread? It is certainly true that they do not invite negroes to their turtle feaſts, nor feed them with the niceſt dainties; but they have a proper allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of corn in all places; in ſome they are allowed a part of Sunday, and in others even all that day, to raiſe their own proviſions. Nay, it is not very uncommon for very good maſters, to give them their daily allowance, and all Sunday beſides to themſelves. Hence it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens that provident cunning fellows (for ſuch there are even among theſe brutes) have been known to ſell <hi>conſiderable</hi> quantities of produce, and indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a variety of <hi>luxuries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very evident that notwithſtanding the accounts of fabulous voyagers, the Negroes on the weſtern coaſts of Africa, are the moſt ſtupid, beaſtly race of animals in human ſhape, of any in the whole world. The brutali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, naſtineſs, indolence and other <hi>criminal</hi> propenſities of the Hottentots, are a convincing proof of the truth of my aſſertion; and though I admit they are not deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of hoſpitality to ſtrangers (of which Aeſop gives us many inſtances, even in four footed beaſts) yet I am far from thinking this can counterbalance their execrable fondneſs for raw fleſh.—The author of the <hi>Defence</hi> aſſerts that there are four or five different ſpecies of men,—with ſubmiſſion, I will limit them to four, viz. 1ſt, Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, 2d, Aſſiaticks, 3d, Americans, and 4th, Africans, and retracting the word <hi>ſpecies,</hi> ſubſtitute <hi>genus,</hi> which is more expreſſive of my idea as being a general term, by
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012935_0016_0F903F3AF3ACAB10"/>
which I would diſtinguiſh the laſt as only a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of that <hi>genus,</hi> though utterly devoid of reaſon. Carrying this idea a little further, I would yet ſubdivide the Africans into five <hi>claſſes,</hi> aranging them in the order as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach neareſt to reaſon, as 1ſt, Negroes, 2d, Ourang Outangs, 3d, Apes, 4th, Baboons, and 5th, Monkeys. The opinion of their irrationality is ſo well ſupported by <hi>facts,</hi> that to thoſe acquainted with them, I need ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance very little on the ſubject; but to remove every ſcruple from the ſceptic, a little undeniable evidence may not be improper.—There never was a civilized nation of any other complexion than <hi>white;</hi> nor ever any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual eminent either in action or ſpeculation that was not rather inclining to the <hi>fair.</hi> Africa, except a ſmall part of it, inhabited by thoſe of our own colour, is totally overrun with Barbariſm—nay ſuch is the contaminating influence of black, that I fear I need not except <hi>even</hi> the <hi>whites</hi> among <hi>them.</hi> Perhaps this obſervation may aſſiſt us in accounting for the few appearances of Barbariſm we now and then diſcover among the <hi>whites</hi> in our ſouthern colonies and iſlands, where <hi>blacks</hi> bear ſo large a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their number. But to proceed from this ſhort di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, Africa has no kingdoms of any eminence, but chiefly conſiſts of petty monarchies, excepting Bildulge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, Ethiopia, Nubia, Abiſſinia, Morocco, and many others that are rather large. That they are <hi>all</hi> perpetually at war with each other, we are well aſſured, for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the caſe with all the petty nations, that are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtant from our European factories on their weſtern coaſts, from the river Senegal to the Cape of Good Hope; the Hottentots, Ferlys and ſome few others, only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The ſtupidity of the natives cannot be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to climate; for that r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r inſtances of the powers of ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious inſtinct than a proof of my opinion, reſpecting the irrationality of <hi>all</hi> Africans, being erroneous. Let not any in anſwer to what I have ſaid relating to their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and wars, object the ſimilarity of deſcription given by Tacitus and other hiſtorians, of many European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in early ages. Such an objection can have no weight, when we conſider the Europeans are bleſſed with reaſon, and therefore capable of improvement. Beſides the deſcriptions of this kind are made by Roman authors, who generally gave an exaggerated picture of the manners of any people with whom they were at war, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they had any particular deſigns on them, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave them or any thing elſe for which they could pretend no juſt authoity, for ſuch repreſentations might afford them ſome excuſe for their lawleſs ambition. This fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us too, with another ſtrong reaſon for diſcrediting abundance of idle tales, on which the arguments of theſe gloomy oppugners of Slavery are founded, as I have before obſerved.</p>
            <p>I could never perceive the Africans have the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant notions of a ſupreme being, which had they any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional powers, they would certainly have either by intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition, or the benefit of the connection which thoſe near our factories eſpecially muſt have with abundance of <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> white people, whoſe lawful concerns carrying them into Africa, we may ſuppoſe ſpare no opportunities of benefitting them in any ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>. In the converſation of theſe, the Negroes would frequently hear imprecations,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012935_0018_0F903F3C4B8036C0"/>
that would communicate the <hi>notion</hi> of the whites on this ſubject. They have, however, a confuſed notion of an evil ſpirit called <hi>Jumbee,</hi> who is able to do them miſchief, and it is a cuſtom among them to hang a broken bottle, a bit of rag, or any thing elſe by way of charm near their ground, which they call <hi>Oby,</hi> and is I ſuppoſe their good ſpirit. When their property is thus guarded, few Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes will have the boldneſs to ſteal any part of it. How ſuch irrationals came by even ſo much religion is hard to find, except we may be allowed a conjecture that they have a faint notion of image worſhip; borrowed proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from Roman itinerant Miſſionaries, as I think Baretti tells us that among the Catholicks, when any indecency is intended in the preſence of a picture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or Madona, a cloth is carefully placed before the picture to conceal ſuch indecency from their view. They alſo make ſome little ſhew of religion at their funerals, but this too may be well attributed to imitation; and we may aſſign the ſame cauſe, if we diſcover any thing like ſentiments of friendſhip, gratitude, or other ſocial ties among them.— In arts and ſciences, they have never made the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, which is another ſtrong proof of their brutality. In their muſic, although there ſeems to be a kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant harmony, I have never been able to diſcover their having any notion of the <hi>gamut;</hi> neither have they adopted our beſt ſyſtem of aſtronomy. When did we ever hear of a Caractacus or a Newton, a Boadicea or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fucius exiſting in Africa. It is true hiſtory informs us that it once had a Hannibal, a Ptolemy and a Hippar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, but then there is no poſitive proof of their being <hi>natives</hi> of it.—The author of the addreſs has attempted to prove they have ſome <hi>genius.</hi> I will be candid enough to allow there have been ſurprizing inſtances of <hi>docility</hi> in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012935_0019_0F903F3D139CF730"/>
Negroes. Such for inſtance was that of a Negroe fellow in Jamaica, who ſeemed to have ſome parts and learning, and could talk in a manner, that had his colour been concealed, and he had ſtuck a piece of wax on his noſe to make it a little more prominent, might have been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a rational creature poſſeſſing a tolerable knowledge in the law. I have myſelf ſeen ſeveral Negroes, who by dint of great labour and attention in their owners, have become very good mechanicks, as jewellers, watch-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, &amp;c. Nay I have known more than one of them who were capable of keeping a ſet of books in the Italian method in a neat correct manner. But we are not to ſuppoſe a few ſuch inſtances, or that a mere <hi>Luſus Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae</hi> can add any ſtrength to the ſuppoſition of their being endued with reaſon. We all know that extraordinary inſtances of docility in brutes have naturally excited great admiration in all ages. Pliny and many others have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us ſurprizing relations of this kind, and I have been told when a boy, of an elephant in Africa following the occupation of a tinker with ſome reputation. The inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of mechanicks have alſo furniſhed us with occaſions of wonder in imitations of divers kinds; for inſtance, the inanimate flying eagle at Vienna—the crowing cock at Straſburg—the ſpeaking clock in Ireland, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more, which ſufficiently prove the ingenuity of Europeans, but do by no means convince us that the ſaid eagle, cock and clock were rational beings. Indeed what we are told of ingenuity in Negroes, has ſometimes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtaggered my hypotheſis; and would induce a ſuſpicion of their mother's fidelity, was not the whole race of them ſo extremely forbidding in their perſons; and the antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all the <hi>whites</hi> to them and their deſcendants ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable, as entirely to ſatisfy me on that head. The
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012935_0020_0F903F3DD0CF2D48"/>
probability of the falſity of ſuch relations, or of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much exaggerated to gratify a natural fondneſs for the marvellous and wonderful, is much more in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Addreſſer</hi> endeavours to convince us that Negroes pine and degenerate in the iſlands. It is evidently other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for when an eſtate there is ſold, much higher pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are given for their two footed ſtock born in the Weſt-Indies, than for thoſe imported from Africa.—Would this wiſe acre himſelf give as much for a horſe which had not been broke to the ſhafts or ſaddle, as for one that had thoſe advantages? Surely not.</p>
            <p>He then goes on with his objections to the method of carrying on the Slave-trade. The reaſons I ſuggeſted in my obſervations on the pamphlets I firſt took notice of, preclude the neceſſity of my enlarging on this particular point. It is very plain that Slaves are bought in a <hi>fair</hi> courſe of trade; and even could he prove that it is not in the courſe of a <hi>fair</hi> trade, it would be nothing to the purpoſe—if a commodity, a cow for inſtance, is brought to me for ſale, is it my buſineſs to enter with a critical nicety, into an enquiry by what means the ſeller procured her? I am ſure if I did, I ſhould forfeit all pretenſions to the character of a gentlemen; and I am as confident, that <hi>whatever</hi> the means are, by which ſlaves are brought among us, or whether their ſervitude in the Weſt-Indies is voluntary or not; or even if I ſhould admit all the accounts of the villainies and cruelties practiſed in the trade were ſhort of the truth, I ſhould yet be juſtified in the purchaſe of them, as it is a moſt certain introduction to health and happineſs in a ſituation, where they have fewer cares, and leſs anxiety about to-morrow, than any people in the whole
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012935_0021_0F903F3E9E3F60B0"/>
world. They have (in a general way however) their uſual allowance of proviſions, and are entirely exempted from all the diſtreſſes attendant on war. The Negroe it is true, cannot eaſily change his maſter, but to make amends for this ſlight inconvenience, he enjoys a ſingular advantage over his brother in freedom of being <hi>carefully</hi> attended in ſickneſs, and of having the ſame proviſion in old age as in youth. Inſtead of being oppreſſed to feed a large family, like the free comfortleſs labourers in Europe, the more children he has, the richer he becomes; for the moment a child is born, the happy parents receive as much addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional proviſion, as with their own allowance, will amount to <hi>more</hi> than they can eat; and in caſe of their own death, (if by living among <hi>whites,</hi> they ſhould chance to have attained any thing like reflection) they will quit the world with the comfortable certainty of their children being brought up with the <hi>ſame</hi> kind care, they formerly experienced themſelves. What Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, Epicurean or Stoick, could wiſh for more? In theſe iſlands and colonies only, do the highly favoured Africans realize the fabulous hiſtory of the golden age. Was their happy ſtate but known in Great-Britain and Ireland—what emigrations there would be in ſearch of this terreſtrial elyſium? Acts of Parliament would then be really neceſſary—not indeed to comply with the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary ſchemes of gloomy enthuſiaſts—but to prevent the entire depopulation of thoſe kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The cauſe I plead is ſo well ſupported by the Suffrages of Cuſtom and Right Reaſon, that I fear I have made an apology to the public neceſſary for detaining it's attention ſo long on arguments drawn from ſelf-evident principles. I have heard of a certain Philoſopher who wrote a large folio vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012935_0022_0F903F3FEACEDCC0"/>
to prove that light came from the Sun. I flatter myſelf I am more excuſeable, as I write for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gloomy fanaticks, who to muliſh obſtinacy join a moſt illiberal and malevolent turn of thinking; and I have no leſs in view than to convince them of errors far more miſchievous in their conſequences, than any that could ariſe from its remaining undetermined, what may be the true ſource of light.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Addreſs</hi> is a ſcandalous libel, in which ſome of the Weſt-Indians are unworthily traduced, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved; and am ſure that the leaſt the public can do, to teſtify a decent deteſtation of it's moſt malevolent ſlanders, is to have it formally committed to the flames by the hands of the common hangman. The inhabitants ſhould conſider that the Weſt-Indies form a conſiderable branch of their commerce, and that therefore it ill becomes them to ſuffer <hi>any</hi> practice to be opprobriouſly ſtigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as unjuſt or impolitic, in which the Weſt-Indians happen to be concerned. They ſhould alſo remember, that a genteel ſum of money was lately received from that quarter, for the uſe of their College, for which they have been highly commended by its Provoſt. Every one muſt ſuppoſe that in delivering his commendations, he ſpoke the ſentiments of the other Profeſſors, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe Gentlemen, equally remarkable for their piety and learning, would not have beſtowed praiſes on a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe conduct in <hi>any</hi> reſpect was exceptionable. It is therefore evident that all the Profeſſors are Advocates for Slavery, and being learned and pious, it naturally follows that the Slave-trade in itſelf and in its conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is not at all inconſiſtent with religion or ſound po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:012935_0023_0F903F4013623FF0"/>What will not this ſame <hi>Addreſſer</hi> and <hi>his aſſociates</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, if in reſentment for their infamous uſage of them, the Weſt-Indians ſhould determine to decline their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the northern colonies of America? Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment working in men of honour, may carry them a great way. They may find reſources to ſupply themſelves with flour and pork, or with ſuccedaneums that will do as well. The white people of fortune in the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are comparatively but few in number, and might be ſupplied nearly with all <hi>they</hi> uſe of theſe articles from the Carolinas. It would then only remain to ſupply the lower claſs of whites, and the demands of the Negroes. —It is ſuppoſed that one hundred thouſand Slaves are yearly ſhipped in the African ports for the Britiſh Weſt-India iſlands. Of theſe perhaps twenty thouſand die on the paſſage. Now when their death is not occaſioned by any bad diſorder, if there was a proper quantity of ſalt on board, the bodies might be cured in pickle or ſmoak; and the ſame method purſued with thoſe that die on land, or are paſt labour. A conſiderable quantity of proviſion might be thus procured that would furniſh a tolerable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneum for <hi>pork</hi> and hams. I have never heard that this kind of meat is deemed unwholeſome, but on the contrary, that the Cannibals are a hardy robuſt race of people.—The ſcheme is new, and might not be very eligible—I only mention it as a <hi>dernier reſort,</hi> and which a very high degree of reſentment only could ever incline them to have recourſe to.</p>
