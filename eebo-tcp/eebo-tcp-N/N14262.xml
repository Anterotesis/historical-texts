            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MANY of the rules of philoſophizing, which Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> adopted, I think are good, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mended—In the following piece, I have been careful to attend to his four cardinal rules, eſpecially the firſt, which is recited there at large.</p>
            <p>But I can by no means approve of Sir <hi>Iſaac's</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, viz. <hi>That all matter is originally the ſame</hi>; to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch an hypotheſis, I am under the neceſſity of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in to my aid, an almoſt infinite number of cauſes; moſt of which are baniſhed, upon the ſuppoſition of the <hi>original diviſion</hi> of matter, poſſeſſed of different qualities, as ſet forth in the following diſcourſe. A deviation from Sir <hi>Iſaac,</hi> may poſſibly be thought preſumptuous; but, I humbly conceive, I am kept in countenance from his fourth rule of philoſophizing, viz. <hi>That propoſitions collected from phaenomena by induction, are to be deemed,</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding contrary hypotheſis) <hi>either exactly, or very nearly true, until other phaenomena occur, by which they may be rendered either more accurate, or liable to exception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The diſcovery that Doctor <hi>Franklin</hi> has made, in his electrical experiments, will I conceive, warrant both a departure from Sir <hi>Iſaac's</hi> hypotheſis, and alſo an yatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another, more agreeable to his own rule; which ought to be held ſacred among Philoſophers, as a pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar, and not teaze <hi>nature</hi> to find out a firſt cauſe for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every effect—For if, in order to explore the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature, experiments are to be attended to in one day, they are doubtleſs alſo to be attended to in another, with equal aſſiduity and care.</p>
            <p>I have a great veneration for Sir <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and eſteem him as one of the brighteſt luminaries, that ever enlighten'd the philoſophic world: But I think it no diminution to his character, to ſuppoſe that Doctor <hi>Franklin</hi> has, by a
<pb facs="unknown:018058_0003_0FA4B70355B3EC68"/>
courſe of experiments, brought things to light, which were never before ſufficiently explored, and diſcovered a genius equal to any that ever went before him.</p>
            <p>As moſt of the illuſtrations were written on different topicks, and delivered before the medical ſociety at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times, and never were deſigned to be publiſhed; and as this publication is inſiſted on by a number of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſome at leaſt, of the beſt characters; and as preſent Inconveniencies will not allow ſufficient time to prepare the work for the preſs, I beg the reader would excuſe the inaccuracies as well as digreſſions, which may appear in ſome of them—And ſhould this publication meet with a favourable reception, a new edition, with large additions and illuſtrations, is in contemplation. But ſhould any object to the general principle, I deſire they would ſtate their objections fairly, that the public may be under advantages to judge for themſelves, whether the general ſentiments advanced in the following Piece, are well founded or not.</p>

            <head>DISCOURSE on FLUIDITY.</head>
            <p>ONE principal character of a fluid, as laid down by Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> and ſeems to be warranted by Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is (viz.) <hi>That the particles compoſing the ſame, are exceeding ſmall,</hi> for, that <hi>the ſmallneſs of the particles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to fluidity,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is evident from hence: That the points of contact between ſpheres, are in proportion to their diameters, and therefore grow leſs with their ſpheres, and the leſs their points of contact, the leſs will be the coheſion, and the greater</hi> (of courſe) <hi>their diſpoſition to fluidity, &amp;c.</hi>— upon which I would obſerve firſt; That if any given point of the contact of a ſphere, even againſt a plane, is of any meaſure of diſtance acroſs, 'tis plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, 'tis not an entire ſphere; for that given diſtance, muſt be a plane alſo, or it could not reſt upon a plane. Hence 'tis alſo plain and evident, that let their ſpheres be great or ſmall, it makes no odds in reſpect to the largeneſs of their points of contact; But in reſpect to their number, it does; for the larger the ſpheres, the fewer the number of their points of contact, in any gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven quantity of matter. Therefore, if we account for fluidity in their way, the larger the ſpheres, the more fluid muſt that body be; which we know is contrary to fact.</p>
            <p>Fill any veſſel with muſk<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> ball, and elevate (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) the ſouth ſide of the veſſel, until ſome of the balls begin to roll, not one of them will roll, until you bring the center of its gravity, north of the northermoſt point of its contact; 'Tis certain alſo, that you muſt elevate the veſſel juſt as many degrees, in order to make fine pigeon ſhot to roll, as to make cannon ball roll— And 'tis juſt as certain, that the ſame veſſel, being filled with any known fluid, and elevated on one ſide, the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:018058_0005_0FA4B707C7833F90"/>
whole ſurface, inſtantly alters accordingly, and forms a level—Thus I think I have made it fully to appear, that thoſe philoſophers are miſtaken in this matter.</p>
            <p>In the 2d. and 3d. place, they affirm, <hi>that they are both round and ſmooth</hi>; here I would juſt obſerve, that if they are perfectly round, they muſt, of courſe be ſmooth, for there can be no other idea of ſmoothneſs, but equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in ſurface—Moreover, ſmoothneſs, they make an abſolute requiſite to a fluid, <hi>for want of this quality,</hi> ſay they, <hi>altho' the particle were poſſeſſed of all other mentioned in the definition, yet they would never conſtitute a fluid, ſince nothing can be of greater obſtruction thereto, than aſperity or roughneſs of the ſuperficies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would juſt obſerve, for a moment, in what manner our theory muſt run (in order to have it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent upon the hypotheſis, that ſmoothneſs is abſolutely neceſſary to a fluid; it muſt run thus, viz. That the particles compoſing oleaginous ſubſtances, ſuch as lard, tallow, &amp;c. together with the whole train of metallic ſubſtances; alſo moſt ſaline ſubſtances, ſuch as ſea-ſalt, pot-aſh, lap. infern. and even lunar cauſtic itſelf, when melted, are exceeding ſmooth—Surely then, we ought to leave off the term acrid, as applied to them—Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, what has been ſaid, I think ſufficient to prove, to any curious mind, that the account given by thoſe philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers concerning a fluid, is at leaſt, altogether unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory—It were to be wiſhed therefore, that they had adhered more ſtrictly to the incomparable Sir <hi>Iſaac's</hi> firſt rule of philoſophizing, viz. <hi>More cauſes of natural things are not to be admitted, than are both true and ſufficient to explain the phaenomena</hi>; for nature does nothing in vain, but is ſimple, and delights not in ſuperfluous cauſes of things. Accordingly the poet, although with a different view, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,</p>
            <l>"The univerſal cauſe,</l>
            <l>'Acts not by partial, but by general laws;'</l>
            <p>&amp; again,</p>
            <l>'In human works, tho' labor'd on with pain,</l>
            <l>'A thouſand movements ſcarce one purpoſe gain;</l>
            <l>'In God's one ſingle can its end produce,</l>
            <l>'Yet ſerves as ſecond to ſome other uſe:'</l>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:018058_0006_0FA4B708227ECB98"/>It remains therefore, to account for fluidity on ſome more rational principles, and more agreeable to what we find to be fact—Firſt then, we will attend to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing axiom, viz. <hi>Whenever we can procure a number of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles or corpuſcles of common matter, of a ſuitable configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to attract the electrical effluvia on all ſides, ſo as to form an electrical atmoſphere around each; we then have a fluid, without which electrical atmoſphere, there can be no proper fluid; becauſe, if the particles touch each other, altho' it ſhould be even only in points, yet they would not be a fluid; altho' perhaps, they might be a pretty fine powder</hi>: Now there are two grand diviſions into which all the matter compoſing this ſyſtem, ought to be divided, becauſe, attended with oppoſite qualities and attributes—The firſt is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive matter,</hi> which is, by far, the moſt abundant, <note n="*" place="bottom">By this, it is not meant that the cubic meaſure of all the ſolid minutiſſimals of repellent matter, is more than the cubic meaſure of all the ſolid minutiſſimals of attractive matter; for this is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable: But that the extent of the aggregate ſum of all the parts of ſpace, which are occupied chiefly by repellent matter, is more than that of the aggregate ſum of all the parts of ſpace, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied chiefly by attractive matter—If we ſhould attend to the great Sir <hi>Iſaac's</hi> 4th rule of philoſophizing, viz. <hi>That propoſitions col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from phaenomena by deduction are to be deemed</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding contrary hypotheſis) <hi>either exactly, or very nearly true, til other phaenomena occur, by which they may be rendered either more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, or liable to exception:</hi> And if, according to the great Doctor <hi>Franklin,</hi> we conclude that ſpheres are kept aſunder by electrical atmoſpheres, which I think experiment fully evinces, we ſhall then readily determine, that the grand ſpheres compoſing this ſyſtem, are kept aſunder by the ſame kind of repelling atmoſpheres; and that the repelling atmoſphere, which keeps this earth from a nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the ſun, may extend many hundreds of miles above, or beyond the ſurface of the air; and conſequently, near the ſurface of ſaid atmoſphere, the repelling particles muſt ſtand at very great diſtances from each other—That there are diſtances, vacuums, or interſtices, between the impenetrable, or ſolid particles of both at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive and repellent matter is undeniable, ſince otherwiſe there could be no motion: But the various phenomena of things, render it probable, at leaſt, that there is no one point, in the univerſe, in which the influence of both attractive and repellent matter is not extended; and this influence, being a phyſical entity: Therefore, in this view, there can be no vacuum.</note>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:018058_0007_0FA4B708E6DA8498"/>
and ſecondly <hi>attractive or common matter,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Attractive matter is called common matter, becauſe its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal characteriſtics are commonly underſtood; its figure or ſhape, being plainly diſcoverable by the eye; whereas repulſive matter can never be diſcoverable by the eye, becauſe the rays of light, which paint the figure of all objects of ſight, are doubtleſs, no other, than particles of repulſive matter.</note> which occupies but a ſmall proportionate part of ſpace. One very princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals, as well as peculiar attribute of the former, is an invariably repulſive quality, whereby its particles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and violently repel each other; but as conſtantly attract, and of conſequence, are attracted by all common matter—Which laſt, in reſpect of repulſive matter, may be ſub-divided into <hi>plus</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> or more and leſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive powers. Again there is a ſub-diviſion to be made in repellant matter alſo, as appears from electrical experiments on the vitrious and reſinous electricity; but to determine preciſely, how they are diſpoſed towards, or affected by each other, muſt be referred to more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, as well as a greater number of experiments.— The pecular characteriſtic and principal attribute of common matter, is, that its particles conſtantly and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully attract each other, and alſo thoſe of repulſive mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—And when by any <note n="‡" place="bottom">When, by violence, any attempt is made to rob any portion of attractive matter, of its natural proportion of the repulſive, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary proportionate increaſe of attraction, in regard to the repulſive, ſhews the wiſdom of the creator, in diſpoſing that imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial eſſence, which is connected with ſaid attractive matter, thus to act, in order that there ſhould not be a coaleſſence of attractive matter, upon every trivial occaſion.</note> violence, they are robbed of their natural proportion of the repulſive, (in any degree) in the ſame proportion are their attractions, in regard to the repulſive, both ſtronger, and to a greater diſtance; and all theſe attractions, and repulſions are, <hi>coeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> proportionate to the quantity of matter, and their nearneſs; and from theſe axioms, together with the conſideration of the <hi>vis inertiae</hi> of matter may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the general laws, to which are ſubjected all the fluids and ſolids, hitherto known; and all the motion in

the material world, where ſpirit is not the immediate &amp; efficient cauſe—Here it may be aſk'd what then, are rays of light, which the great Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> affirms to be material ſubſtances? and certainly they produce much motion, rarify air, and other ſubſtances, produce that briſk acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on called fire, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If I was to attend to the aforeſaid rule of Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, viz. <hi>not to admit more cauſes, than are, both true and ſufficient to explain the phaenomena,</hi> I would anſwer, that a ſolar ray of light, is no other than a particle of this ſame repulſive matter, juſt now deſcribed, projected forth from the ſurface of the ſun, with ſuch force as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the reſiſtance made by the attracting matter in that body; and ſuddenly paſſing into a repelling medium, with little, or no reſiſtance, it almoſt inſtantaneouſly paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the interſtices, or ſeams near the verge of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſpheres of repulſion; much after the manner that a honey-bee paſſes, when the hunter takes his line—When it arrives at the air's ſurface, it finds more reſiſtance; but from thence to the earth, is a ſmall proportionate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance—When the rays of light arrive at the earth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Sir <hi>Iſaac,</hi> they are there moſtly abſorded— How that great philoſopher means to be underſtood by this, I am at a loſs; whether he means that they are annihilated, or that they have aſſiſted, in increaſing the bulk of this earth for near ſix thouſand years; in conſequence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the ſun has grown leſs, in that proportion—True, I don't find, that he gives us any account of them after this; but I rather think, that had he lived in this day, with advantage of the diſcoveries of that equally great philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, Doctor <hi>Franklin,</hi> he would have employed them in ſupplying the place of thoſe large quantities of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity, or repulſive matter, which are continually paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from this globe, to other parts of the ſyſtem, to reſtore an equilibrium in the ſame; and that ſome of them aſſiſted in preſerving a fluid ſtate in air, ſome in water. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I would here take notice of a very curious experiment, that now occurs to my mind, that has been often try'd,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018058_0009_0FA4B70A5EE5E1B0"/>
tho' not attended to—I mean the collection of nitre from air; a principal part of which laſt, conſiſting of <hi>plus</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive matter, thence collects around each particle, a very large atmoſphere of the repulſive—When the wind, in this country, blows from the N. W. and theſe repelling atmoſpheres, are from any cauſe conſiderably leſſen'd, the projectile motion of the air, being a force added to that of the natural attraction there is between the aerial par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and that of the terrene alkaline ſalt; urges the former (notwithſtanding its repulſive atmoſphere) direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on to the ſaline point; which being accute, more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily enters, taking off the ſaid repelling atmoſphere as it approaches, from the known laws of electricity; whence the ſaid aerial and terrene particles, becoming one, are now of a figure not fit to hold a repelling atmoſphere, on all ſides, having a point that is conſtantly throwing off, as faſt as the other part, tho' <hi>plus</hi> attractive, can take on; &amp; thus polarity being form'd between theſe two primogenial particles, (both which now conjunctly form one corpuſcle) a number of thoſe corpuſcles, being immerg'd in a fluid capable to ſuſpend them, eaſily form into ſhoots which we call nitre; and thus the original fluid and ſolid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles forming this corpuſcle, are generally, both conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in a ſolid form, until ſome ignited particle is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, with ſuch force, as to knock off the ſaid ſaline particle, leaving the aerial naked, and in its original fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; whence it immediately demands its original quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of repulſive atmoſphere; in gaining of which, there being ſuch violent and inſtantaneous demand for room, there are numbers more of thoſe ſpiculae knock'd off by the ſudden motion of the repellent matter; as alſo nearly all the adjacent particles of common matter, projected from thence, with an ignited force, in among the adjacent maſs; and thus is produced a general exploſion of the whole—The terrene and aerial particles, being thus ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the former precipitates to the earth from whence it originated, and there lies ready, either to aſſiſt in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nitre again, or to perform all the offices of vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. that belong to that particular ſubſtance; and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018058_0010_0FA4B70F9332FE48"/>
the latter is now become a fluid again: And as ſoon as it has had ſufficient time to part with its extraordinary quantity of repulſive atmoſphere, is fitted to perform all the purpoſes of reſpiration, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let us next take a view of human blood; I mean, in an athletic perſon. This we may conſider as an hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous maſs, conſiſting of particles or corpuſcles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon matter, differing, not only in magnitude, but figure alſo; whence they are both <hi>plus</hi> and <hi>minus</hi> attractive— Now the conſtant friction, occaſioned by the action of the heart and arteries, collects ſuch large quantities of repulſive matter, that the proportion that each of the <hi>minus</hi> attractive particles naturally take to themſelves, proves ſufficient to produce a fluid ſtate in them; leſſen that friction, to a ſufficient degree, by taking the blood from thoſe veſſels, or by any means prevent this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary quantity of repulſive matter collecting in their neighbourhood, ſo that the proportion of the repulſive that belongs to each <hi>minus</hi> attractive corpuſcle, is not ſufficient to counteract the natural attraction there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves, and they immediately coaleſce; and then, we ſay the blood is coagulated.</p>
            <p>And on theſe principles only, have I ever been able to account for the coagulation of any fluid <hi>whatever</hi>—But here comes a queſtion, viz. <hi>How comes it to paſs then, that the fluids in an egg are coagulated by an extraordinary degree of heat?</hi> I anſwer, that the <hi>plus</hi> attractive particles, which, by their intervention, render fluid all the reſt, are ſo ſhap'd, and ſo extremely minute with-all, that upon any conſiderable addition of repulſive matter, they make their eſcape, even through the ſhell; hence the remaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles immediately coaleſce.</p>
            <p>In farther illuſtration of this ſubject, let us next take a view of the effects of froſt on human fleſh; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a right underſtanding of this matter, it may be neceſſary firſt to inquire, what ſort of ſubſtance may be the proper ſubject of froſt—And here firſt negatively, 'tis neither air, nor earth, nor ſpirit, nor any of the ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginous ſubſtances; for neither of thoſe having been
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018058_0011_0FA4B70FF7D05868"/>
placed in a ſituation ever ſo cold, do we agree to call fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen—But 2dly and poſitively, water alone is, perhaps, the only proper ſubject of froſt; and therefore a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the mechanical operation of froſt on water, will naturally lead the mind to a right view of its effects on human fleſh—Now then, we are to conſider the effects of froſt on water; and here I would make the following ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, viz. 1ſt. That water, in an open veſſel, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heated beyond the 212th degree by Farenheit's thermometer; becauſe, if you add to the water any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of heat, the aqueous particles inſtantly take to themſelves, ſuch large and complete repelling atmoſpheres, as to caſt them out of the ſpheres of the corpuſcular attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each other, and thence they become air; for there is doubtleſs no eſſential difference between water and air, only the particles compoſing the one are within, but the other without the ſpheres of their corpuſcular attractions. 2dly. That water will decreaſe in its quantity or bulk, exactly according to the increaſe of cold, from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible degree of its rarefaction, viz. From the 212th degree of heat, even down to the 32d degree—Now 'tis plain, that in all this proceſs, the aqueous particles are conſtantly approaching nearer to each other; but when it comes to the 32d degree, which is the freezing point, and the particles are about to come in contact, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or bulk of the water will inſtantly be enlarg'd, by reaſon that the particles of the ſame, in order to preſent their more angular or pointed parts to each other, will alter their ſituation, by ſuddenly turning out of that cloſe and compact poſition, reſpecting each other, in which they were before conſtantly kept, by common gravitation. Hence, ice occupies more cubic meaſure, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is ſpecifically lighter than water.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, 'tis eaſy to ſee how hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fleſh muſt be affected by froſt; eſpecially when we conſider that the whole of human fleſh is compoſed of fluids, (the baſis of which is water) and the veſſels which contain them; which veſſels are continually contracting and growing ſtronger, as the cold advances, until it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018058_0012_0FA4B71235B851C0"/>
at the freezing point; at which time, the fluids, with which the veſſels are already filled, being inſtantly enlarged, by a force that is not to be reſiſted; the effect which this muſt have on the containing veſſels, needs no deſcription.</p>
            <p>I beg leave here to recite the following, nearly as it was delivered before the ſociety:</p>
            <p>Diſcourſe on Burns and Scalds.</p>
            <p>THE chief deſign of the following diſcourſe, being to point out a method of treating thoſe wounds received by fire, (commonly called burns or ſcalds) better, and more rational than is commonly practiſed in the country; and it being generally neceſſary to inveſtigate the cauſe of a diſeaſe, before we can proceed to preſcribe a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al method of cure; it may be neceſſary to obſerve the following method, viz. Firſt to ſay ſomething on the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of fire; 2dly, on the mechanical operation in its action; 3dly, its effects on human fleſh; and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the general intention:</p>
            <p>Firſt then, I am to ſay ſomething concerning the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of fire—This has been thought, (perhaps by ſome of the greateſt geniuſes in all ages, from the firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, even down to the preſent day) to be one of the moſt ſurprizing and unaccountable creatures of God: ſome of the antients obſerv'd that wherever a man was (and could himſelf ſubſiſt) whether on Pizgah's top, or in the deepeſt vault, on board a ſhip, many leagues off at ſea, or in the hold of the ſame, many feet beneath the ſurface of the water, in open day, or even in the darkeſt dungeon, if he ſhould only do this ſmall homage, viz. To ſtrike two hard ſubſtances together, ſuch as a flint and a bit of ſteel, or the like—This won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful eſſence would inſtantly make its appearance to his aſſiſtance, preſenting him a comfortable degree of both light and heat—This circumſtance looking ſo much like omnipreſence, many of them miſtook this creature for the creator, and worſhiped it accordingly; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for I think, that without the light of a divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018058_0013_0FA4B712A7C774D8"/>
the miſtake muſt have been, in their day, pretty eaſy and natural—Among the modern of all the writers on the eſſence of fire, that I have had the peruſal of, I think the great <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> appears to be the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious; but he, groſsly miſtook his point—He gave us no ſatisfactory account of the eſſence of fire, neither is this to be wondered at, for he ſought it where it was not to be found, viz. In material ſubſtance—But he who rightly attends to the very intereſting diſcoveries of the great Doctor <hi>Franklin,</hi> will find, that the eſſence of fire conſiſts in motion; and that this motion is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular effect of certain qualities, viz. Attraction, and repulſion, and the <hi>vis inertiae</hi> of matter; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears, but that the ſame particle that did once attract, ever continues to attract, and that the particle that did once repel, continues ſo to act, and that they both conſtantly and invariably obſerve all the laws of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and repulſion, whether they aſſiſt in compoſing the body which we call frozen, or that of a hot flame. I come now to conſider the mechanical operation in its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion — And here, firſt I would conſider that moſt eminent of all, that appears in the exploſion of nitre, which the reader may reflect has been before particularly treated of, under the head of the formation of that ſubſtance, where we have a view of the mechanical operation of a fire, the moſt ſudden and violent—Now, in order to render this fire leſs violent and more laſting, (ſuch as might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a culinary fire) you have nothing farther to do, but to add thereto and intimately mix with the nitrous maſs, a ſufficient quantity of attractive matter, whoſe intervening particles, are leſs attractive, in regard to the repulſive; and you then have a view of a culinary fire, which will be more or leſs violent, according to the quantity of intervening matter, and according as the ſaid intervening matter is more or leſs attractive, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the repulſive; thus much for the mechanical operation of fire in its action—I am now thirdly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the effect of this action of fire, on human fleſh; and here firſt I would obſerve, that whenever any body of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018058_0014_0FA4B7135FE66990"/>
matter, heated to a high degree, is oppoſed ſo near to human fleſh, as that the ignited particles that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from ſaid heated body, enter, and paſs thro' the interſtices of the ſolid fleſh, with ſuch force and in ſuch abundance, as by their extraordinary friction, to invite ſuch large quantities of repelling, into the region of the fleſh, as that the particles or corpuſcles compoſing the ſolid fibre of the fleſh, beginning to take to themſelves ſuch large and complete repelling atmoſpheres, as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to overcome the reſiſtance made by that attraction, whereby they ſubſiſt in a natural fibre; then we may juſtly ſay, that fleſh is burn'd or ſcalled: And it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs impoſſible, by any art whatever, to re-vivificate, or reſtore this fleſh to proper life again—But there is a ſeam or ſpace between this dead fleſh, and that which has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered nothing as yet by this extraordinary flux of repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, in which the <hi>plus</hi> attractive ends or parts, of the component particles or corpuſcles, ſtand at diſtances from each other; while the other ends or parts, that are more pointed, and therefore <hi>minus</hi> attractive, adhere ſtill to the healthy part—This gives to the patient, the idea of extreme pain, and is, according to the great <hi>Boerhaave's</hi> definition of pain, viz. A tendency towards a diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of continuity, in the component parts of a fibre— Thus much for its effects on human fleſh—I am now to point out a method of treating thoſe wounds received by fire; and the firſt intention appears to be, to preſerve from putrefaction, that portion of fleſh, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the healthy and the dead fleſh; which can be done in no way, but by applying, externally, thoſe ſubſtances as will ſo violently attract the repellency from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of its component parts, as that its particles will coaleſce with each other, in the ſame manner as they did in the healthy ſtate. The ſubſtance which moſt ſtrongly attracts, and is the beſt conductor for the electricity, is cold water—But that it may be holden, with convenience to the part, I have made a cataplaſm therewith, by the admixture of ſome farinaceous ſubſtances; ſuch as Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an meal, ſcrap'd potatoes, or the like—Some object to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018058_0015_0FA4B714264E1378"/>
this practice and ſay, it ſubjects the patient to take cold, ſo much cold water, &amp;c. being applied: But it ought to be conſidered, that as taking cold is no other than perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being obſtructed—Perſpiration, in this caſe, cannot be obſtructed, for that is already done, by an abſolute deſtruction of the cutaneous glands; therefore not the leaſt danger from this quarter.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as your poultice is on, the pain ceaſes; but when the pain returns, change your poultice, for the part next to the fleſh has, by the heat of the fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo warm, that it does not attract the repellency ſtrongly enough—And thus we ought always to proceed, until this kind of incipient gangrene is intirely gone; and then apply digeſtives, &amp;c. as in caſe of other wounds, and it will be found to heal as faſt as any other whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver—Thus much for external application—But it often happens, that ſo great a part of the cutis is deſtroy'd by a burn or ſcald, that ſuch a proportion of the <hi>materia perſpirabila</hi> is retained in the habit, as that (by a coaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of its particles, and ſo forming obſtructions) a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is the conſequence; and this fever is generally very highly inflammatory, and therefore very dangerous; for being ardent, it very often turns malignant—Therefore, when a perſon is conſiderably burn'd or ſcalled, he ought always to be carefully watched by the phyſician; and upon the very firſt appearance of a fever, either phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy or a cathartic febrifuge, or both, ought forthwith to be adminiſtered; and in this way, may the fever be entirely prevented, and a perfect cure will ſucceed, as faſt as the wheels of nature can advance—Now if theſe ſentiments are juſt, and this practice warrantable, and I think they can be vindicated, upon the moſt ſtrict theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical principles, as well as reiterated experiments; then how may we deplore, the excruciating torture, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced chiefly by thoſe who are in their tender years of childhood, as well as loſs of life occaſioned by a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry practice?</p>
            <p>I would next, take a view of that perpetual motion in an animal, call'd <hi>reſpiration</hi>—The reader may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018058_0016_0FA4B714EA958510"/>
that when ſpeaking about the particles of attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive matter, it was obſerv'd, that when, (by any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they are robb'd of their natural proportion of the repulſive in any degree) in the ſame proportion are their attractions, in regard to the repulſive, both ſtronger, and to a greater diſtance.</p>
            <p>This appears from the manner of collecting the repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter, by the electrical apparatus; for by rubbing the globe againſt the cuſhion, and ſo conſtantly robbing the outermoſt vitreous particles, of their natural propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the repulſive; you not only, hence charge your apparatus with electricity, but impregnate the region round about; nay, the whole electric room is ſo filled with repellent matter, that atoms, floating in the air, take to themſelves ſuch large repelling atmoſpheres, that they are ſeen for a long time after, to repel each other at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtances; but in time, an equilibrium is reſtored. Now the body of an animal, may be compar'd to the electric room, the blood and arteries, which keep a conſtant friction, to the glaſs globe and cuſhion, and perhaps the nervous veſſels to the conductor, or common recepticle of the repellent matter; now by the friction, occaſioned by the motion of the blood, there are large quantities of repellent matter collected therein, which is generally pretty equally diſtributed throughout the whole maſs. In a <hi>faetus in utero,</hi> where the fluids in the <hi>faetus, amnios,</hi> &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are all ſo connected, as that if you leſſen the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of repellency in the one, you alſo diminiſh it in the other—They all conjunctly forming one general maſs, the mother breathing for the whole, they are generally all equally fraught with repellent matter.</p>
            <p>In all <hi>faetuſes,</hi> both of viviparous, and oviparous ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, although the lungs are found collapſed, the mouth ſhut, &amp;c. yet the <hi>aſpera arteria,</hi> &amp; <hi>bronchii,</hi> are ever found nearly empty, open, and not collapſed, as the lungs are; yet the fluids in the <hi>amnios</hi> (being equally fraught with repellent matter) are not attracted by the blood in the lungs, which is the reaſon, why the lungs are not fill'd with the fluids contain'd in the <hi>amnios</hi>; but as ſoon as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018058_0017_0FA4B715ACB246A8"/>
the cold air takes place in lieu of the ſaid fluids, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt violently attracted by the blood in the lungs, immediately ruſhes in <hi>qua data porta,</hi> and inflates them— But, when the air has enter'd the lungs, it cannot ſtay there for a moment—But being divided into an almoſt infinite number of ſtreams, that are ſurrounded by ſo great a proportion of blood, in the <hi>pulmonie</hi> and other arteries, and their returning veins, the arteries coming in a direct courſe from the right ventricle of the heart, and fraught with as much repellent matter, as any part of the juices; hence the aeriel particles, (taking to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an equal quantity of repellent matter, and thereby forming exceeding large repelling atmoſpheres) are thence immediately forced out, by way of the mouth or noſe— Here, at firſt thought, it would be natural to ſuppoſe, that no more air would be forc'd out, than to reſtore an equilibrium; and that therefore there was nothing to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a ſecond inſpiration—But it ought to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the <hi>pulmonic</hi> blood, that has juſt ſuffered a great loſs of repellent matter, which was taken out of it, and carried off, in the aeriel atmoſpheres of the laſt expiration, is directly replete with its proportion of repellency, from the remainder of the maſs of blood; hence the ſame cauſe obtains, to produce a ſecond inſpiration, as did in the firſt, and ſo on—Thus, I think, I have given a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical account of the true cauſe of reſpiration.</p>
            <p>I am now to ſay ſomething concerning its uſe, which is very great indeed; for without it, animal life, by the known laws of nature, could not exiſt: All animals that have fallen under our inſpection, do breathe; even from an elephant, down to the ſmalleſt reptile; from a ſtork, to an houſe-fly; and from a whale, even down to a ſprat; they all breathe, that is, they do inſpire, or ſuck in; and then, at ſhort intervals, puff out again ſome kind of fluid; ſome have their lungs ſeated in one part, ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the common houſe-fly has her's ſeated near the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the back, and the <hi>trachea</hi> comes out a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the wing; but ſhe does breathe—And it doubleſs anſwers the ſame grand purpoſe, as in other animals, that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018058_0018_0FA4B71663CB8B30"/>
is, it preſerves a conſtant ſtream or current of electricity or repellent matter, through ſome certain tubes in the body of the animal; which ſtream or current, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> and efficient cauſe of all involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary animal motion; on which immediately depends, all thoſe motions which are voluntary, in which a muſcle acts by the ſame laws, and in the ſame manner, as it does in that motion which is involuntary—Thus much appears to me eaſy, plain and natural; but here we muſt ſtop with our reſearches—If we proceed any farther herein, we get on hallowed ground—This is too near the immediate finger of the creator—We know, the will does determine the time and quantity of motion, in every voluntary act of a muſcle—But a knowledge of the manner, in which that ſomething, which is capable of volition, acts on the body, preſuppoſes a knowledge of the <hi>modus</hi> of union between ſoul and body; which, I ſhould think, neceſſarily implied in it, a knowledge of the <hi>modus</hi> in the operation of the divine ſpirit, in the exerciſe of creating power, which doubleſs is a matter too deep, even for the higheſt created intelligence in Heaven to look into: Therefore, it can be no impeachment of the character of any gentleman, as a phyſician—A wiſe man, or philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, to ſay that he knows nothing about the matter.</p>
            <p>The following is inſerted by particular deſire:</p>
            <p>THE mechanical operation of mercury, on the human juices, which has long ſince been deſcribed by the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> in the 5th vol. of his inſtitutes, to thoſe gentlemen of the faculty, who have been honeſt in the purſuit of their proper buſineſs, is generally known— In which deſcription, it plainly appears by the laws of projectiles, that not the ſolids, but the fluids are prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and principally acted upon; in this view, there can be no irritation of the veſſels; hence nothing of draſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in its operation—But the chief deſign of this part of my diſcourſe, being to recommend the uſe of the above me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine in ſevers, it may be proper to have recourſe chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to facts—Firſt then, in all inflammatory fevers, ſuch as pleuriſies, peripneumonies, meaſles, what is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018058_0019_0FA4B7176E369100"/>
called rattles in children, ſmall-pox, &amp;c. I have for a courſe of about 12 years, given it as my moſt common febrifuge; and it has proved in almoſt all, a moſt ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſafe and effectual remedy—The morbid ſerous cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which we call inflammatory lentor, ſtand no more chance before it, than ſo many ſnow-balls would, before the projectile force of cannon ball—Thoſe fevers flee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its operation, as the dew before the ſun. I very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten find no occaſion to exhibit it more than once, ſeldom more than twice, and don't remember an inſtance that I ever gave it more than thrice, before the fever ſubſided; but I have not had opportunity to exhibit it, in a proper manner, to more than ſix or ſeven perſons, who had the ſmall-pox the natural way: But in thoſe it had a very good effect, the patients recovered, and had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order light—When I conſider the operation of it in the above caſes, I call it the moſt expeditious, ſafe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual febrifuge, that I ever knew; and it has no leſs ſalutary effect on fevers of the putrid or malignant kind, by its projectile force, flying in the arteries ſo much ſwifter than the reſt of the juices; it knocks off the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles or <hi>ſpicula</hi> of the morbific or putrid corpuſcles, which carries on the work of putrefaction, in ſuch manner, &amp; ſo abſolutely, as to intirely prevent any farther putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the juices; at the ſame time, opening the emunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and carrying off what is already rendered unfit for circulation—I have given it in many of the above mentioned caſes; and one inſtance I remember, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, where the blood was ſo diſſolved, as that when I was firſt called to the patient, he bled at the noſe, void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blood by urine and by ſtool, and ſpit blood; I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gave him down about 35 grains of calomel, and it happen'd very lucky, for it operated not as a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartic, ſhort of about ſix hours, and then gently paſſed off by ſtool; by which time, all the haemorrhages ceaſed, and by the help of a ſtrong decoction of the bark, in large doſes, the patient recovered.</p>
            <p>When I alſo conſider its operation in putrid fevers, I am conſtrain'd to call it, not only expeditious, ſafe and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018058_0020_0FA4B71ACB005860"/>
effectual, but the moſt univerſal febrifuge; and in its effects, the greateſt antiputreſcent, hitherto known— Neither ſhould the phyſician fear to give it, on account of its deſolving the blood, and ſo haſtening the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the ſame; for it has no ſuch tendency: If a liberal uſe of it does any miſchief to the juices in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it is in rendering them aqueous and ſo bringing on a dropſy, a ſtate of the juices very oppoſite to that of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy—Moreover, it ought to be conſider'd, that if by paſſing ſwifter in the arteries, it ſhould break a few of the red globules of blood; yet millions of morbid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, are hereby ſo trimmed of their numberleſs <hi>ſpicula</hi> as that they become innocent—But to return to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the operation of this medicine, in inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fevers, and here I would obſerve, that the higher, and more ardent the fever, the more difficult to raiſe a <hi>ptyaliſm</hi>—In ſhort, in an acute fever, you can retain the mercury in the habit but for a very few hours, unleſs the fever ſubſide.</p>
            <p>If therefore, I find my potion ſuddenly paſs off by ſtool, and the fever very little abated, I conclude then, either that not much has enter'd the lacteals, and ſo paſs'd into circulation, or rather, that what of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel, that has entered the lacteals, has too ſoon paſs'd out, by the <hi>hepatic</hi> veſſels—As ſoon therefore as the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharſis</hi> is a little over, I give a doſe or two of calomel, 3 or 4 grains at a time, waiting a few hours between; and then in ſix, eight, or 12 hours, more or leſs, give a ſufficiency of the ſame to purge—My common doſe for an adult, is from eight to thirty five grains; and I by no means give much leſs to children, on account that daily experience ſhews, that, for a general rule, about the ſame quantity of any kind of phyſic, as will purge the child, will alſo purge the adult; by reaſon that a great part of the potion is commonly inveloped in the phlegm, which is apt to collect in large quantities, in the ſtomach and inteſtines of youthful perſons—Very great indeed have been the prejudices, againſt this moſt

uſeful and ſalutary medicine; ariſing chiefly, from a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken notion, that a fever render'd the uſe of it dangerous, &amp; ſo it was given only where a fever was abſent, and in low caſes, the only caſe in which it ever lodges in the habit, and is miſchievous in the bones, &amp;c. and in which caſe ſpecial care ought always to be taken, to keep up a proper tone to the <hi>ſanguiferous</hi> veſſels, either by well tim'd <hi>epiſpaſticks,</hi> or ſome other proper ſtimulants, which would intirely prevent the evil—A neighbour of mine, a man of about thirty years of age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under an hectic fever, for upwards of a year, which he had acquired from a ſurfeit by over excerciſe, I viſited him often, for about ſix months, but gave him nothing of conſequence beſides calomel, and balf. tolu, with loaf ſugar; which, being wet with water, would form into pills, that would eaſily diſſolve in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach—This he took every day or two, thro' the whole term, and then the acrimony being all deſtroy'd by force of the calomel the fever left him; and by the help of a tincture of the bark, in a ſyrup of the opening roots, he in a very few weeks, recovered his ſtrength, and is now in health—Moreover, if I give not my patient over at firſt view, I never think I am called in too late; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wait I for, nor pay the leaſt regard to an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing critical hour—My patient being ever ſo weak, I admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter calomel, which by reſolving the obſtructing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fitting it to paſs the emunctories, &amp;c. brings on a criſis forthwith, and all this, is without the leaſt force on nature—I think little, or nothing more needs be ſaid to the ingenious, intirely to prevent any future miſchief being done by this ineſtimable medicine—One word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the ſick, and their friends, and I have done— And here I would obſerve, that among the deceaſed, more than nine tenths of them would probably recover, only living in that abſtemious way, which is generally natural to the ſick, merely by force of the operations of that honeſt phyſician <hi>nature,</hi> who is conſtantly uſing her endeavour, and doctering for no pay, cares not how ſoon

ſhe makes a cure; nay, I have often known her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſo forcible, that ſhe has finally perfected a cure, in ſpite of both patient and quack, conſtantly affording her, all the interruption in their power; and ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity as this, (being all the knowledge the quack has in phyſic) is inſtantly embraced, and by him publiſh'd in <hi>Gath,</hi> and affords him large opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to murder numbers with impunity. The want of proper regulations among practitioners at preſent, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it almoſt impoſſible effectually to guard againſt this prenicious evil, which I verily believe, has been the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of more American lives, than have fallen in battle for five years paſt—However, 'tis to be hoped that the time is approaching, when this country will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no Initiation into the practice of phyſic, without a public examination before ſome reſpectable body of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians.</p>
