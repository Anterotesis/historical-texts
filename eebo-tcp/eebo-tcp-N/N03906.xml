            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S we are fallen Creatures, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in a loſt, and periſhing Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the firſt, and chief Thing that ſhould be thought of by us, and that, which, (if we would act like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Beings) ought in a Manner to ſwallow up all our other Concerns, is; how, or whereby we may be ſaved? But who is there of you, but muſt be ſenſible that it is ſomething elſe that takes up the Thoughts, and employs the Enquiries of a buiſy World; and that with too many this is the leaſt, and laſt of their Cares?</p>
            <p>BUT then of thoſe that are not without all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Anxiety as to their own Salvation, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of them appear to be too little concerned for the Salvation of the reſt of Mankind. Whereas tho' we are firſt to look to our own Souls; the divine and heavenly Religion we profeſs, requires that we
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004806_0004_100E29D556561BF0"/>
don't confine our Regards to our ſelves, but extend them to others, and expreſs a juſt Concern, not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their preſent, but for their future and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Welfare. And accordingly the Words I have now read to you breath the true Spirit and Temper of it.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle having been ſpeaking of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and being about to diſcourſe farther upon the ſame Subject, leaſt what he had ſaid, or might ſay, ſhould ſeem to proceed from any Diſaffection to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; he makes a ſolemn Declaration of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Love to them, and his deep Concern for them. Yea, ſo great was the Regard he had for them, and ſo ſollicitous was he for their Happineſs, that he was almoſt ready, and willing to forego his own for the ſake of it. As in the third Verſe of the immediately preceeding Chapter, <hi>For I could wiſh that my ſelf were accurſed from Chriſt, for my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, my Kinſmen according to the Fleſh.</hi> If by wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf accurſed from Chriſt, he means that he could be content to be cut off from the Land of the living, as an <hi>Anathema,</hi> or a devoted Perſon, and to be remov'd out of the World in a moſt ignominious Manner, would it conduce to their Felicity. Or if he intends that he ſhould be willing to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from the Society of the Faithful, to be ſeparated from their Communion, and even to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a Heathen Man, and a Publican. That if their beſt Intereſts would be promoted by it, he could wiſh himſelf no more remembred among the Saints, and his Name blotted out of the Records of the Church: This is a ſtrong Evidence of his Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Regard for them. But then there are ſome that carry the Expreſſion higher, and ſuppoſe that he here means his being really ſeperated from Chriſt, and cut off from reaping any Benefit by him. But then they juſtly obſerve, that he does not ſay, I do
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004806_0005_100E29D711E17BF0"/>
               <hi>wiſh,</hi> but <hi>could wiſh my ſelf accurſed from Chriſt.</hi> As we are wont to ſay, when we would expreſs a Thing to the Heigth which is not fit, nor intended to be done by us: I could wiſh even ſo, or ſo: I could be content to do this, or that. So, when the Apoſtle thus expreſſes himſelf, they conceive it to be as much as if he had ſaid, So great is my Concern for my Countrymen the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were it proper, and would it prevail to the procuring of their Salvation, I could be willing to undergo the greateſt of Evils, and almoſt to wiſh my own Deſtruction for the ſake of it. So that the Apoſtle may be conſider'd as giving us the Senſe of what he had before ſaid, and as repeating much the ſame Thing, when he makes this ſolemn Declaration, and ſays, <hi>My Heart's Deſire and Prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſpeaking to theſe Words there are two Things that I would take Notice of, and briefly ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE vaſt Worth and Importance of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and Bleſſing here ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> The being ſaved. And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE vehement Deſire the Apoſtle had that others might be Partakers of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I AM to take Notice of the vaſt Worth, and Importance of the Benefit, and Bleſſing here ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> The being ſaved. When the Apoſtle was about to give the ſtrongeſt and fulleſt Evidence that poſſibly he could of his good Will to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, how does he expreſs it, but by his Deſire that they might be ſaved? Plainly intimating, that nothing elſe would be ſo advantageous, or was of ſo much Moment to them: And it is certainly of equal Importance to all. This being not the Thing that I had chiefly in View in diſcourſing from the Words, I ſhall ſay but little to it at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004806_0006_100E29DCB6C70E58"/>BY the being ſaved, I here mean the being ſaved from the Wrath and Curſe of God, and the Miſeries conſequent upon it. This is what by the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and our own actual Sin, we have fallen under. But as there is a Poſſibility of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, it is a Thing of the utmoſt Conſequence that we attain to it. It is of very great Importance to us that we be ſaved at Death: That our Souls when they put off theſe Earthly Tabernacles, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from falling into the Hands of Devils: That they may eſcape that Place and State of Torment that is prepared and reſerved for the ſeparate Spirits of the Wicked, and go to aſſociate with the pure and perfected Spirits of the Juſt. And then it is of great Importance to us that we be ſaved at the final Judgment, and general Diſſolution. We are told of a Day that is approaching when our <hi>Lord ſhall deſcend from Heaven in flaming Fire to take Vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not his Goſpel:</hi> When <hi>the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great Noiſe, and the Elements melt with fervent Heat; when the Earth, and the Works that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhall be burnt up.</hi> And if we look for ſuch Things, muſt it not be a Thing of great Concernment to every one, that when this Day of the Lord ſhall come, they may be found of him in Peace? Will it not be a fearful Thing to be then diſowned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by him? O! What will become of you, when being doom'd to everlaſting Fire, you find your ſelves ſurrounded with mercileſs Flames, and being caſt out of the Divine Protection, have no where to flee? How inconceivably wretched will be your Caſe, when you find your ſelves cut off from the Proſpect of preſent Deliverance, and from any Hopes of future Releaſe?</p>
            <p>OF what vaſt Importance is it then now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Place of Refuge and Shelter againſt that great and terrible Day; that ſo you may be accounted
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004806_0007_100E29DF60726968"/>
worthy to eſcape theſe Things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of Man? That whilſt others are caſt into outer Darkneſs, and left to dwell with everlaſting Burnings, you may be caught up to the Heaven of Heavens, may take up your Reſidence with God, and bleſſed Spirits in thoſe Realms of uninterrupted Light, and your Body and Soul be poſſeſſed of compleat and perfect Bleſſedneſs for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>ALL this, and much more is included in the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpoken of in the Text. It muſt needs then be a rich and valuable Bleſſing, and a Thing of the greateſt Importance to attain to it.</p>
            <p>AND now if it be ſo, why ſhould we any of us wonder, and now can we think it ſtrange, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſo deeply anxious as they ſometimes are, about their own Salvation? Such is the Importance of the Thing; ſo much more difficult is it than many are aware of to attain to it; ſo ſtrait is the Gate, and ſo narrow the Way that leads to it, and ſo few there be that find it: In a Word, ſuch is the Danger of coming ſhort of it, and ſo diſmal the Thought of miſcarrying, and of being loſt for ever, that there is not the leaſt Room to admire, that thoſe that are in the due Exerciſe of their Intellectual Powers ſhould be under great Concern, and in deep Diſtreſs of Soul, till they have a good and comfortable Hope, and Proſpect of it.</p>
            <p>BUT on the other Hand, what Reaſon have we to ſtand amazed at the Careleſneſs and Security of the greater Part of Mankind? Were we to argue from the Behaviour of the Generality of the Sons and Daughters of Men, we ſhould be apt to conclude that their Salvation was a Thing of but very little Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and be almoſt ready to think it a Matter of Indifferency to them, whether they are ſaved, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are damned. They have commonly very fearful Apprehenſions of Poverty and Contempt, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004806_0008_100E29E38F7B8040"/>
the other Inconveniencies and Miſchiefs they are liable to in this Life, and take a great deal of Pains to ſecure themſelves from them: But they ſeem to be no ways afraid of Hell, or of the endleſs and inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Miſeries of another Life, and take hardly any Thought or Care that they may eſcape them. O! the lamentable Blindneſs and Stupidity of the Sons of Men. Wilt thou be pleaſed infinitely good God, to open their Eyes? Awaken their ſleepy, dead Souls; ſhew them the Dangers that ſurround them; make them to ſee of what Importance it is to be ſaved; and then they'll give all Diligence to work out their own Salvation; and not only ſo, but will be doing all they can to promote the Salvation of all that are near to them. And ſo I come to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing that I took Notice of, and am to ſay ſomething to, from the Words, <hi>viz.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's vehement Deſire that others might be Partakers of the great and important Bleſſing he here ſpeaks of. <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my Heart's Deſire and Prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved.</hi> And in ſhewing himſelf thus earneſtly deſirous of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of others, he is to be conſider'd as a Pattern to Chriſtians in all ſucceeding Ages, and as well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their Imitation. We are all then to take Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from him in manifeſting our ſelves earneſtly deſirous of the Salvation of others. And here I ſhall ſay, 1ſt, Whoſe Salvation are we thus earneſtly to deſire. 2. How and in what Way we are to manifeſt our ſelves deſirous of it. 3. Whence or upon what Account we are to do it: And then conclude with ſome proper Uſe of the whole.</p>
            <p>HERE then I am briefly to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHO they are whoſe Salvation we are thus earneſtly to deſire. And in general, we are to deſire the Salvation of all, without excepting any of the whole humane Race.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004806_0009_100E29E673F68938"/>GOD made of one Blood all Nations of Men for to dwell on the Face of the Earth. We had all one Father, and partake of one and the ſame Nature; and therefore however diſtinguiſh'd into different Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages or Religions, we are to be ſollicitous for the everlaſting Happineſs one of another. There are none of the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> of whatever Nation or Complexion, but may be ſaid to be our Brethren; and therefore it ſhould be our Heart's Deſire, if it were the Will of God, that they may be ſaved: We are to deſire with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.2. <hi>That God's Way may be known in the Earth, and his ſaving Health among all Nations.</hi> That they that are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the great Salvation that God reveals and offers in his Goſpel may be made acquainted with it. And that they that have the Overtures and Tenders of it, may accept of them and cloſe with them. And ſo I proceed to ſay, that tho' we are to wiſh the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, there are ſome whoſe Salvation we are in a more eſpecial Manner to deſire. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE are eſpecially to deſire the Salvation of thoſe that are not only of the ſame Nature, but of the ſame Faith and Religion with us.</p>
            <p>BY thoſe of the ſame Religion with us, I don't here mean thoſe only that are exactly of the ſame Opinion, or of our own Party and Perſwaſion; but all that own the ſame common Faith, that profeſs the ſame Chriſtian Doctrine; all that are of the Church or Iſrael of God in general; all that as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, in every Place call on the Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; both theirs, and ours; to whom he wiſhes Grace, Mercy, and Peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1ſt Chap. 2d Verſe. And thus far are we all oblig'd to extend our good and charitable Wiſhes; even to all our Chriſtian Brethren, however they may be divided into different Parties and Opinions, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004806_0010_100E29E934A1F408"/>
diſtinguiſh'd by various Denominations: It ſhould be our Heart's Deſire concerning them all, that they may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, in the next Place, Chriſtians ſhould yet more eſpecially wiſh this Bleſſing to thoſe that are peculiarly near and dear to them, either on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſpecial Relation they ſtand in to them, or any Benefits they have conferred upon them. You are to be ſollicitous not only for the temporal, but for the ſpiritual and everlaſting Welfare of Huſbands and Wives; of Parents and Children; of Brethren and Siſters; of Benefactors and Friends that are as your own Souls. Brethren, it ſhould be your Heart's Deſire for them that they may be ſaved. You are indeed to wiſh well to the ſpiritual and eternal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of Strangers, and even of Enemies; to bleſs them that curſe you; to do good to them that hate you; to pray for them that deſpitefully uſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you. But tho' your greateſt Perſecutors, and bittereſt Enemies are not to be excluded from your kind Wiſhes, there is no Doubt but that your near Friends are peculiarly entitled to them.</p>
            <p>AND then I may add once more, that Chriſtians ſhould in a very peculiar Manner deſire the Salvation of thoſe of their own immediate Houſhold. If he that provides not for his own, eſpecially for thoſe of his own Houſe, upon temporal Accounts, and takes no Care for the Supply of their bodily Wants, meets with ſo ſharp a Reproof from the Apoſtle, of how much ſeverer Cenſure ſhall he be thought worthy, who neglects their eternal Intereſts, and cares not what becomes of their precious and immortal Souls. Whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are that Providence brings into your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and puts under your Care, be they bond or free, white or black, you are to be ſollicitous for their Souls Welfare, and to be heartily deſirous that they
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004806_0011_100E29EC5936F4C0"/>
may be ſaved. Having thus hinted to you who they are whoſe Salvation we are earneſtly to deſire, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. HOW and in what Way we are to manifeſt our ſelves deſirous of it. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE are to ſhew our ſelves heartily deſirous of the Salvation of others, by our fervent Prayers to God for it: This is agreeable to the Apoſtolick Pattern here in the Text; <hi>My Heart's Deſire,</hi> ſays this divine and inſpir'd Writer, he adds, and my <hi>Prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle elſewhere tells us, that it is the Will of God that Prayers and Interceſſions as well as giving of Thanks ſhould be made for all Men.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. ii. 1.</note> Accordingly we are to pray for them that <hi>they may be ſaved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> We are to beg of God that he would diſpel thoſe Clouds of Ignorance and Error that overſpread ſo great a Part of the known World; that <hi>the Nations may be glad and ſing for Joy, and that all the Ends of the Earth may ſee the Salvation of God</hi>; that he would ſend forth his Light and his Truth; that the Truth, even as it is in Jeſus, may be embraced by all that profeſs his Name; and that all that own the ſame common Lord and Saviour, may ſhare with us in his ſaving Benefits.</p>
            <p>BUT then we are to be peculiarly earneſt and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in our Prayers for the Salvation of ſuch as fall under our more immediate Watch and Care; for ſuch as ſtand in any ſpecial Relation, and for all that have been remarkably kind and beneficent to us. As we are eſpecially to deſire the Salvation of ſuch, ſo I ſay we are with a peculiar Fervency to pray for it: We are to interceed with God for their temporal, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for their eternal Welfare: We are to pray for them as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> does for <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> who <hi>was not aſhamed of his Bonds, but when he was at Rome
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004806_0012_100E29EE527F7940"/>
ſought him out diligently, found him, and oft refreſhed him: The Lord grant,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that he may find Mercy of the Lord in that Day,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.18. Thus ſhould we expreſs our Deſires of the Salvation of others, by our fervent Prayers to God for it. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are to do this by our earneſt Endeavours to promote it. If theſe are wanting, our ſeeming Deſires that they may be ſaved are but an idle Pretence, and our Prayers nothing more than a vain and empty Shew. If we would make it evident that we heartily deſire their Salvation, we muſt do what we can as we have Opportunity for the Furtherance of it. It will become us to do all that is in our Power, that ſuch as are deſtitute of the appointed Means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be brought to the Enjoyment of them, and that thoſe that enjoy them, may reap the Benefit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them. We are particularly to endeavour the Salvation of ſuch as come under our immediate View and Obſervation; eſpecially of thoſe we are any ways related to, or concerned with. Do we perceive them to be in the Gall of Bitterneſs and Bonds of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and apprehend that if they continue in their preſent State they are in the Way to Death and Hell, we are not to look upon them with Indifferency and Unconcernedneſs of Soul; nor barely to behold them with ſomething of Compaſſion and Concern, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to breath out a Wiſh on their Behalf; but to labour to convince them of their miſerable and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Eſtate, and do what we can that they may be converted and brought out of it: We are to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that they may be reclaim'd from their Errors of Practice, and alſo from their Errors of Judgment, which, tho' they are in a good Meaſure recover'd from the former, may prove fatal to them: We are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to do what we can to take them off from any miſtaken Notion they may be ſubject to, as to the Terms of their Acceptance with God: To put them
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004806_0013_100E29F3F02FA1E0"/>
upon ſeeking for Juſtification only by Faith in the Son of God, by being found in him, and having on his Righteouſneſs; and to guard them againſt truſting in their own Duties and Performances, which, without Doubt is, and has been the eternal undoing of a great many Souls. This the Text leads me particularly to take Notice of: It being the very Caſe as to thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> for whom the Apoſtle expreſſes ſo much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; and therefore he adds in the very next Words, <hi>I bear them Record that they have a Zeal of God, but not according to Knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> They were very zealous for the Law, and for the ceremonial Obſervances of it; they were conſcientious and ſcrupulous in complying with them; and were ſome of them very exact and careful in their Morals: But here was their fatal Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, that they reſted in theſe Things, and thought hereby to recommend themſelves to the Favour of God. And this it's to be feared is the Error of a great many profeſs'd Chriſtians at this Day: They have ſome ſort of Zeal for God, tho' not according to Knowledge: They make a conſiderable Stir with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Circumſtantials of Religion: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with a great deal of Warmth about outward Modes and Forms; ſome one Way, and others the Reverſe: They come before God as his People, and obſerve all the ſtated Seaſons of his publick Worſhip: They abound in external Performances, and are civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd in their Lives and Manners; and upon theſe Things they depend to procure them Acceptance with God. But if there be any of you that have no other Foundation for your Hope, it will aſſuredly <hi>be cut off, and your Truſt be as the Spider's Web.</hi> Upon Enquiry you'll find that the Phariſees did as much as this, and yet our Saviour expreſsly tells us, <hi>that our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004806_0014_100E29F6E289D3D0"/>
Phariſees, or we ſhall in no Caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are therefore in endeavouring the Salvation of others, to do all we can to bring them to a humble Senſe of the Inſufficiency of any Works or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of their own; to put them upon a cordial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Chriſt, and an entire Reliance upon him, who, as the Apoſtle tells us in the Context, <hi>is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND thus you have briefly heard how and in what Way we are to evidence and expreſs our Deſires of the Salvation of others. And ſo I paſs to the</p>
            <p n="3">3d. THING propoſed; which was to ſay, Whence or upon what Account we ſhould do it. And to paſs over this Head in two or three brief Hints, we ſhould heartily deſire and earneſtly endeavour the Salvation of others,</p>
            <p n="1">1. OUT of Love to God, and from a Regard to his Glory, which is ſo much concern'd in it. He is the moſt amiable and excellent of Beings, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of all imaginable Perfections conſider'd in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And how vaſt has been his Bounty and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to us? He is the Author of our Beings; to him we are indebted for what we are, and for all that we have or hope for; He ought therefore to be the ſupream Object of our Love, and conſequently his Glory ſhould be our higheſt Aim, and what we ſhould be ever ſollicitous to promote. And wherein is the Glory of God more advanced than in the Salvation of Sinners? As his infinite Wiſdom has pitch'd upon ſuch a Way for the Accompliſhment of it, that it may be brought to paſs without the leaſt Reproach to any one of his Attributes; ſo his Mercy and Grace will be herein highly exalted, and unſpeakable Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will redound to his Name. Since then the Glory
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004806_0015_100E29FC61287AC8"/>
of God will be ſo far promoted by the Salvation of others, upon this Account we ſhould deſire it, pray for it, and do all we can in order to it. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nextly.</hi> We are heartily to deſire and earneſtly to endeavour the Salvation of others in meer Love and Compaſſion to them. One of the two great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments on which hang all the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets is, That <hi>we love the Lord our God with all our Heart, with all our Soul, our Strength, and Mind.</hi> And the other is, that we <hi>love our Neighbour as our ſelves.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 22.37, 38, 39.</note> And if we have any real Affection for our Fellow-Creatures, if we have any Bowels and Mercies, when we look upon them as fallen from God, when we conſider the ſad and unhappy State to which they are hereby reduc'd, and the amazing and never-ending Torments, which unleſs they are brought out of it, muſt unavoidably be their Portion, we muſt needs behold them with Compaſſion, and it can't well chuſe but be our hearty Deſire, our fervent Prayer, and earneſt Endeavour that they may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p>ONCE more. We are taught by a great many Scripture Precepts and Examples, to expreſs our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Deſires of the Salvation of others: It is included in the great Commandment before-mention'd, of <hi>loving our Neighbour as our ſelves.</hi> The Scriptures are full of Injunctions to this Purpoſe. And then, how many excellent Patterns of this Nature are there exhibited to our View? Particularly we have the Example of JESUS the High Prieſt of our Profeſſion to induce us to it. From whence was it but from a Regard to the Salvation of Men, that he came down from Heaven, that he was made Fleſh, and dwelt among us? And whilſt here, with what unwearied Diligence did he proſecute this great and noble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign? And as he was content to live a miſerable Life,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004806_0016_100E29FE0AC42A20"/>
he willingly ſubmitted to a ſhameful and painful Death for the ſake of it. And then I might men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Apoſtles of our Lord; particularly the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whoſe Words I am diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from. How willing was he to ſpend and be ſpent for the Good of Souls? How ready to become all Things to all Men, if ſo be he might ſave ſome? What Labours and Perils did he go through? How far was he from counting his Life dear to him, how freely did he part with the moſt valuable of his temporal Intereſts for the ſake of promoting the Cauſe in which he was engag'd? We ſee then that in deſiring and doing what we can to promote the Salvation of others, we imitate the greateſt and beſt Examples; and upon this Account it becomes us to do it.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus briefly illuſtrated and confirm'd the Obſervation here laid down, I proceed to make ſome Uſe of it. 1. By way of Inſtruction. 2. Of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof and Correction. And 3. Of Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WHAT has been ſaid may be profitable for our Inſtruction. And we may hence learn ſomething of the excellent and generous Nature of the Chriſtian Religion. So far is it from countenancing that Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of Spirit that diſcovers itſelf among ſo many of its Profeſſors, that nothing has a greater Tendency to ennoble Men's Minds, and to inſpire them with Largeneſs of Heart. And when it is heartily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd, and has its due Influence, it teaches Men to look upon the Happineſs of others in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as their own, and as ſuch, to wiſh it and ſeek after it. Who that thinks of this Religion freely and without Prejudice, can chuſe but ſee it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming its bleſſed Author, and like him, to be <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely?</hi> The more cloſely we view it, and the better we are acquainted with it, the more ſenſible we ſhall be of its Charms, and the greater Beauties we ſhall diſcover in it. How can we enough admire
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004806_0017_100E2A011C3AAB58"/>
this holy and heavenly Doctrine, or be ſufficiently thankful for it? How much does it become us that profeſs it, to take Care that we don't debaſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour it, but that by a becoming Temper and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour we exhibit the Amiableneſs and Excellency of it? And then,</p>
            <p n="2">II. WHAT has been now offered may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Reproof and Correction: And that as to ſeveral Sorts of Perſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THEY muſt needs ſtand corrected, and deſerve very ſeverely to be rebuked, who inſtead of wiſhing the Salvation of others, are imprecating the contrary upon them. And how many ſuch are there even among thoſe that wear the Chriſtian Name? How many, who with the ſame Mouth, wherewith <hi>they are,</hi> or ſhould be <hi>bleſſing God, even the Father, are curſing Men made after the Similitude of God,</hi> and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon him to damn them for ever? How can we chuſe but ſtand amazed, that any who ſuſtain the Character of rational Beings, eſpecially who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, ſhould ſuffer ſuch horrid Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to proceed out of their Mouths? Certainly when they thus expreſs themſelves, they are not aware of what Damnation means, nor do they conſider what they ſay. But this is far from being a ſufficient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that when they make uſe of theſe Terms, they don't fix any Ideas to them, and that they don't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what the Words import in the ſtrict and literal Acceptation of them. Muſt it not be highly affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Divine Majeſty for any thus ſolemnly to invoke him upon theſe Occaſions, and then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they have no Meaning in it? Is it not a vile Proſtitution and horrid Abuſe of the great and terrible Name which the Angels ſo highly reverence and adore, and at which the very Devils can't forbear trembling, for Perſons to toſs it about in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004806_0018_100E2A042144D880"/>
and ordinary Converſe, to no other Purpoſe but to fill up the Vacancies of their idle Diſcourſe? Is it not a direct Violation of the Letter of his Law, and a horrid Contempt and bold Defiance of his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance? And beſides at the Time of their uttering this inhuman Language, their helliſh Paſſions are ſometimes raiſed to that Heigth, that was it in their Power they would willingly inflict the worſt of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon thoſe that are the Objects of their Rage. All then that allow themſelves in this profane Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, muſt needs be highly worthy of Rebuke. And then,</p>
            <p>NEXTLY, They likewiſe fall under Cenſure, and are juſtly liable to a Reproof, who are one Way or other a Means of obſtructing the Salvation of others, which it may be feared is the Caſe with too many profeſſed Chriſtians at this Day. Men's wicked and profane Imprecations upon others, have no direct Tendency to obſtruct their Salvation, tho' without a deep Repentance they'll be a Bar to their own. Their wiſhing one's Miſery and Deſtruction will be no ways conducive to it: <hi>For as the Bird by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, and the Swallow by flying, ſo the Curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not come,</hi> Prov. 26.2. But there are many other Ways whereby Men may be inſtrumental of each other's Ruin, and are often a Means of leading one another into thoſe Practices that not only prove pernicious in this World, but iſſue in their everlaſting Miſery and Perdition in the next. But how directly contrary is this to the true Spirit and Temper of a Chriſtian, and what a ſad Account will they have to give up when their Lord ſhall come and reckon with them? Should any of you be found thus guilty, how will you be able to acquit your ſelves from the Blood of thoſe who by your bad Counſels, ill Examples, or any other Ways, you have help'd forward in the Way to Ruin? What will you do, when not only
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004806_0019_100E2A07A01DFC20"/>
God and your own Conſciences ſhall accuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you, but when this and that Perſon ſhall riſe up in Judgment againſt you; yea, it may be ſome that were nearly related to you, perhaps the Children of your own Bowels, and lay their eternal Ruin to your Charge? How fearfully will this add to your Account, aggravate your Doom, and enhanſe your Miſery for ever? And then,</p>
            <p>ONCE more, They are worthy of Reproof, who if they do nothing that has a direct Tendency to obſtruct the Salvation of others, are yet careleſs and indifferent about it, and unconcern'd what becomes of them for ever. And this ſeems to be too generally the Caſe with thoſe that call themſelves Chriſtians at this Day. They are too much of the Spirit and Temper of <hi>Cain:</hi> If Actions ſpeak as they certainly do, we can't but hear one and another of them ſaying as he does, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Am I my Brother's keeper?</hi> Is it any thing to me what becomes of him? They ſeldom, if ever, look beyond themſelves; they take but little Thought for the temporal, and leſs for the ſpiritual and eternal Good of their Neighbour; it ſeems to be much the ſame Thing to them whither he be ſav'd, or whether he periſh; whether he be happy, or whether he be miſerable for ever. But ſuch are certainly of a very different Diſpoſition from that which the Apoſtle expreſſes here in the Text: They are void of that Compaſſion which the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they profeſs ſo ſtrongly recommends, are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Power of it, and very juſtly fall under Cenſure. And then a</p>
            <p n="3">III. and laſt Uſe of what has been ſaid is by Way of Exhortation. 1. If you have not yet done it, to ſecure your own Salvation. And 2. To expreſs a ſincere and hearty Concern for the Salvation of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004806_0020_100E2648C21D2728"/>IN the firſt Place, my beloved Brethren, let me earneſtly exhort you, if you have not yet ſecur'd your own Salvation, that you would now exert your ſelves in order to it. And here I would firſt, offer a Word or two to ſuch as are yet ſo ſenſeleſs and ſtupid as to take little or no Thought or Care that you may be ſaved. And let me aſk ſuch of you, how you can poſſibly be eaſy in a natural State, and what it is that encourages you in your preſent Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Do you not think your Salvation a Thing of any Importance, and that it is worthy of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern? Do but think ſeriouſly what muſt be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of coming ſhort of it, and what it is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Damnation of Hell, and you'll ſoon be convinced of the contrary, and ſee all your other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts to be but perfect Trifles, and to vaniſh into nothing, when compar'd with it. Or do you think it is a Thing ſo eaſily obtain'd, that there is no great Care or Pains requir'd in order to it? Do but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially ſurvey the Scriptures from firſt to laſt, and you'll find it to be a Miſtake. Nay, if you do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than conſult the Words of our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, you'll be convinced that you have a great deal to do in order to your being ſaved: That if you ever enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, you muſt preſs and force your Way into it; and that there is great Hazard of your coming ſhort of it. Or is this the Ground of your Security, that it is Time enough to ſet about this Buſineſs as yet, and that you may ſafely put it off till hereafter? O that you would think ſeriouſly of your own Frailty, and conſider how ſoon your Time of Life, or Day of Grace may come to an End, and from hence you'll ſoon ſee your Error. Is there any one of you that enjoys the moſt confirm'd State of Health, or that is flouriſhing in the Vigour of Youth, who can tell but this Night his Soul may be requir'd of him; and but that before another Day his Opportunity of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004806_0021_100E2A0D4115A620"/>
his Salvation may be at an End? What meaneſt thou then, O Sleeper, ariſe and call upon thy God? O that all of you, young and old, or in the midſt of your Days, would awake out of your Stupidity; that you would now reſolve, with a humble Dependance upon God's Grace, to be more concern'd for your Souls than you have ever yet been. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, for it is God that worketh in you to will and to do of his good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> As it is now a Time when a great many are under a ſerious and deep Concern for their Souls, one would think you ſhould be afraid of miſſing this Seaſon, leſt you be left in your Security and be loſt for ever. I would hope there are none here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that ſcoff at this Work of Conviction, or that make Light of it. If they do, it is becauſe they are unacquainted with the Scriptures, and with the uſual Way of Sinners being brought home to God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how thoſe that were converted by the Miniſtry of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> were firſt pricked at the Heart, and in the deepeſt Agony cried out, <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what ſhall we do.</hi> Conſider how it was with the Jaylor that came trembling to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>; and how it was with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who trembled and cried out, <hi>What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And conſider what our Saviour himſelf ſays of the Office of the Holy Spirit, that when he was come he ſhould <hi>reprove,</hi> or convince <hi>the World of Sin.</hi> And how is it poſſible you ſhould think ſtrange of this Work? And whoever of you expect Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without experiencing ſome Degree or other of it, you will doubtleſs find your ſelves deceived. But then I would offer a Word or two to ſuch of you as are under a deep and diſtreſſing Concern for your Souls, (which I truſt is the Caſe with ſome of you) who are full of trembling, and are ready with the Jaylor before mentioned to cry out, <hi>What ſhall</hi> we <hi>do to be ſaved?</hi> And how can I better reply than
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004806_0022_100E2A10A6CE3058"/>
in the Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and you ſhall be ſaved.</hi> He calls upon you to come to him for Life and Salvation; and what is it that prevents your coming? Is it becauſe your Sins have been ſo many and great? If you are but truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of them, this need be no Hindrance to it; No, if you are weary and heavy laden, you are the very Perſons he invites to come, and whom he expreſly promiſes upon your ſo doing, that you ſhall find Reſt for your Souls. Come then to him as your only and almighty Saviour, and don't ceaſe ſeeking and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till you have ſuch a Sight of his ſuitableneſs and ſufficiency, as heartily to embrace him, and to venture your Souls in his Hands: Then being found in him you'll be ſafe and ſecure. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. LET me exhort and perſwade you, having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd your own Salvation, to expreſs a ſincere and hearty Deſire for the Salvation of others. Be much in Prayer to God for it, and not only ſo, but be ſure to uſe your beſt Endeavours to promote it. There are doubtleſs ſome whoſe Happineſs ought to be very near your Heart. This as has been hinted to you, is the Caſe of all that ſtand in any near Relation to you; accordingly be exhorted in an eſpecial Manner to lay out your ſelves for the Salvation of ſuch. Be particularly ſollicitous for thoſe of your own Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould. Let not thoſe that ſerve with you, no not your poor Negroes, be excluded from your Care, but be mindful of their poor periſhing Souls, and do what you can for them, that they may be ſaved. But let your dear Children be in a peculiar Manner the Object of your Cares. As it muſt needs be your Deſire and Prayer, ſo let it be your earneſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that they may not be loſt, but ſav'd for ever. To this Purpoſe be ſure daily to pray with them, as well as for them, to inſtruct them, and faithfully to diſcharge your Duty to them. But tho' your Charity

may and ought to begin at Home, don't let it end there, but extend it to all your Chriſtian Brethren, and even to the whole humane Race, and endeavour to promote the Salvation of all that come within your Reach. You have, Brethren, the Love of God, of Chriſt, and of your Neighbour to conſtrain you, and a great many excellent Examples to induce you to it. Yea, you have the Example of no leſs a Perſon than the Son of God himſelf, of the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians, and a great many noble Patterns of a later Date. What was it but an ardent Deſire of promoting the Salvation of precious and immortal Souls that induced that faithful Servant of Chriſt <note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev Mr. Gilbert <hi>Tenvent.</hi>
               </note> that viſited ſome of our Towns the Winter paſt to face theſe Northern Blaſts, to undertake ſuch a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and to go through ſuch Fatigues in that difficult Seaſon? And as his coming into theſe Parts was owing to a Motion of Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> I can't but ſpeak of him as a bright and ſhining Pattern of Zeal for the Salvation of Souls. Had he conſulted his Eaſe, or had Wealth and Preferment been his Aim, it's eaſy to conceive how he could quickly have made his Way to theſe Things: But he took a Courſe that he might be ſure would be a Bar to his Attainment to them, and that was no likely Way to procure him the Applauſe of any but the ſerious and ſtrictly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, which are by far the ſmaller Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But the Salvation of Souls was infinitely dearer to him, and this is the Thing that he was deſirous at all Hazards to promote. And how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful is it to ſee one in that Age with ſuch burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zeal and unwearied Diligence proſecuting this great Deſign, and how glorious is the Sight? Did we ſee one in the prime of his Days freely ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Life and Fortune, and facing the greateſt

Dangers to reſcue his Countrymen from the Ravages of a potent Adverſary, and to deliver them from the temporal Miſchiefs and Miſeries which upon that Account they lay open to, it would doubtleſs gain our Admiration and Eſteem. How much more ſhould it do ſo, to ſee an intrepid Youth voluntarily engaging in the War betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, to ſee him boldly attacking this grand Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in his ſtrong Holds, and expoſing himſelf to a continual Scene of Labours and Perils, to reſcue poor Souls out of his Hands, to ſave them from Hell, and to prevent them from being bound in Chains of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Darkneſs? However it may be look'd upon by Men, it is I am well aſſur'd a gracious Spectacle in the Sight of GOD and of the bleſſed Angels. Let us then be thankful for the Examples that have been ſet us by theſe Servants of CHRIST, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of diſcovering ſo baſe and envious a Diſpoſition as to take any Pains to find out their Failings, and magnify their Imperfections, let us obſerve and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Vertues; and if we can't come up to them, let us follow them, tho' it be at ſome Diſtance, in their fervent Deſires and earneſt Endeavours to further the Salvation of others. Let us not only be careful to avoid every Thing that may obſtruct it, but do every Thing within our Power that may be conducive to it. It's certain we can't be employ'd in a Work more noble and honourable in itſelf, or that will be more advantageous to us; that will yield us greater Satisfaction in this World, or procure us a higher Degree of Glory in the next. <hi>They that be wiſe,</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>ſhall ſhine as the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us all then lay out our ſelves in this Work, and let us be quicken'd to Diligence in it, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering

that the Seaſon for it is drawing to a Cloſe, and will quickly, we know not how ſoon, come to an End; remembring the Words of the Lord JESUS, <hi>John</hi> 9.4. <hi>I muſt work the Works of him that ſent me while it is Day, the Night cometh when no Man can work.</hi>
