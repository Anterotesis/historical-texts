            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Some do ſo live that their neighbours can have no occaſion to reproach them; ſome there are that ſo live, that the very worſt have a good word for them; I have known ſome that have been ſo unblameable, of ſuch a ſweet diſpoſition, ſo kind and courteous to all, and have lived ſo inoffenſively, that the worſt have had a good word for them. But where are they that have or do carry themſelves ſo, that their Conſciences have no occaſion to accuſe them, or to reproach them? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to that perſon if you can. I have already ſhewed you what Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, and about what it is imployed, and how it is imployed.</p>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:000954_0042_0FAD97A1D40E9138"/>I come now to the Proof of the Doctrine. This was <hi>Jobs</hi> care you ſee; he was reſolved upon it, that he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And hath <hi>Job</hi> no Fellows? yea many; the Scripture ſpeaketh of ſuch that have made it their care ſo to walk, that Conſcience might have no juſt occaſion to reproach them. <hi>David</hi> was one of them, as appears by what he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.3, 112, 113. although there was a time when he gave Conſcience too great occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, and his Conſcience did reproach him to purpoſe at laſt. Ah poor <hi>David</hi>! what broken bones had he?

Children may reproach Parents, and Servants reproach their Maſters, and one Neighbour reproach another; but it is poſſible ſo to live, that Conſcience all this while may be at peace, and not reproach us. Poſſibly you may be ready to think and ſay within your ſelves, Would we could tell how we might ſo live, pray let us have ſome directions how we may ſo live that Conſcience may not reproach us. But before I give counſel ſhould not I know of you whether you will follow it? And in caſe you will not follow it, why ſhould I give it? Ask your ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Miniſter ſhall give us no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counſel than what God himſelf gives us, ſhould not I follow it?

In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths, Prov</hi> 3.6. This will make you careful to keep Gods Precepts, if in all your ways you look upon God as your Obſerver and Overſeer. This was that which made <hi>David</hi> careful to obſerve Gods Precepts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.168. <hi>I have kept thy Precepts and thy Teſtimonies.</hi> O bleſſed <hi>David,</hi> how didſt thou do this!

                  <p n="1">1. Beware of ſetting up the practice of others whether great or good for your rule; the practices of good men are not always agreeable to the rule as they ſhould be; Miniſters and others may ſtep aſide, and too often do; therefore beware of ſetting up the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> great or good, to be your rule. Remember you are to follow others as they follow Chriſt. You will ſay, this was the practice of ſuch a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, this is the practice of ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor; but do they walk as Chriſt walked? if they follow Chriſt, thou mayſt follow them; but if they do not follow Chriſt, we muſt not follow them, be they who they will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beware of ſetting up the opinions of others, be they never ſo learned, for your rule, though they be the greateſt Doctors in the World, and called <hi>Rabbi</hi> never ſo much. Set not up the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any for your rule, any further than they have the Word of God for their opinion. When God ſpeaks we muſt conſider who, but when Man ſpeaks we muſt conſider what; I ſay, when God ſpeaks we muſt not conſider what but who, but when Man ſpeaks, we muſt not conſider who but what. We know God cannot err, but we know that man may err.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Beware of ſetting up the Cuſtoms of the times and places you live in for your rule. Oh this is the Cuſtom of the time, and this is the Cuſtom of the

place, and what ſhall I be like no body? Do not make this your rule. Tell me where in all the Bible doth God allow this for a rule, to walk according to the Cuſtom of the times and places wherein we live?</p>

Beware of ſetting up the Multitude for your example, <hi>follow not a multitude to do evil.</hi> Let not this ſatisfie you, nor ſerve your turn, to ſay, Why, every one doth ſo; it is general and common, the Multitude doth it; what ſhall I be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, like no body in the World? Aſſure your ſelves that a Multitude is not a Law and Rule for you to walk by. I appeal to you Sirs, whether this be not good counſel, whether it would not be a great help to, and furtherance of the peace and quiet of your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to ſet up the Will of God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Word for the rule of your all.</p>
