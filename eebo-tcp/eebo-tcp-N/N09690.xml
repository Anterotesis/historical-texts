            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe are evident Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of, rather than Deductions from the Duty of Self-Preſervation, commonly called the firſt Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p>All Men have a Right to remain in a State of Nature as long as they pleaſe: And in Caſe of intollerable Oppreſſion, civil or religious, to leave the Society they belong to, and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another.</p>

                  <p>Every natural Right, not expreſly given up, or from the Nature of a ſocial Compact neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ceded, remains.</p>
                  <p>All poſitive and civil Laws, ſhould conform as far as poſſible, to the Law of natural Reaſon and Equity.</p>
                  <p>As neither Reaſon requires, nor Religion permits the contrary, every Man living in or out of a State of civil Society, has a Right peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and quietly to worſhip GOD, according to the Dictates of his Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>"<hi>Juſt and true Liberty, equal and impartial Liberty</hi>" in Matters ſpiritual and temporal, is a Thing that all Men are clearly entitled to, by the eternal and immutable Laws of GOD and Nature, as well as by the Law of Nations, and all well grounded municipal Laws, which muſt have their Foundation in the former.</p>
                  <p>In Regard to Religion, mutual Toleration in the different Profeſſions thereof, is what all good and candid Minds in all Ages have ever practiced: and both by Precept and Example
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012332_0007_0F88C8C0EB0F02A0"/>
inculcated on Mankind: And it is now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agreed among Chriſtians, that this Spirit of Toleration, in the fulleſt Extent conſiſtent, with the Being of Civil Society, "is the chief characteriſtical Mark of the true Church."<note n="*" place="bottom">See Lock's Letters on Toleration.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Mr. Lock has aſſerted, and proved beyond the Poſſibility of Contradiction on any ſolid Ground, that ſuch Toleration ought to be extended to all whoſe Doctrines are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of Society. The only Sects which he thinks ought to be, and which by all wiſe Laws are excluded from ſuch Toleration, are thoſe who teach Doctrines ſubverſive of the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which they live. The Roman Catholicks or Papiſts are excluded, by Reaſon of ſuch Doctrines as theſe, "that Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated may be depoſed, and thoſe they call <hi>Hereticks</hi> may be deſtroyed without Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; beſides their recognizing the Pope in ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute a Manner, in Subverſion of Government, by introducing as far as poſſible into the States, under whoſe Protection they enjoy Life, Liberty and Property, that Soleciſm in Politicks, <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium in Imperio</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012332_0008_0F88C8C3DF702820"/>
only as is neceſſary for the great End of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the beſt Good of the Whole.</p>
                  <p>In the State of Nature, every Man is, under GOD, Judge, and ſole Judge, of his own Rights, and of the Injuries done him: By en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into Society, he agrees to an <hi>Arbiter</hi> or indifferent Judge between him and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but he no more renounces his original Right, than by taking a Cauſe out of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe of Law, and leaving the Deciſion to Referces or indifferent Arbitrators. In the laſt Caſe he muſt pay the Referces for Time and Trouble; he ſhould alſo be willing to pay his juſt Quota for the Support of Government, the Law and the Conſtitution; the End of which is to furniſh indifferent and impartial Judges in all Caſes that may happen, whether civil, eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, marine or military.</p>
                  <p>"The <hi>natural</hi> Liberty of Man is to be free from any ſuperior Power on Earth, and not to be under the Will or legiſlative Authority of Man; but only to have the Law of Nature for his Rule."<note n="*" place="bottom">Locke on Government.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the State of Nature, Men may, as the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> did, employ hired Servants for the Defence of their Lives, Liberties and Property; and they ſhould pay them reaſonable Wages.

                     <hi>Government</hi> was inſtituted for the Purpoſes of common Defence; and thoſe who hold the Reins of Government have an equitable natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Right to an honorable Support from the ſame Principle "that the Labourer is worthy of his Hire": But then the ſame Community which they ſerve, ought to be the Aſſeſſors of their Pay: Governors have no Right to ſeek and take what they pleaſe; by this, inſtead of being content with the Station aſſigned them, that of honorable Servants of the Society, they would ſoon become abſolute <hi>Maſters, Deſpots</hi> and <hi>Tyrants.</hi> Hence as a private Man has a Right to ſay, what Wages he will give in his private Affairs, ſo has a Community to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what <hi>they</hi> will give and grant of their Subſtance, for the Adminiſtration of publick Affairs. And in both Caſes, more are ready generally to offer their Service at the propoſed and ſtipulated Price, than are able and willing to perform their Duty.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, it is the greateſt Abſurdity to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it in the Power of one or any Number of Men, at the entering into Society, to renounce their eſſential natural Rights, or the Means of preſerving thoſe Rights; when the grand End of civil Government from the very Nature of its Inſtitution, is for the Support, Protection and Defence of thoſe very Rights: The principal of which as is before obſerved, are Life, Liberty
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012332_0010_0F88C8C4B0C42568"/>
and <hi>Property.</hi> If Men through Fear, Fraud or Miſtake, ſhould in <hi>Terms</hi> renounce or give up any eſſential natural Right, the eternal Law of Reaſon and the grand End of Society, would abſolutely vacate ſuch Renunciation; the Right to Freedom being <hi>the Gift of</hi> GOD ALMIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, it is not in the Power of Man to alienate this Gift, and voluntarily become a Slave.</p>

That theſe Coloniſts are well entitled to all the eſſential Rights, Liberties and Privileges of Men and Freemen, born in Britain, is manifeſt, not only from the Colony Charters in general, but Acts of the Britiſh Parliament. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 13th of Geo. 2. c. 7. naturalizes even Foreigners after ſeven Years Reſidence. The Words of the Maſſachuſetts-Charter are theſe, "And further our Will and Pleaſure is, and we do hereby for Us, our Heirs and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, grant, eſtabliſh and ordain, that all and

every of the Subjects of Us, our Heirs and Succeſſors, which ſhall go to and inhabit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſaid Province or Territory and every of their Children which ſhall happen to be born there, or on the Seas in going thither, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from thence, ſhall have and enjoy all Liberties and Immunities of free and natural Subjects within any of the Dominions of Us, our Heirs and Succeſſors, to all Intents, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Purpoſes whatſoever, as if they and every of them were born within this our Realm of England." Now what Liberty can there be, where Property is taken away without Conſent? Can it be ſaid with any Colour of Truth and Juſtice, that this Continent of three Thouſand Miles in Length, and of a Breadth as yet unexplored, in which however, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, there are five Millions of People, has the leaſt Voice, Vote, or Influence in the Deciſions of the Britiſh Parliament? Have they, all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, any more Right or Power to return a ſingle Member to that Houſe of Commons, who have, not inadvertently, but deliberately aſſumed a Power to diſpoſe of their Lives,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Act of the laſt Seſſion relating to the King's Dock-Yards.</note> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Properties, than to chuſe an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of China! Had the Coloniſts a Right to return Members to the Britiſh Parliament, it would only be hurtful; as from their local Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012332_0015_0F88C8C86B139A68"/>
and Circumſtances, it is impoſſible they ſhould be ever truly and properly repreſented there. The Inhabitants of this Country, in all Probability, in a few Years, will be more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, than thoſe of Great Britain and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land together: Yet it is abſurdly expected, by the Promoters of the preſent Meaſures, that theſe, with their Poſterity to all Generations, ſhould be eaſy, while their Property ſhall be diſpoſed of by a Houſe of Commons at Three Thouſand Miles diſtance from them; and who cannot be ſuppoſed to have the leaſt Care or Concern for their real Intereſt: Who have not only no natural Care for their Intereſt, but muſt be <hi>in effect</hi> bribed againſt it; as every Burden they lay on the Coloniſts is ſo much ſaved or gain'd to themſelves. Hitherto many of the Coloniſts have been free from Quit Rents; but if the Breath of a Britiſh Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, can originate an Act for taking away all our Money, our Lands will go next; or be ſubject to Rack Rents from haughty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentleſs Landlords who will ride at caſe, while we are trodden in the Dirt.

               <head>A Liſt of Infringements and Violations of Rights.</head>
               <p>WE cannot help thinking, that an Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of ſome of the moſt open In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringements of our Rights, will by every candid Perſon be judged ſufficient to juſtify whatever Meaſures have been already taken, or may be thought proper to be taken, in order to obtain a Redreſs of the Grievances under which we labour. Among many others, we humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the following will not fail to excite the Attention of all who conſider themſelves intereſted in the Happineſs and Freedom of Mankind in general, and of this Continent and Province in particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The Britiſh Parliament have aſſumed the Powers of Legiſlation for the Coloniſts in all Caſes whatſoever, without obtaining the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Inhabitants, which is ever eſſentially neceſſary to the rightful Eſtabliſhment of ſuch a Legiſlative.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. They have exerted that aſſumed Power, in raiſing a Revenue in the Colonies without their Conſent; thereby depriving them of that Right which every Man has to keep his own
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012332_0017_0F88C8CB6F98D468"/>
Earnings in his own Hands until he ſhall, in Perſon, or by his Repreſentative, think fit to part with the Whole or any Portion of it. This Infringement is the more extraordinary, when we conſider the laudable Care which the Britiſh Houſe of Commons have taken, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve intirely and abſolutely to themſelves the Powers of giving and granting Money. They not only inſiſt on originating every Money Bill in their own Houſe, but will not even allow the Houſe of Lords to make an Amendment in theſe Bills. So tenacious are they of this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, ſo jealous of any Infringement of the ſole and abſolute Right the People have to diſpoſe of their own Money. And what ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this Infringement the more grievous is, that what of our Earnings ſtill remains in our Hands is in a great meaſure deprived of it's Value, ſo long as the Britiſh Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to claim and exerciſe this Power of taxing us; for we cannot juſtly call that <hi>our</hi> Property, which <hi>others</hi> may, when they pleaſe take away from us againſt our Will.</p>
               <p>In this reſpect we are treated with leſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Regard than the Romans ſhewed even to the Provinces which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. <hi>They</hi> only determined upon the Sum which each ſhould furniſh, and left every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to raiſe it in the Manner moſt eaſy and convenient to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:012332_0018_0F88C8CC315132C8"/>
3dly. A Number of new Officers, unknown in the Charter of this Province, have been appointed to ſuperintend this Revenue; whereas by our Charter, the Great and General Court or Aſſembly of this Province, has the ſole Right of appointing all Civil Officers, excepting only ſuch Officers, the election and conſtitution of whom is, in ſaid Charter, expreſsly excepted; among whom theſe Officers are not included.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. Theſe Officers are by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions inveſted with Powers altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional, and entirely deſtructive to that Security which we have a right to enjoy; and to the laſt degree dangerous, not only to our property, but to our lives: For the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of his Majeſty's Cuſtoms in America, or any three of them, are by their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion impowered, "by writing under their hands and ſeals to conſtitute and appoint infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Officers in all and ſingular the Port within the Limits of their Commiſſions." Each of theſe petty officers ſo made is intruſted with Power more abſolute and arbitrary than ought to be lodged in the hands of any Man or Body of Men whatſoever; for in the Commſſion afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, his Majeſty gives and grants unto his ſaid Commiſſioners, or any three of them, and to all and every the Collectors, Deputy-Collectors, Miniſters, Servants, and all other Officers ſerving &amp; attending in all and every the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012332_0019_0F88C8CDE5E700C0"/>
Ports &amp; other Places within the Limits of their Commiſſion, full Power and Authority, from time to time, at their or any of their Wills and Pleaſures, as well by Night as by Day, to enter and go on board any Ship, Boat, or other Veſſel, riding, lying, or being within, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into, any Port, Harbour, Creek or Haven, within the limits of their Commiſſion; and alſo in the day-time to go into any Houſe, Shop, Cellar, or any other Place, where any Goods, Wares or Merchandizes lie concealed, or are <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected</hi> to lie concealed, whereof the cuſtoms and other duties, have not been, or ſhall not be, duly paid and truly ſatisfied, anſwered or paid unto the Collectors, Deputy-Collectors, Miniſters, Servants, and other Officers reſpectively, or otherwiſe agreed for; and the ſaid Houſe, Shop, Warehouſe, Cellar, and other Place to ſearch and ſurvey, and all and every the Boxes, Trunks, Cheſts and Packs then and there found to break open."</p>
               <p>Thus our Houſes, and even our Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, are expoſed to be ranſacked, our Boxes, Trunks and Cheſts broke open, ravaged and plundered, by Wretches, whom no prudent Man would venture to employ even as menial Servants; whenever they are pleaſed to ſay they <hi>ſuſpect</hi> there are in the Houſe, Wares, &amp;c. for which the Duties have not been paid. Flagrant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the wanton exerciſe of this Power,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012332_0020_0F88C8CE7289A710"/>
have frequently happened in this and other ſeaport Towns. By this we are cut off from that domeſtic ſecurity which renders the Lives of the moſt unhappy in ſome meaſure agreeable. Theſe Officers may under color of Law and the cloak of a general warrant, break through the ſacred Rights of the <hi>Domicil,</hi> ranſack Mens Houſes, deſtroy their Securities, carry off their Property, and with little Danger to themſelves commit the moſt horrid Murders.</p>
               <p>And we complain of it as a further Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, that notwithſtanding by the Charter of this Province, the Governor and the Great and General Court or Aſſembly of this province or Territory, for the time being, ſhall have full power and authority, from time to time, to make, ordain and eſtabliſh all manner of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and reaſonable Laws, Orders, Statutes, and Ordinances, Directions and Inſtructions, and that if the ſame ſhall not within the term of three years after preſenting the ſame to his Majeſty in Privy Council be diſallowed, they ſhall be and continue in full force and effect, until the ſame ſhall be repealed by the Great and General Aſſembly of this province: Yet the Parliament of Great-Britain have rendered, or attempted to render, null and void, a Law of this province, made and paſſed in the Reign of his late Majeſty George the Firſt, intituled, "An Act ſtating the Fees of the Cuſtom-Houſe
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012332_0021_0F88C8CF4B9AB400"/>
Officers within this province," and by meer dint of power, in violation of the Charter aforeſaid, eſtabliſhed other and exorbitant Fees, for the ſame Officers; any Law, of the province, to the contrary notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly. Fleets and Armies have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſupport theſe unconſtitutional Officers in collecting and managing this unconſtitutional Revenue; and Troops have been quartered in this Metropolis for that purpoſe. Introducing and quartering Standing Armies in a free Country in times of Peace, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People either by themſelves or by their Repreſentatives, is, and always has been deemed, a violation of their Rights as Freemen; and of the Charter or Compact made between the King of Great Britain and the People of this Province, whereby all the Rights of Britiſh Subjects are confirmed to us.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly. The Revenue ariſing from this Tax unconſtitutionally laid, and committed to the management of Perſons arbitrarily appointed and ſupported by an armed Force quartered in a free City, has been in part applied to the moſt deſtructive purpoſes. It is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a mixt Government, like that of this Province, that a due proportion or balance of Power ſhould be eſtabliſhed among the ſeveral Branches of the Legiſlative. Our Anceſtors
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012332_0022_0F88C8D00FFE19D8"/>
received from King William and Queen Mary a Charter, by which it was underſtood by both Parties in the contract, that ſuch a proportion or balance was fixed; and therefore every thing which renders any one Branch of the Legiſlative more independent of the other two than it was originally deſigned, is an alteration of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as ſettled by the Charter; and as it has been, until the eſtabliſhment of this Revenue, the conſtant practice of the general Aſſembly to provide for the ſupport of Government, ſo it is an eſſential part of our Conſtitution, as it is a neceſſary means of preſerving an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> without which we cannot continue a free State.</p>
               <p>In particular it has always been held, that the dependence of the Governor of this Province upon the General Aſſembly for his ſupport, was neceſſary for the preſervation of this <hi>Equilibrium;</hi> nevertheleſs his Majeſty has been pleaſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Fifteen Hundred Pounds Sterling annually, out of the American Revenue, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Governor of this Province indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Aſſembly; whereby the ancient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between him and this People is weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Confidence in the Governor leſſened, the Equilibrium deſtroyed, and the Conſtitution eſſentially altered.</p>
               <p>And we look upon it highly probable, from the beſt intelligence we have been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that not only our Governor and Lieutenant
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012332_0023_0F88C8D0AAB92628"/>
Governor, but the Judges of the Superior Court of Judicature, as alſo the King's Attorney and Solicitor General are to receive their Support from this grievous tribute. This will, if accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, compleat our Slavery: For if Taxes are to be raiſed from us by the Parliament of Great Britain without our conſent, and the Men on whoſe opinions and deciſions our Properties, Liberties, and Lives, in a great meaſure depend, receive their Support from the Revenues ariſing from theſe Taxes, we cannot, when we think on the depravity of mankind, avoid looking with horror on the danger to which we are expoſed! The Britiſh Parliament have ſhown their wiſdom in making the Judges there as independent as poſſible both on the Prince and People, both for place and ſupport: But our Judges hold their commiſſions only during pleaſure; the granting them Salaries out of this Revenue is rendering them dependent on the Crown for their ſupport. The King, upon his firſt acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Throne, for giving the laſt Hand to the independency of the Judges in England, not only upon himſelf but his ſucceſſors, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending and conſenting to an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, by which the Judges are continued in office, notwithſtanding the demiſe of the King, which vacates all other Commiſſion, was applauded by the whole Nation. How alarming therefore muſt it be to the inhabitants of this province, to find ſo wide a difference made
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012332_0024_0F88C8D3A0746538"/>
between the ſubjects in Britain and America, as the rendering the Judges here altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the Crown for their ſupport.</p>
               <p n="7">7thly. We find ourſelves greatly oppreſſed by Inſtructions ſent to our Governor from the Court of Great Britain; whereby the firſt branch of our legiſlature is made meerly a miniſterial Engine. And the Province has already felt ſuch effects from theſe inſtructions, as we think, juſtly intitle us to ſay, that they threaten an entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of our Liberties; and muſt ſoon, if not check'd, render every branch of our government a uſeleſs burthen upon the people. We ſhall point out ſome of the alarming effects of theſe inſtructions which have already taken place.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of inſtructions, the Governor has called and adjourned our General Aſſemblies to a place highly inconvenient to the Members and greatly diſadvantageous to the intereſt of the province, even againſt his own declared Intention.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of inſtructions, the Aſſembly has been prorogued from time to time, when the important concerns of the Province re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their meeting.</p>
               <p>In obedience to inſtructions the General Aſſembly was Anno 1768 diſſolved by Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Bernard, becauſe they would not conſent to <hi>reſcind</hi> the Reſolution of a <hi>former</hi> Houſe, and thereby ſacriſice the Rights of their Conſtituents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:012332_0025_0F88C8D3B8568410"/>
By an Inſtruction, the honorable his Majeſty's Council are forbid to meet and tranſact matters of publick concern as a council of advice to the Governor, unleſs called by the Governor; and if they ſhould from a zealous regard to the Intereſt of the province ſo meet at any time, the Governor is ordered to negative them at the next Election of Councellors. And although by the Charter of this province the Great and General Court have full power and authority to impoſe Taxes upon the Eſtates and perſons of all and every the proprietors and inhabitants of this province, yet the Governor has been forbidden to give his conſent to an act impoſing a Tax for the neceſſary ſupport of government, unleſs ſuch perſons as were pointed out in the ſaid inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were exempted from paying their juſt proportion of ſaid Tax.</p>
               <p>His Excellency has alſo pleaded inſtructions for giving up the provincial Fortreſs, Caſtle William, into the hands of Troops, over whom he had declared he had no controul (and that at a time when they were menacing the ſlaughter of the inhabitants of the town, and our ſtreets were ſtain'd with the blood which they had barbarouſly ſhed.) Thus our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, appointed and paid from Great-Britain with Money forced from us, is made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of totally preventing, or at leaſt of rendering futile, every attempt of the other
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012332_0026_0F88C8D46E780EA0"/>
two branches of our Legiſlative in favour of a diſtreſſed and wronged people: And leſt the complaints naturally occaſioned by ſuch oppreſſion ſhould excite compaſſion in the royal Breaſt, and induce his Majeſty ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſet about relieving us from the cruel Bondage and Inſults which we, his loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, have ſo long ſuffered, the Governor is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to conſent to the payment of an Agent to repreſent our grievances at the Court of Great Britain, unleſs he, the Governor, conſent to his Election; and we very well know what <hi>the Man muſt be</hi> to whoſe appointment a Governor, in ſuch circumſtances, will conſent.</p>
               <p>While we are mentioning the Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Rights of this Colony in particular by means of Inſtructions, we cannot help calling to remembrance the late unexampled Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Legiſlative of a Siſter Colony, <hi>New-York,</hi> by force of an Inſtruction, until they ſhould comply with an arbitrary act of the Britiſh Parliament, for quartering Troops, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, by military execution, to enforce the raiſing of a tribute.</p>
               <p n="8">8thly. The extending the power of the Courts of Vice-Admiralty to ſo enormous a degree, as deprives the people in the colonies, in a great meaſure, of their ineſtimable right to trials <hi>by
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012332_0027_0F88C8D52BFE2560"/>
Juries;</hi> which has ever been juſtly conſidered as the grand Bulwark and Security of Engliſh property.</p>
               <p>This alone is ſufficient to rouſe our jealouſy: And we are again obliged to take notice of the remarkable contraſt, which the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been pleaſed to exhibit between the Subjects in Great-Britain and the Colonies. In the ſame Statute, by which they give up to the deciſion of one dependent intereſted Judge of Admiralty the eſtates and properties of the Coloniſts, they expreſsly guard the eſtates and properties of the People of Great-Britain; For all forfeitures and penalties inflicted by the ſtatute of the fourth of George the third, or any other Act of Parliament relative to the Trade of the Colonies, may be ſued for in any Court of Admiralty in the Colonies; but all penalties and forfeitures which ſhall be incurred in Great-Britain, may be ſued for in any of his Majeſty's Courts of Record in Weſtminſter, or in the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively. Thus our Birthrights are taken from us; and that too with every mark of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, inſult and contempt. We may be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed and dragged from one part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the other (which ſome of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren here and in the country towns already have been) and finally be deprived of our whole property, by the arbitrary determination of one biaſſed, capricious Judge of the Admiralty.</p>

9thly. The reſtraining us from erecting Slitting-Mills for manufacturing our Iron the natural produce of this Country, is an Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Right with which God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have inveſted us, to make uſe of our ſkill and induſtry in procuring the neceſſaries and conveniencies of Life. And we look upon the Reſtraint laid upon the Manufacture and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Hats to be altogether unreaſonable and grievous. Although by the Charter all Havens, Rivers, Ports, Waters, &amp;c. are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſely granted the Inhabitants of the Province and their Succeſſors, to their only proper uſe and behoof forever, yet the Britiſh Parliament paſſed an act, whereby they reſtrain us from carrying our Wool, the produce of our own Farms, even over a Ferry; whereby the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants have often been put to the expence of carrying a Bag of Wool near an hundred miles by land, when paſſing over a River or Water of one quarter of a mile, of which the province are the abſolute proprictors, would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all that trouble.</p>
               <p n="10">10thly. The Act paſſed in the laſt Seſſion of the Britiſh Parliament, intituled. <hi>An Act for the better preſerving his Majeſty's Dock-Yards, Magazines, Ships, Ammunition and Stores,</hi> is, as we apprehend, a violent Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of our Rights. By this Act, any one of us may be taken from his Family, and carried to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012332_0029_0F88C8D6B10F5380"/>
any part of Great-Britain, there to be tried, whenever it ſhall be pretended that he has been concerned in burning or otherwiſe deſtroying any Boat or Veſſel, or any Materials for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. &amp;c. any naval or victualling Store, &amp;c. belonging to his Majeſty. For by this Act all Perſons in the Realm, or in any of the Places thereto belonging (under which Denomination we know the Colonies are meant to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded) may be indicted or tried either in any County or Shire within this Realm, in like manner and form as if the Offence had been committed in ſaid County, as his Majeſty and his Succeſſors may deem moſt expedient. Thus we are not only deprived of our grand Right to <hi>Trial by our Peers in the Viciuity,</hi> but any perſon ſuſpected, or pretended to be ſuſpected, may be hurried to Great-Britain, to take his Trial in any County the King or his Succeſſors ſhall pleaſe to direct; where, innocent or guilty, he is in great danger of being condomn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and whether condemned or acquitted, he will probably be ruined by the Expence attending the Trial, and his long Abſence from his Family and Buſineſs; and we have the ſtrongeſt reaſon to apprehend that we ſhall ſoon experience the fatal Effects of this Act, as about the Year 1769, the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſed Reſovles for taking up a number of perſons in the Colonies and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to Great-Britain for trial, pretending
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012332_0030_0F88C8D76B9355A0"/>
that they were authoriſed ſo to do by a Statute paſſed in the Reign of Henry the Eighth in which they ſay the Colonies were included, although the Act was paſſed long before any Colonies were ſettled, or even in contemplation.</p>
               <p n="11">11thly As our Anceſtors came over to this Country that they might not only enjoy their civil but their religious Rights, and particularly deſired to be freed from the Prelates, who in thoſe times cruelly perſecuted all who differed in ſentiment from the eſtabliſhed Church; we cannot ſee without concern, the various at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts which have been made, and are now making, to eſtabliſh an American Epiſcopate. Our Epiſcopal brethren of the Colonies do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and nightfully ought over to enjoy, the free exerciſe of their Religion; but as an American Epiſcopate is by no means eſſential to that free exerciſe of their Religion, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help fearing that they who are ſo warmly contending for ſuch an Eſtabliſhment, have Views altogether inconſiſtent with the univerſal and peaceful enjoyment of our Chriſtian privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges: And doing or attempting to do any thing which has even the remoteſt tendency to endanger this Enjoyment, is juſtly looked upon a great Grievance, and alſo an Infringement of our Rights; which is not barely to exerciſe, but peaceably and ſecurely to enjoy, that Liberty with which CHRIST hath made us free.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:012332_0031_0F88C8D9F4314078"/>
And we are further of Opinion, that no Power on Earth can juſtly give either temporal or ſpiritual Juriſdiction within this Province, except the Great &amp; General Court. We think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that every deſign for eſtabliſhing the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of a Biſhop in this Province, is a deſign both againſt our civil and religious Rights: And we are well informed, that the more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did &amp; judicious of our Brethren of the Church of England in this and the other Colonies, both Clergy and Laity, conceive of the eſtabliſhing an American Epiſcopate both unneceſſary and unreaſonable.</p>
               <p n="12">12thly. Another Grievance under which we labour is, The frequent Alteration of the Bounds of the Colonies by Deciſions before the King and Council, explanatory of former Grants and Charters. This not only ſubjects Men to live under a Conſtitution to which they have not conſented, which in itſelf is a great Grievance; but morevover under Color, that the <hi>Right of Soil</hi> is affected by ſuch Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſome Governors, or Miniſters, or both in Conjunction, have pretended to grant in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a Mandamus many Thouſands of Acres of vacant and appropriated Lands near a Century paſt, and rendered valuable by the Labors of the preſent Cultivators and their Anceſtors. There are very notable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Settlers, who having firſt purchaſed
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012332_0032_0F88C8DA6E40C648"/>
the Soil of the Natives, have at conſiderable Expence obtained Confirmations of Title from this Province; and, on being transfer'd to the Juriſdiction of the Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> have been put to the Trouble and Coſt of a new Grant or Confirmation from thence; and after all this, there has been a third Declaration of the Royal Will, that they ſhou'd thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be conſidered as pertaining to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>New-York.</hi> The Troubles, Expences and Dangers which Hundreds have been put to on ſuch Occaſions, cannot here be recited; but ſo much may be ſaid, that they have been moſt cruelly harraſſed, and even threatened with a military Force, to dragoon them into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the moſt unreaſonable Demands.</p>

                  <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WE, the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of <hi>Boſton,</hi> in Town-Meeting duly aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, according to Law, apprehending there is abundant Reaſon to be alarmed that the Plan of <hi>Deſpotiſm,</hi> which the Enemies of our invaluable Rights have concerted, is rapidly haſtening to a completion, can no longer conceal our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience under a conſtant, unremitted, uniform Aim to inſlave us, or conſide in an Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which threatens us with certain and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable deſtruction. But, when in Addition to the repeated Inroads made upon the Rights and Liberties of the Coloniſts, and of thoſe in this Province in particular, we reflect on the late extraordinary Meaſure in affixing Stipends, or Salaries from the Crown to the Offices of the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012332_0034_0F88C8DBF17D5F60"/>
Judges of the Superior Court of Judicature, making them not only intirely independent of the People, whoſe Lives and Fortunes are ſo much in their Power, but abſolutely dependent on the Crown, (which may hereafter be worn by a <hi>Tyrant</hi>) both for their Appointment and Support, we cannot but be extremely alarm'd at the miſchievous Tendency of this Innovation; which, in our Opinion is directly contrary to the Spirit of the Britiſh Conſtitution, pregnant with innumerable Evils, &amp; hath a direct Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to deprive us of every thing valuable as Men, as Chriſtians, and as Subjects, entitled, by the Royal Charter, to all the Rights, Liberties and Privileges of native Britons. Such being the critical State of this Province, we think it our Duty on this truly diſtreſſing Occaſion, to aſk you, What can withſtand the Attacks of mere Power? What campreſerve the Liberties of the Subject, when the Barriers of the Conſtitution are taken away? The Town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting on the Matter abovementioned, thought proper to make Application to the Governor by a Committee; requeſting his Excellency to communicate ſuch Intelligence as he might have received, relative to the Report of the Judges having their Support independent of the Grants of this Province, a Copy of which you have herewith in Paper No. 1.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix, No.1.</note> To which we received as Anſwer the Paper No. 2.<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Appendix, No. 2.</note> The
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012332_0035_0F88C8DD8D6C18A0"/>
Town on further Deliberation, thought it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to refer the Matter to the Great and General Aſſembly; and accordingly in a ſecond Addreſs No. 3.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Appendix, No. 3.</note> they requeſted his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency that the General Court might convene at the Time to which they then ſtood pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued; to which the Town received the Reply as in No. 4.<note n="§" place="bottom">See Appendix, No. 4.</note> in which we are acquainted with his Intentions further to prorogue the General Aſſembly, which has ſince taken Place. Thus, Gentlemen, it is evident his Excellency declines giving the leaſt Satisfaction as to the Matter in Requeſt. The Affair being of public Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Town of <hi>Boſton</hi> thought it neceſſary to conſult with their Brethren throughout the Province; and for this Purpoſe appointed a Committee, to communicate with our Fellow Sufferers, reſpecting this recent Inſtance of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as well as the many other Violations of our Rights under which we have groaned for ſeveral Years paſt—This committee have briefly recapitulated the ſenſe we have of our invaluable Rights as Men, as Chriſtians, and as Subjects; and wherein we conceive thoſe Rights to have been violated, which we are deſirous may be laid before your Town, that the Subject may be weighed as its Importance requires, and the collected wiſdom of the whole People, as far as poſſible, be obtained, on a deliberation of ſuch great and laſting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012332_0036_0F88C8DE2C9CF988"/>
as to Involve in it the Fate of all our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.—Great Pains has been taken to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Britiſh Adminiſtration to think, that the good People of this Province in general are quiet and undiſturbed at the late Meaſures: and that any Uneaſineſs that appears, ariſes only from a few factious deſigning and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected Men. This renders it the more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the ſenſe of the People ſhould be explicitly declared.—A free Communication of your Sentiments to this Town, of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Danger, is earneſtly ſolicited and will be gratefully received. If you concur with us in Opinion, that our Rights are properly ſtated, and that, the ſeveral Acts of Parliament, and Meaſures of Adminiſtration, pointed out by us, are ſubverſive of theſe Rights, you will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs think it of the untmoſt Importance that we ſtand firm as one Man, to recover and ſupport them; and to take ſuch Meaſures, by directing our Repreſentatives, or otherwiſe, as your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Fortitude ſhall dictate, to reſcue from impending Ruin our happy and glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. But if it ſhould be the general Voice of this Province, that the Rights, as we have ſtated them, do not belong to us; or, that the ſeveral Meaſures of Adminiſtration in the Britiſh Court, are no Violations of theſe Rights; or, that if they are thus violated or infringed, they are not worth contending for, or reſolutely mantaining;—ſhould this be the general
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012332_0037_0F88C8DF304B9DF0"/>
Voice of the Province, we muſt be reſigned to our wretched Fate; but ſhall forever lament the Extinction of that generous Ardor for Civil and Religious Liberty, which in the Face of every Danger, and even Death itſelf, induced our Fathers, to forſake the Boſom of their Native Country, and begin a Settlement on bare Creation.—But we truſt this cannot be the Caſe: We are ſure your Wiſdom, your Regard to Yourſelves and the riſing Generation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer you to doze, or ſet ſupinely indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, on the brink of Deſtruction, while the Iron Hand of Oppreſſion is daily tearing the the choiceſt Fruit from the fair Tree of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, planted by our worthy Predeceſſors, at the Expence of their Treaſure, and abundantly water'd with their Blood.—It is an obſervation of an eminent Patriot, that a People long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urded to Hardſhips, looſe by Degrees the very notions of Liberty; they look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as Creatures <hi>at Mercy,</hi> and that all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions laid on, by Superior Hands, are legal and obligatory.—But thank Heaven this is not yet verified in <hi>America!</hi> We have yet ſome Share of public Virtue remaining: We are not afraid of Poverty, but diſdain Slavery.—The Fate of Nations is ſo precarious, and Revolutions in States ſo often take Place at an unexpected Moment, when the Hand of Power, by Fraud or Flattery, has ſecured every Avenue of Retreat, and the Minds of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012332_0038_0F88C8DFAAD6C430"/>
debaſed to its Purpoſe, that it becomes every Well-Wiſher to his Country, while it has any Remains of Freedom, to keep an Eagle Eye upon every Inovation and Stretch of Power, in thoſe that have the Rule over us. A recent Inſtance of this we have in the late Revolutions in <hi>Sweden;</hi> by which the Prince, once ſubject to the Laws of the State, has been able of a ſudden, to declare himſelf an abſolute Monarch. The Sweeds were once a free, martial and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant People: Their Minds are now ſo debaſed, that they even rejoice at being ſubject to the Caprice and arbitrary Power of a Tyrant, and kiſs their Chains. It makes us ſhudder to think, the late Meaſures of Adminiſtration may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the like Cataſtophe; which Heaven forbid!—Let us conſider Brethren, we are ſtrugling for our beſt Birth Rights and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; which being infringed, renders all our Bleſſings precarious in their Enjoyments, and conſequently trifling in their Value. Let us diſappoint the Men, who are raiſing themſelves on the Ruin of this Country. Let us convince every Invader of our Freedom, that we will be as free, as the Conſtitution our Fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized, will juſtify.</p>

This Report has ſpread an Alarm among all conſiderate perſons who have heard of it in Town and Country; being viewed, as tending rapidly to compleat the Syſtem of their Slavery; which originated in the Houſe of Commons of Great-Britain, aſſuming a Power and Authority, to give and grant the Monies of the Coloniſts without their Conſent, and aginſt their repeated Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances.

                  <hi>THE Royal Charter reſerves to the Governor full Power and Authority, from time to time, as he ſhall judge neceſſary, to adjourn, prorogue and diſſolve the</hi> General <hi>Aſſembly.</hi>
