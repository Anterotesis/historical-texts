            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REMARKS UPON THE <hi>Earthquake.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Night</hi> that followed the Twenty ninth of <hi>October</hi> [1727.] was a <hi>Night</hi> whereto NEW-ENGLAND had never in the Memory of Man, ſeen the like before. The <hi>Air</hi> never more <hi>Calm,</hi> the <hi>Sky</hi> never more <hi>Fair;</hi> every thing in all imaginable Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity: But about a quarter of an Hour before Eleven, there was heard in BOSTON, paſſing from one end of the Town to the other, an horrid rumbling like the Noiſe of many Coaches together, driving on the paved Stones with the utmoſt Rapidity. But it was attended with a moſt awful <hi>Trembling of the Earth,</hi> which did heave and ſhake ſo as to Rocque the Houſes, and cauſe here and there the falling of ſome ſmaller Things, both within Doors and without. It cannot be imagined, but that it gave an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Concern unto all the Inhabitants, and even a degree of Conſternation, unto very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002919_0004_0FE6966739570BF0"/>of them. This <hi>firſt Shock,</hi> which was the moſt Violent, was followed with ſeveral others, and ſome Repetition of the Noiſe, at ſundry times, pretty diſtant from one another. The Number of them is not entirely agreed; but at leaſt Four or Five are allow'd for; The laſt of which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Five and Six of the Clock in the Morning.</p>
            <p>How far this <hi>Earthquake</hi> extended thro' the Countrey, we are not yet informed; but that it extended Scores of Miles, we have already a certain Information. And what added unto the Terrors of it, were the terrible Flames and Lights, in the Atmoſphere, which accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. The Veſſels on the Coaſt, were alſo made ſenſible of it, by a ſhivering that ſiezed on them.</p>
            <p>When the greatly affected People, had a little Opportunity to look about them in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Paſtors of the <hi>Old North Church,</hi> directed the <hi>Bells</hi> to be rung, that ſuch of the People as could and would, might aſſemble immediately unto ſome ſeaſonable Exerciſes of Religion. The Paſtors of the <hi>New</hi> joined with them in ſending up unto Heaven, the Supplications which the ſolemn Occaſion called for. And the Paſtors in the other part of the Town, made a ſpeedy and hearty Appearance, and moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately united in a Concurrence with them. The Aſſembly that came together, did more than croud and fill the moſt capacious of our Meetinghouſes; And as there was a multitude of ſerious Chriſtians, who are acquainted with
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002919_0005_0FE696675946C788"/>
               <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Vital</hi> PIETY, ſo the whole Auditory expreſſed a Devotion which was truly Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
            <p>When theſe Exerciſes were finiſhed about Two in the Afternoon, after ſome ſhort Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſſion of an Hour or Two, ſeveral Churches in the other part of the Town, followed the Exemple, and with vaſt Congregations, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the proper Exerciſes of Religion, until a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Eight a Clock in the Evening. For the Animation thereof, there was not only the joint Inclination of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> but likewiſe a Recommendation from His Honour the L. GOVERNOUR; Whoſe <hi>Piety,</hi> ever diſcovered on every other, as well as this, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, diſpoſed him, to Direct alſo the keeping of the <hi>Thurſday</hi> following (which is the Day of the uſual weekly Lecture,) as a Day of SUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLICATIONS in all the Churches of the City.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1580. <hi>England</hi> felt an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> which tho' no conſiderable Damage was done by it, awakened the Government of the Nation, to call upon all the Subjects throughout the Kingdom, to be fervent and inſtant in Prayer, that the Wrath of GOD whereof the <hi>Earthquake</hi> was a <hi>Token,</hi> might be averted from the Land. Such a Diſpoſition poſſeſſes our <hi>Commander in Chief,</hi> and his People moſt readily come into it.</p>
            <p>One of the MINISTERS, who did their part, in the Great Aſſembly of the Morning judg'd it Expedient, yea, Neceſſary, that PRAYER
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002919_0006_0FE6967149A89090"/>ſhould have the WORD accompanying of it. He thought, that if ever he did <hi>preach the Word IN SEASON,</hi> he ſhould now do ſo, by taking the Preſent SEASON to render the <hi>Voice</hi> of the Glorious GOD, in the EARTHQUAKE, while it was yet ſcarce over, Articulate and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible unto the Hearers: 'Twould be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, A WORD IN SEASON. And he hop'd, that <hi>Hearts made ſoft</hi> by the ALMIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY <hi>Troubling</hi> of them with the Occurrences of the Night before, would be more likely than ever, to receive Good Impreſſions, and be moulded into durable Reſolutions of Godlineſs; Yea, that as the primitive <hi>Outpouring</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly SPIRIT, was attended with an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> ſo the EARTHQUAKE would now be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch on <hi>Out-pouring</hi> of the Holy SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT as would make an Holy, and ſo an Happy People. Accordingly, with the Divine Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he made a SPEECH, [or, if you pleaſe, A SERMON,] which was no ſooner offered in the Aſſembly of <hi>Zion</hi> there convened. but it was deſired, that it might be further offered in the way of the Preſs, for the Service of PIETY, not only here, but in other parts of the Land, which <hi>GOD makes to Tremble.</hi> He durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Deſire. Tis true, There can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none but a mean Preparation, from a few Minutes of a Morning filled with Diſturbances; which may be an Apology for the Deficiencies which a curious Reader may ſoon diſcover in it.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002919_0007_0FE696716324CBB0"/>But our Gracious GOD is pleaſed ſometimes to make uſe of <hi>ſuch,</hi> to do Good in the World; that ſo, <hi>Man</hi> may be Nothing, and HE may be <hi>All in All.</hi> Tis not poſſible for him to give Word for Word, a Diſcourſe which he could have no Time to Write, before it was delivered. But it is here without many material <hi>Additions,</hi> &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, with ſome Forgetful <hi>Subſtractions,</hi> Exhibited as very near as can well be asked for, to what was delivered.</p>
            <p>O! May the Holy SPIRIT of our GOD, make it come with <hi>Efficacy!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We find, the <hi>Hill</hi> on the North ſide whereof <hi>Joſhua</hi> was buried, had [Joſh. XXIV. 30.] the Name of, <hi>Har-Gayaſh;</hi> which Name ſignifies, <hi>The Mountain of Trembling.</hi> The Jews have a Tradition, That at the Time of his Burial, the <hi>Mountain Trembled</hi> with an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> to teſtify the Diſpleaſure of GOD againſt the People. My Friends, We approach as to an <hi>Har-Gayaſh,</hi> in what is now to be ſet before us.</p>

            <head>A SPEECH, Made by One of the Miniſters, to the Inhabitants of BOSTON; Aſſembled the Morning after the EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKE. <hi>Octo.</hi> 30. 1727.</head>
            <p>THE Glorious GOD has <hi>Roared out of Zion.</hi> We have the laſt Night heard the terrible <hi>Roaring;</hi> with general and uncommon Terror, heard the awful Repetition of it. Who is here of you, among them who felt the <hi>Earth trembling</hi> under them, that ſaid not upon it, <hi>When I heard, my Lips quivered at the Voice, and I trembled in my ſelf, that I might find Reſt in the Day of Trouble!</hi> Who is there that ſaid not, <hi>Lord, my Fleſh trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!</hi> The <hi>Lion hath roared; Who will not fear?</hi> We are worſe than <hi>Beaſts,</hi> if we <hi>tremble</hi> not.</p>
            <p>Never did the City of BOSTON, in the Ninety ſeven Years that have rolled over it, ſee
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002919_0009_0FE696798DC160A8"/>ſuch a <hi>Night,</hi> as what we ſaw a few Hours ago. A MIDNIGHT CRY was heard; The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation whereof is not this Morning over with us; An <hi>Auguiſh</hi> like that on a <hi>Travailing Woman,</hi> ſiezed upon <hi>Men</hi> as well as <hi>Women.</hi> What <hi>Fear,</hi> from the Apprehenſion of going to the <hi>Pil,</hi> by a ſtroke like a <hi>ſuare</hi> upon us!</p>
            <p>We have had the repeted, more than three times repeted <hi>Shocks,</hi> of a Formidable EARTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAKE. And GOD knows, whether there are any more to come, or what Execution they may do, when they come.</p>
            <p>When the never-to-be-forgotten <hi>Sicilian</hi> EARTHQUAKE in our Days, had given ſome <hi>Shocks</hi> which only terrified the People, after an Intermiſſion of Two Days, there came on thoſe, which horribly deſtroy'd them; A <hi>Boſom of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> that ſwept away near one hundred and fifty Thouſand of them.</p>
            <p>The Ancient Cry of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> is now moſt certainly the Cry of our <hi>Earthquakes;</hi> Hoſ. X. 12. <hi>It is Time to ſeek the Lord.</hi> The poor Popiſh <hi>Idolaters,</hi> in their <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> make their Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions &amp; their Addreſſes to, <hi>Lying Vanities,</hi> &amp; ſilly gods that <hi>cannot ſave</hi> them; <hi>They cry, but there is none to ſave them!</hi> We will <hi>walk in the Name of</hi> JEHOVA-JESUS, <hi>who is our</hi> only GOD, as thoſe unhappy Creatures <hi>walk in the Name</hi> of Theirs. <hi>Their Rock is not as our Rock;</hi> We have a SAVIOUR, in whom we find a ſufficient <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> for us, and a <hi>very preſent Help in Trouble,</hi>

We will invert the Order of the <hi>Eighteenth Pſalm;</hi> The Pſalmiſt ſaid, <hi>In my Diſtreſs I called on the Lord, and cried unto my GOD, Then the Earth ſhook and trembled.</hi> We will ſay, <hi>Since the Earth ſhakes and trembles; Now in our Diſtreſs we will call on the Lord, and cry unto our GOD.</hi> It is with pleaſure that I read in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> a Letter of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> who was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the True GOD, but yet complains, That the <hi>Pagan</hi> urged him to perſecute the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> 
               <q>Whereas (he ſays) I underſtand, that they are a good People, and whenever there happens an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> their Courſe is to go and pray unto their GOD, that His Wrath may be turned away from us; And in this they ſhow more of Religion than the People that urge me to deſtroy them!</q> We are this Day doing what the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> did, and what all <hi>Genuine Chriſtians</hi> will.</p>
            <p>We have Two <hi>Occaſions,</hi> to repair unto our gracious GOD; we have Two <hi>Petitions</hi> to carry unto Him. The one is, That we may have the Grace to <hi>know,</hi> and to <hi>do,</hi> the <hi>Duties,</hi> which the <hi>Earthquake</hi> does in its hideous Rumbles moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible call us to. The other is; That there may be no ſuch <hi>Returns</hi> of the <hi>Earthquake</hi> as to lay us in Deſolations, and make our <hi>Plagues wonderful.</hi> But, the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of our Supplications, will very much turn upon our Attention to the Voice of our glorious GOD in the <hi>Earthquake</hi> which is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002919_0011_0FE696A1DAECDE38"/>now affrighting of us. Don't we remember thoſe Divine <hi>Retaliations; As He cried, and they would not hear, ſo they cried and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> And again, <hi>Becauſe I called, and ye refuſed, I will laugh at your Calamity, and I will mock when your Fear cometh; when your Fear cometh as Deſolatioa, and your Deſtruction corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as a Whirlwind; when Diſtreſs and Anguiſh cometh upon you?</hi> Yea, I may ſay unto you, The <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> of PIETY, will be ſo many <hi>Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and indeed, the beſt ſort of <hi>Supplications,</hi> the moſt proper and the moſt potent <hi>Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> There are <hi>pure Hands lifted up</hi> in our <hi>Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> when we <hi>Do</hi> what our GOD has oblig'd us to.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as a Praeliminary, and as a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the Diſcourſe, wherewith I propoſe to treat you, the TEXT which I now pitch upon is That;</p>

               <bibl>

               <p>The Voice of the LORD, crieth unto the City.</p>
            </q>
            <p>CErtainly, you will not expect, that I ſhould ſpend any time in proving, That there is a VOICE of the glorious GOD, in all that He <hi>does,</hi> in the World. All the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Creation,</hi> and all the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> there is a <hi>Voice</hi> of the glorious GOD in them. He <hi>ſpeaks</hi> in all
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002919_0012_0FE69679A72B7F10"/>that He <hi>does.</hi> And there is no place, where their <hi>Voice</hi> may not be <hi>beard.</hi> O <hi>Deaf</hi> we, if we hear it not! — That <hi>Voice, — O Love,</hi> O <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, O Adore, the glorious One, who does all theſe things. O Fear this GOD, and give Glory unto Him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis very ſure; In the <hi>Works</hi> wherein the glorious GOD goes out of the <hi>Ordinary Road,</hi> or, His <hi>Extraordinary Diſpenſations;</hi> In theſe, His <hi>Voice</hi> becomes very Notable; and moſt inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable are they who <hi>Regard not the Works of the Lord, nor the Operation of His Hands: He ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, and not build them up.</hi>

            <p>EARTHQUAKES are ſuch <hi>Works.</hi> We read, Pſal. XXIX. 8. <hi>The Voice of the Lord ſhakes the Wilderneſs.</hi> There is the <hi>Voice of the Lord,</hi> in it, when He <hi>ſhakes</hi> our Territories. — There may be ſome <hi>Earthquakes</hi> more <hi>Supernatural</hi> than others: We reckon that of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> One; And ſo we reckon that at the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Bleſſed JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS; and yet more conſpicuouſly that of His <hi>Crucifixion.</hi> The <hi>ſplit Rocks</hi> at this Day obſerved by Travellers who are <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and ſomewhat Nice in their Credulity, are thought by ſome no Injudicious Men, to be the laſting Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Memorials of it. But uſually, our <hi>Earthquakes</hi> have <hi>Natural Cauſes</hi> aſſigned for them. What they are, 'tis now and here, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Time nor Place for Philoſophical Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. Whether <hi>Colluctations</hi> of <hi>Minerals</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Vapours that muſt have an Exploſion,

Let the <hi>Natural Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> be what the <hi>Wiſe Men of Euquiry</hi> pleaſe, <hi>They</hi> and their <hi>Cauſes</hi> are ſtill under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of HIM that is the <hi>GOD of Nature.</hi> Shall we ſay, All this is but a <hi>Chance that happens to us,</hi> or the meer unguided <hi>Motion</hi> of <hi>Matter?</hi> Ah, profane <hi>Philiſtine!</hi> — 'Tis a Language for none but a <hi>Philiſtine.</hi> A <hi>Chriſtian</hi> cannot ſpeak ſo; No, He is one that will be ſenſible of GOD in theſe things. Verily, In them, <hi>Lo, GOD ſends forth His Voice, and that a mighty Voice</hi> unto us.</p>
            <p>You will yet leſs expect, that I ſhould be at any pains, for proving, That this VOICE of the glorious GOD, is to be hearken'd to. When the <hi>great GOD who formed all things,</hi> will pleaſe to <hi>utter His Voice,</hi> What? Shall it not by all that have the Faculties of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in them rendring them capable of hearkening to it, be hearken'd to? O moſt <hi>unreaſonable!</hi> GOD our Maker
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002919_0014_0FE6967BF9873410"/>ſays, <hi>Unto you, O Men, I call, and my Voice is unto the Sons of Men.</hi> We are <hi>Bruits</hi> rather than <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Colts of the wild Aſs,</hi> yea, <hi>Children of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed One,</hi> rather than the <hi>Sons of Men,</hi> if we do not hearken to the <hi>Voice</hi> of his Eternal <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> He will not own us, for the <hi>People of His Paſture, and the Sheep of His Hand,</hi> if we do not even <hi>To Day bear His Voice.</hi> An hardy <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may ſay, Exod. V. 2. <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould Obey His Voice!</hi> Words to come from the Mouth of none but a <hi>Pharaob,</hi> and a <hi>Devil!</hi> But, Ah, <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ah! Monſter, The Almighty GOD, whom thou ſo inſulteſt, and whoſe <hi>Voice</hi> thou ſo defieſt, what will the affronted JEHOVAH do unto thee! <hi>What will He do unto thee!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed there is this Argument for hearkening to the <hi>Voice</hi> of our GOD, that if we do it not, we provoke Him to <hi>Render His Rebukes in Flames of Fire</hi> unto us; We provoke Him, to inflict <hi>great Plagues and of long continuance</hi> upon us. If we do not hearken to His <hi>Voice,</hi> eſpecially in His <hi>Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory Dealings</hi> with us, — He ſays, <hi>If ye will not hearken unto me, I will puniſh you yet ſeven times more for your Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, Be now at length effectually <hi>Alarmed,</hi> O Inhabitants of BOSTON, yea, and of the whole Countrey whereof this is the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis.</hi> What a <hi>Trial,</hi> Yea, what a Gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſcending <hi>Trial,</hi> is our glorious GOD making of us, whether we will <hi>hearken to His Voice</hi> or no? A few Months ago, how fearfully did
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002919_0015_0FE696AAE6B6D7C8"/>we ſee the Heavens blazing over us, with Coruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that fill'd People with a <hi>fearful Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>fiery Indignation</hi> which is anon to <hi>devour the Adverſaries</hi> of GOD! And how frequently did loud <hi>Thunder-Claps</hi> rouſe us out of our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargies! How frequently did hot <hi>Thunderbolts</hi> fall where many Objects felt the Force of an <hi>Arm</hi> which, <hi>What can ſtand before?</hi> But, alas, Did we <hi>bear Attentively,</hi> and Obediently, the <hi>Noiſe of Hu Voice,</hi> or, Mind as we ſhould have done, the <hi>Sound that went out of His Mouth?</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, The <hi>Stormy Wind which fulfils His Word,</hi> came ruſhing down upon us. We ſaw an <hi>Horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tempeſt.</hi> A <hi>Storm</hi> came, which tore up the Trees of our Fields by the roots; tore down parts of our Houſes; Yea, Wounded and Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome of our People. The <hi>great and ſtrong Wind</hi> which <hi>rent the Mountains,</hi> had a <hi>Voice</hi> in it. Indeed, it was not a <hi>ſtill ſmall Voice;</hi> but was it therefore the leſs to be hearken'd to? And now, <hi>After the Wind an Earthquake!</hi>—Oh! Let it not be ſaid, <hi>The Lord was not in the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</hi> Our GOD ſays, <hi>Now ſurely, they will fear me, and they will receive Inſtruction;—that I may not proceed unto a more dreadful Extremity, and cut off their Dwellings, and them with and in their Dwellings!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I am now therefore to proceed unto, is the Conſideration of that CASE.</p>

            <p>O People <hi>Trembling</hi> before the Lord; <hi>Hear now my SPEECH, and hearken to all my Words.</hi> For indeed, I may declare unto you, The <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Lips will be of Right Things;</hi> and you will not <hi>underſtand Wiſdom,</hi> nor be <hi>of an underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Heart,</hi> if you do not hearken to them.</p>
            <p n="1">I.

            <p>Syrs, Don't you <hi>clearly ſee</hi> the <hi>Eternal Power and Godhead</hi> of Him, who can <hi>ſhake the Earth,</hi> yea, ſhake it all to pieces at His Pleaſure?

If an <hi>Earthquake</hi> do unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things upon us, let the Impurities of <hi>Sodom</hi> ſtand indicted for it.</p>
            <p>How do the Sins of <hi>Diſhoneſty</hi> bring an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſcandal on our Profeſſion; and the <hi>perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ways</hi> thereof, make the <hi>way of Truth</hi> to be <hi>evil ſpoken of?</hi> The Habitations, that are not <hi>Habitations of Righteouſweſs,</hi> but built, or fill'd, or ſed, by <hi>Diſhoneſt Gain,</hi> 'tis not wrong, if the <hi>Earth</hi> don't bear them to ſtand upon it.

Briefly, A glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous CHRIST has in a <hi>Covenant of Redemption</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged unto His FATHER for His People; That He would furniſh them with a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> in Relying whereon they ſhould be <hi>Forgiven</hi> and <hi>Accepted</hi> with Him; And, That He would then fill them with the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD and their Neighbour, and Heal all that is Amiſs in them, and fit them for and bring them to <hi>all the ſpiritual Bleſſings in the Heavenly places.</hi> Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto it, O Goſpellized Soul, That thou mayſt be comprehended in this <hi>Covenant</hi> of thy SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR. Beg it of Him; <hi>O my SAVIOUR, Do for me all that thou haſt engaged unto thy FATHER to do for all thy choſen!</hi> This Conſent brings thee into the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002919_0035_0FE696C2B34C4748"/>
               <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> Thy SAVIOUR takes thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>ſhadow of His Wings;</hi> And what can any <hi>Earthquake</hi> do unto thee there? My Neighbours come about me, and Cry, <hi>Oh! What ſhall I do, if I ſee the Earth opening under me, and ſeel my ſelf going down into the Pit?</hi> I cannot for my life think on a better Anſwer than This; <hi>Get and keep a faſt hold of a CHRIST, and you are in eternal ſafety.</hi> I have juſt now told you, how to do it. Soul, Thy SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR calls to thee, <hi>With me thou ſhalt be in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Oh! Repair to Him, and ſay, <hi>Lord, I am Thine; ſave me!</hi> If an <hi>Earthquake</hi> ſhould now ſink thee down, thou haſt a SAVIOUR that will fetch thee up again.</p>
            <p>—And now, O EARTHQUAKE, <hi>Do thy worſt. Thou canſt not make me miſerable. My SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR is my Friend, I will not fear; what can an Earthquake do unto me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly; A Life of Serious, Watchful, Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Fruitful PIETY; <hi>This</hi> will do. <hi>All its Ways are Ways of Tranquillity, and all its Paths are Safety.</hi> He that <hi>walks with</hi> GOD, what has he to ſear, tho' he ſhould have the <hi>Earth trembling</hi> under his Feet? The <hi>Life of GOD,</hi> come into <hi>That,</hi> and thou haſt what can't be <hi>kill'd;</hi> No, Not by an <hi>Earthquake.</hi> Beleever, Get a Soul as full of a CHRIST as ever thou canſt; eſpecially, in <hi>Precious Thoughts</hi> of Him. Let thy <hi>Life</hi> be fill'd with <hi>Devotions</hi> towards GOD, and with <hi>Benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> towards Men. Make the <hi>ſerving</hi> and <hi>pleaſing</hi> of GOD in them, the main <hi>Scope</hi> of thy Actions;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002919_0036_0FE69697A110D418"/>Make the <hi>ſeeing</hi> and <hi>ſerving</hi> of GOD by them, the main <hi>Sweet</hi> of thy Enjoyments. Be daily <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing of Good,</hi> and have a peerleſs Delight in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and, <hi>Be not weary of well-doing.</hi> If an <hi>Earthquake</hi> find thee <hi>ſo doing,</hi>—how <hi>Safe,</hi> how <hi>safe,</hi> art thou? <hi>What can harm thee,</hi> if thou be ſuch a <hi>Follower of the Good One?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas, When I ſee the Epidemical Decay of <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Vital</hi> PIETY, and how <hi>Lukewarm</hi> we are in all that is Good, with how few <hi>Agonies</hi> the affairs of Salvation are carried on, methinks, I ſee ſufficient cauſe for <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> to throw us into <hi>Agonies. Laodicea</hi> had this charged upon her, <hi>Thou art Lukewarm.</hi> Tis <hi>Our</hi> unhappy and prevailing Temper. But what is become of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicea?</hi> Tis intirely loſt, in amazing <hi>Earthquakes.</hi> No Travellers can find where <hi>Laodicea</hi> ſtood!— It is entirely abſorb'd and vaniſhed, in horrible <hi>Earthquakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly. What a Contempt is due to an <hi>Earth,</hi> whereof we ſee all the Poſſeſſions lying under ſuch a diſmal <hi>Uncertainty!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We find People <hi>caſting away their Idols,</hi> when they ſee the <hi>LORD ariſing to ſhake terribly the Earth.</hi> The <hi>Earthquake</hi> wherein we juſt now ſaw the Glorious GOD <hi>ariſing to ſhake terribly the Earth,</hi> has in it this <hi>Voice</hi> unto us; <hi>Don't Idolize this Earth! Set not your Hearts upon an Earth, which may eaſily and ſuddenly prove a Grave unto you, and unto all that you have upon it!</hi> If we could look into the <hi>uncertain Ground</hi> which we ſtand upon,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002919_0037_0FE696C2D32970F8"/>and build upon, and could ſee the deep, the wide, and hideous <hi>Vaults</hi> below, and how liable the thin <hi>Arched Roof</hi> over the hollow Receſſes of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous World</hi> may be to fail and break &amp; ſink upon the Expanſion of the Vapours there, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it were enough to make us almoſt ſwoon with Fear, and in a ſhuddering Horror, and our Hearts even die away within us. The dreadful <hi>Abyſs,</hi> over which there is bent and laid the ſhallow <hi>Bridge,</hi> that ſuſtains us, and all that the <hi>Men of this World</hi> have to ſubſiſt upon, or find comfort in! Syrs, we have no <hi>earthly</hi> Poſſeſſions, but what may be call'd, <hi>Moveables;</hi> Our very <hi>Houſes</hi> are ſo! O you that <hi>mind Earthly Things!</hi> What of this <hi>Idolized Earth</hi> is there, that you can be ſure of? How does all appear, when an <hi>Earthquake</hi> ſhews you <hi>truly</hi> what it is? How Undone! How Undone! How Damned are you, if you are put off with a <hi>Portion</hi> here? The Text, of which the <hi>Earthquake</hi> is a Cogent and a Pungent <hi>Sermon,</hi> is that; Col. III. 2. <hi>Set your Affections on the Things that are Above, not on Things that are on the Earth.</hi> My Fellow-Travellers; Let us live like <hi>Strangers on the Earth,</hi> and even as <hi>Dead</hi> unto it; and maintain a wiſe <hi>Indifferency</hi> to all the Enjoyments and Endearments of it. <hi>As Dying, and behold we Live!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done.—But now, <hi>Return and diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Righteous and the Wicked; between him that ſerveth GOD, and him that ſerveth Him not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, firſt, ſee the forlorn and frighted Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002919_0038_0FE69698F18FD9D8"/>of the <hi>Wicked;</hi> How their <hi>Countenance is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> and their <hi>Thoughts trouble them,</hi> and their <hi>knees do ſwite one againſt another!</hi> Their <hi>Fleſh</hi> it ſelf evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently quivering, and their <hi>Hearts failing for fear, and for looking after: be Things that are coming on the Earth!</hi> — And NOW, they wiſh, <hi>Oh! That I were in good Terms with Heaven!</hi> they think; Well, If they may eſcape <hi>this once,</hi> how they will <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves unto Godlineſs;</hi> how Regularly they will <hi>order their Converſation;</hi> how conſcienciouſly they will <hi>work out their own Salvation!</hi> — Sayſt thou ſo, <hi>Friend?</hi> — But Oh! <hi>Let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more!</hi> We ſhall ſee, how they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the <hi>Vows</hi> of GOD upon them; how they behave themſelves.</p>
            <p>But then, the <hi>Righteous! Mark the perfect Man, and behold the Upright;</hi> See the <hi>Peace of GOD</hi> that fortifies him, even, when he has a proſpect of his <hi>End</hi> juſt come upon him. There is indeed a <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and godly Fear</hi> with which he regards what the great GOD is doing in an <hi>Earthquake.</hi> Even a <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf is an Example of it. He is neither a <hi>Stoick,</hi> nor a <hi>Mocker.</hi> But yet — not <hi>Afraid with any Amazement!</hi> — you may ſee an Amiable <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity</hi> in him, when all the World about him is in an uproar. How free from the <hi>Commotions,</hi> and Convulſions and Confuſions, with which the reft of the World is agitated. Even an Heathen Poet, celebrates it among the priviledges and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of a Virtuous Man, <hi>Let an Earthquake break and ſink the World,</hi> [Impavidum ſerient Ruinae]

               <hi>be is not frighted at the Ruins!</hi> But O the Triumphs of the Man that indeed <hi>Lives unto GOD,</hi> and feels a CHRIST, <hi>living in him!</hi> He is aſſured, <hi>If the Earthquake put a ſtop to my Breath, my Soul will be in the Paradiſe of GOD before the morning.</hi> Like <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas,</hi> he can <hi>Sing</hi> in the midſt of an <hi>Earthquake;</hi> he can <hi>Sing for the Majeſty of the Lord;</hi> he can ſay, <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting! O Earthquake, where is thy Victory!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus do we turn to <hi>ſee the Voice!</hi> — We read, Rev. XI. 19. <hi>The Temple of GOD was opened, and there were Voices, and Thundrings, and a great Earthquake.</hi> We are this Day come into the <hi>Temple,</hi> that we may hear the <hi>Voices</hi> of our <hi>Great Earthquake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Great Earthquake</hi> is called in the Bible, <hi>A Trembling of GOD.</hi> But, O! If we may <hi>Tremble</hi> more than the <hi>Earth,</hi> and be thoſe whom GOD <hi>ſhall ſee Trembling at His Word;</hi> This, This would be a <hi>Trembling of GOD</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: Such as, Bleſſed are they that come into it.</p>
            <p>In ſome Expectation, that <hi>GOD giving forth His Thundring Voice,</hi> in and by the <hi>melting</hi> of the <hi>Trembling Earth,</hi> His <hi>Voice</hi> will be heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto, and that our <hi>Earthquake</hi> will prove the <hi>moſt uſeful Diſpenſation</hi> that ever we have ſeen, in all the Days of our Pilgrimage, We ſhall now conclude; and preſently Sing part of the <hi>Forty ſixth Pſalm,</hi> with the <hi>laſt Verſe</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Pſalm</hi> annexed unto it.</p>

            <p>BEFORE Six Days from the Firſt Shock of our EARTHQUAKE are Expired, we are able to Relate, That it has reached, as far as 'tis poſſible for us in this Time to learn, upon all points of the Compaſs. We already know of it's reaching from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> near one hundred &amp; forty Miles. It ſeems, to have been at the <hi>Northward,</hi> rather more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blethan in our parts. The <hi>Roar</hi> of it <hi>longer</hi> and <hi>louder,</hi> and the Noiſe of the <hi>Exploſion</hi> ſomewhere or other, after more than an Hours <hi>murmur,</hi> more audible, and more terrible; equal to that of many diſcharged Cannon. It affects Travellers to ſee, not only vaſt Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of <hi>Stone-Wall</hi> thrown down by it, but alſo mighty <hi>Rocks</hi> either overſet, or ſunk ſome way into the Earth. 'Tis not known, how many <hi>Houſes,</hi> or <hi>Chimneys</hi> are damnified. But then, That no <hi>more!</hi> — That no <hi>Worſe!</hi> — That no <hi>Lives</hi> that we yet know of, Sacrificed! —</p>
            <p>Scarce a Night has paſs'd all this Week, without a ſenſible Repetition of the <hi>Sbocks,</hi> with the concomitant Rumbles in mony Places. But
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002919_0041_0FE696CC17A1D9B8"/>the ſmell of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is affirmed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to have been plain unto them, — adds to a <hi>Fearful Expectation</hi> of a <hi>Fiery Indignation,</hi> — in GOD's Time and way to be proceeded in.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the Glorious GOD has heretofore ſpoke to <hi>New-England,</hi> by leſſer <hi>Earthquakes;</hi> and our Predeceſſors made ſuch an Holy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them, that they proved <hi>profitable Diſpenſations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About, <hi>Jun.</hi> 2. 1638. there was an <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi> that ſhook the Houſes, and ſhook down the Things that ſtood upon Shelves in them; and People that were abroad, could not ſtand, but laid hold upon what was next them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from falling down. A ſecond <hi>Shock</hi> ſucceeded, but not equal to the former. The <hi>Sea alſo was troubled;</hi> and the Veſſels there felt the Shock, with ſurprize and conſternation.</p>
            <p>GOD was at the ſame time, <hi>ſhaking</hi> the Churches in the Country, with a Shock that would have torn them to pieces: if <hi>GOD in the midſt</hi> of them, had not prevented their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>moved:</hi> Their GOD and SAVIOUR <hi>helped</hi> them, in that <hi>Morning</hi> of the Colony.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Octob.</hi> 29 1653. there was an <hi>Earthquake;</hi> on which the Aged Hand of the famous Mr. <hi>Peter Bulkly,</hi> the never-to-be-forgotten Paſtor and Glory of <hi>Concord,</hi> could not forbear taking a Pen, and Writing this Epigram. [Taken from, His <hi>Life,</hi> in the <hi>Magnalia CHRISTI Americana.</hi> B. III. p. 98.]</p>

               <q>The Lord ſeldom Viſits any Town or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with deſolating Judgments, but He firſt gives them Warning of it, by one means or another; and many times by <hi>Earthquakes.</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002919_0044_0FE6969E30A431B8"/>A Roman Hiſtorian obſerves, that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> never felt any <hi>Earthquake,</hi> but ſome ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Judgment ſoon followed. In the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is ſaid, <hi>There ſhall be Earthquakes in diverſe Places;</hi> The Next Words are; <hi>And FAMINES &amp; PESTILENCES. Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> are ſometimes <hi>prodromous</hi> of thoſe other Judgments. — But, —We have at this Day Reaſon to expect that a Notable COMING of the LORD is near at hand. Yea, we may ſay, <hi>The Great-DAY of THE LORD, is Near, it is Near, and it Haſteth greatly.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There have been more than One or Two leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> beſides theſe, at ſeveral Times in the Country. But never any that on all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts has equalled THAT which is now Alarming of us.</p>
            <p>We will at preſent conclude, with a few Lines extracted from a little Treatiſe entituled, <hi>Geologia Norvegica:</hi> written by a Daniſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, whoſe Name was <hi>Michael Peterſon Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholt,</hi> on the Occaſion of (what he calls) <hi>That very great &amp; ſpacious Earthquake, almoſt quite thro' the South Parts</hi> of <hi>Norway, Apr.</hi> 24. 1657.</p>
            <p>He ſays, <q>It carryed ſuch a Noiſe &amp; Sound with it, that the People at firſt knew not but it was the Noiſe of Thunder, until they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Houſes ſhook, and all their Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables totter. — Yet it hath not done any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Harm; for which we ought to be very Thankful unto GOD.— Nevertheleſs,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002919_0045_0FE696CDB76C7DE8"/>in regard that this <hi>Earthquake</hi> was of ſuch a Length and Breadth, namely an hundred and ſixty Miles, we need not doubt but that it may ſignify ſome Remarkable Change and Alteration. The ancient Hiſtoriographer <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> has recorded it; That when any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Change or Calamity approaches, it is commonly ſignified by ſuch preceding Tokens! —</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>—When GOD Almighty, now in theſe laſt Times of the World, ſhall permit ſuch <hi>Great &amp; Spacious Earthquakes,</hi> for ſo many many Miles in length to happen, Men ought not careleſly to ſlight them, and think no more of them: No, But regard &amp; receive them, as partly ſignifying ſome unuſual Accident Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending or Approaching; and partly as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible <hi>Forerunners</hi> of the DAY, which the <hi>earneſt Expectation of the Creature waiteth for, yea, Groaneth and even Travaileth in Pain.</hi>
