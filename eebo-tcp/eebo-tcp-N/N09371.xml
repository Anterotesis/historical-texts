            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS mankind from one parent are divided into many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and as trading to ſea is greatly increaſed within a few ages paſt; amidſt this extended commerce how neceſſary is it that the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed followers of Chriſt keep ſacred his holy name, and be employed about trade and traffick no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than juſtice and equity evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently accompanies? that we may give no juſt cauſe of offence to any, however diſtant, or unable to plead their own cauſe; and may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually keep in view, the ſpreading of the true and ſaving knowledge of God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, amongſt our fellow creatures, which through his infinite love ſome feel to be more precious than any other treaſure.</p>

                  <hi>CHAPTER I.</hi> On ſerving the Lord in our outward Employments.</head>
               <p>UNDER the humbling diſpenſations of the Father of mercies, I have felt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> inward labour for the good of my fellow creatures, and a concern that the holy ſpirit, which alone can reſtore mankind to a ſtate of true harmony, may with ſingleneſs of heart be waited for and followed.</p>
               <p>I TRUST there are many under that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, which if faithfully attended to will make them quick of underſtanding in the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011948_0003_0F8788778E3FA4E0"/>
fear of the Lord, and qualify with firmneſs to be true patterns of the Chriſtian life, who in living and walking may hold forth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to others, to come out of the entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements of the ſpirit of this world.</p>
               <p>AND that which I feel firſt to expreſs is, a care for thoſe who are in circumſtances, which appear difficult, with reſpect to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their families in a way anſwerable to pure wiſdom, that they may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but remember that in humbly obeying the leading of Chriſt, he owneth us as his friends, <hi>Ye are my friends if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I command you;</hi> and to be a friend to Chriſt, is to be united to him, who hath all power in heaven and in earth; and though a woman may forget her ſucking child, yet will he not forget his faithful ones.</p>
               <p>THE condition of many who dwell in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hath often affected me with a brotherly ſympathy, attended with a deſire that reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may be laboured for; and where the holy leader directeth to a country life or ſome change of employ, he may be faithfully followed; for under the refining hand of the Lord I have ſeen that the inhabitants of ſome cities are greatly increaſed through ſome branches of buſineſs which his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth not lead into, and that being entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in theſe things, tends to bring a cloud over the minds of people convinced of the leadings of this holy leader, and obſtructs
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011948_0003_0F8788778E3FA4E0"/>
the coming of the kingdom of Chriſt on earth as it is in heaven.</p>
               <p>NOW if we indulge a deſire to imitate our neighbours in thoſe things which harmoniſe not with the true Chriſtian walking, theſe entanglements may hold faſt to us, and ſome, who in an awakening time, feel tender ſcruples, with reſpect to their manner of life, may look on the example of others more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the church, who yet may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined from every degree of droſs; and by looking on theſe examples, and deſiring to ſupport their families in a way pleaſant to the natural mind, there may be danger of the worldly wiſdom gaining ſtrength in them, and of their departure from that pure feeling of truth, which if faithfully attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, would teach contentment in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, even in a very low eſtate.</p>
               <p>ONE formerly ſpeaking on the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of true humility ſaith, <q>He that troubles not himſelf with anxious tho'ts for more than is neceſſary, lives little leſs than the life of Angels, whilſt by a mind content with little, he imitates their want of nothing. Cave's prim. Chriſti. page 31.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>IT is not enough, ſays Tertullian, that a Chriſtian be chaſte and modeſt, but he muſt appear to be ſo: a virtue of which he ſhould have ſo a great ſtore, that it ſhould flow from his mind upon his habit,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011948_0004_0F8788785CEA34D8"/>
and break from the retirements of his conſcience, into the ſuperficies of his life. Same book, page 43.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>THE garments we wear, ſays Clemens, ought to be mean and frugal—that is true ſimplicity of habit, which takes away what is vain and ſuperfluous; that the beſt and moſt ſolid garment, which is the fartheſt from curioſity. Page 49.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THOUGH the change from day to night, is by a motion ſo gradual as ſcarcely to be perceived, yet when night is come we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it very different from the day; and thus as people become wiſe in their own eyes, and prudent in their own ſight; cuſtoms riſe up from the ſpirit of this world, and ſpread by little and little, till a departure from the ſimplicity that there is in Chriſt, becomes as diſtinguiſhable as light from darkneſs, to ſuch who are crucified to the world.</p>
               <p>OUR holy Shepherd, to encourage his flock in firmneſs and perſeverance, reminds them of his love for them, <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you; continue ye in my love;</hi> and in another place graciouſly points out the danger of departing therefrom, by going into unſuitable employments; this he repreſents in the ſimilitude of offence from that uſeful active member, the hand; and to fix the inſtruction the deeper, names the right hand, <hi>If thy right hand offend thee cut it off and caſt it from thee</hi>—If thou feeleſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011948_0004_0F8788785CEA34D8"/>
in thy employment, humbly follow him who leads into all truth, and is a ſtrong and faithful friend to thoſe who are reſigned to him.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, he points out thoſe things which appearing pleaſant to the natural mind, are not beſt for us, in the ſimilitude of offence from the eye, <hi>If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out, and caſt it from thee.</hi> To pluck out the eye, or cut off the hand, is attended with ſharp pain; and how precious is the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which our Redeemer thus opens to us, that we may not faint under the moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trials, but put our truſt in him, even in him who ſent an Angel to feed Elijah in the wilderneſs; who fed a multitude with a few barley loaves, and is now as attentive to the wants of his people as ever.</p>
               <p>THE prophet Iſaiah, repreſents the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous doings of the Iſraelites toward the poor, as the fruits of an effeminate life, <hi>As for my people, children are their oppreſſors, and women rule over them; what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Then he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the haughtineſs of the daughters of Sion, and enumerates many ornaments, as inſtances of their vanity, to uphold which, the poor were ſo hardly dealt with, that he ſets forth their poverty, their leanneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to help themſelves, in the ſimilitude of a man maimed by violence or <hi>beaten to</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011948_0005_0F8788798AF98E18"/>
and forced to endure the painful operation of having his face gradually worn away in the manner of grinding.</p>
               <p>AND I may here add, that at times, when I have felt true love open my heart towards my fellow creatures, and been engaged in weighty converſation in the cauſe of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the inſtructions I have received un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe exerciſes, in regard to the true uſe of the outward gifts of God, have made deep and laſting impreſſions on my mind.</p>
               <p>I HAVE here beheld, how the deſire to provide wealth, and to uphold a delicate life hath grievouſly entangled many, and been like ſnares to their ofspring; and though ſome have been affected with a ſenſe of their difficulties, and appeared deſirous, at times, to be helped out of them; yet for want of abiding under the humbling power of truth, they have continued in theſe entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for in remaining comformable to this world, and giving way to a delicate life, this expenſive way of living, in parents and in children, hath called for a large ſupply, and in anſwering this call <hi>the faces of the poor</hi> have been ground away, and made thin through hard dealing.</p>
               <p>THERE is balm, there is a phyſician! and O what longings do I feel! that we may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the means appointed for our healing, know that removed which now miniſters cauſe for the cries of many people to aſcend
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011948_0005_0F8788798AF98E18"/>
to heaven againſt their oppreſſors, and that we may ſee the true harmony reſtored.</p>
               <p>BEHOLD <hi>how good and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi> The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this unity is thus opened by the apoſtle, <hi>If we walk in the light, as Chriſt is in the light, we ſhall have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Chriſt will cleanſe us from all ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE land may be polluted with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood, which like the blood of Abel may cry to the Almighty; but thoſe who <hi>walk in the light as Chriſt is in the light,</hi> they know the <hi>lamb of God, who taketh away ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WALKING is a phraſe frequently uſed in ſcripture, to repreſent our journey through life, and appears to comprehend the various affairs and tranſactions properly relating to our being in this world.</p>
               <p>CHRIST being the light, dwells always in the light, and if our walking be thus, and in every affair and concern we faithfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this divine leader; he preſerves from giving juſt cauſe for any to quarrel with us; and where this foundation is laid and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kept to, by families converſant with each other, the way is open far theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in ſociety, which our heavenly father intends as a part of our happineſs in this world; and then we may experience the goodneſs, and pleaſantneſs of dwelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in unity; but where ways of living
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011948_0006_0F87887A2C51AC30"/>
take place, which tend to oppreſſion, and in the purſuit of wealth, people do that to others which they know would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to themſelves, either in exerciſing an abſolute power over them, or otherwiſe laying on them unequitable burdens; here a fear leſt that meaſure ſhould be meeted to them, which they have meaſured to others, incites a care to ſupport that by craft and cunning devices which ſtands not on the firm foundation of righteouſneſe: thus the harmony of ſociety is broken, and from hence commotions and wars do frequently ariſe in the world.</p>
               <p>COME <hi>out of Babylon my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi> Rev. xv. 3, 4. This Babel, or Babylon, was built in the ſpirit of ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation; <hi>Let us build us a city and a tower, whoſe top may reach to heaven, and let us make us a name.</hi> Gen. xi. 4. In departing from an humble truſt in God, and following a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſpirit, people have intentions to get the upperhand of their fellow creatures, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately meditate on means to obtain their ends, have a language in their hearts which is hard to underſtand. In Babel the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is confounded.</p>
               <p>THIS city is repreſented as a place of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and thoſe employed in it, as merchants of the earth: <hi>The merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> Rev. xviii. 3.</p>

               <p>AS my mind hath been brought into a brotherly feeling with the poor, as to the things of this life, who are under tryals in regard to getting a living in a way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the purity of truth; a labour of heart hath attended me, that their way may not be made difficult through the love of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in thoſe who are tryed with plentiful eſtates, but that they with tenderneſs of heart may ſympathize with them.</p>
               <p>IT was the ſaying of our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God and mammon.</hi> There is a deep feeling of the way of purity, a way in which the wiſdom of the world hath no part, but is opened by the ſpirit of truth, and is <hi>called the way of holineſs;</hi> a way in which the traveller is employed in watching unto prayer; and the outward gain we get in this journey is conſidered as a truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us, by HIM who formed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

the world; and is the rightful director of the uſe and application of the product of it.</p>
               <p>NOW except the mind be preſerved chaſte, there is no ſafety for us; but in an eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from true reſignation, the ſpirit of the world caſts up a way, in which gain is many times principally attended to, and in which there is a ſelfiſh application of outward trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p>HOW agreeable to the true harmony of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, is that exhortation of the Apoſtle? <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others. Let this mind be in you which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A PERSON in outward proſperity may have the power of obtaining riches, but the ſame mind being in him which is in Chriſt Jeſus, he may feel a tenderneſs of heart towards thoſe of low degree; and inſtead of ſetting himſelf above them, may look upon it as an unmerited favour, that his way through life is more eaſy than the way of many others; may improve every opportunity of leading forth out of thoſe cuſtoms which have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled the family; employ his time in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the wants of the poor members, and hold forth ſuch a perfect example of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, that the pure witneſs may be reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many minds; and the way opened for a harmonious walking together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:011948_0008_0F87887C06742150"/>JESUS CHRIST, in promoting the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, was not deficient in looking for the helpleſs, who lay in obſcurity, nor did he ſave any thing to render himſelf ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable amongſt men, which might have been of more uſe to the weak members in his Father's family; of whoſe compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards us I may now ſpeak a little. He who was perfectly happy in himſelf, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with infinite love, <hi>took not upon him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels,</hi> but our imperfect natures, and therein wreſtled with the temptations which attend us in this life; and being the Son of HIM who is greater than earthly Princes, yet became a companion to poor, ſincere heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; and though he gave the cleareſt evidence that divine power attended him, yet the moſt unfavourable conſtructions were framed by a ſelf righteous people; thoſe miracles repreſented as the effect of a diabolical power, and endeavours uſed to render him hateful, as having his miſſion from the prince of darkneſs; nor did their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ceaſe till they took him like a criminal and brought him to tryal. Though ſome may affect to carry the appearance of being unmoved at the apprehenſion of diſtreſs, our dear Redeemer, who was perfectly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, having the ſame human nature which we have, and feeling, a little before he was apprehended, the weight of that work upon him, for which he came into the world, was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011948_0009_0F87887F18C54730"/>
                  <hi>ſorrowful even unto death;</hi> here the human nature ſtruggled to be excuſed from a cup ſo bitter; but his prayers centered in reſignation, <hi>Not my will but thine be done.</hi> In this conflict, ſo great was his agony that <hi>ſweat like drops of blood fell from him to the ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BEHOLD now as foretold by the prophet, he is in a judicial manner <hi>numbered with the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Behold him as ſome poor man of no reputation, ſtanding before the high prieſt and elders, and before Herod and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, where witneſſes appear againſt him, and he mindful of the moſt gracious deſign of his coming, declineth to plead in his own defence, <hi>but as a ſheep that is dumb before his ſhearer,</hi> ſo under many accuſations, revilings and buffetings remained ſilent. And tho' he ſignified to Peter that he had acceſs to power ſufficient to overthrow all their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forces; yet retaining a reſignation to ſuffer for the ſins of mankind, he exerted not that power, but permitted them to go on in their malicious deſigns, and pronounce him to be worthy of death, even him who was perfect in goodneſs; thus <hi>in his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his judgment was taken away,</hi> and he, like ſome vile criminal, <hi>led as a lamb to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Under theſe heavy tryals (though poor unſtable Pilate was convinced of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, yet) the people generally looked upon him as a deceiver, a blaſphemer, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching puniſhment as a juſt judgment
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011948_0009_0F87887F18C54730"/>
upon him, <hi>They eſteemed him ſmitten of God and afflicted.</hi> So great had been the ſurprize of his diſciples, at his being taken by armed men, that they <hi>forſook him and fled;</hi> thus they hid their faces from him, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and by their conduct it appeared as though <hi>they eſteemed him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT contrary to that opinion, of his being ſmitten of God and afflicted, it was for our ſakes that <hi>he was put to grief; he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our tranſgreſſions; he was bruiſed for our iniquities;</hi> and under the weight of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting the deepeſt compaſſion for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his miſery, laboured as their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and in the deeps of affliction, with an unconquerable patience, cried out, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW this mind being in us, which was in Chriſt Jeſus, it removes from our hearts the deſire of ſuperiority, worldly honour or greatneſs; a deep attention is felt to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine counſellor, and an ardent engagement to promote, as far as we may be enabled, the happineſs of mankind univerſally; this ſtate, where every motion from a ſelfiſh ſpirit yieldeth to pure love, I may, with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the father of mercies acknowledge, is often opened before me as a pearl to dig after; attended with a living concern, that amongſt the many nations and families on the earth, thoſe who believe in the Meſſiah, that <hi>he was manifeſted to deſtroy the works of

the Devil, and</hi> thus to <hi>take away the ſins of the world,</hi> may experience the will of our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, <hi>may be done on earth as it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Strong are the deſires I often feel, that this holy profeſſion may remain unpolluted, and the believers in Chriſt may ſo abide in the pure inward feeling of his ſpirit, that the wiſdom from above may ſhine forth in their living, as a light by which others may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally helped on their way, in the true harmonious walking.</p>

               <p>WHERE the treaſures of pure love are opened, and we obediently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him who is the light of life, the mind becomes chaſte; and a care is felt, that the unction from the holy one may be our leader in every undertaking.</p>
               <p>IN being crucified to the world, broken off from that friendſhip which is enmity with God, and dead to the cuſtoms and faſhions which have not their foundation in the truth; the way is prepared to lowlineſs in outward living, and to a diſentangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from thoſe ſnares which attends the

love of money; and where the faithful friends of Chriſt are ſo ſituated that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize appears to be their duty, they feel a reſtraint from proceeding farther than he owns their proceeding; being convinced that <hi>we are not our own but are bought with a price, that none of us may live to ourſelves, but to him who died for us.</hi> 2 Corin. v. 15. Thus they are taught, not only to keep to a moderate advance and uprightneſs in their dealings; but to conſider the tendency of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; to do nothing which they know would operate againſt the cauſe of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal righteouſneſs; and to keep continually in view the ſpreading of the peaceable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt amongſt mankind.</p>
               <p>THE prophet Iſaiah ſpake of the gathered church, in the ſimilitude of a city, where many being employed were all preſerved in purity; <hi>They ſhall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord, and thou ſhalt be called ſought out, a city not forſaken.</hi> lxiii. 10. And the apoſtle after mentioning the myſtery of Chriſt's ſufferings exhorts, <hi>Be ye holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 15. There is a converſation neceſſary in trade; and there is a converſation ſo foreign from the nature of Chriſt's kingdom, that it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the ſimilitude of one man puſhing another with a warlike weapon, <hi>There is that ſpeaketh like the piercings of a ſword.</hi> Prov. xii, 18. Now in all our concerns it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011948_0011_0F878881AF4F2138"/>
that the leading of the ſpirit of Chriſt be humbly waited for and faithfully follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the only means of being preſerved chaſte as an holy people, who <hi>in all things are circumſpect.</hi> Exod. xxiii. 13, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we do may carry the appearance of approbation of the works of wickedneſs, make the unrighteous more at eaſe in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, or occaſion the injuries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the oppreſſed to be more lightly looked over.</p>
               <p>WHERE morality is kept to, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the inhabitants of a country, there is a certain reproach attends thoſe individuals amongſt them, who manifeſtly deviate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. Thus, if a perſon of good report, is charged with ſtealing goods out of an open ſhop in the day time, and on a public tryal found guilty, and the law in that caſe put in execution, he therein ſuſtains a loſs of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but if he be convicted a ſecond and third time of the like offence, his good name would ceaſe amongſt ſuch who knew theſe things. If his neighbour, reputed an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, being charged with buying goods of this thief, at a time when the purchaſer knew they were ſtolen, and on a publick tryal is found guilty, this purchaſer would meet with diſeſteem, but if he perſiſted in buying ſtolen goods, knowing them to be ſuch, and was publickly convicted thereof a ſecond and third time, he would no longer
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011948_0011_0F878881AF4F2138"/>
be conſidered as an honeſt man by them who knew theſe things; nor would it appear of good report to be found in his company buying his traffick, till ſome evident tokens of ſincere repentance appeared in him. But where iniquity is committed openly, and the authors of it are not brought to juſtice, nor put to ſhame, their hands grow ſtrong. Thus the general corruption of the Jews ſhortly before their ſtate was broke up by the Chaldeans, is deſcribed by their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in impiety; for as their leaders were connected together in wickedneſs, they ſtrengthened one another, and grew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, <hi>Were they aſhamed when they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted abominations? nay, they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh.</hi> Jer. vi. 15, on which account the Lord thus expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with them, <hi>What hath my beloved to do in my houſe, ſeeing ſhe hath wrought lewdneſs with many, and the holy fleſh is paſſed from thee, when thou doeſt evil, then thou rejoiceſt.</hi> Jer. xi. 15.</p>
               <p>NOW the faithful friends of Chriſt, who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly breathe that his kingdom may come on earth as it is in heaven, he teacheth them to be quick of underſtanding in his fear, and to be very attentive to the means he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point for promoting pure righteouſneſs in the earth; and as ſhame is due to thoſe whoſe works manifeſtly operate againſt the gracious deſign of his ſufferings for us, a care lives on
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011948_0012_0F8788821144E218"/>
their minds that no wrong cuſtoms however ſupported may byaſs their judgments, but that they may humbly abide under the croſs and be preſerved in a conduct which may not contribute to ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked in their wickedneſs, or to remove ſhame from thoſe to whom it is juſtly due. The coming of that day is precious in which we experience the truth of this expreſſion. <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi> Jer. xiii. 6, and feel him to be <hi>made unto us wiſdom and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE example of a righteous man is often looked at with attention. Where righteous men join in buſineſs their company gives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to others; and as one grain of incenſe deliberately offered to the prince of this world, renders an offering to God in that ſtate unacceptable; and from thoſe eſteemed leaders of the people may be injurious to the weak; it requires deep humility of heart, to follow him faithfully, who alone gives ſound wiſdom and the ſpirit of true diſcerning; and O how neceſſary it is, to conſider the weight of a holy profeſſion!</p>
               <p>THE conduct of ſome formerly, gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of complaint againſt them, <hi>Thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed thy ſanctuaries by the multitude of thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, by the iniquity of thy traffick.</hi> Ezek. xxviii. 18, and in ſeveral places it is charged againſt Iſrael that they had polluted the holy name.</p>
               <p>THE prophet Iſaiah repreſents inward ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011948_0012_0F8788821144E218"/>
in the ſimilitude of being purged from that which is fuel for fire; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſcribes the outward fruits, brought forth by thoſe who dwell in this inward holineſs <hi>they walk righteouſly, and ſpeak uprightly.</hi> By <hi>walking</hi> he repreſents the journey through life, as a righteous journey; and <hi>by ſpeaking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,</hi> ſeems to point at that which Moſes appears to have had in view, when he thus expreſs'd himſelf, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to do evil, nor ſpeak in a caſe to decline after many to wreſt judgment.</hi> Exod. xxiii. 2.</p>
               <p>HE goes on to ſhew their firmneſs in equity; repreſenting them as perſons ſuperior to all the arts of getting money, which have not righteouſneſs for their foundation; <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the gain of oppreſſions:</hi> and further ſhews how careful they are that no proſpects of gain may induce them to become partial in judgment reſpecting an injury; <hi>They ſhake their hands from holding bribes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, where any intereſt is ſo connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſhedding blood, that the cry of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood goes alſo with it; he points out their care to keep innocent blood from crying againſt them, in the ſimilitude of a man ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his ears to prevent a ſound from entering his head, <hi>They ſtop their ears from hearing blood;</hi> and where they know that wickedneſs is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he points out with care, that they do not by an unguarded friendſhip with the authors of it, appear like unconcerned look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011948_0013_0F87888310985E08"/>
on, but as people ſo deeply affected with ſorrow, that they cannot endure to ſtand by and behold it; this he repreſents in the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a man <hi>ſhutting his eyes from ſeeing evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHO amongſt us ſhall dwell with devouring fire? Who amongſt us ſhall dwell with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnings? He that walketh righteouſly and ſpeaketh uprightly. He that deſpiſeth the gain of oppreſſions, that ſhaketh his hands from hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bribes, that ſtoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and ſhutteth his eyes from ſeeing evil.</hi> Iſa. 33.15.</p>
               <p>HE proceeds in the ſpirit of prophecy to ſhew how the faithful being ſupported under temptations, would be preſerved from that defilement that there is in the love of money; that as they who in a reverent waiting on God, feel their ſtrength renewed, are ſaid to <hi>mount upward;</hi> ſo here their preſervation from the ſnare of unrighteous gain, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the likeneſs of a man, borne up above all crafty, artful means of getting the advantage of another, <hi>They ſhall dwell on high;</hi> and points out the ſtability and firmneſs of their condition, <hi>His place of defence ſhall be the munition of rocks;</hi> and that under all the outward appearances of loſs, in denying himſelf of gainful profits for righteouſneſs ſake, yet through the care of him who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for the ſparrows, he ſhould have a ſupply anſwerable to his infinite wiſdom, <hi>Bread ſhall
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011948_0013_0F87888310985E08"/>
be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure.</hi> And as our Saviour mentions the ſight of God to be attainable by <hi>the pure in heart,</hi> ſo here the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet pointed out, how in true ſanctification the underſtanding is opened, to behold the peaceable harmonious nature of his kingdom <hi>thine eyes ſhall ſee the king in his beauty:</hi> and that looking beyond all the afflictions which attend the righteous, to <hi>a habitation eternal in the heavens,</hi> they with an eye divinely open <hi>ſhall behold the land that is very far off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall dwell on high, his place of defence ſhall be the munitions of rocks, bread ſhall be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure. Thine eyes ſhall ſee the king in his beauty; they ſhall behold the land that is very far off.</hi> Iſa. xxxiii. 16.</p>
               <p>I OFTEN remember, and to me the ſubject is awful, that the great Judge of all the earth doeth that which is right, and that he <hi>before whom the nations are as the drop of a bucket</hi> is <hi>no reſpecter of perſons.</hi> Happy for them, who like the inſpired prophet, <hi>in the way of his judgments wait for him.</hi> Iſaiah xxvi. 8.</p>
               <p>WHEN we feel him to ſit as a refiner with fire, and know a reſignedneſs wrought in us, to that which he appoints for us, his bleſſing in a very low eſtate, is found to be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than much outward treaſure in thoſe ways of life where the leadings of his ſpirit are not followed.</p>
               <p>THE prophet in a ſight of a divine work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many people, declared in the name of the Lord, <hi>I will gather all nations and tongues,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011948_0014_0F878883905BF918"/>
and they ſhall come and ſee my glory.</hi> Iſaiah lxvi. 18. And again, <hi>from the riſing of the ſun to the going down of the ſame, my name ſhall be great amongſt the gentiles, and in every place incenſe ſhall be offered to my name, and a pure of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</hi> Malachi i. 11.</p>
               <p>BEHOLD here how the prophets had an inward ſenſe of the ſpreading of the kingdom of Chriſt; and how he was ſpoken of as one who ſhould <hi>take the heathen for his inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion.</hi> Pſal. ii. 8.

               <p>WHEN we meditate on this divine work, as a work of ages; a work that the prophets felt long before Chriſt appeared viſibly on earth, and remember the bitter agonies he endured when he <hi>poured out his ſoul unto death,</hi> that the heathen nations, as well as others, might come to the knowledge of the truth and be ſaved.</p>
               <p>When we contemplate on this marvellous work, as that which <hi>the Angels deſire to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> i. Pet. i. 12. And behold people amongſt whom this light hath eminently broken forth, and who have received many favours from the bountiful hand of our heavenly Father; not only indifferent with reſpect to publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glad tidings amongſt the Gentiles, as yet ſitting in darkneſs and entangled with

many ſuperſtitions; but aſpiring after wealth and worldly honours, take hold of means to obtain their ends, tending to ſtir up wrath and indignation, and to beget an abhorrence in them to the name of chriſtianity. When theſe things are weightily attended to, how mournful is the ſubject?</p>
               <p>IT is worthy of remembrance, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in different ages, deeply baptiſed into the nature of that work for which Chriſt ſuffered, have joyfully offered up their liberty and lives for the promoting of it in the earth.</p>
               <p>POLICARP, who was reputed a diſciple of St. John, having attained to great age, was at length ſentenced to die for his religion, and being brought to the fire, prayed nearly as follows, "Thou God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom I have received the knowledge of thee! O God of the angels and powers and of every living creature, and of all ſorts of juſt men which live in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. I thank thee! that thou haſt graciouſly vouchſafed this day and this hour to allot me a portion among the number of martyrs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people of Chriſt, unto the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of everlaſting life; among whom I ſhall be received in thy ſight, this day, as a fruitful and acceptable ſacrifice, wherefore for all this, I praiſe thee, I bleſs thee, I glorify thee through the everlaſting high Prieſt, Jeſus Chriſt, thy well beloved

               <p>BISHOP LATIMER, when ſentence of death by fire, was pronounced againſt him, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his firmneſs in the cauſe of religion, he ſaid, "I thank God moſt heartily! that he hath prolonged my life to this end; that I may, in this caſe glorify him by this kind of death." Fox Acts and mon. 936.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DEWSBERY, who had ſuffered much for his religion, in his laſt ſickneſs, encouraging his friends to faithfulneſs, made mention, like good old Jacob, of the loving kindneſs of God to him in the courſe of his life, and that through the power of divine love, he for Chriſt's ſake had joyfully enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed priſons. See introduction to his works.</p>
               <p>I MENTION theſe, as a few examples, out of many of the powerful operation of the ſpirit of Chriſt, where people are fully devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, and of the ardent longings in their minds for the ſpreading of his kingdom amongſt mankind. Now to thoſe, in the preſent age, who truly know Chriſt, and feel the nature of his peaceable government open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their underſtandings, how loud is that call wherewith we are called to faithfulneſs; that in following this pure light of life, <hi>we as workers together with him,</hi> may labour in that great work for which he was offered as a ſacrifice on the croſs; and that his peaceable doctrines may ſhine through us in their real har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,

at a time when the name of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is become hateful to many of the heathen.</p>
               <p>WHEN Gehazi had obtained treaſures, which the prophet under divine direction had refuſed, and was returned from the buſineſs; the prophet troubled at his conduct, queried if it was a time thus to prepare for a ſpecious living.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it a time to receive money and garments, men ſervants and maid ſervants, the leproſy therefore of Naaman ſhall cleave to thee and to thy ſeed forever.</hi> ii. Kings, v. 26. And O that we may lay to heart the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſent time! and humbly follow his counſel, who alone is able to prepare the way for a true harmonious walking amongſt mankind.</p>

               <p>Theſe kind of devouring creatures appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeldom, and coming in ſuch multitudes, their generation appears different from moſt other reptiles, and by the prophet were call'd <hi>God's army ſent amongſt the people.</hi> Joel ii. 25.</p>
               <p>THERE have been tempeſts of hail, which have very much deſtroyed the grain where they extended. Through long drought in ſummer, grain in ſome places hath been leſs than half the uſual quantity <note n="*" place="bottom">When crops fail, I often feel a tender care that the caſe of poor tenants may be mercifully conſidered.</note>; and in the continuance thereof, I have beheld with attention, from week to week, how dryneſs from the top of the earth, hath extended deeper and deeper, while the corn and plants have languiſhed; and with reverence my mind hath been turned toward HIM, who being perfect in goodneſs, in wiſdom and power, doeth all things right. And after long drought, when the ſky hath grown dark with a collection of matter, and clouds like lakes of water hung over our heads, from whence the thirſty land hath been ſoaked; I have at

               <p>WHEN I have conſidered that many of our fellow creatures ſuffer much in ſome places, for want of the neceſſaries of life, whilſt thoſe who rule over them are too much given to luxury, and divers vanities; and behold the apparent deviation from pure wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom amongſt us, in the uſe of the outward gifts of God; thoſe marks of famine have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared like humbling admonitions from him, that we might be inſtructed by gentle chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, and might ſeriouſly conſider our ways; remembring that the outward ſupply of life is a gift from our heavenly Father, and no more venture to uſe, or apply his gifts, in a way contrary to pure wiſdom.</p>
               <p>SHOULD we continue to reject thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful admonitions, and uſe his gifts at home, contrary to the gracious deſign of the giver, or ſend them abroad in away of trade, which the ſpirit of truth doth not lead into; and ſhould he whoſe eyes are upon all our ways, extend his chaſtiſements ſo far as to reduce us to much greater diſtreſs than hath yet

been felt by theſe provinces; with what ſorrow of heart might we meditate on that ſubject, <hi>Haſt thou not procured this unto thy ſelf, in that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way? Thine own wickedneſs ſhall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thee, and thy backſlidings ſhall reprove thee, know therefore, and ſee that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Jerem. ii. 17, 19.</p>
               <p>MY mind hath often been affected with ſorrow, in beholding a wrong application of the gifts of our heavenly Father; and thoſe expreſſions concerning the defilement of the earth have been opened to my underſtanding, <hi>The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</hi> Gen. vi. 11.

               <p>THE earth being the work of a divine power, may not as ſuch be accounted unclean; but when violence is committed thereon, and the channel of righteouſneſs ſo obſtructed, that <hi>in our ſkirts are found the blood of the ſouls of poor innocents; not by a ſecret ſearch, but upon all theſe</hi>
