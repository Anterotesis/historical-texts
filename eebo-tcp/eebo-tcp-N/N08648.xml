            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>FOR Mordecai the Jew, was next unto King Ahaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, ſeeking the wealth of his people, and ſpeaking peace to all his ſeed.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words now read, preſent to our view, true patriotiſm, and public happineſs in the cloſeſt connection therewith; not in theory, but really exiſtent, in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and adminiſtration of Mordecai the Jew, under the king Ahaſuerus.</p>
            <p>LONG had the jews enjoyed peace and quiet, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſucceſſive reigns of ſeveral Perſian princes, who
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011062_0005_0F854BE8228F0008"/>
were as famous for their moderation, as for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of their arms, the extent of their empire, or the grandeur of their courts: when Haman, a deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of Agag, a former devoted king of the curs'd Amalekites, by the united influence, of his riches, and his craft, became the favourite of the king A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuerus, and was promoted to be prime miniſter of ſtate.</p>
            <p>AMIDST all his glory, he had the mortification, to be treated with a conſcientious neglect, and ſcorn, by Mordecai a Jew; whoſe higheſt employment, was that of a porter to the king's palace. This fill'd the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty breaſt of Haman with the utmoſt indignation, and rais'd the old national enmity, of the Amalekite, againſt the Jew to its higheſt pitch.</p>
            <p>NOT contented therefore, with the deſtruction of Mordecai, and ſcorning to reak his revenge on a ſingle object, and of ſo low a character; he plots the utter extirpation of the Jews from the empire, to gratify his proud and malicious reſentments: and abuſing the confidence of his maſter, he obtain'd a decree for that purpoſe; which according to the laws of the empire, was irreverſible.</p>
            <p>SECURE of carrying his point, he pleaſed himſelf with the proſpect of the cruel maſſacre deſigned. But it was not long before his curſed plot was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by the prudence and application of Mordecai, and his zeal for the ſafety and happineſs of his people; together with the addreſs and influence of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011062_0006_0F854BE8E2846530"/>
Eſther his kinſwoman, whom he had educated as his child and whoſe tender mind he had formed, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of pure religion, and ſincere benevolence to public uſefulneſs; and who by her graceful and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous conduct, as well as ſingular beauty, had gained the favor of her prince, and was become his queen.</p>
            <p>THE vertue of Mordecai had ſhone with an agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able luſtre in private life, and in the lower offices of ſervice to his maſter; who had received a ſpecial proof of his loyalty and fidelity, in the diſcovery of a treaſonable deſign againſt his life. But now Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was pleaſed on occaſion of Haman's villany, to call him forth to more public and extenſive uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and give him an opportunity to diſplay his capacity and his vertue in an exalted ſtation.</p>
            <p>IN Haman we ſee the tyrant in real life; no ſooner raiſed to power, than his ſelfiſhneſs and ambition, cruelty and revenge burſt forth, in ſpite of reaſon, honor and conſcience, and in defiance of the moſt venerable rights, and the claims of equity and mercy; and he diſpoſes of the liberty, property and lives of thouſands, at pleaſure, and in a wantonneſs of rage beyond deſcription. But the vengeance of heaven ſoon awoke to vindicate his people's wrongs; and he fell a victim thereto, and to the juſt reſentments of his abuſed prince; before whom his villany was expoſed, by the prudence of the queen, under the direction of Mordecai. Thus he dropped into oblivion, like other tyrants, unregretted and his memory rots.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011062_0007_0F854BE9A30A0050"/>
How ſtrong, and beautiful is the contraſt; when on the other hand we view the character of Mordecai! his capacity, wiſdom, and vertue appear amiable in private, but much more in public life: in his moſt elevated ſtation he is far from being elated in his mind above it; and notwithſtanding all the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to avarice and ambition, cruelty and revenge, attending ſo great a tranſition and change, in his outward circumſtances, the true patriot ſhines with diſtinguiſhing luſtre, and diſcovers a greatneſs of ſoul, riſing ſuperior to all the influence of private and ſelfiſh paſſions. And the form of government, among the Perſians, being monarchial, and become quite deſpotic, rendered the prudence, moderation and vertue of Mordecai the more conſpicuous, and the more worthy of imitation.</p>
            <p>BUT whatever forms of government different nations have been led into, from their differing genius and circumſtances, by which they have conſented to give up their natural rights, into the hands of one or more, it has been done in truſt only: the ſole original end and deſign of which, is therefore the public happineſs. And perhaps each form is equally agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the will of God, and capable of ſecuring this great deſign, provided it falls into the hands of a wiſe and vertuous adminiſtration; whereof methinks the inſtance of Mordecai is no ſmall proof. Yet that form of government, in which the liberty, property and life of the ſubject, hath the ſtrongeſt ſecurity, muſt be the moſt eligible, as it is the moſt perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011062_0008_0F854BEC293BB5B8"/>
SUCH is the happy conſtitution of Britain and her Colonies, which God long preſerve, againſt the ſecret machinations and open attempts of its enemies, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic and foreign, who envy <hi>her,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>their</hi> encreaſing greatneſs, proſperity, and felicity.</p>
            <p>THE character of a good ruler is to be drawn; and the qualifications for this office and truſt, are to be determined, by the great end of government, the public good: and this is the ſtandard, according to which, rulers are to form themſelves to uſefulneſs, in their advanced ſtations. And the influence of ſuch a character and conduct, will be great, to ſecure the affection and loyalty of the ſubject; and to promote the felicity of the whole. My text very naturally leads us into, and confirms us in this thought.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the character of Mordecai; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the exerciſe of his high authority, not only rendered himſelf grateful to his prince; but perfectly ingratiated himſelf with his people; while he ſteadily purſued, this great end of government, the public weal. A character, and conduct like his, can hardly fail of commanding all that reſpect and obedience, which is a ruler's due.</p>
            <p>MORDECAI was great with the king, being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the higheſt poſt of government under him; and one he delighted to honour. He was equally great with the people; and by gaining their affections, he ſecured their allegiance to their prince, and their obedience to his own adminiſtration. The reaſon of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011062_0009_0F854BECA0882BB8"/>
all this greatneſs of Mordecai, was the greatneſs of his own mind, and the excellency of his government; the whole whereof, was directed to the common good, and under which, the people felt themſelves eaſy, ſafe, and happy. <hi>For Mordecai the Jew, was next unto king Ahaſuerus, and great among the Jews, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the multitude of his brethren, ſeeking the wealth of his people, and ſpeaking peace to all his ſeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To decypher the character of a good ruler, from this example; and to ſhew its force, and influence to ſecure the confidence, reſpect and obedience of the ſubject, ſhall be my preſent buſineſs.</p>
            <p>FIRST then,</p>
            <p>I SHALL take ſome account of the character of a good ruler, as drawn in the text.</p>
            <p>As the great end of civil government is the public good, capacity, and genius, wiſdom, and prudence, courage and reſolution, religion, and vertue, and public ſpirit, are the moſt obvious qualifications of a good ruler, and the moſt ſtriking parts of his character, and all together form the true patriot. Such a one was Mordecai; and ſuch civil rulers ought ever to be, in whoſe hands the whole, or the principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of government are betruſted.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place, Capacity and genius is neceſſary to the character of a good ruler.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT this, Mordecai could never have roſe to that eminency of ſtation, he was honoured with;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011062_0010_0F854BEEEF32DAF0"/>
nor in any meaſure, have ſupported the dignity of it; nor anſwered the deſigns of his elevation. And how can the ends of government be attained, without a genius, and capacity ſuited thereto? when the loweſt office in life can never be well diſcharged, without talents anſwerable to its nature, and deſign. Men's abilities, muſt be as extenſive as their authority, to preſerve the dignity, and ſecure the advantages of government. Jethro, Moſes's father-in-law, a man verſed in politics, gives Moſes that advice, in the choice of magiſtrates, to which heaven fixed its appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, (viz.) that they be able men, (i. e.) men of ſtrength of genius, and that underſtand public bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; as Moſes afterwards, explains it; when he directs the people, to take wiſe men, and men of underſtanding, known among their tribes, to be rulers over them. And it was the commendation, of the heads of Iſſachar, that they were, men that had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the times, to know what Iſrael ought to do.</p>
            <p>A NATURAL clearneſs, and coolneſs of thought, with a turn of mind towards government, improved by the ſtudy of men and books, and judicious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, will render a man capable of buſineſs, in a good degree: And ſo eſſential is ſuch a capacity and genius, that nothing can ſupply the defect thereof.</p>
            <p>WHAT, but a perpetual ſeries of blunders, and the moſt diſmal confuſion, as the conſequence thereof, can be expected, from the adminiſtration of weak headed, ſhort ſighted, muddy brained men? who, ſo
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011062_0011_0F854BEFBAF9A030"/>
far from meriting the character of good rulers, are, for the moſt part, the plagues of ſociety, and the bane of public felicity; while their weak minds, and not leſs vain, commonly grow giddy with their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement; and make them unwilling to be checked, or to take the advice of wiſer men than themſelves. And, be it, that the heart of a ruler deſtitute of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, is honeſt; yet he knows not where the true intereſt of the community lies, nor by what meaſures to purſue, and promote it: his benevolent deſigns therefore, prove abortive, for want of capacity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute them to advantage. Beſides, from a defect of underſtanding, equal to his truſt, he is expoſed to the intrigues of deſigning men, and to be made the tool of a party, or of ſome fawning paraſite, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt miniſter of ſtate, whoſe intereſted views, and luſt of power, can be gratified with nothing leſs, than the ruin of thouſands. How juſt, then is that exclamation of Solomon? Wo unto thee, oh land, when thy king is a child!</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, a ſtate reduced to the brink of ruin, by prodigality and diſſipation, or by ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ambition, with its conſtant attendants, fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and party ſpirit; has been often ſaved, by a ſingle man, in public place; and reſcued from the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that viſibly impended over it. This, Solomon long ſince obſerved; and therefore ſays, for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a land, many are the princes thereof; but by a man of underſtanding and knowledge, the ſtate ſhall be prolonged.</p>
            <p>

THE objects that are to employ the thoughts and ſtudy of magiſtrates, require a more than common extent of capacity, and ſtrength of genius: ſuch are the natural and ſocial rights of mankind; the hiſtory and laws of nature and nations; the hiſtory and municipal conſtitutions of their own country; the genius and intereſts thereof; their connections with, or dangers from their neighbours; the methods of beſt increaſing the numbers and wealth of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and the laws which will render their liberties more ſecure, and their neceſſary burthens more eaſy and equal; encourage their trade, huſbandry and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures; promote vertue and religion, and ſuppreſs vice of every kind, and in every character. What extenſive capacities? What penetration and clearneſs of thought, and ſoundneſs of judgment, are requiſite in this view, to render a magiſtrate uſeful, and aſtate happy?</p>
            <p>NOR is it every man of underſtanding, that is fit for a ſtateſman. A man may have a noble genius for, and make vaſt improvements in various branches of ſcience, or mechanic knowledge, and be thoroughly acquainted with the <hi>belles lettres,</hi> who has no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of government and politics, nor any genius for the law, or ſufficient acquaintance with humane nature in general, or the particular conſtitution, and circumſtances of the people he is to govern: and it is impoſſible, ſuch a man ſhould be a good ruler; however he may be a man of wit or learning, and an honeſt chriſtian.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, in this frail and paſſing ſtate, in which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011062_0013_0F854BF137ED69D0"/>
we have but little opportunity, for our own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſerve us; there is need of the experience of paſt ages; and of a juſt diſcerning, to notice and correct former miſtakes and errors; and to improve advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges obtained, and happy precedents, to promote not only the preſent, but the future felicity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; which a good ruler will ever keep in view.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Wiſdom and prudence is not leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to form the character of a good ruler, than capacity and genius. Solomon, deeply ſenſible of the importance of ſuch a qualification, made the acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, the great object of his attention; and the principal matter of his prayer to heaven, when he firſt entered on his government. Heaven heard, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with a rich ſupply of this, and every other needful gift and bleſſing. How conſpicuous, was the wiſdom of Mordecai, in the meaſures he took to defeat the cruel and bloody deſigns of Haman upon the Jews! By which he turned the miſchief on the heads of their enemies, and procured ſafety for them, to his everlaſting honour.</p>
            <p>THERE are a variety of circumſtances, that may attend a community; which expoſe it to the moſt imminent hazards, beſides the conſtant and ordinary buſineſs of government, and occaſions of the ſtate; which call for ſingular meaſures of wiſdom and prudence, to find out expedients, and fix upon the beſt means, for its relief: and if in ſuch an important criſis, rulers are deſtitute of wiſdom, adequate to the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011062_0014_0F854BF1F1548270"/>
demands and expectations of the ſtate; its ruin is like to enſue, and will lie under their hands. And where parties and factions prevail, either through ignorance, or deſign, as too often happens; it will require the moſt prudent conduct, to ſilence murmurs, ſtop the mouth of faction, and reſtore peace and tranquility. Nor will a leſs degree of prudence ſerve to remove the miſtakes, or prejudices, and obviate the deſigns of thoſe who have it in their power to oppreſs and injure the community.</p>
            <p>SOME men have a peculiar talent this way; and to find out the moſt happy expedients, in every caſe of public danger, and to purſue them with the greateſt advantage, which muſt be a diſtinguiſhing ornament in their character as rulers. Whereas others, whoſe prudence may be ſufficient to conduct the concerns of the public in a calm, are wholly nonpluſh'd in every ſpecial emergency and difficulty, and appear quite unequal to the trials they are called to encounter: they yield to them, ſink under them, and leave all things to their own courſe; which neceſſarily involves the ſtate in the utmoſt diſorder and confuſion, and endangers the total ſubverſion of government. Sound wiſdom in a ruler is the medium between tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing caution, and raſh precipitancy; each alike dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and often fatal. And that ruler only, comes up to the character in the text, who hath ſuch a greatneſs of mind, as to riſe above every difficulty and danger, in the moſt tempeſtuous ſeaſon and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011062_0015_0F854BF2ABC2ED38"/>
threatning criſis: and while he keeps the full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of himſelf, calmly conſults and ſteadily purſues thoſe meaſures which have the moſt direct tendency to prevent the impending ruin; or at leaſt to leſſen and mitigate the evils dreaded, and render them leſs pernicious.</p>
            <p>I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Courage and reſolution are very eſſential to the character of a good ruler.</p>
            <p>How firm and ſteady was Mordecai, under the moſt threatning aſpects, and when nothing leſs than the total extirpation, and ruin of his people was plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and decreed! Inſtead of ſinking under the proſpects of this dreadful fate; he riſes, not to meet it undaunted, which is often but the falſe image of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and properly ſtiled fool-hardineſs, and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but to obviate, and ward it off, and happily ſucceeds. Similar dangers call for ſimilar prudence, application and reſolution.</p>
            <p>EVERY community lies expoſed in ſome degree to foreign enemies and inteſtine feuds; and if in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, dependant, to oppreſſion from thoſe, on whom they are ſo, thro' miſtaken policy, or the influence of ſuch, as have a luſt for arbitrary power. Nor is any ſtate ſo wholly free from crafty deſigning men, enemies of order and government, or of the liberties of their country; as not in certain circumſtances to endanger, at leaſt its peace, if not its entire ſubverſion, and ruin. And the follies of ſome, and vices of others, not ſeldom, reduce it to the brink of deſtruction. In theſe, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011062_0016_0F854BF3751176E8"/>
the like dangers, as well as when rulers are vilified, and reproached for their zeal and fidelity in their office; courage and ſteadineſs is of abſolute neceſſity. And a man that dare not confront, domeſtic or foreign enemies; aſſert the dignity of his ſtation, and the conſtitutional rights belonging to it, againſt factious demagogues; or the juſt, reaſonable, and conſtitutional liberties of the people, againſt the encroachments of arbitrary power; that meanly flys his poſt, or betrays his truſt, on threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning appearances; that ſneaks before the tow'ring menaces of vice, or that ſinks under the reproaches caſt upon him for his fidelity:—The man, in ſhort, that dares not do his duty in the face of danger, is ſurely not fit to be a ruler, nor can poſſibly be a good one.</p>
            <p>THE fear of man, brings a ſnare, to a timerous mind; and every little danger, is aggravated, and enhanced, by a frightful fancy, and imagination: which byaſſes the judgment, and too often bribes the conſcience. And who doth not ſee this to be ſufficient to diſqualify a man for being a ruler?</p>
            <p>WHEN a ſtate is ſunk never ſo low, to deſpair of its emerging, and flouriſhing again, prevents, or ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates all endeavours for its relief; and tends to haſten and compleat its deſtruction. And to be irreſolute, is almoſt as fatal, as to deſpair. A ruler of ſuch a tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous make, muſt needs be hurried by thoſe paſſions, which commonly precipitate the ruin he fears, and which he might with reſolution have prevented. Calm conſideration is interrupted, tho' abſolutely neceſſary,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011062_0017_0F854BF421B32AB0"/>
to guide the judgment, and fix the mind, in the choice, and purſuit, of the beſt, or only means of ſafety and deliverance.</p>
            <p>IN every dangerous criſis of the ſtate then, happy is the people that have rulers of capacity and wiſdom, to diſcern, and of courage and firmneſs, to purſue thoſe meaſures, from which, under God, they may hope for a redreſs of grievances, and a removal of thoſe evils, that threaten their ruin.</p>
            <p>I go on to ſay,</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, Religion and vertue are eſſential to the character of a good ruler.</p>
            <p>THERE is not a ſingle character of a good ruler, in the bible, in which religion and vertue is not a principal part of it. This was a ſtriking part of Mordecai's character, in private life: and when he left his private ſtation, for the higheſt poſt in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, next the king, he left not his religion behind him. And it is to be preſumed, that when a man has acquired a religious character, in private, he will ſupport the ſame in public life. Yet it ſometimes falls out otherwiſe, through the frailty of human nature, and the force of thoſe temptations, that attend a public ſtation.</p>
            <p>WHERE men have no ſettled principle of vertuous conduct, we may reaſonably expect it will always be thus. And a man deſtitute of integrity and principle, will be regardleſs of the great ends of government, and make it his buſineſs, rather to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011062_0018_0F854BF4F7679BE8"/>
indulge his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe and pleaſures, his avarice or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; than to diſcharge the duties of his poſt. In this caſe, men's capacity and genius, their wiſdom and courage, will be proſtituted to their ſelfiſh and ſiniſter deſigns; or to the humours and luſts of others, on whom they are dependant. They often become venal, and by their examples teach others to be ſo: and ſacrifice the intereſts and liberties of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, to gratify their private paſſions, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their perſonal advantage: and uſe all their policy and influence, to make thoſe they moſt abuſe, inſenſible of the wrongs done them, or to compel them to bear them; and to make others the tools of their avarice and ambition, and the inſtruments of their oppreſſion and villainy. An inward principle of religion is therefore highly neceſſary in a ruler: for he that ruleth over men, muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God. And to fear God, and hate covetouſneſs, are principal qualifications of the good ruler. Such a principle will be of uſe, to influence all the public meaſures; and to ſecure thoſe divine aids and ſmiles, without which the arduous and important truſt, aſſigned to rulers, can never be duly, or ſucceſsfully diſcharged.</p>
            <p>THIS principle is of a divine nature and original; and a man informed and actuated thereby, will have a moſt ſacred veneration for the Deity, will place his confidence in him, will labour to be conformed to him in a godlike temper and diſpoſition; and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011062_0019_0F854BF5AC67C858"/>
have an inviolable regard to his glory and intereſt, his will and law. This principle will in a very ſpecial manner, lead a ruler into a dependance on, and conformity to a glorious Chriſt; and to exhibit that righteouſneſs and mercy, that truth, meekneſs, and gentleneſs, which are ſo conſpicuous in the adminiſtration of his kingdom. It will alſo give force and energy to all the motives the goſpel ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, to a faithful diſcharge of the duties of his ſtation; and bear them in on his mind in their full weight and importance. It will ſubdue his ſelfiſh paſſions, ſubordinate his private, to the public intereſts: and while it enlarges the mind, and enobles the ſpirit, will divert him from every low, mean, and criminal view and purſuit; and engage him to devote his time and talents, with ſteady zeal, application, and fidelity to the public good, and to deny himſelf in every reſpect to promote it.</p>
            <p>THERE are indeed, no principles, but thoſe of chriſtianity, that are ſufficient to make a man truly great; how much ſoever ſome of the heathen have been admired for their ſeeming greatneſs, and how much ſoever they have been propoſed to imitation. Nor do I conceive a man truly great, who, out of vain glory, and worldly views, is lead to do ſome great things: nay, that Roman ſpirit, ſo often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and extolled, which appears to be influenced only by the proſpect of fame, riches, honours, and authority; which not only ceaſed to exert itſelf for
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011062_0020_0F854BF662ADE248"/>
the public good, when it met with ingratitude and injuſtice, neglect and contempt, ſuffering and reproach; but ſhrank, and ſhrivel'd up into a mean, daſtardly fear, or ſelf-love, that made them run upon the ſword, as their only refuge and relief; is ſo far from deſerving the encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums given it, that chriſtians ſhould be rather cautioned againſt it, and taught to treat it with the contempt and abhorrence it deſerves. 'Tis the chriſtian religion only, that inſpires the mind with fortitude and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, to ſuffer in a noble cauſe, and not ingloriouſly deſert it; nay, voluntarily to tender its ſervices, when the ſtate needs them, or is in danger. The poſt of honour, is not therefore, always, a private ſtation, tho' ſometimes, it may ſo happen.</p>
            <p>I AM ſenſible, that a natural generoſity of mind; the power of conſcience in men deſtitute of a principle of true religion; nay even ambition, and intereſted views, may be improved by heaven, to render ſome men uſeful to the public; and they may diſcharge their truſt to general ſatisfaction and applauſe. But if a ruler acting on no higher principles, may merit the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the public; how much more will ſuch deſerve it, who act on the noble and exalted principles of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity?</p>
            <p>WE have indeed but little ſecurity for the good conduct of rulers that are deſtitute of religion, or for the divine ſmiles on their adminiſtration. Whereas we have the ſtrongeſt grounds to hope for both, if they are men of ſincere vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:011062_0021_0F854BF72301BB20"/>
RELIGION is venerable, in the eſteem of all, but thoſe who have abandoned themſelves to debauchery and villainy, and whoſe conſciences are perfectly ſeared, and callous: hence ſome men, to ſerve a low, ſelfiſh, and party deſign, put on a maſk of religion, that they may be reſpectable, and the eaſier accompliſh their deſigns. But if known, they ought to be the objects of the greateſt contempt and abhorrence: nor is it unuſual, that they betray themſelves, and act out their true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in ſo open a manner, as to diſcover their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable hypocriſy. It is ever to be expected, that he that is falſe to his God, will be unfaithful to men; nor is ſuch a man, when known, to be truſted in the lower offices of life; and much leſs in the high ſtations of government. Nor can any thing be more prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and abſurd, than to commit our properties, life, and liberties, to the care of a man, that pretends to no religion, or that evidences by his converſation, that he has none: for he that has no reverence for the Deity, cannot be ſuppoſed to have any regard for moral obligations, nor to be in any degree influenced thereby; and he that will ſacrifice his own moſt valuable, yea eternal intereſts, to his vicious inclinations, will not fail to ſacrifice thoſe of the public (when they come in competition) to the ſame ruling paſſions.</p>
            <p>Once more, Fifthly,</p>
            <p>PUBLIC ſpirit is an eſſential qualification of a good ruler, and is inſeparable from his character.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:011062_0022_0F854BF7E1BA3760"/>
THE ruler's office is for the public good, and if his ſpirit correſponds not with the deſign of his office, he is far from being a benefactor or a bleſſing: nor can any ſtate flouriſh, where public ſpirit is not the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of its rulers. This is a ſpirit of true benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, is therefore founded in, or rather a branch of true religion. The love of our neighbour ſprings from the love of God, as its true original and ſource; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſeparably connected with it. This was the ſpirit of Mordecai, in whom benevolence to his brethren, was as conſpicuous and evident, as his love to God.</p>
            <p>GENEROSITY and kindneſs, condeſcenſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, were in him, the true marks of it. A man of this ſpirit, will ever feel for the public, as well as for himſelf; and the benign influences of his heart, will diffuſe themſelves, in the moſt beneficial and happy effects to thouſands. He conſiders himſelf as the father of the people, when in the moſt exalted ſtation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor diſdains to treat them as brethren. He views all his powers and betruſtments, as committed to him by the great parent of the univerſe, for the good of the whole; and he ſleeps and wakes for the common benefit. An equal and ardent love of the whole, poſſeſſes his breaſt, and excites him to thoſe meaſures, which wiſdom and vertue dictate, whereby the whole may be made eaſy, ſafe, and happy. He knows no diſtinction of rich and poor, noble or ignoble, friends or foes; ſo as to avoid any particular acts of benevolence, which may promote the welfare of each: nor will the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011062_0023_0F854BF8C80F5AC0"/>
returns, for his diſintereſted good will, cauſe him to ceaſe from the offices of kindneſs. His heart will be intent upon the public ſafety and felicity, ever his delight and joy; and to ward off dangers, and remedy evils; while he deeply regrets thoſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heal, and the miſchiefs he cannot prevent.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER is uſeful or beneficial to ſociety, will have his ſteady attention. Agriculture will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, till the wilderneſs become a fruitful field, and the deſart bloſſom as the roſe. Trade ſo nearly connected therewith, as the ſecond ſource of wealth, will be protected and cheriſhed, that his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity may derive riches and plenty from other parts of the globe, as well as their own. Liberty, next to religion, the darling of a generous mind, will be guarded with the moſt tender and watchful care. Injuſtice and immorality, diſſipation and idleneſs, that ever weaken the ſinews of the common wealth, will be frowned upon, and properly puniſhed; and the contrary vertues ſupported, and encouraged, with a view to the dignity of the ſtate, and its importance with its neighbours; one of the moſt probable means of its ſafety, and peace. Arts and ſciences, under his countenance, and favourable auſpecies, will be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and flouriſh; and yield a pleaſing proſpect, that wiſdom and knowledge will be the ſtability of future times, as well as of the preſent. And above all, religion in its truth, and native ſimplicity and freedom, will be promoted, under a benevolent adminiſtration,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011062_0024_0F854BF96EBC66B8"/>
by the beſt examples; and provided for, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch ſalutary laws, as come within the province of the magiſtrate; and this with a ſpecial view <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the divine favour and protection, without which no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity can long ſubſiſt, and much leſs flouriſh.</p>
            <p>SUCH are the exertions, and ſuch will be the effects of true public ſpirit; and with unwearied application will a ruler of this character, employ himſelf for the good of his fellow men, that are under his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. While on the contrary, avarice or ambition, indolence or moroſeneſs, mark the character of the man deſtitute hereof; and ſpeak him unfit, for any office of importance, in government.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus drawn into view, ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal parts of the character, of a good ruler, from the inſtance in the text, I ſhall proceed to conſider,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, The influence of ſuch a character, well ſupported, to ſecure the confidence, reſpect, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſubjects.</p>
            <p>AFTER all that has been ſaid in favour of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance to what is called the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right of magiſtracy in general, or of kings in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; it will remain for ever true, that the doctrines of arbitrary power, and conſequently of ſlavery, are not the maxims of prudence, reaſon, or revelation; and put into practice, tend to produce the moſt fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions in a ſtate, unleſs ignorance, effeminacy, and corruption have prevailed to enervate mens ſpirits, to debauch their reaſon, and ſink them into a ſtupid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, almoſt equal to that of the brutes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:011062_0025_0F854BFA3181F728"/>
IN this caſe, while the language of deſpotiſm, in a proud uſurper of the rights of mankind, raiſed to power by his own intrigues, or by the folly, or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of others, is to this purpoſe. <q>I am veſted with ſufficient authority, to give law, and to demand unreſerved ſubmiſſion and obedience; and have power in my hands to enforce it: he that fails therefore, may depend upon my ſevereſt reſentments; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhall be the fate of the man that dares oppoſe me.</q> The abject minds of ſubjects, loſt to all vertue and honour, may tamely yield; and they may reply, All that thou haſt ſaid, we will do, and will be obedient: Yet, what confidence have ſuch ſubjects in their magiſtrate? How can they but entertain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret jealouſies and ſuſpicions, equally deſtructive of veneration, and love, of truſt, and cordial ſubmiſſion? a ſlaviſh dread, and brutal ſubjection, or that which is forced, and inſincere, is the moſt that can be pretended to. As mutual confidence and affection, between rulers and people, cannot fail of being deſtroyed by ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary claims, ſo the people will be as pleaſed to have it in their power, to put to death even a prince, as ever they were to raiſe him to the throne: nor need we a large acquaintance with humane nature, or the hiſtory of nations, to be convinced of this: our own nation will indeed furniſh us with proof hereof, the moſt ample and ſufficient.</p>
            <p>THAT the moſt hearty confidence, reſpect and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is the magiſtrates due, perhaps, no one in the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011062_0026_0F854BFAF1DE4028"/>
ſober uſe of reaſon, will deny. But the moſt likely, and the only rational, and ſcriptural way of gaining and ſecuring it, is for the magiſtrate to exhibit the patriotic character, in its full extent; and as a father, to purſue the common good and happineſs of the ſubject. He that is thus, the miniſter of God to men, for their good, in his ruling capacity, not only fills his poſt with dignity and honour, but has all advantages on his ſide, to ſecure the confidence, reſpect and obedience of thoſe he governs. For beſides, the ſolemn repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of divine revelation, to this purpoſe, let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers; enforced by a motive, drawn from the great end of magiſtracy and government, the good of the whole; which, by the way evidently determines the extent as well as deſign of it: as alſo, by a motive, drawn from the penal conſequences, of an oppugnation of lawful authority, in this world, and the future: I ſay, beſides ſuch injunctions, which have a peculiar weight and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on a people, not ſunk in ignorance, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to debauchery: there is ſomething in this character itſelf, that peculiarly ſtrikes the mind, awes it to reverence, and engages it to love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is the image of God on a ruler, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a proportionable reſpect.</p>
            <p>RULERS are called gods, with regard to their office; and if they act in character, they become amiable and venerable, for their divine vertues; in which their is a certain engaging ſweetneſs and majeſty, not to be
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011062_0027_0F854BFBB3498440"/>
deſcribed, which immediately poſſeſſes the mind, and gains its approbation, and makes it revere and honour them, and take pleaſure in their commands, as it were by neceſſity and conſtraint. How acceptable was Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai to his brethren! and how great the influence of his truly patriotic character and conduct, to ſecure all that confidence and affection, that reverence and ſubmiſſion, which he could wiſh for! Nor is it without deſign, that the penman of his hiſtory, remarks the happy influence of his adminiſtration on the people. They felt themſelves eaſy, ſafe, and happy under his government, and were fully confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his capacity and integrity, and entirely at his devotion.</p>
            <p>BUT then, the principle of ſelf-love alone, will engage men to that obedience to good rulers, by which their own happineſs may be promoted, and ſecured. They can feel the benign influences of a wiſe, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and benevolent adminiſtration; and without the labour of reaſoning, and reflection, they generally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to be ſafe and happy, when they are ſo. When people have this ſenſe, and percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it cannot fail of producing thoſe returns of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and confidence, reſpect and obedience, which are a good magiſtrate's due: or if under ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular burthens, the wiſdom of rulers, ſees fit to lay upon them, a few, whoſe views are narrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, complain and find fault; it will rarely be found that their uneaſineſs is laſting, or grows up to any great degree of diſaffection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:011062_0028_0F854BFC8C737830"/>
THERE are indeed, in all ſocieties, ſome men, whoſe minds are ſo degenerate and baſe, as not only, not to be ſenſible of the beauty and dignity of the patriot character, in rulers: but from ambitious, and intereſted views, or an invidious and jealous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, are ever ready to find fault, and often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come turbulent and reſtleſs. Such men are conſtantly on the watch for opportunities, from the unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frailties, and miſtakes of the beſt rulers, to raiſe ſome colourable objection againſt them; and practice the meaneſt arts to prejudice others. And while they pretend a great zeal for the public, cry out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, unreaſonable burthens, prodigality, or unequal meaſures; they too often prevail to raiſe parties and factions, to the diſturbance of the ſtate. The bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all is, they, or their friends are out of place, and they have little or no proſpect, under a wiſe and vertuous adminiſtration, of ſerving their ſelfiſh deſigns. And no men more like to take exceptions againſt a good adminiſtration, than thoſe whoſe character is quite the reverſe of the true patriot.</p>
            <p>BUT however ſuch men, may practice, and proſper a while, they commonly precipitate their own ruin: or the righteous judge of all, expoſes their vile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues in open light, and they become the objects of univerſal contempt.</p>
            <p>IN general, if mankind have not a quick ſenſe of the excellency of true patriotiſm in a ruler; yet they know when they are well uſed; they have ſome ſenſe
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011062_0029_0F854BFD313EC020"/>
and value for their conſtitutional as well as natural rights, and can tell when they freely and fully enjoy them; and will not deſtroy their own ſafety and happineſs, by a contempt of, or oppugnation to that authority, which is the great means of ſecuring it.</p>
            <p>IT is certain, the wiſer and better part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, will have ſuch grateful reſentments of the fatherly tenderneſs, and watchful care and fidelity of good rulers, as to engage all their intereſt and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in ſupport of their authority; and to lighten as much as poſſible their burthens, by promoting the loyalty and affection of their fellow ſubjects. And if a civil adminiſtration, be but tolerably good, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhews, that thoſe in it, are honoured while they live, by the wiſe and vertuous; and their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is rever'd long after they are dead: how much more, will this be the caſe, where rulers anſwer the diſtinguiſhing character of Mordecai, and approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves true patriots, in the moſt extenſive view?</p>
            <p>THE doctrines of arbitrary power, are therefore as uſeleſs and inſignificant, as they are abſurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural; in as much as, rulers have it in their power to ſecure all that confidence, reſpect, and obedience, from ſubjects, that is their due, or that they can juſtly deſire, in a way more eaſy and ſafe. Let them only act up to, and ſupport their proper character as miniſters of God for good to the people; and they may be morally aſſured, of their hearts and purſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, yea, of their lives when the ſtate needs them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:011062_0030_0F854BFDEC9A4238"/>
SUCH is the influence, which the patriotic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and conduct in rulers, will have on the minds of ſubjects, to ſecure their confidence, reſpect, and obedience.</p>
            <p>IN theſe views, the wiſdom and duty of rulers, with the moſt natural and effectual motives to enforce it, are plainly pointed out. And we have all reaſon, of thankfulneſs to heaven, that our rulers are men of this character.</p>
            <p>NOR can a better acknowledgment be paid to his Honour, the Governor, with the honourable the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty-Governor, and Aſſiſtants, (whom I would addreſs on this occaſion) under whoſe wiſe, vertuous and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent adminiſtration, we have enjoyed much peace and quietneſs; than, in the name of this people, to expreſs our deſires, and hopes, that you may be ſtill continued, in your important ſtations, to exert your well known capacities, and ſpirit, in watching for the liberty, peace, and happineſs of the community. And we freely expreſs our confidence, that it will be your care to form your ſelves, under heaven's influence, to a yet nearer reſemblance of the perfect model, of true patriotiſm, in its moſt extenſive view: and thereby render your ſelves moſt uſeful, and the people moſt happy.</p>
            <p>AND as the greater part, of the former Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people, are returned to ſerve in the preſent general aſſembly; it ſpeaks their confidence, worthy Sirs, in your wiſdom, and integrity; and is a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011062_0031_0F854BFEAEBE5EA0"/>
powerful obligation on you, to make the moſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous efforts, anſwerable to the patriotic character, to ſave them from impending ruin.</p>
            <p>YOU cannot be inſenſible, honoured, and worthy ſenators, of the diſtreſſes, many are involved in, by their own diſſipation and prodigality; and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence this has had upon; and how much it has affected others, that have been more induſtrious and frugal. Nor are you ignorant of our embaraſſments, by the late parliamentary reſolutions, and regulations: nor are <hi>we</hi> wholly inſenſible of the dangers and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities we are threatned with, which can ſcarce be painted in too horrible and gloomy colours.</p>
            <p>WE were ready to bleſs ourſelves, when the ſtamp act was repealed, in the pleaſing proſpect of future tranquility and peace; and the laſting enjoyment of our diſtinguiſhing privileges. And tho' the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of parliament, at that time, reſpecting their conſtitutional power over America, gave us no ſmall concern: yet we were ready to hope, that power would never be exerted to our diſadvantage, or the prejudice of our natural and conſtitutional rights, till their regulations ſince, have convinced us of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</p>
            <p>I WOULD be far from thinking, much more from hinting, that, that auguſt aſſembly, the guardians of the conſtitution, and of the liberty and property of the ſubject, have formed a ſyſtem to enſlave the coloniſts: whatever may have been the ambitious or
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011062_0032_0F854BFFA605E6E8"/>
intereſted views of any particular favourite, miniſter, or ſtateſman, jealous of, or invidious towards our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing greatneſs, proſperity and felicity. And it may be juſtly preſumed, the people of Britain, tenacious of their liberties as they are, would not ſuffer a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, of ſo fatal a tendency to her, as well as her colonies, to be carried into execution: ſince it could be viewed in no other light, than as a prelude to their own ſlavery and ruin.</p>
            <p>IN this moſt critical and alarming ſituation, our eyes are to you, our honoured and worthy rulers, next to God, to exert yourſelves as your wiſdom ſhall judge moſt loyal, decent, and proper to obtain a redreſs of our grievances. And as, without doubt, the Britiſh parliament have been induced to make thoſe reſolves, and regulations, that we think, bear ſo hard, on our natural and conſtitutional rights, from miſinformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and abuſive repreſentations of us; it ſeems, may I be allowed to ſay it, to belong to you, to rectify their miſtakes, and vindicate us from every injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſperſion. And ſuch is our opinion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, equity, and tenderneſs of our gracious Sovereign, and of the great council of the nation; that we promiſe our ſelves, upon ſuitable petitions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of the united, and loyal colonies, by their reſpective aſſemblies, we may obtain the wiſhed for relief. We take it for granted, you will not excuſe your ſelves; tho' if any ſhould happen to be of this turn of thought, and it would not be eſteemeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011062_0033_0F854C002D39F8F0"/>
and aſſuming, I ſhould with all deference, remind them of the meſſage, of the worthy Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai, to queen Eſther, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>Then Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai commanded to anſwer Eſther, Think not with thy ſelf, that thou ſhalt eſcape, in the King's houſe, more than all the Jews. For if thou altogether holdeſt thy peace, at this time; then ſhall there, enlargement, and deliverance, ariſe to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's houſe, ſhall be deſtroyed: and who knoweth that thou art come to the kingdom, for ſuch a time as this?</hi> We perſwade ourſelves, at leaſt, that you will never be influenced, by the menaces of power, the artful inſinuations of its tools, the examples of others, or the temptations of honour, or intereſt, (under a pretence of obedience to ſuperiors) to betray the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of your country; or do any thing to fix an arbitrary adminiſtration upon us; however coloured with an appearance of law, and conſtitutional autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>I SHALL not need, to recommend to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the importance of frugality, and induſtry, among the inhabitants of this colony: nor will you fail to give all due encouragement thereto, as well as to our own manufactures. And ſuffer me to add, that the diſtreſſed ſtate we are in, on account of our ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing debts; the want of a ſufficient medium of trade; the uncommon multiplication of law-ſuits, and ſingular protraction of their iſſues, in the courts of juſtice; and the aſtoniſhing conſumption of ſpirituous liquors,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011062_0034_0F854C00F4A9A4C8"/>
are worthy of, and call for your attention. And the viſible growth and prevalence of vice, diſſipation, and debauchery, demands at this day a more vigorous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yourſelves, to ſuppreſs and diſcountenance it. Learning, we doubt not, will ever have your patronage; and we hope, the College, in particular, will not be deſtitute of all needful aſſiſtance, to attain in the moſt happy and effectual manner, the great ends of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. And above all things, that you will ſupport, and promote to the utmoſt, the religion of the goſpel, as the ſureſt means of our proſperity, ſafety and felicity.</p>
            <p>GREAT is the weight of the public truſt. While therefore you receive it with caution, and the wiſeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, as leading into ſcenes, not of eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but of burthen, and care, eſpecially in the preſent day; and enter upon it with a becoming ſobriety, and ſelf diffidence, and reſolved dependance, on him, whoſe is wiſdom and counſel, and every needful gift and bleſſing; and engage your ſelves to the greateſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and unwearied efforts, to approve your ſelves faithful in the ſervice of God, and your generation; you may hope for the divine guidance and ſmiles, in your future adminiſtrations. And in the ſteady pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the common good, in all thoſe ways, your wiſe and benevolent minds ſhall dictate; you will have the approbation of your own conſciences; will render your ſelves acceptable, to the multitude of your brethren, at leaſt, the wiſer and better part of them; and raiſe a monument to your honour, in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011062_0035_0F854C01A22BB9F8"/>
the grateful remembrance of this, and ſucceeding ages, more laſting than braſs or marble; and what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more, you will meet with the divine accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a large reward, in proportion to your fidelity, and the numberleſs important bleſſings, you will be inſtrumental of diffuſing to thouſands.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the character the gentlemen of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred order, generally ſuſtain among us, that I may with the greateſt aſſurance engage on their behalf, that they will not depart from the generous, loyal, and religious principles of the fathers of this country: but that they will ſteadily, and with equal order, exert themſelves, in their place and ſtation, to ſupport the honour and dignity of government, and to enforce the duty of the ſubject, and cultivate loyalty, peace, and good order, with a love of the Engliſh conſtitution, and the practice of every ſocial vertue. And eſpecially, that they will urge on men, the peculiar doctrines, important precepts, and engaging motives of the goſpel; with a view to promote true and vital religion, as not only the means of their private and perſonal happineſs; but as the alone ſure baſis of public vertue, and felicity.</p>
            <p>I MAY alſo fairly preſume, it will be the care of the wiſe and the vertuous, not to encreaſe the burthens of government: but on the contrary, to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unreaſonable jealouſies, murmurs, and complaints; expoſe the low arts and intrigues of deſigning men, to deſerved reproach and contempt; and prevent as much as poſſible, factions and parties: while at the ſame
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011062_0036_0F854C026337A000"/>
time, with the firmeſt union, and moſt manly and chriſtian reſolution, they aſſert and maintain their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and conſtitutional rights; and are ready to ſpend their treaſure and their blood, in the noble cauſe of civil and religious liberty.</p>
            <p>AND methinks, every one capable of the leaſt reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or proſpect, ſhould unite in the moſt vigorous endeavours, to promote peace and loyalty, vertue, oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and religion in the preſent dark and cloudy day.</p>
            <p>IT would betray a want of gratitude to heaven, on this occaſion, as well as a narrow contracted turn of thought, not to obſerve the divine patronage of right and liberty in Britain, from its moſt early times. Britain, moſt highly favoured of God, in the preſervation of her civil and religious freedom, while moſt of the neighbour nations, have been enſlaved to deſpotic power, and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſway; and the tyranny of prelates, as well as princes. Let her rejoice herein, and learn ſoberly and vertuouſly to uſe both her power, and her liberty, which will thus be, as it has been, her glory and her ſafety.</p>
            <p>'TIS worthy of remark, that not all the changes, that have paſſed over her, have ever yielded an opportunity to her enemies, to deprive her of her darling liberty: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at times it has been greatly oppreſſed, and in the utmoſt danger. The weakneſs and wickedneſs of her princes, and their counſellors, the treaſons and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her ſubjects, the invaſions of foreigners, have often reduced her to the laſt extremity. But heaven has
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011062_0037_0F854C032A40ECD0"/>
ſeaſonably interpoſed, and by ſome ſurpriſing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected turn, has made all their injurious attempts, ſubſervient to fix her liberty on a more ſolid baſis, and to guard it with ſtronger ſecurities. A plain intimation this, that God never gives men up to be ſlaves, till they looſe their national vertue, and abandon themſelves to ſlavery.</p>
            <p>THE eſtabliſhment of the ſucceſſion to the imperial crown of Great-Britain, in the illuſtrious houſe of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover has been a moſt happy and effectual means, under God, of preſerving the Britiſh rights and conſtitution: while the princes thereof have nobly maintained the dignity of their ſtation, by a ſober improvement of the prerogative, within its conſtitutional limits, and a ſteady aim to live and reign in the affections of their ſubjects. Never was religious and civil liberty more ſecure, loyalty more cordial, arts and ſciences better cultivated, trade more flouriſhing, domeſtic peace and tranquility more ſtable, or Britain more the pride of her ſons, or the envy and terror of her foes; than under their paternal and patriotic adminiſtration. Her glory has been riſing, with growing luſtre, to the moſt exalted ſummit, in the age and reign of George the third, our lawful and moſt gracious ſovereign. Heaven grant it may be perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſtill (if poſſible) increaſe: for, ſo far are we from envying her, that her grandeur and happineſs is ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> boaſt, and our connections with, and conſtitutional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on her, what we wiſh the moſt laſting perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency to. May ſhe ever flouriſh, and under her ſhadow may we be ſafe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:011062_0038_0F854C03F14B9160"/>
WHAT thanks owe we to heaven, in ſpecial, for our diſtinguiſhing privileges, civil and religious! and that when they have been ſo often threatned, deliverances have been ſeaſonably granted! auſpicious deliverances to Britain, as well as her American Colonies: alike intereſted in the important cauſe of liberty, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py events by which it has been reſcued from its dangers, and amply ſecured.</p>
            <p>NOR ſhould we forget the noble patrons of liberty, on the other ſide the atlantic; who not long ſince, ſo boldly eſpouſed, and effectually pleaded its cauſe; as to obtain a repeal of the ſtamp act: nor thoſe worthy patriots in America, who then, or more lately appeared in its defence; among whom the ingenious, generous, ſenſible, ſpirited, and loyal FARMER, deſerves our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar notice and acknowledgments. May they all ſtill continue their benevolent efforts, in the important cauſe; and may their names be handed to poſterity, with the moſt grateful ſenſe of their friendly offices; and after a long ſeries of the moſt beneficent and extenſive ſervices to their country, may they receive the rewards, that ever await ſuch diſtinguiſhed merit, and public uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>IF we call to mind the ideas we entertained, at the cloſe of the late war, or on the repeal of the ſtamp act; with what exultation and triumph were we ready to ſing, the ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped! We then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated ourſelves, and each other, on the wondrous things God had wrought for us, and in the pleaſing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of laſting tranquility and peace, and the full unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011062_0039_0F854C04A8E00CE0"/>
enjoyment of civil and religious liberty: which to ſecure, our fathers ſpent the whole labour of their lives, with an amazing treaſure, and many of them their blood. Here thought we, may we now ſit, under our own vine, and fig-tree, and reap the fruit of our own and our fathers toil and expence, ſecure from the rage of the enemy, and from the tyranny of bigotted prelates, the capricious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of arbitrary miniſters, and the power of lawleſs ſway. Here ſhall our parent ſtate, ſtill tender of our liberties as of her own, find all the returns of filial duty and affection from her true born ſons, that ſhe can deſire; and be honored, ſtrengthned and enriched, by their growing numbers, and encreaſing commerce and wealth. Here arts and ſciences, and every uſeful manufacture ſhall flouriſh, and make continual advances towards perfection. Here religion ſhall remain, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved undefiled, in the doctrines of faith, the duties of the chriſtian life, and that worſhip of God, which is moſt agreable to primitive evangelical ſimplicity: and from hence ſhall be diffuſed through unnumbered tribes of heathen, and bring them to the knowledge, profeſſion, and obedience of the truth; and the deſart ſhall bloſſom as the roſe: and God, even our own God, ſhall bleſs us, and we ſhall ſee his ſalvation.</p>
            <p>SUCH were the bright and bliſsful ſcenes that opened to our view. But oh, the mutability of human affairs! How ſoon are theſe agreable proſpects changed for thoſe which are moſt diſmal! the ſad fruit of our own folly and wickedneſs. A gloomy cloud has gathered
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011062_0040_0F854C055FEBC0C0"/>
over our heads, and intercepts every pleaſing viſion and hope, and portends the moſt inſupportable and fatal calamities. This has rouſed the attention of the moſt thoughtleſs, and filled the minds of all the friends of civil and religious liberty, with anxious ſollicitude; and engaged them to (at leaſt) a ſeeming union and vigour, in promoting induſtry, oeconomy and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, as the great means of the ſalvation of their country: which is truly praiſe-worthy. But methinks the conduct of Eſther and Mordecai, together with the Jews, under their diſtreſſes, and when the proud and revengeful Haman had obtained a decree for their total extirpation; comes moſt ſtrongly recommended, as a pattern and precedent; I do not ſay from a ſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of circumſtances, ſo much, as from the juſtice and propriety of the thing in itſelf; and from the happy ſucceſs that attended it. I mean, that of religious faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer. This, to be ſure, in the preſent alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing criſis, cannot be improper for particular perſons, families, ſocieties, or the public. And the experience we have often had of God's gracious readineſs to hear, and ſave us in our diſtreſſes; as well as the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his word; together with the aſſurance, our reaſon muſt give us, that without heaven's interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the continuance of the divine patronage of our rights and liberties, all our own efforts for relief will be vain; conſpire to engage us to apply to God in this way herefor. Nor let us expect his gracious regards, unleſs herewith, we put away the evil of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011062_0041_0F854C0626496440"/>
our doings, and become a vertuous and religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This Sirs, this is the only, and bleſſed be God, it is a ſure way to recover and ſecure the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and ſmiles we have forfeited, to obtain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of our grievances, and to have our liberties reſtored and confirmed to us, and to derive them down to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born ages: for we are aſſured that God will be with us, while we are with him; he will not leave, or forſake us. <hi>Know therefore, that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy, with them that love him, and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to a thouſand generations.</hi>
