            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>O THAT ONE MIGHT PLEAD FOR A MAN WITH GOD, AS A MAN PLEADETH FOR HIS NEIGHBOR!</p>

            <p>THE repeated events which have ſhewn death to us in various forms, require a ſolemn recollection of death from the pulpit. When we mourn the domeſtic bereavement, tho the grief be more pungent, yet ſentiment will ſupply our conſolations, and time renew our happy relations. When we loſe the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful citizen—the friend of his neighbors, and of mankind—we may not ſo readily
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023177_0004_0FBDDC236B6F3B70"/>find our public loſs compenſated; tho we may not indulge our tears, or our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſions of grief. Envy, or an ignorance of life, may repreſent, that the place of the beſt may ſoon be ſupplied— that inſtead of the fathers are the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren —and that as ſoon as one man is gone, another will riſe up and take his place: but devotion has taught, in every age, to regret the abſence of the eminent men, who have diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the public ſervice of mankind; and political virtue has celebrated the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who have conducted the important intereſts of the world. To whatever cauſes we owe human greatneſs, we are not better inſtructed in the magnitudes of bodies, and their relative powers, than we are in the hiſtory of mankind, that the greateſt intereſts have depended on the virtue, and generous exertions, of ſome diſtinguiſhed names among men. Whether the character of an age, falſe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023177_0005_0FBDDC24EE6D3930"/>attachments, or any ignoble cauſe, have increaſed this influence, or not, it has been ſacredly real, and truly happy. And we cannot forget the late worthy CAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN GARDNER. His character is the moſt intereſting to us, tho we were not honored by his preſence with us in our public worſhip. His reſidence in our neighborhood, his exemplary virtues, and his uſefulneſs in the town—particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly his ſtation, as a MASTER to one of the moſt intereſting inſtitutions for MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINERS —call upon ſuch an aſſembly as this, in which the greater number are employed in navigation, to ſee a refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the charges which can be brought againſt the man of buſineſs and the ſea. His integrity was unimpeached; his averſion from profanity, ſerious-; his private virtues, conſpicuous; his zeal for his brethren of the ſea, unabated, amidſt all the neglects which in this town have remarkably attended their common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023177_0006_0FBDDC266BC46C08"/>Indeed, he was an example, in his whole character, worthy of the imit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of our mariners—not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to civil and ſocial, but religious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. And to ſuffer ſuch a man to drop into the grave forgotten, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray a criminal inattention to the means of virtue.</p>
            <p>THE words read to us are the words of Job; and they accommodate themſelves very eaſily to the conſideration of that character, which our departed friend ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as a benefactor and patron of an inſtitution deſigned for the relief of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed mariners and their families.</p>
            <p>TO THE ſuperſicial obſerver, as well as the contemplative, of ancient times, the power and ſovereignty of nature were viſible. The preſent life did not correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond to a deſign of immediate good to the individual, nor of an adequate ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit to the whole animal creation. The
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023177_0007_0FBDDC27ECA5EE80"/>laws were not ſuch as a limited ſenſe of goodneſs might adopt. To exhibit this ſentiment, was the deſign of the book of Job. Its images diſcover it to be of eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern original: it has not the prejudices nor language of an Hebrew, and is not mentioned in their antient books: the preſumption is, that it was unknown in antiquity, and was written by an eaſtern pen. The book ſhews us approved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and happy ſucceſs, accompanied with the moſt diſtreſſing diſappointments. The raging winds, the treacherous Arab, and cruel diſeaſe, ſeize together upon the man of virtue. His aſtoniſhed friends, too apt to combine ſucceſs and virtue, cannot reconcile this ſuffering to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. They ſuſpect the virtue they once applauded, and charge guilt upon the ſufferer. Conſcious of integrity, he riſes in his defence. He carries them over nature, to ſhew them the ſovereignty of God. He wiſhes to expoſtulate with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023177_0008_0FBDDC296D801628"/>Heaven, and, as in our text, to awaken the ſame ſympathy in God, which he could provoke in man. But he recollects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: —The book of my years will ſoon be finiſhed; and the Sovereignty which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts me, will terminate my exiſtence.— But we pity the error of his friends. So ſtrongly had they aſſociated ſucceſs with innocence, that they inſulted innocence in its ſuffering. The pleaſing eſteem they had entertained was loſt, and the vigor of their affection abated. Often do we ſee the ſame effects ſtill more ungenerous, in an enlightened world.</p>
            <p>BUT we ſhould remember, that a too ſtrong ſympathy with miſery may lead into an oppoſite extreme. Tho virtue may ſuffer, yet virtue may ſecure ſucceſs. And if we conſider the world as governed only by thoſe who are the leaſt deſerving, the contempt of ſucceſs may place us at variance with all the ſcenery of human
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023177_0009_0FBDDC2AE7F2BAF8"/>affairs, by deſpiſing the rewards which a wiſe conduct may beſtow. The part aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to a benevolent mind, is, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the dangers of life, and to extend the means of relief; that no unhappy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of action, or unforeſeen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, may depreſs the virtue which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, or deprive of the moſt ſalutary conſolations, the men who have nobly dared to diſcharge their duty. While we deſpiſe the inſolence of ſucceſsful villainy, let us encourage virtue in its richeſt gains: and while we juſtify the miſery of vice, let us remember the moſt humble condition of virtue.</p>
            <p>LET us then, in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, conſider the cauſes of human diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, independent of perſonal merit; the diſpoſition to relieve, in human nature; and the juſt improvement of the ſhortneſs of life, to aſſiſt the ſocial principle. The firſt will ſhew us the ſovereignty of God:
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023177_0010_0FBDDC2C6C142A18"/>the ſecond, our happy relief; and the laſt, point out the happy uſe of riches, and a particular application.</p>
            <p>UNDER the firſt conſideration, we may illuſtrate the means of ſucceſs, and the cauſes of diſappointment. What we cannot reverſe in the decrees of Heaven, we may ſhun by our knowledge of them. And the uſual ſources of our proſperity are in education, abilities, and ſecular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Whatever we aſſign to abilities, or impute to intereſt, we muſt allow that education produces the greateſt uſefalneſs and happineſs of character. By this, all uſeful habits are fixed, and the relations of life known. By it is not intended any particular opinions which we obtain in any ſociety, or the form in which we are inſtructed in the duties of life: the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the bow is as real an education, as the learning of the ſchool; and the moſt humble ſociety is formed by it, as well as
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023177_0011_0FBDDC2DEADCA030"/>the beſt. Abilities may, like a ſoil, be rich, and yet without uſe. It is educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cultivates them. It is upon this cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation we depend for ſecular intereſt; and tho all forms of education may not be neceſſary, yet ſome exiſt of neceſſity. The difference of abilities, their capacity for various improvement and various ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, cannot be diſputed. We may grant all we pleaſe to education in employing the materials, and yet conſent that the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials are of different value. We may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſify ſucceſs, and yet own but one way to it. And tho we ſee it attend ſome who are deſtitute of the higher means of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yet we may pronounce it educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill. To be capable of acquiring may be a gift of nature; the means may be taught; and he may be moſt wiſe and happy, in whom theſe qualifications unite; tho a greater ſhare of either may in ſome meaſure compenſate for a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive deficiency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:023177_0012_0FBDDC2F6CC1E6A8"/>
LET us now inveſtigate the cauſes of ill ſucceſs. And they may be reduced to two—nature, and ſociety; but more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly divide themſelves into three— from nature, ſociety in itſelf; and the vices from perſonal character. Nature includes all obſtructions from the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bodies, or unforeſeen contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies; ſociety, all the evils ariſing from the nature of the ſociety in which we live; and the vices, all the miſery ariſing from the neglect to cultivate our natural abilities, or abuſe of them when exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
            <p>SOME are ſo formed, that the animal functions cannot be diſcharged. They have not the uſual ſtrength of body, or energy of mind. They have not all the ſenſes perfect, or all the faculties of the ſoul. Others have ability and diſpoſition for active life, but by ſome animal injury are prevented in the moment of purſuit, or by the deſtructive elements loſe all
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023177_0013_0FBDDC30ED65F2C0"/>the means of enjoying the fruits of their labors. Theſe evils, however, vary greatly in their conſequences. In the firſt and rude ſocieties, the enjoyment upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is eaſily recovered; and in ſome refined ſocieties, reputation will ſurvive loſſes, and urge the moſt generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. In regard to theſe events, we ſee the ſovereignty of God; and however we may ſurmount the evils they bring upon us, we experience our dependence, in the beſt projected plan of our ſucceſs. We cannot bring the will which appoints them, to our immediate ideas of right, or to our wiſhes and hopes. Conſidered then only as the ſubjects of Heaven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation is our happineſs; which implies a full diſpoſition for the action required, in the natural circumſtances of life, through all their changes.</p>
            <p>BUT as in all animal wants man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires aſſiſtance, he finds his refuge in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023177_0014_0FBDDC326AB43488"/>ſociety; which he enlarges at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and forms by habit into a moſt uſeful rule of his life. In ſociety, he can obtain relief under all the evils he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, which admit of his exiſtence; and to furniſh this relief, and to increaſe his ſecurity, he enters into it. In whatever form the contract, or the ſtate, firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, his expectation is nearly the ſame, tho various in degree. But ſociety does not always remedy the evils, againſt which it is provided; and this ſtate forms an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other claſs of obſtructions to the ſucceſs of life in individuals. All ſocieties do not regard, as the object of their laws, the general welfare: hence, the many are ſacrificed to the few. In all ſocieties, the paſſions of men diſplay themſelves, and oppoſed intereſts create endleſs ſufferings to the weaker. The employments, alſo, being aſſigned to different claſſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the progreſs of commerce, and population, have their obſtructions.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023177_0015_0FBDDC33ECA5C770"/>The revolutions in political bodies, which are perpetual, expoſe the members of ſociety to involuntary ſufferings; and in theſe the ambition of rulers has a great influence. The vices, too, are more ſure evils. By indolence they prevent all our juſt exertions, and we become leſs inſtructed and qualified to enjoy ſocial life: or they ariſe from a too paſſionate purſuit of the good to be obtained in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety —ſuch as an inordinate purſuit of pleaſure—an eager deſire of gain, at the expence of equity and truth—and a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for diſtinctions, which involve us in deſtructive meaſures.—Under this fate of humanity, our only relief is ſtill in ſociety: our virtues muſt entitle our claims, and the ſocial affections be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to pronounce them juſt.</p>
            <p>WE paſs now to conſider the diſpoſition to relieve, upon which Job pronounces his claim.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:023177_0016_0FBDDC356D3BC5E0"/>
SO FAR as the evils of life are within human power, we can reſtrain the cauſes from their moſt painful operation. We can ſuccor the infirm, relieve the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate: we can aſſiſt the induſtrious, and correct the vicious. But this aſſiſtance muſt have its eſtabliſhed rules, and not depend upon the reſolution of the hour. It is an evil inſeparable from ſociety, which it is to leſſen, and therefore ſhould have its inſtitutions as permanent as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety itſelf. And while experience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, that the laws and government of a people have a more determined influence upon them, than either climate or ſoil— while, in oppoſite governments, we ſee the ſame race zealous for freedom, or abject in ſlavery—we cannot heſitate in juſtifying all the meaſures which give ſtrength to the ſocial principle in man. All expedients, then, which give men a particular intereſt in one another, are entitled to the encouragement of every
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023177_0017_0FBDDC36ED9B6270"/>friend of mankind. The hand of charity may be extended to the ſufferer, in the hour of his diſtreſs: but this is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial relief. The good ſhould be permanent; and as the object is great, the hands ſhould be united. The helpleſs children are not relieved, merely by the bread they eat; or fit to live, by being preſerved in exiſtence till they can labor with their own hands for a mercenary employer. A generous relief is ſuch as a father would beſtow—the familiar means of education, for the valuable ends of the ſociety in which they live—a fair inquiry into their abilities, and uſeful ſuccor in their firſt attempts. And this aſſiſtance can be had only from happy combinations in ſociety.</p>
            <p>BUT all men are not diſpoſed to this generous ſervice. The excuſes are many, from their own wants, or their immediate
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023177_0018_0FBDDC386BF39E10"/>dependents. It is the benevolent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of more ſocial tempers, which muſt force into action ſuch inſenſible minds, and involve every man's happineſs in the ſucceſs of his neighbor. The ſocial inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions muſt exiſt, to obtain this aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. When they exiſt, they have the following ſalutary conſequences. It is the buſineſs of ſome men to foreſee the evils of life, and provide remedies. The evils foreſeen provide caution, and the remedies render relief ſeaſonable. There are many added to ſociety, who might have been loſt forever. Families, alſo, are not abandoned to deſpair. Being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the kind inſpection of benefactors, they are encouraged to maintain their rank, educate their children, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their exertions. In ſuch ſucceſs, it becomes honorable, as well as uſeful, to relieve diſtreſs. It is impoſſible by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to influence ſome men to make the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023177_0019_0FBDDC39ECDE86C8"/>leaſt voluntary ſacrifice of their intereſt. The work muſt be begun by ſentiment; and, upon the leaſt ſucceſs, it will be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by pride; and this will become hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and of ſteady influence.</p>
            <p>WHEN examples are before our eyes, of families redeemed from deſtruction, every man's danger will urge his care.— If he be not in danger, his children may need aſſiſtance; and if they eſcape, it is ſurely for his own ſecurity that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be forſaken, and, under the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of adverſity, plunge into the low vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Indeed, wealth, in large ſocieties, will have few poſſeſſors, who will not find it for their eaſe and intereſt to move in this ſocial vortex. In conſequence, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent will prevail over a mercenary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Men, being accuſtomed to act, not as will merely promote their ſecular intereſt, but the good of ſociety upon the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023177_0020_0FBDDC3B6B9E13A0"/>whole, will inſenſibly, tho ſurely, gain ſocial habits. To act from ſentiment, is to act from a tender conſcience; and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent is the beſt ſecurity both of virtue and religion. A man, who accuſtoms himſelf to act in this manner, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a mind ſuperior to all diſhonorable gains, to the rigor of juſtice, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of other men; and then ſociety will have a friend and benefactor in him.</p>
            <p>THE ſocial relations will alſo be objects of more ſober deſire, and more ſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Men will not fear to engage in relations, which appear to be the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able charge of all good men; and they will be aſhamed to neglect that attention, which ſtrangers would be bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow in their abſence.</p>
            <p>A FREQUENT intercourſe with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable would have an happy influence upon ſociety. Men would bear upon
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023177_0021_0FBDDC3CEAA816F8"/>their minds, not only the gains they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, but the miſery they occaſion. And their apprehenſions of the laſt, would check their inordinate purſuit of the firſt.</p>
            <p>SUCH knowledge of human life would facilitate the progreſs of ſociety. They, who from their wealth have the greateſt influence on human affairs, would have the moſt extenſive knowledge of the wants of men, and be diſpoſed to relieve them. This happy communication improves the confidence of ſociety, and brings every expedient for the public good into fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar view. Such ſocial inſtitutions would remove numerous prejudices which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter life. Travelling into foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries has been often recommended, to wear off thoſe partialities, which action in confined life, and very narrow circles, occaſions: and the reſult commonly is, with diſcreet minds, a diſcovery of the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023177_0022_0FBDDC3E6D5295B8"/>deep impreſſions made by early aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, prevalent cuſtoms and opinions, and from the nature of the employment, and of the government. All men have not opportunities for obſervation, who go abroad; but as we ſee men abating their prejudices againſt men of any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by an acquaintance with them, ſo, by a careful inſpection of our own neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood, we diſcover all the ſufficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the variety of opinion which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts. The averſion decreaſes, as men are more known; and the happineſs of life improves, in juſt proportion.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER effect is upon religion. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition has its cauſe from an ignorance of natural law; bigotry from an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of mankind. The power of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is confeſſed, upon the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as the ſocial character—upon ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When they blend themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023177_0023_0FBDDC3FED33EE10"/>religion is the ſtrongeſt obligation to the duties of ſociety. Its rites have theſe duties as their object, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and its inſtructions are formed to make life happy. A conviction of theſe conſequences has made ſuperſtitious bigots ſo timorous of ſocial inſtitutions, ſo fond of retirement, and ſo ready to exclude any thing as their object but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. It is hence they have an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to moral diſcourſes, as lifeleſs; and a fondneſs for terror, as inſtruction.</p>
            <p>WE are now prepared for the laſt part of our diſcourſe—to conſider how the ſenſe of our common mortality may be improved to aſſiſt the ſocial principle.</p>
            <p>WE ſee, that generous ambition finds its object in ſociety—that wealth derives its value from the ſame ſource—and that vice, in all its pleaſures, is but an abuſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023177_0024_0FBDDC416E297D58"/>of this favorite enjoyment. Religion brightens, only as it adds its motives to our happineſs, and promotes happy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, by forming from it all its emblems of heaven. Let us now ſearch out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object for wealth. It is beyond our own neceſſary uſe—at leaſt we have not appropriated it for ourſelves—Where ſhall we find its objects? We think not of friends, or neighbors—of ſocial inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, or public benefit. Are we to live here forever, to contemplate it, to make favorite compariſons, and to ſee the world below us? In a few days, we muſt go hence, and return no more. We have not the hope left, of caſting an eye again upon the tranſient ſcene; and our prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty is alienated forever. No bleſſed friend announces our bounty; no heart is warm with gratitude; and death diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges us of the load, without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, Not a particle of earth lays lighter
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023177_0025_0FBDDC42EC2A3A88"/>upon us. Not a ſingle hair of our heads eſcapes diſſolution—and we are gone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Our pains in diſſolution are not leſs ſevere. The ſovereign hand of Heaven trembles not at our wealth, or our power. Our activity and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment defend us not from the ſtroke— Death demands us; and we ſee our own fate in the meaneſt of mankind. It is death, tho under a canopy of ſtate; and the ſame death that overtakes the bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and unburied traveller in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. In all political concerns, wealth is a dangerous poſſeſſion to a man, whoſe heart dwells upon it; for every revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has it as its object. Commerce ſhares its bounty with the rich and poor; excepting that the laſt are nearer to the neceſſary wants of life, and not liable to the ſame changes. But for all its toils there is no compenſation. There is no true happineſs in dying rich, unleſs uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ourſelves and other men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:023177_0026_0FBDDC446D1411D0"/>
AND do we not ſee the beſt turned out every day? Is it not an admonition, that we muſt ſoon remove? Shall not our wealth ſecure the bleſſing of poſterity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own deſcendants; and, as we have aſſiſted others, urge men to aſſiſt our own in turn?</p>
            <p>AND can a better example be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than in our deceaſed friend, who was the head of a charitable ſociety?—His virtues were not oſtentatious. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked no man's envy, but ſought every man's happineſs. He purſued no man's praiſe, but enſured every man's affection. The confidence of mankind he valued, ſo as to endeavor to deſerve it; and he has now left the world—and memory, and the virtues, are his mourners.</p>
            <p>HE has left the moſt uſeful inſtitution, of which he was MASTER, in a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023177_0027_0FBDDC45EEE0DAC0"/>ſituation. And as it is a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble object, eſpecially to the principal gentlemen of this aſſembly, it may not be improper to comply with a deſire to have it conſidered.</p>
            <p>THE beſt charitable inſtitutions, in common with every other good thing, are liable to abuſe; and it has been a queſtion, whether ſome foundations have not increaſed the evils they were intended to remedy. But as this inſtitution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends only friends in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and its dangers are ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, it eſcapes all the principal objections which have been advanced, and has the moſt full claim to the regard of all men employed in commerce.</p>
            <p>THE favorable influence of ſocial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions has been already diſplayed. The MARINE SOCIETY has its full ſhare of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023177_0028_0FBDDC476F1F6E48"/>this influence. It is confeſſed, that to commerce we owe our enlightened age: by it, the genius of modern nations is formed, and their laws and religion. The political virtue of our mariners is more ſecure, as they are maintained in the ſocial virtues, and love of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and their ſecurity adds to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical uſefulneſs. We are all ſenſible that they are particularly expoſed to danger, eſpecially on our coaſt, in this ſeaſon of the year. A ſhipwreck, a neceſſity of returning after an arrival on the coaſt, and the frequent deſtruction on the ocean, not only involve property, but lives; and the beſt proſpects are loſt in a ſingle voyage. Into what ſore diſtreſs are their families plunged! And is there no relief? What is the laſt wiſh of the dying mariner, when he quits the ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered plank? What anguiſh for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at home! What are the emotions of his companion, who receives the tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings!
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023177_0029_0FBDDC48F2355908"/>Is there a heart on earth ſo truly ſocial as the mariner's? Is there a life more formed for ſociety?—Let us do ſomething for his family. Yes, ſays ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery generous friend. Do ſomething—is not ſomething done already? Can it be poſſible that our friend ſhould periſh in the common danger, with a ſocial heart, and an hatred of every unmanly vice, and no way be deviſed to ſecure on remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfort to his wretched family?— And ſhould he eſcape the ſtorm, and leave all his property to the ocean, are there no united friends to ſuccor ſo worthy a companion, and feed his hopes? Is he to wander in the ſtreets, and tell his tale to the thoughtleſs paſſenger? Is he to renounce his rank, and, forgetful of what he once was, deſcend to the meaneſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, when he loſt his intereſt without guilt? Is his amiable wife and lovely children to have no claims; or has the unhappy man, in his gains, never depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023177_0030_0FBDDC4A6E54F640"/>for others, what he may claim for his own neceſſities? Is thus the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mariner to abandon himſelf to the winds and the waves? Forbid it, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that the men, beſt fitted to live in ſociety, ſhould prepare the leaſt! That they ſhould have no band of union—no protection for ſuffering merit—no honor in the welfare of each other, who live and die for ſociety! That they ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to oppreſſion, without uſeful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations, who deſpiſe injuſtice moſt!— Or, that they, who purchaſe wealth with their lives, ſhould renounce their politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal importance! Will not the inſurance of their property, and the communication of uſeful obſervations, be more ſure, if they are repreſented by their friends, and forget not that it is their honor, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and their character, to be bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:023177_0031_0FBDDC4BF16B9C80"/>
AND yet with how much ſupineneſs has this ſubject been conſidered! An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, begun twenty-five years ago, with an hundred members, now reduced to a few, who have been obliged, by humble expedients, to preſerve the form of their inſtitution—printing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing their articles, without effect.— And now their moſt active friend is gone forever! How can I give thee up!— Strengthen the things which remain, and are ready to die. See the generous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a town in this county, to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate its navigation by the ſame inſtitution, and with a ſmall portion of our wealth. See the many humane ſocieties of our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital; and let it be ſaid, while it is acknowledged the town of SALEM has the beſt mariners, moſt enterpriſing, and at home moſt reputable in ſociety, that they have vigor to keep an inſtitution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the diſtreſs of a ſhipwrecked mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and give conſolation to his amiable
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023177_0032_0FBDDC4D6E528158"/>family when he is no more.—For what is this life?—A ſtorm at ſea!—Let us help each other; for he that lives the longeſt, muſt ſink at laſt, and return no more!—</p>
