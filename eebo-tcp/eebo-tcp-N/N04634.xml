            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>ISA. lxii. 4, 5.</bibl>
               <q>Thy Land ſhall be married: For as a young Man mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a Virgin, ſo ſhall thy Sons marry thee; and as the Bridegroom rejoiceth over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy GOD rejoice over thee.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the midſt of many bleſſed Promiſes that God makes to his Church in this and the preceding and following Chapters, of Advancement to a State of great Peace, Comfort, Honour and Joy, after long continued Affliction, we have the Sum of all contained in theſe two Verſes. In the 4th Verſe God ſays to his Church, <hi>Thou ſhall no more be termed Forſaken, neither ſhall thy Land any more be termed Deſolate; but thou ſhalt be called</hi> Hephzibah, <hi>and thy Land</hi> Beulah; <hi>for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy Land ſhall be married.</hi> When it is ſaid, <hi>Thy Land ſhall be married,</hi> we are by <hi>thy Land</hi> to underſtand <hi>the Body of thy People, thy whole Race;</hi> the Land, by a Metonymy very uſual in Scripture, being put for the People that inhabit the Land.</p>
            <p>The 5th Verſe explains how this that is promiſed in the laſt Words of Verſe 4th ſhould be accompliſhed in two Things, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>in being married to her Sons,</hi> and <hi>married to her God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is promiſed that ſhe ſhould be <hi>married to her Sons,</hi> or that her Sons ſhould marry her; <hi>For as a young Man
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005766_0003_10270415004C10A8"/>
marrieth a Virgin, ſo ſhall thy Sons marry thee.</hi> Or, as the Words might have been more literally tranſlated from the Original; <hi>As a young Man is married to a Virgin, ſo ſhall thy Sons be married to thee.</hi> Some by this underſtand a Promiſe that the Poſterity of the captivated <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould return again from <hi>Babylon</hi> to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> &amp; ſhould be, as it were, married or wedded to their own Land; <hi>i.e.</hi> They ſhould be re-united to their own Land, and ſhould have great Comfort and Joy in it, as a young Man in a Virgin that he marries. But their thus interpreting the Words ſeems to be through Inadvertence; not carefully obſerving the Words themſelves, how that when it is ſaid, <hi>So ſhall thy Sons marry thee,</hi> God don't direct his Speech to the Land itſelf, but to the Church whoſe Land it was; the Pronoun <hi>Thee</hi> being applied to the ſame myſtical Perſon in this former Part of the Verſe, as in the Words immediately following in the latter Part of the ſame Sentence, <hi>And as the Bridegroom rejoiceth over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoice over thee.</hi> It is the Church, and not the Hills and Valleys of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that is God's Bride, or the Lamb's Wiſe. 'Tis alſo manifeſt that when God ſays, <hi>So ſhall thy Sons marry thee,</hi> he continues to ſpeak to her to whom he had ſpoken in the three pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Verſes; but there it is not the Ground or Soil of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but the Church that he ſpeaks to when he ſays, <hi>The Gentiles ſhall ſee thy Righteouſneſs, and all Kings thy Glory; and thou ſhall be called by a new Name, which the Mouth of the Lord ſhall name: Thou ſhalt alſo be a Crown of Glory in the Hand of the Lord, and a royal Diadem in the Hand of thy God: Thou ſhalt no more be termed Forſaken,</hi> &amp;c. And to repreſent the Land itſelf as a Bride, and the Subject of Eſpouſals and Marriage, would be a Figure of Speech very unnatural, and not known in Scripture; but for the Church of God to be thus repreſented is very uſual through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scripture from the Beginning to the End of the Bible. And then it is manifeſt that the Return of the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> from the <hi>babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, is not the Event mainly intended by the Prophecy of which theſe Words are a Part. The Time of that Return was
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005766_0004_10270417ECC0C598"/>
not the Time when that was fulfilled in the 2d Verſe of this Chapter, <hi>And the Gentiles ſhall ſee thy Righteouſneſs, and all Kings thy Glory; and thou ſhall be called by a new Name, which the Mouth of the Lord ſhall name.</hi> That was not the Time ſpoken of in the two preceding Chapters, with which this Chapter is one continued Prophecy. That was not the Time ſpoken of in the laſt Words of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, when <hi>the Lord would cauſe Righteouſneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>So that the Children of <hi>Iſrael's</hi> being wedded to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> being manifeſtly not the meaning of thoſe Words in the Text, <hi>As a young Man marrieth a Virgin, ſo ſhall thy Sons marry thee,</hi> as ſome ſuppoſe; I chuſe rather, with others, to underſtand the Words of the Church's Union with her faithful Paſtors, and the great Benefits ſhe ſhould receive from them. God's Miniſters, tho' they are ſet to be the Inſtructors, Guides and Fathers of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet are alſo the Sons of the Church; Amos 2. 11. <hi>I raiſed up of your Sons for Prophets, and of your young Men for Nazarites.</hi> Such as theſe, when faithful, are thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sons of <hi>Zion</hi> comparable to fine Gold ſpoken of <hi>Lam</hi> 4. 2. ſpoken of again Verſe 7. <hi>Her Nazarites were purer than Snow, they were whiter than Milk.</hi> And as he that marries a young Virgin becomes the Guide of her Youth; ſo theſe Sons of <hi>Zion</hi> are repreſented as taking her by the Hand as her Guides, Iſa. 51. 18. <hi>There is none to guide her among all the Sons whom ſhe hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the Hand of all the Sons that ſhe hath brought up.</hi> That by theſe Sons of the Church is meant Miniſters of the Goſpel, is confirmed by the next Verſe to the Text, <hi>I have ſet Watchmen upon thy Walls, O Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Sons of the Church ſhould be married to her as a young Man to a Virgin, is a Myſtery or Paradox not unlike many others held forth in the Word of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Relation between Chriſt and his People, and their Relation to him and to one another; ſuch as that Chriſt is <hi>David'</hi>s Lord and yet his Son, and both the Root and Offspring of <hi>David;</hi> that Chriſt is a Son born and a Child given, and yet the everlaſting Father; that the Church is Chriſt's Mother, as ſhe is repreſented <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 11. and 8. 1, and yet that ſhe is his Spouſe, his Siſter and his Child; that Believers are Chriſt's Mother, and yet his Siſter and Brother; and that Miniſters are the Sons of the Church, and yet that they are her Fathers, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelf, as the Father of the Members of the Church
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005766_0006_1027041CA7195A88"/>
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and alſo the Mother of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> travailing in Birth with them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond and chief Fulfilment here ſpoken of, of that Promiſe of the Church's being married, is in her being married to Chriſt; <hi>And as the Bridegroom rejoiceth over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoice over thee.</hi> Not that we are to underſtand that the Church has many Huſbands or that Chriſt is one Huſband, and Miniſters are other Huſbands that ſhe hath: For tho' Miniſters are here ſpoken of as being married to the Church, yet 'tis not as being his Fellows or Competitors, or as Huſbands of the Church ſtanding in a conjugal Relation to his Bride in any wiſe parallel with his: For the Church has but one Huſband; ſhe is not an Adultereſs, but a Virgin, that is devoted wholly to the Lamb, and follows him whitherſoever he goes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Miniſters eſpouſe the Church intirely as Chriſt's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, as repreſenting him and ſtanding in his Stead, being ſent forth by Him to be married to her in his Name, that by this Means ſhe may be married to him. As when a Prince marries a foreign Lady by Proxy, the Prince's Ambaſſador marries her, but not in his own Name, but in the Name of his Maſter, that he may be the Inſtrument of bringing her into a true conjugal Relation to him. This is agreable to what the Apoſtle ſays, 2 Cor. 11. 2. <hi>I am jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over you with a godly Jealouſy; for I have eſpouſed you to one Huſband, that I may preſent you as a chaſte Virgin to Chriſt.</hi> Here the Apoſtle repreſents himſelf as being, as it were, the Huſband of the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> for 'tis the Huſband that is jealous when the Wife commits Adultery; and yet he ſpeaks of himſelf as having eſpouſed them, not in his own Name, but in the Name of Chriſt, and for him, and him only, and as his Ambaſſador, ſent forth to bring them Home a chaſte Virgin to him. Miniſters are in the Text repreſented as married to the Church in the ſame Senſe that elſewhere they are repreſented as Fathers of the Church: The Church has but one Father even God, and Miniſters are Fathers as his Ambaſſadors; ſo the Church
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005766_0007_102705198CB1DCD8"/>
has but one Shepherd, Joh. 10. 16. <hi>There ſhall be one Fold and one Shepherd;</hi> but yet Miniſters, as Chriſt's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, are often call'd the Church's Shepherds or Paſtors. The Church has but one Saviour; but yet Miniſters, as his Ambaſſadors and Inſtruments, are called her Saviours; 1 Tim. 4. 16. <hi>In doing this thou ſhalt b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Text ſpeaks firſt of Miniſters marrying the Church, and then of Chriſt's rejoicing over her as the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom rejoiceth over the Bride; the former is manifeſtly ſpoken of as being in order to the latter, even in order to the Joy and Happineſs that the Church ſhall have in her true Bridegroom. The preaching of the Goſpel is in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text ſpoken of three Times going, as the great Means of bringing about the Proſperity and Joy of the Church; that is foretold; once in the firſt Verſe, <hi>For</hi> Zion's <hi>Sake will I not hold my Peace, and for</hi> Jeruſalem's <hi>Sake I will not reſt, until the Righteouſneſs thereof go forth as Brightneſs, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth;</hi> and then again in the Text; and laſtly in the two following Verſes, <hi>I have ſet Watchmen upon thy Walls O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which ſhall never hold their Peace Day nor Night: Ye that make mention of the Lord keep not Silence, and give him no Reſt 'till he eſtabliſh and 'till he make</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a Praiſe in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text thus opened affords theſe two Propoſitions proper for our Conſideration on the ſolemn Occaſion of this Day.</p>
            <p>I. The uniting of faithful Miniſters with Chriſt's People in the miniſterial Office, when done in a due Manner, is like a young Man's marrying a Virgin.</p>

II. This Union of Miniſters with the People of Chriſt is in order to their being brought to the Bleſſedneſs of a more glorious Union, in which Chriſt ſhall rejoice over them, as the Bridegroom rejoiceth over the Bride.</p>
            <p>I. The uniting of a faithful Miniſter with Chriſt's People in the miniſterial Office, when done in a due Manner, is like a young Man's marrying a Virgin.</p>
            <p>I ſay, the uniting of a <hi>faithful Miniſter</hi> with Chriſt's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in a <hi>due Manner:</hi> For we muſt ſuppoſe that the Promiſe God makes to the Church in the Text, relates to <hi>ſuch Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a Manner</hi> of Union with the Church; becauſe this is promiſed to the Church as a Part of her latter Day Glory, and as a Benefit that ſhould be granted her by God, as the Fruit of his great Love to her, and an Inſtance of her great ſpiritual Proſperity and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in her pureſt and moſt excellent State on Earth. But it would be no ſuch Inſtance of God's great Favour and the Church's Happineſs to have unfaithful Miniſters entring into Office in an undue and improper Manner. They are evidently faithful Miniſters that are ſpoken of in the next Verſe, where the ſame are doubtleſs ſpoken of as in the Text; <hi>I have ſet Watchmen on thy Walls, O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which ſhall never hold their Peace Day nor Night.</hi> And they are thoſe that ſhall be introduced into the Miniſtry at a Time of its extraordinary Purity, Order and Beauty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as is ſaid in the firſt, ſecond and third Verſes) <hi>her Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhould go forth as Brightneſs, and the Gentiles ſhould ſee her Righteouſneſs, and all Kings her Glory, and ſhe ſhould be a Crown of Glory in the Hand of the Lord, and a royal Diadem in the Hand of her God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I ſpeak of the uniting of a faithful Miniſter with Chriſt's People in a <hi>due Manner,</hi> I don't mean a due Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner only with Regard to external Order; but its being truly done in a holy Manner, with ſincere upright Aims and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, with a right Diſpoſition, and proper Frames of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005766_0009_1026E03FED389190"/>
Mind in thoſe that are concerned; and particularly in the Miniſter that takes Office, and God's People to whom he is united, each exerciſing in this Affair a proper Regard to God and one another.</p>
            <p>Such an uniting of a faithful Miniſter with the People of God in the miniſterial Office, is in ſome Reſpects like a young Man's marrying a Virgin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When a duly qualified Perſon is properly inveſted with the miniſterial Character, and does in a due Manner take upon him the ſacred Work and Office of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, he does in ſome Senſe, eſpouſe the Church of Chriſt in general: For tho' he don't properly ſtand in a paſtoral Relation to the whole Church of Chriſt through the Earth, and is far from becoming an univerſal Paſtor; yet thenceforward he has a different Concern with the Church of Chriſt in general, and its Intereſts and Welfare, than other Perſons have that are Laymen, and ſhould be regarded otherwiſe by all the Members of the chriſtian Church: where ever he is providentially called to preach the Word of God, or miniſter in holy Things, he ought to be received as a Miniſter of Chriſt, and the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts to them. And every one that takes on him the Office of a Miniſter of Chriſt as he ought to do, eſpouſes the Church of Chriſt, as he eſpouſes the Intereſt of the Church in a Manner that is peculiar. He is under Obligations, as a Miniſter of the chriſtian Church, beyond other Men, to love the Church, as Chriſt her true Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom hath loved her, and to prefer <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above his chief Joy, and to imitate Chriſt the great Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls and Huſband of the Church, in his Care and tender Concern for the Church's Welfare, and earneſt and conſtant Labours to promote it, as he has Opportunity. And as he, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aking Office, devotes himſelf to the Service of Chriſt in his Church; ſo he gives himſelf to the Church, to be hers, in that Love, tender Care, conſtant Endeavour, and earneſt Labour for her Proviſion, Comfort and Welfare,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005766_0010_1026E041A940F960"/>
that is proper to his Office, as a Miniſter of the Church of Chriſt, by the Permiſſion of divine Providence as long as he lives; as a young Man gives himſelf to a Virgin when he marries her. And the Church of Chriſt in general, as conſtituted of true Saints through the World (tho' they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on't deliver up themſelves to any one particular Miniſter, as univerſal Paſtor, yet) do cleave to and embrace the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Church with endeared Affection and high Honour and Eſteem, for Chriſt's Sake; and do joyfully commit and ſubject themſelves to them to cleave to, honour and help them, to be guided by them and obey them ſo long as in the World; as the Bride doth in Marriage cleave and deliver up herſelf to her Huſband. And the Miniſtry in general, or the whole Number of faithful Miniſters, being all united in the ſame Work as Fellow-Labourers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring to the ſame Deſign as Fellow-helpers to the Grace of God, may be conſidered as one myſtical Perſon, that eſpouſes the Church as a young Man eſpouſes a Virgin: as the many Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> are repreſented as one myſtical Perſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1. and all called the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> and as the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt in general, all over the World, ſeem to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as one myſtical Perſon and called an Angel, Rev. 14. 6. <hi>And I ſaw another Angel fly in the midſt of Heaven, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and People.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. More eſpecially is the uniting of a faithful Miniſter with a particular chriſtian People, as their Paſtor, when done in a due Manner, like a young Man's marrying a Virgin.</p>
            <p>It is ſo with Reſpect to the Union itſelf, the Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Union, and the Fruits of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>The Union itſelf</hi> is in ſeveral Reſpects like that which is between a young Man and a Virgin, whom he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:005766_0011_1026E04424D24118"/>
It is ſo with Reſpect to mutual Regard and Affection. A faithful Miniſter that is in a chriſtian Manner united to a chriſtian People as their Paſtor, has his Heart united to them in the moſt arden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and render Affection: And they, on the other Hand, have their Hearts united to him, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him very highly in Love for his Work's Sake, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him with Honour and Reverence, and willingly ſubjecting themſelves to him, and committing themſelves to his Care, as being, under Chriſt, their Head and Guide.</p>
            <p>And ſuch a Paſtor and People are like a young Man and Virgin united in Marriage with Reſpect to the Purity of their Regard one to another. The young Man gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Bride in Purity, as undebauched by meretricious Embraces: and ſhe alſo preſents herſelf to him a chaſte Virgin. So in ſuch an Union of a Miniſter and People as we are ſpeaking of, the Parties united are pure and holy in their Affection and Regard one to another. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Heart is united to the People, not for filthy Lucre, or any worldly Advantage, but with a pure Benevolence to them, and Deſire of their ſpiritual Welfare and Proſperity, and Complacence in them as the Children of God and Followers of Chriſt Jeſus. And on the other Hand, they love and honour him with an holy Affection and Eſteem; and not meerly as having their Admiration raiſed, and their carnal Affections moved, by having their Ears tickled, and their Curioſity and other fleſhly Principles grat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fied by a florid Eloquence, and the Excellency of Speech and Man's Wiſdom; but receiving him as the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts, coming to them on a divine and infinitely impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Errand, and with thoſe holy Qualifications that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Vertues of the Lamb of God.</p>
            <p>And as the Bridegroom and Bride give themſelves to each other in Covenant; ſo it is in that Union we are ſpeaking of between a faithful Paſtor and a chriſtian People. The Miniſter by ſolemn Vows devotes himſelf to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to improve his Time and Strength, and ſpend and be
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005766_0012_1026E0478E91FB00"/>
ſpent for them, ſo long as God in his Providence ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Union: And they, on the other Hand, in a holy Covenant, commit the Care of their Souls to him, and ſubject themſelves to him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Union between a faithful Miniſter and a chriſtian People that we are ſpeaking of, is like that between a young Man and Virgin in their Marriage, with Reſpect to the <hi>Concomitants</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>When ſuch a Miniſter and ſuch a People are thus united, it is attended with <hi>great J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y.</hi> The Miniſter joyfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting himſelf to the Service of his Lord in the Work of the Miniſtry, as a Work that he delights in: and alſo joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uniting himſelf to the Society of the Saints that he is ſet over, as having Complacence in them, for his dear Lord's Sake, whoſe People they are; and willingly and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, on Chriſt's Call, undertaking the Labours and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Service of their Souls. And they, on the other Hand, joyfully receiving him as a precious Gift of their aſcended Redeemer. Thus a faithful Miniſter and a chriſtian People are each other's Joy. Rom. 15. 32. <hi>That I may come unto you with J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y by the Will of God, and may with you be refreſhed.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 14. <hi>As you have acknowledged us in Part, that we are your rejoicing,</hi> even as ye are ours.</p>
            <p>Another Concomitant of this Union, wherein it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that which becomes a young Man and Virgin united in Marriage, is <hi>mutual Helpfulneſs,</hi> and a conſtant Care and Endeavour to promote each other's Good and Comfort. The Miniſter earneſtly and continually ſeeks the Profit and Comfort of the Souls of his People, and to guard and defend them from every Thing that might annoy them, and ſtudies and labours to promote their ſpiritual Peace and Proſperity. They, on the other Hand, make it their conſtant Care to promote his Comfort, to make the Burden of his great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Work eaſy, to avoid thoſe Things that might add to the Difficulty of it, and that might j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Heart; and do what in them lies to encourage his Heart and ſtrengthen his Hands in his Work; and are ready to ſay to him when called to exert himſelf in the more difficult Parts of his Work, as the People of Old to <hi>Ezra</hi> the Prieſt when they ſaw him bowed down under the Burden of a difficult Affair, Ezra 10. 4. <hi>Ariſe, for this Matter belongeth to thee: we alſo will be with thee: Be of good Courage and do it.</hi> They ſpare no Pains nor Coſt to make their Paſtor's outward Circumſtances eaſy and comfortable, and free from pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Neceſſities and diſtracting Cares, and to put him under the beſt Advantages to follow his great Work fully and ſucceſsfully.</p>
            <p>Such a Paſtor and People, as it is between a Couple happily united in a conjugal Relation, have a <hi>mutual Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi> with each other, a fellow-feeling of each other's Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and Calamities, and a Communion in each other's Proſperity and Joy. When the People ſuffer in their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Intereſts, the Paſtor ſuffers: he is afflicted when he ſees their Souls in Trouble and Darkneſs: he feels their Wounds; and he looks on their Proſperity and Comfort as his own. 2 Cor. 11.29. <hi>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 13. <hi>We were comforted in your Comfort.</hi> And on the other Hand, the People feel their Paſtor's Burdens, and rejoice in his Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and Conſolations; ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 14. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) This Union is like that which is between a young Man and a Virgin in its <hi>Fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Fruit of it is <hi>mutual Benefit:</hi> They become meet Helps one for another. The People receive great Benefit by the Miniſter, as he is their Teacher to communicate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Inſtructions and Counſels to them, and is ſet to watch over them to defend them from thoſe Enemies and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they are liable to; and ſo is, under Chriſt, to be both their Guide and Guard, as the Huſband is of the Wife. And as the Huſband provides the Wife with Food and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005766_0014_1026E067F7698C00"/>
Cloathing; ſo the Paſtor, as Chriſt's Steward, makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for his People, and brings forth out of his Treaſure Things new and old, gives every one his Portion of Meat in due Seaſon, and is made the Inſtrument of ſpiritually cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and adorning their Souls. And on the other Hand, the Miniſter receives Benefit from the People, as they miniſter greatly to his ſpiritual Good by that holy Converſe to which their Union to him as his Flock leads them. The conjugal Relation leads the Perſons united therein to the moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Acquaintance and Converſation with each other; ſo the Union there is between a faithful Paſtor and a chriſtian People leads them to the intimate Converſation about Things of a ſpiritual Nature: It leads the People moſt freely and fully to open the Caſe of their Souls to the Paſtor, and leads him to deal moſt freely, cloſely and thoroughly with them in Things pertaining thereto. And this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation not only tends to <hi>their</hi> Benefit, but alſo greatly to <hi>his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Paſtor receives Benefit from the People out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as they take Care of and order his outward Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations for his Support and Comfort, and do as it were ſpread and ſerve his Table for him.</p>
            <p>Another Fruit of this Union wherein it reſembles the conjugal Union, is a ſpiritual <hi>Offspring.</hi> There is wont to ariſe from the Union of ſuch a Paſtor and People a ſpiritual Race of the Children of the Congregation that are new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. Theſe new-born Children of God are in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repreſented both as the Children of Miniſters, as thoſe that have begotten them through the Goſpel, and alſo as the Children of the Church, who is repreſented as their Mother that hath brought them forth, and at whoſe Breaſts they are nouriſhed; as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 1. and 66. 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. and many other Places.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The Saints are and ſhall be the Subjects of this Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Of all the many various Kinds of Union of ſenſible and temporal Things that are uſed in Scripture to repreſent the Relation there is between Chriſt and his Church; that which is between Bridegroom and Bride, or Huſband and Wife, is much the moſt frequently made Uſe of both in the Old and New-Teſtament. The Holy Ghoſt ſeems to take a peculiar Delight in this, as a Similitude fit to repreſent the ſtrict, intimate and bleſſed Union that is between Chriſt and his Saints. The Apoſtle intimates that one End why God appointed Marriage, and eſtabliſhed ſo near a Relation as that between Huſband and Wife, was that it might be a Type of the Union that is between Chriſt and his Church, in Eph. 5. 30, 31, 32. <hi>For we are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones. For this Cauſe ſhall a Man leave his Father and Mother, and ſhall be joined to his Wife; and they two ſhall be one Fleſh.</hi>—<hi>For this Cauſe,</hi> i. e. becauſe <hi>we are Members of Chriſt's Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones:</hi> For this Cauſe God appointed that Man and Wife ſhould be ſo joined together as to be one Fleſh, to repreſent this high and bleſſed Union between Chriſt and his Church: The Apoſtle explains himſelf in the next Words, <hi>This is a great Myſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church. This</hi> Inſtitution of Marriage, and making the Man and his Wife <hi>one Fleſh,</hi> is a great Myſtery; <hi>i. e.</hi> it contains in it a great Myſtery; there is a great and glorious Myſtery hid in the Deſign of it: and the Apoſtle tells us what that glorious Myſtery is, <hi>I speak concerning Chriſt and the Church:</hi> as much as to ſay, the Myſtery I ſpeak of, is that bleſſed Union that is between Chriſt and his Church, which I ſpoke of before.</p>

This Union is a bleſſed Union indeed; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> which that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a faithful Miniſter and a chriſtian People is but a Shadow. Miniſters are not the proper Huſbands of the Church, tho' their Union to God's People as Chriſt's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, in ſeveral Reſpects reſembles the conjugal Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> but Chriſt is the true Huſband of the Church, to whom the Souls of the Saints are eſpouſed indeed, and to whom they are united as his Fleſh and his Bones, yea and one Spirit; to whom they have given themſelves in an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, and whom alone they cleave to, love, honour, obey and truſt in, as their ſpiritual Huſband; whom alone they reſerve themſelves for as chaſte Virgins; and whom they follow whitherſoever he goeth. There are many Miniſters in the Church of Chriſt, and there may be ſeveral Paſtors of one particular Church: but the Church has but one Huſband, all others are rejected and deſpiſed in Compariſon of him; he is among the Sons as the Apple-Tree among the Trees of the Wood; they all are barren and worthleſs, he only is the fruitful Tree; and therefore leaving all others, the Church betakes herſelf to him alone, and ſits under his Shadow with great Delight, and his Fruit is ſweet to her Taſte; ſhe takes up her full and entire Reſt in him, deſiring no other. The Relation between a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and People ſhall be diſſolved, and may be diſſolved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Death: but the Union between Chriſt and his Church ſhall never be diſſolved, neither before Death, nor by Death, but ſhall endure through all Eternity: <hi>The Mountains ſhall depart, and the Hills be removed; but Chriſt's conjugal Love and Kindneſs ſhall not depart from his Church; neither ſhall the Covenant of his Peace, the Marriage Covenant</hi> be removed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 1. The Union between a faithful Miniſter and a chriſtian People is but a partial Reſemblance even of the Marriage Union, it is like Marriage only in ſome Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: but with Reſpect to the Union between Chriſt and his Church, Marriage is but a partial Reſemblance, yea, a faint Shadow of that: Every Thing that is deſirable and excellent in the Union between an earthly Bridegroom and Bride, is to be found in the Union between Chriſt and his

Church; and that in an infinitely greater Perfection, and more glorious Manner: There is infinitely more to be found in it, than ever was found between the happieſt Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a conjugal Relation; or could be found, if the Bride and Bridegroom had not only the Innocence of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> but the Perfection of Angels.</p>
            <p>Chriſt and his Saints, ſtanding in ſuch a Relation as this one to another, the Saints muſt needs be unſpeakably happy: Their mutual Joy in each other is anſwerable to the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Relation and ſtrictneſs of their Union: Chriſt rejoice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

My Text has Reſpect to the mutual Joy that Chriſt and his Church ſhould have in each other: For tho' the Joy of Chriſt over his Church only is mentioned, yet 'tis evident that this is here ſpoken of and promiſed as the great Happineſs of the Church, and therefore ſuppoſes her Joy in him.</p>
            <p>The mutual Joy of Chriſt and his Church is like that of Bridegroom and Bride, in that they rejoice in each other, <hi>as thoſe that they have choſen above others, for their neareſt, moſt intimate, and everlaſting Friends and Companions.</hi> The Church is Chriſt's Choſen, Iſa. 41. 9. <hi>I have choſen thee, and not caſt thee away:</hi> Chap. 48. 10. <hi>I have choſen thee in the Furnace of Affliction.</hi> How often are God's Saints called his Elect or choſen Ones? He has choſen them, not to be meer Servants, but Friends; Joh. 15. 15. <hi>I call you not Servants;</hi>—<hi>but I have called you Friends.</hi> And tho' Chriſt be the Lord of Glory, infinitely above Men and Angels, yet he has choſen the Elect to be his <hi>Companions;</hi> and has taken upon him their Nature; and ſo in ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as it were levelled himſelf with them, that he might be their Brother and Companion. Chriſt as well as <hi>David</hi> calls the Saints his Brethren and Companions, Pſal. 122. 8. <hi>For my Brethren and Companions Sake I will now ſay, Peace be within thee.</hi> So in the Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> he calls his

Church his Siſter and Spouſe. Chriſt hath loved and choſen his Church as his peculiar Friend, above others; Pſal. 135. 4. <hi>The Lord hath choſen</hi> Jacob <hi>unto himſelf, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>for his peculiar Treaſure.</hi> As the Bridegroom chuſes the Bride for his peculiar Friend, above all others in the World; ſo Chriſt has choſen his Church for a peculiar nearneſs to him, as his Fleſh and his Bone, and the high Honour and Dignity of Eſpouſals, above all others, rather than the fallen Angels, yea, rather than the elect Angels. For verily, in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, <hi>he taketh not hold of Angels, but he taketh hold of the Seed of</hi> Abraham; as the Words are in the Original, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. He has choſen his Church above the reſt of Mankind, above all the Heathen Nations, and thoſe that are without the viſible Church, and above all other profeſſing Chriſtians, Cant. 6. 9. <hi>My Dove, my Undefiled is but one; ſhe is the only one of her Mother; ſhe is the choice one of her that bare her.</hi> Thus Chriſt rejoices over his Church, as obtaining in her that which he has choſen above all the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as ſweetly reſting in his Choice; Pſal. 132. 13, 14. <hi>The Lord hath choſen</hi> Zion: He hath deſired it.—<hi>This is my Reſt for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other Hand, the Church chuſes Chriſt above all others: He is in her Eyes the Chief among ten Thouſands, fairer than the Sons of Men: She rejects the Suit of all his Rivals for his Sake: Her Heart relinquiſhes the whole World: He is her Pearl of great Price, for which ſhe parts with all; and rejoices in him, as the Choice and Reſt of her Soul.</p>
            <p>Chriſt and his Church, like the Bridegroom and Bride, rejoice in each other, as <hi>having a ſpecial Propriety in each other.</hi> All Things are Chriſt's; but he has a ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in his Church. There is nothing in Heaven or Earth, among all the Creatures, that is <hi>his,</hi> in that high and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Manner that the Church is <hi>his:</hi> They are often called his Portion and Inheritance; they are ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. to <hi>be the firſt Fruits to God and the Lamb.</hi> As of old, the

            <p>Chriſt and his Church, like the Bridegroom and Bride, rejoyce in each other, <hi>as in thoſe that are the Objects of each others moſt tender and ardent Love.</hi> The Love of Chriſt to his Church is altogether unparallel'd: The Height &amp; Depth and Length and Breadth of it paſs Knowledge: For he loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it; and his Love to her proved ſtronger than Death. And on the other Hand, ſhe loves him with a ſupream Affection: nothing ſtands in Competition with him in her Heart: ſhe loves him with all her Heart: her whole Soul is offered up to him in the Flame of Love. And Chriſt rejoyces and has ſweet Reſt and Delight in his Love to the Church; Zeph. 3. 17. <hi>The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty: He will ſave: He will rejoyce over thee with Joy: He will reſt in his Love: He will joy over thee with ſinging.</hi> So the Church in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of her Love to Chriſt, rejoyces with unſpeakable Joy; 1 Pet. 1. 7,8.—<hi>Jeſus Chriſt: whom, having not ſeen, ye love; in whom, tho' now ye ſee him not, yet believing, ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory.</hi>

She fees Light in his Light; and ſhe is made to drink at the River of his own Pleaſures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 8,9.

            <p>Chriſt rejoyces over his Saints as the Bridegroom over the Bride <hi>at all Times:</hi> But there are <hi>ſome Seaſons</hi> wherein he doth ſo more eſpecially.

               </gap>, that when he was converted, <hi>he rejoyced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in God, with all his Houſe,</hi> Act. 16. 34.</p>
            <p>And there are other Seaſons of <hi>ſpecial Communion</hi> of the Saints with Chriſt, wherein Chriſt doth in an eſpecial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner rejoyce ever his Saints, and as their Bridegroom brings them into his Chambers, that they alſo may be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him; <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p>But the Time wherein this mutual Rejoycing of Chriſt and his Saints will be in its Perfection, is the Time of the Saints <hi>Glorification</hi> with Chriſt in Heaven; for that is the proper Time of the Saints entring in with the Bridegroom into the Marriage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 10. The Saint's Converſion is rather like the betrothing of the intended Bride to her Bridegroom before they come together; but the Time of the Saint's Glorification is the Time when that ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 15. <hi>With Gladneſs and Rejoycing ſhall they be brought; they ſhall enter into the King's Palace.</hi> That is the Time when thoſe that Chriſt loved, and gave himſelf for, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe them, as with the waſhing of Water by the Word, ſhall be preſented to him in Glory, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch Thing. The Time wherein the Church ſhall be brought to the full Enjoyment of her Bridegroom, having all Tears wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from her Eyes; and there ſhall be no more Diſtance or Abſence. She ſhall then be brought to the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an eternal Wedding-Feaſt, and to dwell eternally with her Bridegroom; yea to dwell eternally in his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces. Then Chriſt will give her his Loves; and ſhe ſhall drink her Fill, yea ſhe ſhall ſwim in the Ocean of his Love.</p>

And as there are various Seaſons wherein Chriſt and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Saints do more eſpecially rejoyce in each other; ſo there are alſo certain Seaſons wherein Chriſt doth more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially rejoyce over his Church collectively taken. Such a Seaſon is a Time of <hi>remarkable Out-pouring of the Spirit of God:</hi> it is a Time of the Eſpouſal of many Souls to Chriſt: and ſo a Time of much of the Joy of Eſpouſals: and alſo it is a Time wherein Chriſt is won't more eſpecially to viſit his Saints with his Loving-kindneſs, and to bring them near to himſelf, and eſpecially to refreſh their Hearts with divine Communications: on which Account, ſuch a Time becomes a Time of great Joy to the Church of Chriſt. So when the Spirit of God was ſo wonderfully pour'd out on the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> with the Preaching of <hi>Philip,</hi> we read that <hi>there was great Joy in that City,</hi> Act. 8. 8. And the Time of that wonderful Effuſion of the Spirit at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> begun at the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> was a Time of holy Feaſting and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, and a Kind of a Wedding-Day to the Church of Chriſt; wherein <hi>they continuing daily, with one Accord, in the Temple, and breaking Bread from Houſe to Houſe, did eat their Meat with Gladneſs, &amp; Singleneſs of Heart;</hi> as Act. 2. 46.</p>
            <p>But more eſpecially is the Time of that <hi>great Out-pouring of the Spirit of God, in the latter Days,</hi> ſo often foretold in the Scripture, repreſented as the Time of the Marriage of the Lamb, and of the Rejoycing of Chriſt and his Church in each other, as the Bridegroom and the Bride. This is the Time propheſyed of in our Text and Context; and this is the Time foretold in Iſai.65.19. <hi>I will rejoyce in Jeruſalem, and Joy in my People; and the Voice of Weeping ſhall no more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As I obſerv'd before, a faithful Miniſter eſpouſes a chriſtian People, not in his own Name, but as Chriſt's Ambaſſador: He eſpouſes them, that in their being eſpouſed to him, they may be eſpouſed to Chriſt; and not that the Church may commit Adultery with him: 'Tis for his Sake that he loves her, with a tender conjugal Affection, as ſhe is the Spouſe of Chriſt, and as he, as the Miniſter of Chriſt, has his Heart under the Influence of the Spirit of Chriſt; as <hi>Abraham's</hi> faithful Servant, that was ſent to fetch a Wife for his Maſter's Son, was captivated with <hi>Rebeckah'</hi>s Beauty and Vertue; but not with Reference to an Union with himſelf, but with his Maſter <hi>Iſaac:</hi> it was for his ſake he loved her, and it was for him that he deſired her, and ſat his Heart upon her, that ſhe might be <hi>Iſaac'</hi>s Wife: and it was for this that he greatly rejoyced over her, and for this he woo'd her, and for this he obtained her, and ſhe was for a Seaſon united to him; but it was but as a Fellow-Traveller, that by him ſhe might be brought to <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and for this he adorned her with Ornaments of Gold; it was to prepare her for <hi>Iſaac's</hi> Embraces. All that tender Care which a faithful Miniſter takes of his People as a kind of ſpiritual Huſband, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them, to lead and feed them, and comfort them, is not as looking upon them his own Bride, but his Maſter's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005766_0026_102704428EB7FD78"/>
And on the other Hand, the People receive him, and unite themſelves to him in Covenant, and honour him, and ſubject themſelves to him, and obey him, only for Chriſt's Sake, and as one that repreſents him, and acts in his Name towards them. All this Love and Honour and Submiſſion is ultimately refer'd to Chriſt. Thus the Apoſtle ſays, Gal. 4. 14. <hi>Ye received me as an Angel,</hi> or Meſſenger <hi>of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And the Children that are brought forth in Conſequence of the Union of the Paſtor and People, are not properly the Miniſter's Children, but the Children of Chriſt; they are not born of Man, but of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Things that appertain to that foremention'd Union of a faithful Miniſter and Chriſtian People, are the principal appointed Means of bringing the Church to that Bleſſedneſs that has been ſpoken of. As <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Servant, and the Part he acted as <hi>Iſaac'</hi>s Agent towards <hi>Rebeckah,</hi> were the principal Means of his being brought to enjoy the Benefits of her conjugal Relation to <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Miniſters are ſent to wooe the Souls of Men for Chriſt, 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>We are then Ambaſſadors for Chriſt; as tho' God did you by us; we pray you in Chriſt's Stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> We read in <hi>Math.</hi> 22. of a certain King, that made a Marriage for his Son, and ſent forth his Servants to invite and bring in the Gueſts: 'Tis Miniſters that are theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.

            <p n="1">1. The Exhortation may be to all that are called to the Work of the Goſpel Miniſtry.—Let us who are honoured by the glorious Bridegroom of the Church, to be employed as his Miniſters, to ſo high a Purpoſe, as has been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, be engaged and induced by what has been obſerved, to Faithfulneſs in our great Work; that we may be, and act towards Chriſt's People, that are committed to our Care, as thoſe that are united to 'em in holy Eſpouſals, for Chriſt's Sake, and in order to their being brought to the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p>Here I would mention three or four Things tending to excite us to this Fidelity.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:005766_0029_102704497512EA00"/>
1. We ought to conſider how much Chriſt has done to obtain that Joy that has been ſpoken of, in order to which we have been called to the Work of the Miniſtry; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that wherein Chriſt rejoyces over his Church, as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride.</p>
            <p>The Creation of the World ſeems to have been eſpecially for this End, that the eternal Son of God might obtain a Spouſe, towards whom he might fully exerciſe the infinite Benevolence of his Nature, and to whom he might, as it were, open and pour forth all that immenſe Fountain of Condeſcenſion, Love and Grace that was in his Heart, and that in this Way God might be glorified. Doubtleſs the Work of Creation is subordinate to the Work at Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that is called the Creation of the new Heavens and <hi>new</hi> Earth, and is repreſented as ſo much more excellent than the <hi>old,</hi> that <hi>that,</hi> in Comparison of it, is not worthy to be <hi>mention'd,</hi> or <hi> come into Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Chriſt has done greater Things than to create the World, to obtain his Bride and the Joy of his Eſpouſals with her: For he was incarnate, and become Man for this End; which was a greater Thing than his creating the World. For the Creator to <hi>make</hi> the Creature was a great Thing; but for him to <hi>become</hi> a Creature was a greater Thing. And he did a much greater Thing ſtill to obtain this Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; in that for this he laid down his Life, and ſuffered even the Death of the Croſs: for this he poured out his Soul unto Death, and he that is the Lord of the Univerſe, God over all bleſſed for evermore, offered up himſelf a Sacrifice, in both Body and Soul, in the Flames of divine Wrath. Chriſt obtains his elect Spouſe by Conqueſt: for ſhe was a Captive in the Hands of dreadful Enemies; and her Redeemer came into the World to conquer theſe Enemies, and reſcue her out of their Hands, that ſhe might be his Bride: And he came, and encounter'd theſe Enemies in the greateſt Battle that ever was beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld by Men or Angels: He fought with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> and Powers; He fought alone with the Powers of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005766_0030_1027044F1D771F10"/>
Darkneſs, and all the Armies of Hell; yea he conflicted with the infinitely more dreadful Wrath of God, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in this great Battle; and thus he obtained his Spouſe. Let us conſider at how great a Price Chriſt purchaſed this Spouſe: He did not redeem her with corruptible Things as Silver and Gold, but with his own precious Blood; yea he gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for her. When he offered up himſelf to God in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> extream Labours and Sufferings, this was the Joy that was ſet before him, that made him chearfully to endure the Croſs, and deſpiſe the Pain and Shame, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of this Joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; even that rejoycing over his Church, as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride, that the Father had promiſed him, and that he expected when he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her to himſelf in perfect Beauty and Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>The Proſpect of this was what ſupported him in the midſt of the diſmal Proſpect of his Sufferings, at which his Soul was troubled; as appears by the Account we have Joh. 12. See v. 27. <hi>Now is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Soul troubled: and what ſhall I ſay? Father ſave me from this Hour: But for this Cauſe came I unto this Hour.</hi> Theſe Words ſhew the Conflict and Diſtreſs of Chriſt's holy Soul, in the View of his approaching Sufferings. But in the midſt of his Trouble, he was refreſhed with the joyful Proſpect of the Succeſs of thoſe Sufferings, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home his elect Church to himſelf, ſignified by a Voice from Heaven, and promiſed by the Father: on which he ſays, in the Language of Triumph, Ver. 31. 32. <hi>Now is the Judgment of this World: now ſhall the Prince of this World be caſt out; and I, if I be lifted up, will draw all Men unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Miniſters of the Goſpel are appointed to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of bringing this to paſs; the Inſtruments of bringing home his elect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Therefore Jeſus Chriſt, the King of Angels and Men, does as it were cauſe it to be proclaimed concerning faithful Miniſters, as <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> did concerning him that brought up <hi>Eſther</hi> his beloved Queen; <hi>Thus ſhall it be done to the Man that the King delights to Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſeeing Chriſt hath ſo honoured us, that our Relation to his People imitates his; ſurely our Affection to them ſhould reſemble his, and we ſhould imitate him in ſeeking their Salvation, ſpiritual Peace and Happineſs, as Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Let it be conſidered, that if we faithfully acquit our ſelves in our Office, in the Manner that hath been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, we ſhall ſurely hereafter be Partakers of the Joy, when the Bridegroom and Bride ſhall rejoyce in each other in perfect and eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>God once gave forth a particular Command, with ſpecial Solemnity, that it ſhould be written for the Notice of all profeſſing Chriſtians through all Ages; that they are happy and bleſſed indeed, who are called to the Marriage-Supper of the Lamb: Rev. 19. 9. <hi>And he ſaith unto me,</hi> write, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are called to the Marriage-Supper of the Lamb. And he ſaith unto me, theſe are the true Sayings of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005766_0033_10270455B8D57810"/>
God.</hi> But if we are faithful in our Work, we ſhall ſurely be the Subjects of that Bleſſedneſs; we ſhall be Partakers of the Joy of the Bridegroom and Bride, not meerly as Friends and Neighbours that are invited to be occaſional Gueſts, but as Members of the one and the other. We ſhall be Partakers with the Church the bleſſed Bride in her Joy in the Bridegroom, not only as Friends and Miniſters to the Church, but as Members of principal Dignity; as the Eye, the Ear, the Hand, are principal Members of the Body. Faithful Miniſters in the Church will hereafter be a Part of the Church that ſhall receive diſtinguiſhed Glory at the Reſurrection of the Juſt, which above all other Times may be looked on as the Church's Wedding-Day: Dan. 12. 2,3. <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the Duſt of the Earth ſhall awake;</hi> ſome to everlaſting Life.—<hi>And they that be wife ſhall ſhine as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs, as the Stars for ever &amp; ever.</hi> They are Elders that are repreſented as that Part of the Church triumphant that ſit next to the Throne of God, Rev. 4.4. <hi>And round about the Throne were four and twenty Seats; and upon the Seats, I ſaw four and twenty Elders ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, clothed in white Raiment; and they had on their Heads Crowns of Gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we ſhall alſo be Partakers of the Joy of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, in his rejoycing over his Bride. We as the ſpecial Friends of the Bridegroom ſhall ſtand by the Bridegroom, and hear him expreſs his Joy on that Day, and rejoyce greatly becauſe of the Bridegroom's Voice; as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> ſaid of himſelf, Joh. 3. 29. <hi>He that hath the Bride is the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom: but the Friend of the Bridegroom, which ſtandeth and heareth him, rejoyceth greatly becauſe of the Bridegroom's Voice.</hi> Chriſt in Reward for our faithful Service, in winning and eſpouſing his Bride to him, and bringing her up from her Minority, and adorning her for him, will then call us to partake with him in the Joy of his Marriage. And ſhe that will then be his Joy, ſhall alſo be our Crown of Rejoycing. 1 Theſ. 2. 19. <hi>What is our Hope, or Joy, or Crown of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing?

Are not ye, in the Preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at his Coming?</hi> What a joyful Meeting had Chriſt &amp; his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples together, when the Diſciples returned to their Maſter, after the faithful &amp; ſucceſsful Performance of their appointed Service, when Chriſt ſent 'em forth to preach the Goſpel; Luke 10. 17. <hi>And the Seventy returned with Joy, ſaying, Lord, even the Devils are ſubject to us through thy Name.</hi> Here we ſee how they rejoyce: The next Words ſhow how Chriſt alſo rejoyced on that Occaſion: <hi>And he ſaid unto them, I beheld</hi> Satan <hi>like Lightning fall from Heaven.</hi> And in the next Verſe but two, we are told that <hi>in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Then will be the Day when Chriſt that has ſown in Tears and in Blood, and we that have reaped the Fruits of his Labours and Sufferings, ſhall rejoyce together; agreable to <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 35,36,37. And that will be an happy Meeting indeed, when Chriſt and his lovely &amp; bleſſed Bride, and faithful Miniſters that have been the Inſtruments of wooing and winning her Heart to him, and adorning her for him, and preſenting her to him, ſhall all rejoyce together.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Further to ſtir us up to Faithfulneſs in the great Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is appointed us, in order to the mutual Joy of this Bridegroom &amp; Bride, let us conſider what Reaſon we have to hope that the Time is approaching when this Joy ſhall be, to a glorious Degree, fulfil'd on Earth, far beyond what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever yet has been; I mean the Time of the Church's latter Day Glory. This is what the Words of our Text have a more direct Reſpect to; and this is what is prophecied of in Hoſ. 2. 19,20. <hi>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea I will betroth thee unto me in Righteouſneſs, and in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in Loving-kindneſs, and in Mercies: I will even betroth thee unto me in Faithfulneſs; and thou ſhall know the Lord.</hi> And this is what is eſpecially intended by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Lamb in <hi>Rev.</hi> Chap. 19.</p>

               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:005766_0035_1027045E9E4E9350"/>
We are ſure this Day will come: and we have many Reaſons to think that it is approaching; from the Fulfilment of almoſt every Thing that the Prophecies ſpeaks of as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it, and their having been fulfil'd now of a long Time; and from the general earneſt Expectations of the Church of God, and the beſt of her Miniſters &amp; Members, and the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te extraordinary Things that have appeared in the Church of God, and appertaining to the State of Religion, and the preſent Aſpects of divine Providence, which the Time will not allow me largely to inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>As the Happineſs of that Day will have a great Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Glory and Joy of the eternal Wedding-Day of the Church after the Reſurrection of the Juſt; ſo will the Priviledges that faithful Miniſters ſhall be the Subjects of at that Time, much reſemble the bleſſed Priviledges, that they ſhall enjoy, as partaking with the Bridegroom and Bride, in their Honour and Happineſs, in eternal Glory. This is the Time eſpecially intended in the Text, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>as a young Man marrieth a Virgin, ſo ſhall thy Sons marry thee.</hi> And it is after in the Prophecies ſpoken of as a great Part of the Glory of that Time, that then the Church ſhould be ſo well ſupplied with faithful Miniſters. So in the next Verſe to the Text, <hi>I have ſet Watchmen on thy Walls, O Jeruſalem, that ſhall never hold their Peace, Day nor Night.</hi> So Iſai. 30. 20, 21. <hi>Thy Teachers ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into a Corner any more; but thine Eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers; and thine Ears ſhall hear a Word behind thee, ſaying, This is the Way, walk in it, when ye turn to the right Hand, and when ye turn to the left.</hi> Jer. 3. 15. <hi>And I will give you Paſtors according to mine Heart, that ſhall feed you with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Underſtanding.</hi> And Chap. 23. 4. <hi>And I will ſet up Shepherds over them, which ſhall feed them.</hi> And the great Priviledge and Joy of faithful Miniſters at that Day is foretold in Iſai. 52.8. <hi>Thy Watchmen ſhall lift up the Voice; with the Voice together ſhall they ſing: For they ſhall ſee Eye to Eye, when the Lord ſhall bring again</hi> Zion.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:005766_0036_10270461BA430230"/>
And as that Day muſt needs be approaching, and we our ſelves have lately ſeen ſome Things that we have Reaſon to hope are Fore-runners of it; certainly it ſhould ſtrongly excite us to endeavour to be ſuch Paſtors, as God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to bleſs his Church with at that Time; that if any of us ſhould live to ſee the Dawning of that glorious Day, we might ſhare in the Bleſſedneſs of it, and then be called, as the Friends o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Bridegroom, to the Marriage-Supper of the Lamb, and partake of that Joy in which Heaven and Earth, Angels and Saints, and Chriſt and his Church, ſhall be united at that Time.</p>
            <p>But here I would apply the Exhortation in a few Words to that Miniſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of CHRIST, who above all others is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Solemnity of this Day, who is now to be united to, and ſet over this People as their Paſtor.</p>
            <p>You have now heard, Rev. Sir, the great Importance, and high Ends of the Office of an evangelical Paſtor, and the glorious Priviledges of ſuch as are faithful in this Office, imperfectly repreſented. May God grant that your Union with this People, this Day, as their Paſtor, may be ſuch, that God's People here may have the great Promiſe God makes to his Church in the Text, now fulfil'd unto them. May you now, as one of the precious Sons of <hi>Zion,</hi> take this Part of Chriſt's Church by the Hand, in the Name of your great Maſter the glorious Bridegroom, with an Heart devoted unto him with true Adoration &amp; ſupream Affection, and for his ſake <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

him to rejoyce over, as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride. How honourable is this Buſineſs that Chriſt employs you in! and how joyfully ſhould you perform it! When <hi>Abraham'</hi>s faithful Servant was ſent to take a Wife for his Maſter's Son, how engaged was he in the Buſineſs; and how joyful was he when he was ſucceeded! With what Joy did he bow his Head and worſhip, and bleſs the Lord God of his Maſter, for his Mercy and his Truth in making his Way proſperous! And what a joyful Meeting may we conclude he had with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when he met him in the Field, by the Well of <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> and there preſented his beauteous <hi>Rebekah</hi> to him, and told him, all Things that he had done! But this was but a Shadow of that Joy that you ſhall have, if you imitate his Fidelity, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> when you ſhall meet your glorious Maſter, and preſent Chriſt's Church in this Place, as a chaſte and beautiful Virgin unto him.</p>
            <p>We truſt, dear Sir, that you will eſteem it a moſt bleſſed Employment to ſpend your Time and Skill in adorning Chriſt's Bride for her Marriage with the Lamb, and that it is Work that you will do with Delight; and that you will take Heed that the Ornaments you put upon her are of the right Sort, what ſhall be indeed beautiful and precious in the Eyes of the Bridegroom, that ſhe may be all glorious within, and her Cloathing of wrought Gold; that on the Wedding-Day, ſhe may ſtand on the King's right Hand in Gold of <hi>Ophir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The joyful Day is coming, when the Spouſe of Chriſt ſhall be led in unto the King with Raiment of Needle-Work; and Angels and faithful Miniſters will be the Servants that ſhall lead her in. And you, Sir, if you are faithful in the Charge that is now to be committed to you, ſhall be joined with glorious Angels in that honourable and joyful Service; but with this Difference, that you ſhall have the higher Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. Angels and faithful Miniſters ſhall be together in bringing in Chriſt's Bride into his Palace, and preſenting her to him: But faithful Miniſters ſhall have a much higher
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005766_0038_10270468F9D00898"/>
Participation of the Joy of that Occaſion: They ſhall have a greater and more immediate Participation with the Bride in her Joy; for they ſhall not only be Miniſters to the Church as the Angels are, but Parts of the Church, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Members of the Bride. And as ſuch, at the ſame Time that Angels do the Part of miniſtring Spirits to the Bride, when they conduct her to the Bridegroom, they ſhall alſo do the Part of miniſtring Spirits to faithful Miniſters. And they ſhall alſo have an higher Participation with the Bridegroom than the Angels, in his Rejoycing at that Time; for they ſhall be nearer to him than they; for they are alſo his Members, and are thoſe that are honoured as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Inſtruments of eſpouſing the Saints to him, and fitting them for the Enjoyment of him; and therefore they will be more the Crown of Rejoycing of faithful Miniſters, than of the Angels of Heaven.</p>
            <p>So great, dear Sir, is the Honour and Joy that is ſet before you, to engage you to Faithfulneſs in your paſtoral Care of this People; ſo glorious the Prize that Chriſt has ſet up to engage you to run the Race that is ſet before you.</p>
            <p>I would now conclude with a few Words to the People of this Congregation, whoſe Souls are now to be committed to the Care of that Miniſter of CHRIST, whom they have choſen as their Paſtor.</p>
            <p>Let me take Occaſion, dear Brethren, from what has been ſaid, to exhort you, not forgetting the Reſpect, Honour and Reverence, that will ever be due from you to your former Paſtor, that has ſerved you ſo long in that Work, but by Reaſon of Age and growing Infirmities, and the Proſpect of his Place being ſo happily ſupplied by a Succeſſor, has ſeen meet to relinquiſh the Burden of the Paſtoral Charge over you; I ſay, Let me exhort you (not forgetting due Reſpect to him as a Father) to perform the Duties that belong to you, in your Part of that Relation and Union, now to be eſtabliſhed between you and your
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005766_0039_1027046C3A6599A8"/>
elect Paſtor: To receive him as the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts, one that in his Office repreſents the glorious Bridegroom of the Church, to love and honour him, and willingly ſubmit your ſelves to him, as a Virgin when mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to an Huſband. Surely the Feet of that Meſſenger ſhould be beautiful, that comes to you on ſuch a bleſſed Errand as that which you have heard, to eſpouſe you to the eternal Son of God, and to fit you for, and lead you to him as your Bridegroom. Your choſen Paſtor comes to you on this Errand, and he comes in the Name of the Bridegroom, ſo impowred by him, and repreſenting him, that in receiving him, you will receive Chriſt, and in reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, you will reject Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Be exhorted to treat your Paſtor, as the beautiful and virtuous <hi>Rebekah</hi> treated <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Servant: She moſt charitably and hoſpitably entertained him, provided Lodging and Food for him and his Company, and took Care that he ſhould be comfortably entertained and ſupplied in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, while he continued in his Embaſſy; and that was the Note or Mark of Diſtinction which God himſelf gave him, by which he ſhould know the true Spouſe of <hi>Iſaac</hi> from all others of the Daughters of the City. Therefore in this Reſpect approve your ſelves as the true Spouſe of Chriſt, by giving kind Entertainment to your Miniſter that comes to eſpouſe you to the Antitype of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Provide for his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Subſiſtence &amp; Comfort, with the like Chearfulneſs that <hi>Rebekah</hi> did for <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Servant. You have an Account of her Alacrity and Liberality in ſupplying him, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 18,19,20, &amp; 25—Say as her Brother did, Ver. 31. <hi>Come in thou bleſſed of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſhould entertain your Paſtor. But this is not that wherein your Duty towards him chiefly lies: The main Thing is to comply with him in his great Errand, and to yield to the Suit that he makes to you in the Name of Chriſt, to go to be his Bride. In this you ſhould be like <hi>Rebekah:</hi> ſhe was from what ſhe heard of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

him, and Bleſſing upon him, from the Mouth of <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Servant, willing for ever to forſake her own Country, and her Father's Houſe, to go into a Country ſhe had never ſeen, to be <hi>Iſaac'</hi>s Wife, whom alſo ſhe never ſaw. After ſhe had heard what the Servant had to ſay, and her old Friends had a Mind ſhe ſhould put off the Affair for the preſent, but it was inſiſted on that ſhe ſhould go immediately, and ſhe was enquired of <hi>whether ſhe would go with this Man,</hi> ſhe ſaid, <hi>I will go:</hi> and ſhe left her Kindred, and followed the Man, through all that long Journey, 'till he had brought her unto <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and they three had that joyful Meeting in <hi>Canaan.</hi> If you will this Day receive your Paſtor in that Union that is now to be eſtabliſhed between him and you, it will be a joyful Day in this Place, and the Joy will be like the Joy of Eſpouſals, as when a young Man marries a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; and it will not only be a joyful Day in <hi>Eaſt Hampton,</hi> but it will doubtleſs be a joyful Day in Heaven, on your Account. And your Joy will be a faint Reſemblance, and a Fore-runner of that future Joy, when Chriſt ſhall rejoyce over you as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride, in heavenly Glory.</p>
            <p>And if your Paſtor be faithful in his Office, and you hearken and yield to him in that great Errand on which Chriſt ſends him to you, the Time will come, wherein you and your Paſtor will be each others Crown of Rejoycing, and wherein Chriſt and he and you ſhall all meet together at the glorious Marriage of the Lamb, and ſhall rejoyce in and over one another, with perfect, uninterrupted, never ending and never fading Joy.</p>
