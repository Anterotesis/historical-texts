            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>APOLOGY FOR THE WORK.</head>
                  <p>THE following treatiſe was written at the deſire of Miſs S. and Miſs M. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; who were themſelves educated for the purpoſe of educating others; and on that account were originally placed in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſeminaries for female tuition; and afterwards engaged themſelves for a time as teachers in other ſchools, and in private families; the better to qualify themſelves for the arduous taſk of conducting a board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſchool for the education of young ladies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:033601_0007_0FF7A15125B93230"/>
About four years ago a houſe was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſale at Aſhborne in Derbyſhire, at the very extremity of the town, in a moſt pleaſant and healthy ſituation, on a dry ſandy ſoil, with excellent water, well ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the north-eaſt, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an extenſive proſpect of Sir Brooke Boothby's park, and its beautiful environs.</p>
                  <p>A ſpacious walled garden adjoins the houſe, at the bottom of which is a ſtream of water, which may ſometime be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a river-bath.</p>
                  <p>Miſs PARKERS procured this eligible ſituation, and had the houſe well fitted up for the purpoſes of a boarding ſchool. It conſiſts of an ample ſchool-room, and an ample dining-room, and four ſmaller par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
<pb facs="unknown:033601_0008_0FF7A15397C32910"/>on the principal floor; with two ſtair-caſes, one of which is of ſtone. The whole is airy and well lighted; and now contains about thirty pupils without being crowded.</p>
                  <p>They next had the good fortune to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage very excellent teachers in dancing, muſic, and drawing, from Nottingham, Derby, &amp;c. with a polite emigrant as French maſter; and laſtly applied to me for any ideas, I could furniſh them with, on the ſubject of female education. And now, as their eſtabliſhment has ſucceeded to their utmoſt wiſh, have expreſſed a deſire, that I would give to the public, what I wrote originally for their private inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:033601_0009_0FF7A1552F21C3F0"/>
I have only to add, that a copy of the manuſcript has been ſeen by many of the ingenious of both ſexes, and much improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their obſervations; to whom I here beg leave to return my moſt grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments.</p>

                     <p>THE PARENTS and guardians of young ladies of the laſt half century were leſs ſolicitous about procuring for them ſo extenſive an education, as modern refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requires. Hence it happens, that female education has not yet been reduced to a perfect ſyſtem; but is frequently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by thoſe, who have not themſelves had a good education, or who have not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the ſubject with ſufficient attention. And tho' many ingenious remarks are to be

                     <p>The advantages of a good education conſiſt in uniting health and agility of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with cheerfulneſs and activity of mind; in ſuperadding graceful movements to the former, and agreeable taſtes to the latter; and in the acquirement of the rudiments of ſuch arts and ſciences, as may amuſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or gain us the eſteem of others; with a ſtrict attention to the culture of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and religion.</p>
                     <p>The female character ſhould poſſeſs the mild and retiring virtues rather than the bold and dazzling ones; great eminence in almoſt any thing is ſometimes injurious to a young lady; whoſe temper and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould appear to be pliant rather than
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033601_0012_0FF7A15CB4BD4FF0"/>robuſt; to be ready to take impreſſions ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to be decidedly marked; as great apparent ſtrength of character, however excellent, is liable to alarm both her own and the other ſex; and to create admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rather than affection.</p>
                     <p>There are however ſituations in ſingle life; in which, after the completion of their ſchool-education, ladies may culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate to any extent the fine arts or the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences for their amuſement or inſtruction. And there are ſituations in a married ſtate; which may call forth all the energies of the mind in the care, education, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, for a family; which the inactivity, folly, or death of a huſband may render ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Hence if to ſoftneſs of manners, complacency of countenance, gentle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurried motion, with a voice clear and yet tender, the charms which enchant all hearts! can be ſuperadded internal ſtrength and activity of mind, capable to tranſact the buſineſs or combat the evils of life;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033601_0013_0FF7A15E46B70268"/>with a due ſenſe of moral and religious obligation; all is obtained, which education can ſupply; the female character becomes complete, excites our love, and commands our admiration.</p>
                     <p>Education ſhould draw the outline, and teach the uſe of the pencil; but the exertions of the individual muſt afterwards introduce the various gradations of ſhade and colour, muſt illuminate the landſcape, and fill it with the beautiful figures of the Graces and the Virtues.</p>

It is perhaps more deſirable, that young ladies ſhould play, ſing, and dance, only ſo well as to amuſe themſelves and their friends, than to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thoſe arts in ſo eminent a degree as to aſtoniſh the public; becauſe a great appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent attention to trivial accompliſhments is liable to give a ſuſpicion, that more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable acquiſitions have been neglected. And, as they conſiſt in an exhibition of the perſon, they are liable to be attended with vanity, and to extinguiſh the bluſh of youthful timidity; which is in young ladies the moſt powerful of their exterior charms.</p>

Such maſters ſhould be choſen to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct young ladies in theſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as are not only well qualified to ſing and play, or to dance themſelves; but alſo who can teach with good temper and genteel behaviour: they ſhould recollect, that vulgar manners, with the ſharp geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of anger, and its diſagreeable tones of voice, are unpardonable in thoſe, who profeſs to teach graceful motion, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious expreſſion; and may affect the taſte and temper of their pupils, ſo as to be more injurious to their education; than any thing, which they are able to teach them, can counterbalance.</p>

                     <head>SECTION III. READING.</head>
                     <p>AS reading is as much a language to the eye, as ſpeaking is to the ear; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much time and labour for children to acquire both theſe languages. Such books ſhould therefore be put into their hands, as join amuſement with inſtruction, and thus lighten the fatigue of continued application, as Sandford and Merton, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's aſſiſtant, Evenings at home, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others.</p>
                     <p>In learning to read aloud, a clear and diſtinct enunciation is ſeldom acquired at ſchools; which is owing to the child ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe to the teacher, who looks over the book along with it; and hence the pupil finds no difficulty in being underſtood, even when ſhe pronounces only half words. This however is eaſily remedied by placing the reader at the diſtance of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033601_0017_0FF7A167797580D0"/>two yards or more from the hearer; then the young ſcholar ſoon finds, that ſhe is not underſtood, unleſs ſhe expreſſes her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with clear articulation. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the teacher ſhould always be provided with a duplicate of the book, ſhe teaches; that ſhe may not be neceſſitated to look over the ſhoulder of her pupil.</p>
                     <p>As the young ſcholars advance in the knowledge of language, other books muſt be taught them both in proſe and poetry; ſuch as may improve their minds in the knowledge of things, in morality, religion, or which may form their taſte. A great number of books for the uſe of children has been publiſhed in late years; many of them by very ingenious writers, and well adapted to the purpoſe deſigned, of ſuch of theſe, as have come to my knowledge, a catalogue ſhall be given at the end of this treatiſe.</p>

                     <p>WRITING, as it keeps the body in a fixed poſture, as well as drawing, and needlework, ſhould not be too long appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to at a time; ſince the body, and even the countenance, may thus get a certain tendency to one attitude; as is ſeen in children, who are brought up to ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic art, as in poliſhing buttons or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones on a lathe. A proper manner of holding the pen, or pencil, or needle, with an eaſy but graceful attitude of the perſon, and an agreeable moderate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the countenance, ſhould firſt be taught; for which purpoſes an inclined deſk has many advantages over an horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal table for the books, or working frames; as the body is thence leſs bent forwards; and the light in general ſituations more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidly reflected to the eye.</p>

If the deſk be ſixteen inches broad, the furthermoſt edge of it ſhould riſe about three inches and half from the horizontal line; which produces the moſt convenient inclination, and the table or frame, which ſupports it, for the uſe of the taller chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſhould riſe about two feet eight inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from the ground.</p>

                     <p>WHICH is an abſtract ſcience teaching the texture of language, is too hard for very young minds; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generally taught too early: and the ſame may be ſaid of Arithmetic. The Engliſh grammars in general uſe at ſchools are both tedious and defective compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; an epitome, or extract, from Lowth's grammar, with the late improvements of Mr. Horne Tooke in the theory of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, would well ſupply this branch of knowledge; and might be given to the public under the name of a "rational Engliſh grammar."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Devis has publiſhed a ſmall and uſeful rudiment of grammar purpoſely for the uſe of young ladies: which may be taught as an introduction to Lowth's grammar. The Abbe Gaultier's Jeu de

                     <head>SECTION VI. LANGUAGES.</head>
                     <p>THE neceſſity of learning ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient or foreign languages impoſes a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous taſk on the youth of both ſexes; which conſumes years of their precious time, which might otherwiſe be employed in the acquiſition of ſciences. The difficulty of obtaining a competent knowledge of the Greek or Latin language is many times greater than that of obtaining any modern one; as may be deduced from the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable changes of the termination of their nouns, adjectives, and verbs; which to a beginner are all ſo many new words. And as the works of the beſt writers in theſe languages have been tranſlated into our own, it is leſs neceſſary in the education of ladies to expend ſo much time and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in acquiring them. But as the French and Italian are leſs difficult to learn, and contain new books of taſte and knowledge,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033601_0023_0FF7A175983693F0"/>which are yearly publiſhed in this age of literature; and as they are convenient for converſing with foreigners, who come hither, or in our travelling into other countries; and laſtly, as they are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as well as faſhionable ſtudies; the pupils of boarding ſchools ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to attain one or both of them.</p>
                     <p>The method recommended by Mr. Locke in his treatiſe on education, ſect. 162, of teaching languages by converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will on trial be generally found ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in reſpect to modern languages with even the youngeſt children. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs a knowledge of grammar ſhould afterwards be taught with care, if the child be too young at firſt to attend to it; for without the aid of grammar not only the French or Italian languages, but even the Engliſh will not always be ſpoken or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with perfect accuracy.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe of acquiring modern languages by converſation, a ſchool gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033601_0024_0FF7A178140A2850"/>ſupplies better opportunities than a private family, beſides the advantage of ſome degree of emulation, which frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſts, where children converſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: another advantage of infantine ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is, that they learn many other things, as well as languages, by repeating them to each other; and obtain, what is ſeldom to be acquired from adult companions, ſome knowledge of phyſiognomy; as the paſſions of children are more legibly expreſſed on their countenances than at a maturer age. This knowledge of phyſiognomy, which is perhaps only to be acquired at ſchools, by giving a promptitude of underſtanding the preſent approbation or diſlike, and the good or bad deſigns, of thoſe whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, becomes of hourly uſe in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every department of life.</p>

                     <p>LIKE grammar is an abſtract ſcience, which is frequently attempted to be taught too early; at the ſame time it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the early initiation of moſt children into card playing before they come to ſchool, by giving clear and viſible ideas of the ten firſt numerals, ſeems greatly to facilitate their acquirement of arithmetic; and if this faſhionable amuſement could be ſo managed by the parents, who allow it to their children, as not to excite a deſire of gain along with a conteſt of ingenuity, it might be rendered, in ſome meaſure, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous by exciting the mind to activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this branch of ſcience; but in never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs not proper to be uſed in ſchools, where its effects on the paſſions cannot be ſufficiently watched, and counteracted.</p>
                     <p>So much of the ſcience of numbers as is in common uſe, as the numeration, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033601_0026_0FF7A17B4240F338"/>multiplication, and diviſion of money, ſhould be learnt with accuracy; to which ſhould be added the rule of three, and decimal fractions; which will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly repay the labour of acquiring them by the pleaſure and utility, which will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually reſult from the knowledge of them thro' life. The higher parts of arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, as algebra and fluxions, belong to the abſtruſer ſciences.</p>
                     <p>There are many introductory books to the ſcience of arithmetic; thoſe I have heard moſt recommended are Viſe's tutor's guide, Hutton's practical arithmetic, and Wingate's arithmetic; but it is probable, that moſt of the introductory treatiſes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetic muſt be nearly of equal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

                     <p>SO much of this ſcience, as depends only on memory, may be taught to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their early years.

Afterwards the uſe of the globes ſhould be explained; and ſome ſhort outline of aſtronomy ought to accompany theſe lectures.</p>
                     <p>A compendious ſyſtem of geography on cards, publiſhed by Mr. Newberry, in St. Paul's church yard, ſupplies a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033601_0028_0FF7A181413F6988"/>method of inſtructing children. Other geographical cards by Bowles, tho' they only mention the latitude and longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of important places, may alſo be uſed with advantage. The maps, publiſhed by Mr. Faden, which have blank outlines to be filled up by the ſtudent, are well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and not very expenſive. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be Gaultier's cours de Geographie formed into a game may, like his game at gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, be rendered amuſing to children, and are tolerably well adapted both to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate families, where there are but few pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils, and to public ſeminaries of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Fairman's geography, a ſmall octavo ſold by Johnſon, contains a ſhort account of the planets, and uſe of the globes. Brooks' gazetteer is an uſeful work; and ſome other good geographical publications are mentioned in the catalogue of books at the end of this work.</p>

                     <p>ARE too much neglected in moſt boarding ſchools; theſe ſhould be taught with ſome care, as perhaps peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Ladies; ſince taſte enters into their dreſs, their motions, their manners, as well as into all the fine arts, which they have leiſure to cultivate: as drawing, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, modelling, making artificial flowers, embroidery; writing letters, reading, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and into almoſt every circumſtance of life.</p>
                     <p>The general rudiments of taſte are to be acquired firſt by reading books, which treat profeſſedly on the ſubject; as the ten papers by Mr. Addiſon on the power of imagination in the Spectator, vol. 6, No. 411; Akinſide's pleaſures of imagination; Burke on the ſublime and beautiful; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garth's analyſis of beauty; Maſon's Engliſh
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033601_0034_0FF7A18EC8467438"/>garden; Wheatley's ornamental garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and Gilpin's pictureſque views. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by ſelecting and explaining admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſages from claſſical authors, as the Beauties of Shakeſpeare, of Johnſon, and of Sterne. And laſtly, by exhibiting and explaining the prints of beautiful objects, or caſts of the beſt antique gems and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallions.</p>
                     <p>The authors above mentioned have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the objects of Taſte into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, the beautiful, and the new; but a new ſect of inquirers into this ſubject have lately added the Pictureſque; which is ſuppoſed to differ from the beautiful by its want of ſmoothneſs, and from the ſublime from its want of ſize; but this circumſtance has not yet perhaps undergone ſufficient examination.—See eſſay on Pictureſque, by U. Price.</p>
                     <p>Others have endeavoured to make a diſtinction between beauty and grace; and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033601_0035_0FF7A19142393E90"/>have eſteemed them, as it were, rivals for the poſſeſſion of the human heart. But Grace may be defined Beauty in action; for a ſleeping beauty can not be called graceful, in whatever attitude ſhe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline; the muſcles muſt be in action to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a graceful attitude, and the limbs to produce a graceful motion. The ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed origin of our ideas of beauty acquired in our early infancy from the curved lines, which form the female boſom, is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Zoonomia, vol. I. ſect. xvi. 6; but is too metaphyſical an inveſtigation for young ladies.</p>

                     <p>The ſame obſervation applies to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery, which is painting with the needle inſtead of the pencil, and ſeems to have been a faſhionable employment of ladies of the higheſt rank in the early ages of the world. As the ladies in polite life have frequently much leiſure time at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, it is wiſe for them to learn many
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033601_0037_0FF7A1954CF7BF78"/>elegant as well as uſeful arts in their early years; which they may afterward cultivate for their amuſement; and thus deprive ſolitude of irkſomeneſs: And by being able to entertain themſelves, they may be leſs ſolicitous to enter the circles of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and depend leſs for happineſs on the caprice of others.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the amuſement or accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of poſſeſſing the talent of drawing, there is another advantage reſulting from it; which conſiſts in uſing the pencil as a language to expreſs the forms of all viſible objects, as of flowers, machines, houſes, landſcapes; which can not in words alone be conveyed to others with ſufficient accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy: For this end it may be ſufficient to draw in outlines alone the figures of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, without expending ſo much time on this art, as is requiſite to enable the learner to add the nice touches, which form the delicate gradations of ſhade and colour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="unknown:033601_0038_0FF7A197C7F54310"/>
It may be ſuppoſed, that ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſcience of perſpective ſhould be previouſly acquired for the purpoſe of drawing the outlines of objects; but I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that this is not always neceſſary, ſince at our learning to ſee; before we have compared the ideas received by the ſenſe of ſight with thoſe received by that of touch; any object placed before our eyes, as ſuppoſe the face of a companion, muſt appear a flat coloured or ſhaded ſurface, and not a ſolid ſubſtance covered with emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences and depreſſions; as is ſo well proved by Biſhop Berkley in his theory of viſion. Hence if any one could ſo far unlearn the language of ſight as to imagine the face of his companion to be a flat co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured ſurface only, (as it is really ſeen) he would draw from nature as eaſily and exactly, as if he was copying a picture, as the inequalities would appear lights and ſhades; and he would thus be enabled to take the likeneſs with much greater facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and accuracy without the aid of the rules of perſpective.</p>

                     <p>IS connected with the ſtudy of taſte, and ſhould therefore be taught in boarding ſchools; as without ſome knowledge of it the works of the painters, ſtatuariſts, and poets, both antient and modern, can not be underſtood. But as a great part of this mythology conſiſts of perſonified vices, much care ſhould be taken in female ſchools, as well as in male ones, to prevent any bad impreſſions, which might be made on the mind by this kind of erudition; this is to be accompliſhed by explaining the allegorical meaning of many of theſe ſuppoſed actions of heathen deities, and by ſhewing that they are at preſent uſed only as emblems of certain powers, as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva of wiſdom, and Bellona of war, and thus conſtitute the language of painters; and are indeed almoſt the whole language which that art poſſeſſes, beſides the delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of viſible objects in reſt or in action.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:033601_0040_0FF7A19CE2250338"/>
Theſe emblems however are not to be ſo eaſily acquired by deſcriptions alone, nor ſo eaſily remembered by young pupils; as when prints of antique ſtatues, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallions, or when cameos, or impreſſions of antique gems, are at the ſame time ſhewn and explained to them. For this purpoſe the prints of Spence's Polymetis may be exhibited and explained; from which Bell's pantheon is principally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: And Dannet's dictionary of mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, originally written in French, may be occaſionally conſulted; and the notes on Mr. Pope's tranſlations of Homer.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a little book intitled, "Inſtructions ſur les Metamorphoſes, par M. Le Ragois," which, I am informed is an uſeful and unexceptionable work for this purpoſe, containing a kind of ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of each ſtory of fabulous mythology: to which may be added a tranſlation of Ovid's Metamorphoſes, publiſhed by Garth; which I am told, is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                     <head>SECTION XIV. POLITE LITERATURE</head>
                     <p>MAY be divided into diſſertations, plays, romances, poems; each of which, if the works are properly ſelected, may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford amuſement and inſtruction to young perſons; of ſome of the books of each of theſe claſſes of literature a catalogue will be given at the end of the work.</p>
                     <p>Such diſſertations, as have been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally admired, may be ſelected from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, the World, the Rambler, Adventurer, Looker-on, beſides many others.</p>
                     <p>Plays are of three kinds, tragical, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental, and humourous; of the firſt, Addiſon's Cato has been long admired; and the tragedies of Thompſon conſiſt of fine language. Of the ſecond kind Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's comedies are inſtances; and of the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033601_0043_0FF7A1A4B5B396D0"/>third Sheridan's comedies; ſome of which are entertaining and inoffenſive, and may be read by young ladies without injury to their morals, or much outrage to their feelings.</p>
                     <p>There are many plays, which are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeen as exhibited on the ſtage, than as read in the cloſet; becauſe the objectiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſages are generally omitted in the repreſentation. But whether young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould be taught to act plays them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as is done at ſome boy's ſchools, is a matter of doubt. The danger conſiſts in this, leſt the acquiſition of bolder ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a more elevated voice, ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate that retiring modeſty, and bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing embarraſſment, to which young ladies owe one of their moſt powerful external charms.</p>
                     <p>If young ladies act plays amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only, or without admitting more than two or three of their friends or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033601_0044_0FF7A1A647FB5D90"/>or if they repeat choſen ſcenes of plays, or ſpeeches only, much of the above objection ceaſes, and ſome advantages may reſult to their attitudes or enunciation. Madam de Genlis' Theatre d'Education affords the leaſt exceptionable whole plays, with the ſacred dramas of Miſs Moore, and of Metaſtaſio.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Novels or romances may be divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſerious, the humourous, and the amorous. Of theſe, the laſt ſhould be intirely interdicted; but the firſt, when well managed, may convey inſtruction in the moſt agreeable and forcible manner: Such as Mr. Day's Sandford and Merton. The Children's Friend. Tales of the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Robinſon Cruſoe. Edward, by the author of Zelucco. And to theſe may be added ſome other modern novels, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of ingenious ladies, which are I believe leſs objectionable than many others; as the Evelina, Cecilia, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla of Miſs Burney. The Emmeline
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033601_0045_0FF7A1A7D71489F0"/>and Ethelinda of Charlotte Smith; Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald's ſimple ſtory; Mrs. Brook's Emily Montague; and the female Quixote; all which I have here introduced from the character given to me of them by a very ingenious lady; not having myſelf read them with ſufficient attention. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the humorous novels, which are not written to inflame the paſſions, convey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as far as they are imitations of real life: Of theſe are Le Sage's famous novel of Gil Blas; and Fielding's Tom Jones; neither of which however are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per books for young readers.</p>
                     <p>There are many, who condemn the uſe of novels altogether; but what are epic po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems but novels in verſe?—It is difficult to draw the line of limit between novels, and other works of imagination; unleſs the word novel be confined to mean only the romances of love and chivalry.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed, that almoſt all novels, as well as plays, and epic poems, have ſome
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033601_0046_0FF7A1AA5DC1AD00"/>exceptional paſſages to be found in them; which might therefore be expunged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are allowed to be read by young ladies. But are young women therefore to be kept in intire ignorance of mankind, with whom they muſt ſhortly aſſociate, and from whom they are frequently to chooſe a partner for life? This would be making them the ſlaves rather than the companions of men, like the Sultanas of a Turkiſh Seraglio. And how can young women, who are ſecluded from the other ſex from their infancy, form any judgment of men, if they are not to be aſſiſted by ſuch books, as delineate manners?—A lady of fortune, who was perſuaded by her guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian to marry a diſagreeable and ſelfiſh man, ſpeaking to her friend of the ill humour of her huſband, lamented, that ſhe had been prohibited from reading novels. <q>If I had read ſuch books, ſaid ſhe, before I was married, I ſhould have choſen bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I was told, that all men were alike except in reſpect to fortune.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="unknown:033601_0047_0FF7A1ACE0E19E28"/>
We muſt however obſerve, that novels are perhaps more objectionable in ſchools than in private education; as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of one bad mind may be dangerous to the whole community: And as they are more amuſing to young people than any other books, if read too early, they may give a diſtaſte to more uſeful knowledge; which are good reaſons for the total prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of them in ſchools: And in private education, leſt a preference of fiction to truth ſhould be thus inſtilled, the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous paſſages, with which even the beſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels abound, ſhould be carefully pointed out by a friend or governeſs: with their exaggerations, improbabilities, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent deviations from nature.</p>
                     <p>There are indeed few books, which delineate manners, whether in proſe or poetry, however well choſen, which have not ſome objectionable paſſages in them. In reading the fables of Eſop, Mr. Rouſſeau well obſerves, that the effect
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033601_0048_0FF7A1AF774C4BB8"/>on the mind may frequently be totally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that deſigned by the author; as in the fable where the fox flatters the crow, and gains the piece of cheeſe, the moral was deſigned to ſhew the folly of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to flatterers; but may equally be ſuppoſed to applaud the cunning of the fox or flatterer, who is rewarded. In the popular narrative of Robinſon Cruſoe a childiſh ſuperſtition concerning intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of future events, ſomewhat like the ſecond ſight of the highlands of Scotland, is frequently inculcated; and the uſe of rum or brandy is propoſed as an infallible cure in all maladies; which however I am told is corrected in the new Robinſon Cruſoe.</p>
                     <p>Pamela, and Joſeph Andrews, and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa Harlow, are recommended by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Genlis, and by Mrs. Macawley.— Madame de Genlis in a note in one of her works gives her reaſon for recommending Richardſon's novels; becauſe his heroines
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033601_0049_0FF7A1B10993EF50"/>retain a more conſiderable degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over their affections than thoſe of apparently leſs exceptionable romances. In this reſpect a novel called "Plain Senſe," lately publiſhed by Lane, and written by an ingenious Cheſhire lady, claims the preference to all others, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to carry this idea to exceſs.</p>
                     <p>The works of Richardſon are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs not only too voluminous, and thence would conſume too much time, which might be better employed in ſchools: but in theſe, and even in Mr. Pope's rape of the lock, and his Eloiſa to Abelard, many objectionable paſſages of another kind may be diſcovered. If theſe paſſages, from which ſo few books are totally exempt, were expunged, it might raiſe curioſity, and induce young people to examine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent copies of the ſame work, and to ſeek for other improper books themſelves; it is therefore perhaps better, when theſe books are read to a governeſs, that
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033601_0050_0FF7A1B2B4BE6D18"/>ſhe ſhould expreſs diſapprobation in a plain and quiet way, of ſuch paſſages, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to expunge them; which would give a feeling of diſlike to the pupil, and confirm her delicacy, rather than give im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity to her ideas.</p>
                     <p>Much therefore depends on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the governeſs in this reſpect, ſo long as they are under the eye of a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious monitor, no real harm could proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ariſe from their ſeeing human nature in all the claſſes of life, not only as it ſhould be, or as it may be imagined to be, but as it really exiſts, ſince without compariſon there can be no judgment, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no real knowledge.</p>
                     <p>It muſt nevertheleſs be obſerved, that the exceſſive ſtudy of novels is univerſally an ill employment at any time of life; not only becauſe ſuch readers are liable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a romantic taſte; and to return from the flowery ſcenes of fiction to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033601_0051_0FF7A1B7552ADA90"/>duties of life with a degree of regret; but becauſe the high-wrought ſcenes of elegant diſtreſs diſplayed in novels have been found to blunt the feelings of ſuch readers towards real objects of miſery; which awaken only diſguſt in their minds inſtead of ſentiments of pity or benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The works of the poets, as well as thoſe of the writers of novels, require to be ſelected with great caution. The ſame may be ſaid of painting, ſculpture, and muſic; which by delighting the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion influence the judgment, and may thence be employed either to good or bad purpoſes: But as poetry, when thus ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like painting, ſculpture, and muſic, its rival ſiſters, is an object of refined taſte, and affords an elegant amuſement at leaſt, it ſo far belongs to the education of young ladies.</p>
                     <p>Gay's fables, Thomſon's ſeaſons, Giſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne's walk in a foreſt, are proper for the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033601_0052_0FF7A1B8E6CC9A18"/>younger claſſes of pupils; afterwards Pope's Ethic epiſtles, and eſſay on man, Gold-ſmith's poems, Akinſide, Maſon, Gray, and others, which are enumerated in the catalogue. I forbear to mention the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanic garden; as ſome ladies have intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that the Loves of the plants are deſcribed in too glowing colours; but as the deſcriptions are in general of female forms in graceful attitudes, the objection is leſs forcible in reſpect to female readers. And beſides the celebrated poets of our own country, as Milton and Shakeſpeare, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations from the antients, as from Homer and Virgil; and from the more modern poems of Taſſo, and Camoens, may be read with pleaſure and improvement, tho' ſome objectionable paſſages may perhaps be found in all of them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. For the purpoſe of forming a ſtyle in writing, a few well-choſen books ſhould be read often over; till the ear acquires, as it were, the muſick of the ſentences;
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033601_0053_0FF7A1BA89CB1098"/>and the imagination is thus enabled to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py it in our own compoſitions; ſuch as thoſe papers of the Spectator, which are aſcribed to Addiſon, and are terminated with a capital letter of the word Clio; or ſome of Lady Wortley Montague's letters from Turkey; or other works of chaſte, diſtinct, and expreſſive ſtyle, not overload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with metaphors, which with ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ornament injure perſpicuity.</p>
                     <p>But for other purpoſes of education it is perhaps better to teach young people ſelect parts of many books, than a few en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ones; not only becauſe the pupils will thus be acquainted with more authors in faſhionable literature; but becauſe the buſineſs of polite education is to give the outlines of many ſpecies of erudition, or branches of knowledge; which the young ladies may cultivate further at their future leiſure without the aſſiſtance of a teacher, as may beſt ſuit their taſtes or their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:033601_0054_0FF7A1BD152ED618"/>
I cannot conclude this ſection on po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite learning without mentioning, that ſome illiterate men have condemned the cultivation of the minds of the female ſex, and have called ſuch in ridicule learned ladies; as if it was a reproach to render themſelves agreeable and uſeful. Where affectation is joined with learning, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes pedantry, but this belongs oftener to the ignorant than to the cultivated; as is ſo well elucidated in "Letters to literary ladies," a ſmall duodecimo publiſhed by Johnſon, and written by one of the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious family of E—in Ireland.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. An outline of Botany may be learnt from Lee's introduction to botany, and

And laſtly I ſhall not forbear to mention, that the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical part of botany may be agreeably learnt from the notes to the ſecond volume of the Botanic garden, whether the poetry be read or not.</p>

The acquirement of Chemiſtry ſhould be preceded by a ſketch of Mineralogy; which is not only an intereſting branch of ſcience, as it teaches the knowledge of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and precious ſtones, and of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mines of metals, coals, and ſalt; but becauſe it explains alſo the difference of ſoils, and is thus concerned in the theory and practice of agriculture: But there is at preſent no proper introductory book, that I know of, on this ſubject for the uſe of children; as Cronſtedt's and Bergman's, and Kirwan's mineralogy are too exact and prolix; nor could be well underſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſmall collection of foſſils.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. An outline of the ſciences, to which Mathematics have generally been applied, as of aſtronomy, mechanics, hydroſtatics, and optics, with the curious addition of electricity and magnetiſm, may beſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by attending the lectures in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental philoſophy, which are occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exhibited by itinerant philoſophers;
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033601_0058_0FF7A1C5386EEA28"/>and which have almoſt excluſively acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the name of natural philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>The books in common uſe for teaching theſe ſciences are too difficult and abſtruſe for the ſtudy of young perſons. Some parts of natural philoſophy are rendered not unentertaining in the notes of the firſt volume of the Botanic garden, as the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of meteors, and of winds; and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſtrata of the earth; which nevertheleſs require too much attention for very young ladies; but may be read with pleaſure after leaving ſchool by thoſe, who poſſeſs inquiring minds. It is to be wiſhed that ſome writer of juvenile books would endeavour eaſily to explain the ſtructure and uſe of the barometer, and thermometer, and of clocks and watches, which ſupply a part of the furniture of our houſes, and of our pockets.</p>

Of theſe are the cotton works on the river Derwent in Derbyſhire; the potteries in Staffordſhire; the iron-founderies of Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke Dale in Shropſhire; the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of Birmingham, Mancheſter, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham; but theſe are not in the province of a boarding ſchool, but might be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly exhibited to young ladies by their parents in the ſummer vacations.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In this ſection of arts and ſciences it may be proper to mention the art of producing a technical memory invented by Mr. Gray; which may be readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by conſulting his book, and may perhaps be of advantage in remembering dates or numbers; as they are expreſſed
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033601_0060_0FF7A1CB2658BDF0"/>by letters, and formed into words. This work I attended to in my youth, but found it an amuſing trick, rather than an uſeful art.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The art of writing Short-hand, which is ſaid to be of Engliſh invention, ſhould alſo be mentioned in this place. The book I learned this art from was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Gurney, and ſaid to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement on Maſon; other treatiſes of ſhort-hand I have alſo examined, but found them all nearly of equal excellence. I can only add, that many volumes, which I wrote from medical lectures, I now find difficult to decypher; and that as the words in ſhort-hand are ſpelt from their ſound only; thoſe ſcholars, who practiſe this art early in life, are liable not afterwards to ſpell our language correctly; and laſtly, that I believe, this art is ſtill capable of improvement by firſt forming a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate alphabet, than that in common uſe among all European nations.</p>

7. This ſection on arts and ſciences may perhaps be thought to include more branches of them, than is neceſſary for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male erudition. But as in male education the tedicus acquirement of antient lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages for the purpoſe of ſtudying poetry and oratory is gradually giving way to the more uſeful cultivation of modern ſciences, it may be of advantage to ladies of the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generation to acquire an outline of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar knowledge; as they are in future life to become companions; and one of the greateſt pleaſures received in converſation conſiſts in being reciprocally well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Botany is already a faſhionable ſtudy for ladies; and chemiſtry is ingeniouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to them in the Letters to lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ladies.</p>

                     <p>THE criterion of moral duties has been variouſly delivered by different wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Expediency, by which is meant whatever increaſes the ſum of public hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, is by ſome called the criterion of virtue; and whatever diminiſhes that ſum is termed vice.

                     <head>SECTION XVII. COMPASSION.</head>
                     <p>A SYMPATHY with the pains and pleaſures of others is the foundation of all our ſocial virtues. "DO AS YOU WOULD BE DONE BY," is a precept which deſcended from heaven. Whoever feels pain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he ſees others affected with it, will not only never be liable to give pain, but will always be inclined to relieve it. The lady, who poſſeſſes this chriſtian vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of compaſſion, cannot but be a good daughter, a good wife, and a good mother, that is, an amiable character in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of life.</p>
                     <p>The manner of communicating this benevolent ſympathy to children conſiſts in expreſſing our own ſympathy, when any thing cruel preſents itſelf; as in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of an inſect; or when actions of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033601_0065_0FF7A1D5E3D03680"/>cruelty are related in books or in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I once obſerved a lady with appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent expreſſions of ſympathy ſay to her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle daughter, who was pulling off the legs of a fly, <q>how ſhould you like to have your arms and legs pulled off? would it not give you great pain? pray let it fly away out of the window:</q> which I doubt not would make an indelible impreſſion on the child, and lay the foundation of an amiable character.</p>
                     <p>This virtue of compaſſion is a certain foundation of benevolence; and on that account renders children good to their own parents in the latter part of their lives, as well as to all other people; an important circumſtance to the happineſs of our latter years! Where cruelty or malevolence reſides in the breaſt, it is generally exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt by the child upon the aged parent, with whom in civilized ſociety he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſides; and who often lives ſo long as to ſtand in his way to the poſſeſſion of a wiſhed-for inheritance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="unknown:033601_0066_0FF7A1D773611F38"/>
This compaſſion, or ſympathy with the pains of others, ought alſo to extend to the brute creation, as far as our neceſſities will admit; for we cannot exiſt long without the deſtruction of other animal or vegetable beings either in their nature or embryon ſtate. Such is the condition of mortality, that the firſt law of nature is "eat, or be eaten." Hence for the preſervation of our exiſtence we may be ſuppoſed to have a natural right to kill thoſe brute creatures, which we want to eat, or which want to eat us; but to deſtroy even inſects wantonly ſhews an unreflecting mind, or a depraved heart.</p>
                     <p>A young gentleman once aſſured me, that he had lately fallen in love with a young lady; but, on their walking out one evening in ſummer, ſhe took two or three ſteps out of her way on the gravel walk to tread upon an inſect; and that afterwards whenever the idea of her came into his mind, it was attended with this picture of
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033601_0067_0FF7A1DB1B04CF20"/>active cruelty; till that of the lady ceaſed to be agreeable, and he relinquiſhed his deſign of courtſhip.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs this ſympathy, however amiable and neceſſary, may be carried to an extreme, ſo as to render miſerable the perſon, who poſſeſſes it; ſince many piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able objects muſt be ſeen in our journey through life, which we have not power to relieve. This then furniſhes us with a barrier or line, where to ſtop; that is, we ſhould endeavour to render our little pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils alive to ſympathize with all remedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evils; and at the ſame time to arm them with fortitude to bear the ſight of ſuch irremediable evils, as the accidents of life muſt frequently preſent before their eyes.</p>
                     <p>There ſhould alſo be a plan in ſchools to promote the habit as well as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of benevolence; each young lady might occaſionally contribute a ſmall ſum
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033601_0068_0FF7A1DDAAD59768"/>on ſeeing a needy naked child to purchaſe flannel or coarſe linen for clothes, which they might learn to cut out, and to make up themſelves; and thus the practice of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry might be united with that of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
                     <p>Another ſtill more practical mode of producing a habit of benevolence in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might be by inducing them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſome leiſure hours in little works of taſte, as in making artificial flowers, purſes, fringes, and beſtowing theſe on poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in order that they might ſell them for their ſupport. Miſs Hartley at Bath, the daughter of the great medical philoſopher of that name, has lately exhibited an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of this kind of philanthropy; ſhe has been long diſtinguiſhed by her ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents as an artiſt in painting; and has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtributed her elegant performances among the poor famiſhed emigrants, who reſide in her neighbourhood; who are thus greatly aſſiſted by the ſale of her works.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="unknown:033601_0069_0FF7A1DF436439A0"/>
Another channel, in which this ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy ſhould be taught to flow, is in the obſervance of thoſe attentions, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually diffuſe happineſs by promoting by courteſy of behaviour the cheerfulneſs, or forwarding by ready aſſiſtance the intereſts of thoſe, whether equals, inferiors, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors; with whom every one happens to aſſociate or reſide: which conſtitutes the eſſential part of what is termed politeneſs of manners; and univerſally indicates a benevolent diſpoſition.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XVIII. VERACITY.</head>
                     <p>FOR the purpoſe of inculcating a love of truth early in life the love of praiſe ſupplies the moſt certain means. This kind of honour has an honeſt pride for it's baſis: a ſtory is related in one of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern volumes of the univerſal hiſtory of an inhabitant of Conſtantinople, who was brought to the ſcaffold for denying the divine miſſion of Mahomet; and on hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pardon offered him, if he would then declare his error, anſwered, that he would not ſpeak an untruth to ſave his life. And, I think, it is recorded, that one of the fathers of the church uſed to affirm, that he would not tell a lie, were he ſure to gain heaven by it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="unknown:033601_0071_0FF7A1E586BE3628"/>
I once heard an ingenious lady ſay to a company of her friends, that her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a young girl, who ſtood by with a countenance fluſhed with pleaſure, never told her a lie in her life: This happy uſe of flattery was likely to produce a love for veracity, which would never be deſtroyed by intereſted motives.</p>
                     <p>The diſgrace of telling a lie ſhould be painted in vivid colours, as totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the character of a lady or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, rendering them contemptible in the eyes of the world: And the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of this deteſtable habit of lying ſhould be explained from its preventing their being believed, when they wiſh it; as is exemplified in the fable of the ſhepherd-boy; who called out "the wolf, the wolf," ſo often to alarm his neighbours, and thus to amuſe himſelf, when no wolf was near; that when the real wolf attacked his flock, he could by no vociferation prevail on any
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:033601_0072_0FF7A1E714D24AB0"/>one to come to his aſſiſtance: Or like the village-drunkard, who frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed himſelf with crying out "fire," along the ſtreets on his return from the ale-houſe in the night, to the great alarm of the neighbourhood; till at length, when his cottage was really in flames, his diſtreſs was not believed, and he could gain no aſſiſtance to extinguiſh them.</p>
                     <p>This ſincerity of character ſhould be confirmed by the example of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who ſhould themſelves pay the moſt exact and ſcrupulous attention to truth; they ſhould not exaggerate trifling errors into reprehenſible faults; and, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof is neceſſary, ſhould give it with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſhould not only punctually ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil their own promiſes, tho' to their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, but exact the ſame from their pupils in return.</p>
                     <p>To theſe ſhould be added the precepts of religion, as ſoon as their minds are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:033601_0073_0FF7A1E8F09783A0"/>of receiving them, which uniformly inculcate truth and probity in all our words and actions.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XIX. PRUDENCE, JUSTICE, CHASTITY.</head>
                     <p>THE impreſſions on the mind made by recent examples placed, as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes have ſo much more durable effects, than the more abſtracted ideas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in ſyſtems of moral philoſophy; that I believe the moſt efficacious method of inculcating the virtue of prudence in reſpect to their own conduct is by telling young people the ill conſequences, which have lately happened to others; whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or names they are acquainted with: ſo that a repetition of the ſlander of a town, which always degrades the retailers, has ſometimes its advantage as a leſſon to the hearers.</p>
                     <p>There is another kind of prudence, which it is neceſſary to acquire in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033601_0075_0FF7A1EECDAAB010"/>which arms the poſſeſſor againſt the ill deſigns of others; hence they ſhould be taught to beware of flatterers, gameſters, drunkards, and of all ill-tempered perſons. As this prudence is to be acquired by the knowledge of mankind, ſuch books as the maxims of Rochfoucault, and others, might be recommended; but they give too gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my a picture of human nature to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of young ladies.</p>
                     <p>"Know yourſelf" is a celebrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and may conſtitute one depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Prudence, when any one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes ſome great action, or great change in the condition of life; but "know other people" is equally neceſſary in paſſing along this ſublunary world, and may be inſerted with propriety as another maxim in the code of prudence. The facility of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others in the daily intercourſe of the world is produced by the knowledge of phyſiognomy, acquired at ſchools in early life; while the paſſions continue to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033601_0076_0FF7A1F05B06F9D0"/>on the countenances of children; and which is never ſo well acquired in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate tuition; and thus conſtitutes one of the great advantages of ſchool-education.</p>
                     <p>JUSTICE and CHASTITY, which are the principal links, by which civilized ſociety is held together, are to be inculcated in young minds by ſimilar methods; that is by pointing out by examples the public puniſhment, or public diſgrace, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly accompanies the breach of either of theſe important duties: and afterwards to add the precepts of religion, when their minds are capable of perceiving their force, to co-operate with the effect of the laws of ſociety, and of the opinion of the wiſe and virtuous.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XX. FORTITUDE.</head>
                     <p>IF female children are not treated with tenderneſs by a mother in their early years of infancy, they are perhaps liable to acquire a harſhneſs of character, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent unfeelingneſs, which afterwards renders them leſs amiable; though it may give them greater fortitude; which ſhould therefore be inculcated at their rather ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer years.</p>
                     <p>Neither the robuſt aſſailing courage, which prompts to the performance of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic actions, nor the oſtentatious patience, which requires the flattery of the public eye, for its ſupport, belong to the female character. But that ſerene ſtrength of mind, which faces unavoidable danger with open eyes, prepared to counteract or
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033601_0078_0FF7A1F49561EC38"/>to bear the neceſſary evils of life, is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valuable as a male or female acquiſition. This is termed preſence of mind; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on our judgment of the real value of things; and on our application of thoſe cauſes, which contribute to turn diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances to the beſt advantage; and can therefore only be acquired by the general cultivation of good ſenſe and of knowledge.</p>
                     <p>An occaſional effuſion of tears has been thought an amiable weakneſs, and a mark of delicacy of the ſex. When tears are ſhed at the irremediable misfortunes of others, it indicates an amiable ſenſibility; but when young ladies indulge themſelves in a promptitude of diſſolving into inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant tears at every trivial diſtreſs of their own, it ſhews a kind of infantine debility of mind, and conveys an idea of their being unfit for the common duties of life; and ſhould therefore be diſcouraged by reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the kind and quantity of the evil,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:033601_0079_0FF7A1F71716E768"/>which diſturbs them; and by reciting to them the examples of fortitude exhibited by others in diſaſters much more calamit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, of which there are examples in the letters of Lady Ruſſel: And laſtly by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding them of the conſolations of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>A ſlight appearance of timidity has been eſteemed another mark of delicacy of the ſex; but timidity is the companion of debility of mind rather than of delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſhould not therefore be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. In reſpect to the expreſſions of fear the violent cries and diſtorted countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſome ladies in ſituations of danger exhibit them in no very amiable attitudes; while they increaſe the confuſion, and may be ſaid "to help the ſtorm;" but if to theſe be added an affectation of fear without cauſe; as when a young lady ſcreams through the whole gamut at the ſight of a ſpider, or a graſs-hopper; the fault becomes voluntary, and ſhould be
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:033601_0080_0FF7A1F99195C520"/>oppoſed and conquered by the ſhafts of ridicule.</p>
                     <p>Impudence in common language has been termed boldneſs; and baſhfulneſs has been aſcribed to timidity; but neither of them with ſufficient preciſion; as brave men have been known to be baſhful, and cowards impudent. Aſſurance of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ariſes from the poſſeſſor of it rather over-valuing his own abilities; and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence conſiſts in this aſſurance with a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſregard of the opinions of others; but neither of them bear any analogy to fortitude. On the other hand modeſty ariſes from the poſſeſſor of it rather under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing his own abilities; and baſhfulneſs conſiſts in this modeſty with great ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude about the opinions of others; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them are attended with perſonal fear. So charming is the appearance of this great ſenſibility by adding a bluſh to the features of beauty, that no endeavours ſhould be uſed to extinguiſh it early in
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:033601_0081_0FF7A1FB201BBDE8"/>life. Nor ſhould any means be contrived to increaſe it to exceſs, as embarraſſment both of thought and action, and even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment of ſpeech, is then liable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the great anxiety it occaſions.</p>

                     <p>INCLUDES the ſubjugation of the appetites and paſſions to reaſon and prudence; it conſiſts in our moderation in the uſe of all thoſe things, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the convenience, comfort, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of life; as of food, dreſs, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and in the reſtraining our licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſſions, as of anger, vanity, love, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. The method to inſtil this virtue is by exhibiting the various inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which attend unlimited indulgence; and thus to inculcate the golden rule of "nothing to exceſs."</p>
                     <p>The example of the governeſs will have great effect in producing many of the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:033601_0083_0FF7A2000E9421C8"/>virtues above mentioned in the minds of her pupils.

                     <p>The divine morality delivered in the new teſtament ſhould be repeatedly incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to an infant audience, who cannot ſo well underſtand the metaphyſical parts of religion, ſuch as the duty of doing to others
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:033601_0085_0FF7A20419F95678"/>as we would they ſhould do unto us: to love our neighbours as ourſelves: to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give injuries, not to revenge them: and to be kind even to our enemies. For this purpoſe the ſermons of the old Whole du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man are recommended; one of which might be read every Sunday evening.</p>
                     <p>Ladies of more mature years, or who have finiſhed their ſchool-education, may learn the neceſſity and uſefulneſs of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent religion from Baron Haller's letters to his daughter, from Lady Pennington's advice to her daughter, and laſtly from Mr. Giſborne's duties of the female ſex: and the defence of the truth of it may be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Mr. Payley's evidences of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; but perhaps it is better for them not to perplex their minds with many works of religious controverſy.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXIII. ADDRESS.</head>
                     <p>THERE is a faſcinating manner in the addreſs of ſome people, which almoſt inſtantly conciliates the good will, and even the confidence of their acquaintance. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel in his hiſtory of Caſtruccio Caſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani obſerves; that his hero could aſſume ſuch openneſs of countenance; that though he was known to be a man practiſed in every kind of fraud and treachery, yet in a few minutes he gained the confidence of all, whom he converſed with; they went away ſatisfied of his good will towards them, and were betrayed to their ruin.</p>
                     <p>This enviable addreſs, which may be uſed for good purpoſes as well as for bad ones, may be difficult to analize; but may poſſibly conſiſt ſimply in a countenance ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:033601_0087_0FF7A209368E6670"/>with pleaſure at meeting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with our acquaintance; and which diffuſes cheerfulneſs by pleaſurable conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into the boſoms of others; and thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts them in our behalf. It is not the ſmile of flattery, nor the ſmile of ſelf-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, nor the ſmile of habit, nor of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; but it is ſimply an expreſſion of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which ſeems to ariſe at the fight of our acquaintance; and which perſuades them, that they poſſeſs our love, and for which they barter their own in return.</p>
                     <p>However this conciliating manner may have been uſed, as above related, for bad pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; it probably proceeded originally from friendlineſs and openneſs of heart, with cheerful benevolence; and that in thoſe, who have in proceſs of time become bad characters, the appearance of thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues has remained, after the reality of them has vaniſhed. What then is the method, by which this inchantment of countenance can be taught? certainly by inſtilling cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:033601_0088_0FF77E8DE46759E8"/>and benevolence into the minds of young ladies early in life, and at the ſame time an animation of countenance in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them; and though this pleaſurable animation be at firſt only copied, it will in time have the appearance of being natural; and will contribute to produce by aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the very cheerfulneſs and benevolence, which it at firſt only imitated. This is a golden obſervation to thoſe, who have the care of young children.</p>
                     <p>A very accompliſhed lady, who read the manuſcript of this work, wrote the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing with her pencil on the oppoſite page; "nothing can be more juſt and intereſting than the whole of this ſection; yet however deſirable it may be to mend an unpleaſant <hi>abord,</hi> might one not ſuſpect, ſince Nature has produced a diverſity of manner, that an attempt to engraft this beautiful cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on a grave ſet of features might produce the worſt of evil affectations? A natural ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of manner, whether ſerious or gay,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:033601_0089_0FF7A20E38CF1740"/>will always pleaſe; and probably this amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble addreſs may be rendered equally conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with natural manners, whether ſerious or gay?"</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXIV. CONVERSATION.</head>
                     <p>NEXT to the winning manners above deſcribed, the art of pleaſing in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems to conſiſt in two things; one of them to hear well; and the other to ſpeak well. The perpetual appearance of attention, and the varying expreſſion of the countenance of the hearer to the ſentiments or paſſions of the ſpeaker; is a principal charm in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; to be well heard and accurately underſtood encourages our companions to proceed with pleaſure, whatever may be the topics of their diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe, who have been educated at ſchools, and have learnt the knowledge of phyſiognomy from their playfellows in their early years, underſtand the pleaſurable or painful fellings of all with whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:033601_0091_0FF7A2124EADB4A8"/>often even before their words are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and, by thus immediately conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expreſſion of their own features to the ſenſations of the ſpeaker, become the intereſting and animated companions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove deſcribed, which is ſeldom ſeen in thoſe educated in private families; and which, as before obſerved, gives a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſchool-education.</p>
                     <p>To ſpeak agreeably in reſpect to manner conſiſts in a voice clear, yet not loud, ſoft, yet not plaintive; with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct articulation, and with graceful atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes rather than with graceful actions; as almoſt every kind of geſticulation is diſagreeable. In reſpect to the matter it ſhould be ſuch as coincides with the taſtes or purſuits of thoſe, to whom the converſation is addreſſed. From hence it will appear, that both to hear well, and to ſpeak well, requires an extenſive knowledge of things, as well as of the taſtes and purſuits of mankind; and muſt
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:033601_0092_0FF7A214D2855540"/>therefore ultimately be the effect of a good education in general, rather than a particular article of it.</p>
                     <p>There are however faults to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, and cautious to be obſerved, in the converſation of young ladies; which ſhould be pointed out to them by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs of a boarding ſchool. Of theſe I ſhall mention firſt, that whenever the thirſt of ſhining in converſation ſeizes on the heart, the vanity of the ſpeaker be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes apparent; and we are diſguſted with the manner, whatever may be the matter of the diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that it is always childiſh, and generally ridiculous, when young people boaſt of their follies, or when they accuſe themſelves of virtues; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which they probably poſſeſs in the degree, which they deſcribe. A young lady was heard to ſay, "I am frightened to death at the ſight of a
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:033601_0093_0FF7A2165F9AFCF8"/>bird:" And another, that ſhe was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, as to give her money to the poor naked children, whom ſhe ſaw in the ſtreets in winter.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they ſhould be apprized, that there is danger in ſpeaking ill even of a bad perſon; both becauſe they may have been miſinformed, and becauſe they ſhould judge their neighbours with charity. A friend of mine was once aſked by a young man, how he could diſtinguiſh, whether the lady, whom he meant to addreſs, was good tempered; and gave this anſwer. "When any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious accuſation is brought in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt an abſent perſon; if ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inclines to believe the worſt ſide of the queſtion, ſhe is ill-tempered." There are ſome nice diſtinctions on this ſubject of good nature delivered in Lady Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington's advice to her daughters, which are worth a young lady's attention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:033601_0094_0FF7A218F72B36F8"/>
Fourthly, that it is dangerous for a young lady to ſpeak very highly in praiſe even of a deſerving man; for if ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols his actions, ſhe will ſeem to give her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the importance of a judge, and her determinations will ſometimes be called in queſtion; and to commend highly the perſon of a man is in general eſtimation inconſiſtent with the delicacy of the ſex at any age.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, young ladies ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed not to accuſtom themſelves to the uſe of ſtrong aſſeverations, or of a kind of petty oaths, ſuch as "upon my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour," in their converſation; nor often to appeal to others for the truth of what they affirm; ſince all ſuch ſtrong expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and appeals derogate ſomewhat from the character of the ſpeaker: as they give an intimation, that ſhe has not been uſually believed on her ſimple aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="unknown:033601_0095_0FF7A2DB8F349FB8"/>
Sixthly, laughing vehemently aloud, or tittering with ſhort ſhrieks, in which ſome young ladies, who have left ſchool, indulge themſelves at cards or other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements, are reprehenſible; as their dignity of character muſt ſuffer by appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too violently agitated at trivial circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, and uniform adherence to ſincerity in converſation is of the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; as without it our words are but empty ſounds, and can no more intereſt our companions than the tinkling of a bell. No artificial poliſh of manners can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the apparent want of this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor any acquirements of knowledge for the reality of the want of it. Hence though the exceſs of blame or praiſe of the actions of others may be imprudent or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper in the converſation of young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; as mentioned in the third and fourth articles of this ſection; yet in theſe, as in all other kinds of converſation, their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:033601_0096_0FF77EB1B561AA28"/>ſhould be given with truth, if given at all; but when the character <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> are concerned, they ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> with diffidence and modeſty.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, if at any time any improper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhould be addreſſed to young ladies, which has a tendency to indecency, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, or irreligion, they ſhould be taught to expreſs a marked diſapprobation both in words and countenance. So great is the power of the ſoſter ſex in meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the characters of men; that, if ſuch was their uniform behaviour, I doubt not, but that it would much contribute to reform the morals of the age; an event de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly to be wiſhed, and which would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much to their own happineſs.</p>
                     <p>To theſe might be added many other obſervations from the writers on female education concerning a due reſpect in converſation to ſuperiors, good temper to
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:033601_0097_0FF77EB34F954200"/>equals, and condeſcenſion to inferiors. But as young ladies are not expected to ſpeak with the wiſdom, or preciſion of philoſophers; and as the careleſs cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their converſation, with ſimplicity of manner, and with the grace, eaſe, and vivacity natural to youth, ſupplies it with its principal charms; theſe ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly encouraged, as there are few ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial accompliſhments, which could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the loſs of them.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXV. EXERCISE.</head>
                     <p>THE acquirements of literature, and of many arts, make the lives of young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple too ſedentary; which impairs their ſtrength, makes their countenances pale and bloated, and lays the foundation of many diſeaſes; hence ſome hours ſhould every day be appropriated to bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and to relaxation of mind.</p>
                     <p>Such as tend to produce activity, and to promote the growth of the perſon in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to height, are preferred in the ſchools for young ladies to thoſe, which render the ſyſtem more robuſt and muſcular.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe playing at ball, at ſhuttlecock, ſwinging as they ſit on a cord or cuſhion,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033601_0099_0FF77EC355D38640"/>and dancing, in the open air in ſummer, and within doors in winter, are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. To theſe ſome have recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an exerciſe of the arms by ſwinging lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en weights, which are called dumb bells; theſe ſhould be very light, if they be uſed at all, otherwiſe they load the ſpine of the back, and render the ſhoulders thick and muſcular, and rather impede than forward the perpendicular growth of the perſon. The ringing of a real bell hung as is done in churches, or the frequent drawing up of a weight by a cord over a pulley, with a fly-wheel to prevent its too haſty deſcent, would be an exerciſe, which might be uſed with great advantage by young people; as it both extends the ſpine, and ſtrengthens the muſcles of the cheſt and arms.</p>
                     <p>Many other kinds of exerciſe have been recommended by authors: Madame Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis adviſes weights to be carried on the head, as milk-maids carry their milk-pails;
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:033601_0100_0FF77F589DDEB2B0"/>and even to add weights to the ſoles of the ſhoes of children to ſtrengthen, as ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, the muſcles of locomotion in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or running. It is evident, that carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weights on the head muſt be injurious to young people, eſpecially when there is a tendency to ſoftneſs of the bones; as it may contribute to bend the ſpine by their preſſure, and to impede the perpendicular growth of the body; and the walking in weighted ſhoes may induce awkward geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without any adequate advantage.</p>
                     <p>There are other modes of exertion, which, though graceful in themſelves, are not allowed to ladies by the faſhion of this age and country; as ſkating on the ice in winter, ſwimming in ſummer, funambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or dancing on the ſtreight rope: but walking with a ſtately meaſured ſtep occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, like the march of ſoldiers, and reading aloud frequently rather in a thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric manner, as well as dancing and ſinging,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:033601_0101_0FF77F5B79642F38"/>will much contribute to give ſtrength and grace to the muſcles of locomotion, and of vocality.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXVI. AIR.</head>
                     <p>THE ſtrength and activity of young people not only depends on the perpetual exerciſe of their limbs, as deſcribed in the preceding ſections, but on the purity of the air, which they breathe, and even on the occaſional coldneſs of it. The cold air of winter acts on delicate people like a cold bath; as it diminiſhes the action of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutaneous veſſels for a time, and thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an accumulation of animal power, whence an increaſed action of thoſe veſſels and a conſequent warmth of the ſurface of the body ſucceeds; and by this leſs expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diture of animal power during immerſion in cold air, and its conſequent accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the perſon becomes ſtronger for a time and more animated; which is termed
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:033601_0103_0FF77F600644C450"/>in common language, "bracing the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem." Hence to ſtrengthen delicate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they ſhould be encouraged to go into the cold air of winter frequently, but ſhould not remain in it longer than a quarter or half an hour at a time. In ſummer young people can ſcarcely continue too much in the air, where they are ſhaded from the heat of the ſun.</p>
                     <p>A conſtant immerſion in pure air is now known to contribute much both to the health of the ſyſtem, and to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful colour of the complexion. And this atmoſphere ſhould undergo a perpetual change and renovation; that the vital air, which conſtitutes about one-fourth part of it, may not be too much diminiſhed by frequent reſpiration. Due attention ſhould be given to this important circumſtance both by frequently urging the young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to amuſe themſelves out of doors; and by the proper ventilation of the ſchool-room, dining-room, bed-rooms, and
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:033601_0104_0FF7A21B6ECBD008"/>their other apartments. For this purpoſe it is convenient to ſaw off about one inch from the top of every door of theſe crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rooms, and oppoſite to this aperture to nail along the top of the door a tin plate about two inches wide, riſing at an angle of about forty-five degrees; which will bend the current of air up towards the ceil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; where it will be mixed with the warm air of the room, and ſink down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſociety without the danger of giving cold to any one: And, beſides theſe door-ventilators, the upper ſaſhes of every window ſhould always be let down a few inches, when the external weather will admit of it.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to bed rooms, which have more than one bed, the doors ſhould be furniſhed with ſimilar ventilators for the due admiſſion of freſh air; and during the ſummer-months a window ſhould be kept a few inches open during the night as well as the day; the ſaſh of which ſhould have
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:033601_0105_0FF7A21E0B5C0CF0"/>a bolt or other proper faſtening for this purpoſe; nor ſhould the fire-place be ſtopt up at any ſeaſon by a chimney-board, or a bag of ſtraw; as many rooms are made to ſhut up ſo cloſe, that this is the only aperture, by which freſh air is admitted. To this ſhould be added, that the bed-curtains ſhould never be drawn cloſe round the beds; which confine the air ſpoiled by frequent reſpiration, and the perſpirable matter, like a noxious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere over the unconſcious ſleepers. At the ſame time none of the beds ſhould be placed very near either to an open win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or to an open chimney, as a partial current of air might be injurious by the coldneſs it might occaſion.</p>
                     <p>In crowded bed-rooms, where children are cloſe ſhut up for eight or nine hours every night, not only the pale bloated complexion, which is ſeen in children of crowded manufactories; but other diſeaſes are produced by the impurity of the air,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:033601_0106_0FF7A21F985D9450"/>ſuch as indigeſtion, difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſometimes convulſive fits, as mentioned in Zoonomia, vol. II. claſs. iii. 1.1.5. and laſtly putrid fevers; of which fatal inſtances frequently occur in the crowded habitations of the poor. Hence parents cannot be too careful in inſpecting the bed-rooms, and the beds of the ſchools, to which they entruſt their children; as not only their preſent comfort, but their future health, and ſometimes their lives depend on this attention; as is further explained in the ſection on rheumatiſm.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the due ventilation of rooms by a perpetual ſupply of pure air in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſomething ſhould be here ſaid about the manner of warming them in winter. As the quantity of air carried up a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is very great, owing to its being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſo much lighter than the external atmoſphere by the heat of the fire, ſtrong currents of cold air preſs into the room at every chink of the doors and windows
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:033601_0107_0FF7A22152320520"/>paſſing towards the fire; and are liable to give catarrh, rheumatiſm, kibed heels, and ſwelled fingers, to thoſe ſcholars, who are expoſed to them. To leſſen theſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of cold air ſetting in at every aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the chimney ſhould be ſo contracted over the fire-grate, as to admit no more of the warm air to go up it, than is neceſſary to carry up the ſmoke; and hence much more of the warm air near the fire-place will riſe up to the cieling; and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it becomes cooler, in the diſtant parts of the room, will form a kind of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical eddy, and warm the whole apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; adding greatly to the heat produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the radiation from the fire.</p>
                     <p>To effect this Doctor Franklin recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended an iron or tin plate to ſlide under the mantle-piece over the fire, ſo as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the aperture of the chimney to two or three inches in width, all the length over the fire-grate. And lately Count Rumford has accompliſhed the ſame purpoſe by a
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:033601_0108_0FF7A225F96004D0"/>flat ſtone about twelve inches broad, and eighteen inches high; which is reared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one end at the back of the fire-place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight inches above the grate, and leans forward towards the mantle-piece, ſo as to leave an aperture, three or four inches wide, and twelve or fourteen inches long, over the front of the fire-place. The uſe of both theſe contrivances is to contract the mouth of the chimney, and thus to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no more warm air up it, than is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to convey the ſmoke. And the ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iron plate in Franklin's plan, and the end-reared ſtone in Rumford's plan, are deſigned to be occaſionally withdrawn for the admittance of the chimney-ſweeper. Theſe are deſcribed in detail in the eſſays of Doctor Franklin, and Count Rumford; and it is believed, that one-third of the fuel may be thus ſaved, and the rooms be kept more equally warm, and more ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXVII. CARE OF THE SHAPE.</head>
                     <p>DELICATE young ladies are very liable to become awry at many board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſchools, this is occaſioned principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their being obliged too long to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an erect attitude, by ſitting on forms for many hours together. To prevent this, the ſchool-ſeats ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have backs, on which they may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally reſt themſelves; or deſks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, on which they may occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lean. This is a thing of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, than may appear to thoſe, who have not attended to it; and who wiſh their children to acquire a very erect attitude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="unknown:033601_0110_0FF7A22929F852E0"/>
When the leaſt tendency to become awry is obſerved, they ſhould be adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lie down on a bed or ſofa for an hour in the middle of the day for many months; which generally prevents the increaſe of this deformity by taking off for a time the preſſure of the head and neck and ſhoulders on the ſpine of the back; and it at the ſame time tends to make them grow taller.</p>
                     <p>Young perſons, when nicely meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are found to be half an inch higher in the morning than at night; as is well known to thoſe, who inliſt very young men for ſoldiers. This is owing to the cartilages between the bones of the back becoming compreſſed by the weight of the head and ſhoulders on them during the day. It is the ſame preſſure, which produces curvitures and diſtortions of the ſpine in growing children, where the bones are ſofter than uſual; and which may thus be relieved by an hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:033601_0111_0FF7A22BC7D09C40"/>poſture for an hour in the middle of the day, or by being frequently allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lean on a chair, or to play on a carpet on the ground.</p>
                     <p>Young ladies ſhould alſo be directed, where two ſleep in a bed, to change every night, or every week, their ſides of the bed; which will prevent their tendency to ſleep always on the ſame ſide; which is not only liable to produce crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, but alſo to occaſion diſeaſes by the internal parts being ſo long kept in uniform contact as to grow together. For the ſame reaſon they ſhould not be allowed to ſit always on the ſame ſide of the fire or window: becauſe they will then be inclined too frequently to bend towards one ſide; which in thoſe conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, where the bones are too ſoft, is liable to produce crookedneſs of the ſpine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="unknown:033601_0112_0FF7A22D563E88C8"/>
Another great cauſe of injury to the ſhape of young ladies is from the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſtays, or other tight bandages; which at the ſame time cauſe other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes by changing the form or ſituation of the internal parts. If a hard part of the ſtays, even a knot of the thread, with which they are ſewed together, is preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon one ſide more than the other; the child bends from the ſide, which is uneaſy, and thus occaſions a curviture of the ſpine. To counteract this effect ſuch ſtays, as have feweſt hard parts, and eſpecially ſuch as can be daily or week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned, are preferable to others. A wiſe faſhion of wearing no ſtiff ſtays, which adds ſo much to the beauty of young ladies, has commenced ſince the above was written; and long may it continue!</p>
                     <p>Where frequently lying down on a ſofa in the day time, and ſwinging fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:033601_0113_0FF7A230CEE9F670"/>for a ſmall time by the head, with looſe dreſs, do not relieve a beginning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion of the back, I have uſed with ſome ſucceſs a ſwing for children to ſleep in, as deſcribed in Zoonomia, vol. II. claſs. I 2.2.16. and alſo a crutch-chair, as there delineated; and where theſe do not ſeem to ſucceed, recourſe may alſo be had to Monſ. Vacher's ſpinal machine, firſt deſcribed in the memoirs of the academy of Surgery in Paris, vol. III. with a good print of it; and ſince made by Mr. Jones in London, at No. 6, North-ſtreet, Tottenham-court Road; which ſuſpends the head, and places the weight of it on the hips.</p>
                     <p>It will be from hence eaſily perceived that all other methods of confining or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the growth of young people ſhould be uſed with great ſkill, ſuch as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards, or bandages; and that their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhould not be continued too long at a time; leaſt worſe conſequences ſhould enſue, than the deformity they are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:033601_0114_0FF7A2325D6F6A68"/>to remove. Of theſe the ſtocks for the feet of children, for the purpoſe of making them turn their toes quite out, and the frame for preſſing in their knees, as they ſtand erect, at the ſame time, I ſuſpect, when carried to exceſs, to be particularly injurious, and to have cauſed an irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lameneſs of hip-joint; as explained in Zoonomia, vol. II. claſs I. 2.2.17. Theſe therefore ſhould be uſed with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per caution, ſo as to give no pain or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy feels, or not uſed at all.</p>
                     <p>To this it may be proper to add, that the ſtiff erect attitude, taught by ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern dancing maſters, does not contribute to the grace of perſon, but rather militates againſt it; as is well ſeen in one of the prints in Hogarth's analyſis of beauty; and is exemplified by the eaſy grace of ſome of the ancient ſtatues, as of the Venus de Medici, and the Antinous; and in the works of ſome modern artiſts, as in a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful print of Hebe feeding an eagle,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:033601_0115_0FF7A234E963D728"/>painted by Hamilton, and engraved by Eginton; and many of the figures of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica Kauffman. And laſtly, which is ſo eminently ſeen in many of the beauties of the preſent day, ſince they have left off the conſtraint of whale-bone ſtays, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the graceful dreſs of the ancient Grecian ſtatues.</p>
                     <p>In the tendency to curviture of the ſpine whatever ſtrengthens the general conſtitution is of ſervice, as the uſe of the cold bath in the ſummer months. This however requires ſome reſtriction both in reſpect to the degree of coldneſs of the bath, the time of continuing in it, and the ſeaſon of the year. Common ſprings, which are of 48 degrees of heat, are too cold for tender conſtitutions, whether of children or adults; and frequently do them great and irreparable injury, as I have witneſſed in three or four caſes. The coldneſs of river water in the ſummer
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:033601_0116_0FF7A237823FA730"/>months, which is about 65 degrees, or that of Matlock, which is about 68, or of Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which is 82, are much to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: The two latter are improperly called warm baths, comparing their degree of heat with that of common ſprings; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are in reality cold baths, being of much lower degree of heat than that of the human body, which is 98. The time of continuing in a cold bath ſhould be but a few minutes; certainly not ſo long as to occaſion a trembling of the limbs from cold. In reſpect to the ſeaſon of the year, delicate children ſhould certainly only uſe cold bathings in the ſummer months; as the going frequently into the cold air in winter will anſwer all the purpoſes of the cold bath.</p>
                     <p>Other means of counteracting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the ſyſtem, or ſoftneſs of bones, which occaſion crookedneſs, conſiſt in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing internally from 10 to 20 grains of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of bark, with as much ſoda phoſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:033601_0117_0FF7A239F57D11C8"/>and mixed with from five to ten drops of tincture of opium, twice a day for three or four weeks; as is further treated of in Zoonomia, vol. II. claſs I. 2.2.14. and 16.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXVIII. DRESS.</head>
                     <p>YOUNG Ladies ſhould be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhew attention to their dreſs, as it gives an idea of cleanlineſs of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; which has ſo great a charm, that it may be reckoned amongſt the inferior vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; for this purpoſe an elegant ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of dreſs is to be recommended in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that ſuperabundance of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the lady herſelf is the leaſt part of her. The form of dreſs muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs perpetually vary with the faſhion of the time; but a perſon of taſte may leſſen thoſe parts of a faſhionable dreſs, which oppoſe beauty or grace; and bring forwards thoſe, which are more coincident with them; ſo as to wear a dreſs in faſhion, and yet not devoid of taſte.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="unknown:033601_0119_0FF7A23E3604E350"/>
Thus when large hoops were in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe, which ſo totally militate with all ideas of beauty and grace; ladies of taſte wore them as ſmall, as cuſtom would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. So in reſpect to the ear-rings of the preſent day; ſince piercing the tender part of the ear for the purpoſe of ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a weight of gold, or of precious ſtones, or of glaſs beads to it, reminds us of the ſavage ſtate of mankind; thoſe ladies of taſte, who think themſelves obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with this indecorous faſhion, uſe the lighteſt materials, as a chain of ſmall pearls, to give a leſs diſtreſſing idea of the pain, they ſeem to ſuffer at every motion of their heads. Hence alſo long pendant and complicated ear-rings, however they may add to the dignity of riper years by their coſtlineſs, are unbecoming to young ladies; as they ſeem to give pain in the quicker, tho' more graceful, motions of juvenility.</p>
                     <p>Sir Joſhua Reynolds, I think, obſerves in one of his addreſſes to the academy,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:033601_0120_0FF7A241E0D3F610"/>that hard curls of hair ſtiffened with the fat of hogs, and covered with the flower of wheat, cannot be admitted into picture. The ſame may be obſerved of that coat of mail, the whale-bone ſtays, the uſe of which is now ſo happily diſcontinued. Both of theſe, however they may conceal the grey hairs and waining figures of thoſe, who are advanced in life, are highly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the flowing locks and graceful forms of young ladies.</p>
                     <p>As beauty conſiſts of lines flowing in eaſy curves according to the analyſis of Hogarth; thoſe parts of dreſs, which are compoſed of ſuch lines, are always agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Thus a ſaſh deſcending from one ſhoulder to the oppoſite hip, or a grecian veil thrown back and winding careleſsly down behind, are always beautiful; but a few white oſtrich feathers riſing on the head before, and a train of ſilk ſweeping on the ground behind, add ſo much grace to a moving female figure, as to attract all eyes with unceaſing admiration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="unknown:033601_0121_0FF7A24374114CC8"/>
In moving forwards the hair falls back, and in very ſwift motion floats upon the air behind; hence by aſſociation of ideas, when the hair is made to retire from the cheeks, it gives an intimation of the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful agility of the perſon; and when it is brought forwards over the cheeks, it may conſent with unmoving dignity, like the full wig of a judge, but diminiſhes our idea of the activity of playful youth.</p>
                     <p>Where the appearance of uſe in dreſs can be given to ornaments, it ſuggeſts an excuſe for wearing them, and is therefore to be preferred; as diamond pins, ſtrings of pearl, and a comb of ſhell, to reſtrain the exuberant hair; or knots of ribbons to fix the ſlipper on the foot, to contract the ſleeve around the arm, to unite the veſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the boſom, or to attach the cap above the forehead. And when theſe are ſimilar in colour, it gives an air of ſimplicity, and a kind of pyramidal form to the dreſs; which the painters ſo much endeavour to
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:033601_0122_0FF7A245064DA5C0"/>exhibit both in their landſcapes, and their groups of figures.</p>
                     <p>Other ornaments, which bear no analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to uſe in dreſs, ſhould be ſparingly worn; leſt they give an idea, that they were deſigned to diſplay the pride of the poſſeſſor, rather than to decorate her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Theſe are ſometimes ſeen ſo ill placed as to make deformities conſpicuous, as a number of rings on ſingers diſtorted with the gout, or ſplendid buckles on turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-in feet. Where there is no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of uſe, all ſhining ornaments ſhould be ſo diſpoſed as to direct the eye of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder to ſome beautiful feature of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who wears them; as diamond ſtars in the hair, and artificial flowers on the boſom.</p>
                     <p>Paint and perfumes are totally inadmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the dreſs of young ladies, as they give a ſuſpicion of natural defects in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to colour of the ſkin, and odour
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:033601_0123_0FF7A2469D53B890"/>of the breath. Where there exiſts but a mediocrity of beauty, and youth is in the wain, a variety of pretty or of coſtly ornaments on the dreſs, and even the whiteneſs of powder in the hair, may ſometimes mingle with our idea of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſeem to render the whole fairer, more pleaſing, or more reſpectable. But ornaments of every kind are uſeleſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to youthful beauty; they add no power to the charm, but rather diſenchant the beholder by abſtracting his attention; which dwells with undiminiſhed rapture on beauty arrayed by ſimplicity, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated without affectation. Thus the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic juno of Homer is arrayed in variety of ornament, and with ear-rings, which have three large pendant bobs to each, and commands univerſal homage. But his Queen of Beauty is dreſſed with more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple elegance, in her magic ſaſh, or ceſtus, and charms all eyes.</p>
                     <p>The attention to taſte in dreſs may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs be carried into an extreme; it
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:033601_0124_0FF7A24B2C5C79D0"/>ſhould not ſeem to be the moſt important part of the education of a young lady; or the principal object of her care; ſhe ſhould rather appear to follow than to lead the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, according to the lines of Mr. Pope.</p>
                     <p>Be not the firſt, on which the new are tried, Nor yet the laſt to lay the old aſide.</p>

                     <p>ARE generally diſtinguiſhed from exerciſe, as they relieve or exhilerate the mind. Cards may be occaſionally uſed by children in private families, without their gaming for money; and will in general fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate their acquirement of arithmetic; but cannot be allowed in ſchools, leſt the young ladies ſhould expend too much time upon them, or ſhould play for money clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinely. But the game of cheſs, from its bearing ſo great analogy to common life, is ſuppoſed much to improve the moſt uſeful powers of the mind: It has the experience of the remoteſt antiquity to recommend it, occaſions no depraved paſſions, as it is not played for money; and by the caution per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually neceſſary to watch your adverſary,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:033601_0126_0FF7A24E50B5F440"/>and the judgment required to contrive, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range, and manage your own affairs, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys and ſtrengthens every part of the underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Embroidery, drawing, muſic, as well as the exerciſes of dancing, ſwinging, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ball, and ſhuttlecock, ſhould be claſſed amongſt the amuſements of young ladies; and ſhould be reciprocally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, either in the houſe or in the open air, for the purpoſe of relieving each other; and of producing by ſuch means an uninterrupted cheerfulneſs of mind; which is the principal charm, that fits us for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and the great ſource of earthly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXX. PUNISHMENTS. REWARDS. MOTIVES.</head>
                     <p>IT is the cuſtom of many ſchools to uſe ſome kinds of puniſhments, which either give pain or diſgrace to the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, as a fool's cap, or a meal of water gruel. The uſe of theſe are ſeldom if ever neceſſary in ſchools for young ladies, and are always attended with diſagreeable conſequences, as they either diminiſh the character of honour in the puniſhed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſink their ſpirits, or render them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to the opinions of others; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure their health: Inſomuch that at ſome ſchools all that can be acquired can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compenſate the loſs of cheerfulneſs, and degradation of mind, or bad health, which their puniſhments produce.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="unknown:033601_0128_0FF7A253C5AE1618"/>
Thus the ſitting in the public ſchool for an hour in a cap with bells diminiſhes the ſenſibility of a child to the opinions of her companions, and thus gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys one of the greateſt motives to good actions, and of the greateſt reſtraints from bad ones. For the ſame reaſon repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and even admonitions ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways applied in private, but applauſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in public.</p>
                     <p>A meal of water gruel, given as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inſtead of a meal of animal food, ſo frequently had recourſe to in ſome boarding ſchools, I believe to have laid the foundation of incurable debility. The diſeaſes of debility, as ſcrophula, bronch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocele, ſoftneſs of bones, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſtortion of them, are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among the children of the poor in Derby, which on examination, I believe to be owing to their food conſiſting chiefly of gruel; or ſometimes with milk, which has been twice ſkimmed, ſo that it is total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:033601_0129_0FF7A2565E86F4E8"/>deprived of its moſt nouriſhing part; at other times with weak ſalt broth, but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with ſolid animal food. When broth is weak in reſpect to the quantity of fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat boiled in it, it is the cuſtom of cooks to add much ſalt to it to increaſe the reliſh, which renders it ſtill more injurious to weak children; as ſalt contains no nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and by its ſtimulus increaſes the action of the ſyſtem; and by promoting great inſenſible or ſenſible perſpiration di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes the ſtrength of the child more, than the ſmall quantity of meat diſſolved in the broth can counterbalance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How then are refractory children to be governed? certainly by the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the mind of the teacher over that of the pupil. When a famous lady in Italy was put to the torture, and queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what ſorcery ſhe had governed a princeſs of the family of Medici; ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered "by no ſorcery, but by that power, which ſuperior minds poſſeſs over inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ones."</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="129" facs="unknown:033601_0130_0FF7A258401A0FE0"/>
3. Beſides the two circumſtances, which ſo much govern the great world, I mean hope of reward and fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in the microſcoſm of a boarding ſchool blame and praiſe, if given very ſparingly, will be found ſtrong motives to the little pupils to perform their taſks well, and of more efficacy ten times, than the meal of water gruel, or the diſgrace of a cap and bells. Eſteem and diſgrace are obſerved by Mr. Locke to be of all others the moſt powerful incentives to the mind, when once it is brought to regard them: And if once you can communicate to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren a love of credit, and an apprehenſion of ſhame, you have inſtilled into them a principle, which will conſtantly act, and incline them to do right, tho' it is not the true ſource from whence our actions ought to ſpring; which ſhould be from our duty to others and to ourſeives.—See Eſſay on education, ſect. 56, &amp;c. where are many other valuable obſervations on this ſubject.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="130" facs="unknown:033601_0131_0FF7A25AEFA4D6A0"/>
4. Emulation at ſeeing others excel, if properly managed is another incitement to induſtry. But as this is liable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into envy, it ſhould rather be left to its own operation, than be promoted by pointing out the examples, which ſhould be copied. It is better to ſay, "your taſk is not done to day ſo well as you ſometimes do it," than to ſay, "your taſk is not done ſo well as your ſiſter's." Since in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe envy, and its conſequence hatred, may ſucceed; a thing of tenfold worſe conſequence than the neglect of a thouſand taſks.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Tho' ſome degree of flattery may be uſed with ſucceſs in teaching veracity to very young children, as mentioned in ſect. 18. of this work, yet I think it ſhould be uſed very rarely indeed, and only on very important occaſions, leſt it ſhould become a neceſſary motive of action, inſtead of moral duty; as obſerved in Zoonomia, vol. II. claſs iii. 2.1.8. "The debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:033601_0132_0FF7A25DB76BB6B0"/>of the exertion of voluntary efforts prevents the accompliſhment of all the great purpoſes of life. This often origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates from a miſtaken education; in which pleaſure or vanity is made the immediate motive of action, and not fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture advantage, or what is termed duty.

Rewards have been given to children to excite their induſtry in the performance of particular taſks; theſe are certainly leſs eligible motives to action than the fear of diſgrace, the love of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and above all the obligations of duty. Where nevertheleſs theſe are thought proper, the kind of rewards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome attention; which ſhould conſiſt of books, or maps, or boxes of colours, or needle caſes: but not of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or of trinkets for ornamental dreſs, or of a glaſs of wine. Where money is given as a reward for induſtry in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it may ſeem to them to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motive of their actions inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation or of duty; and may thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:033601_0134_0FF7A2620156E928"/>the vice of avarice or of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. Where a fine cap or gown is given as a reward of diligence, the pride of dreſs may be produced, and become their great motive of action, inſtead of the love of reputation, or of duty. And laſtly, where a glaſs of wine is given as a reward for induſtry, a child is taught to believe wine to be a moſt valuable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, and a perpetual deſire of it even to intoxication may be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. I remember a wealthy farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who had two drunken ſons, tho' he was a ſober man himſelf, who told me, that he aſcribed this great misfortune to his having occaſionally given them in their early life a cup of ale as a reward for their exertious.—See Locke on edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſect. 52, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A very accurate obſerver, who has long had the conduct of ſchools of various kinds for the inſtruction of the youth of both ſexes, acquaints me, "That

The ſame obſervation has been made by others, but he adds, "That this might probably ariſe from ſome trivial circumſtance, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the inclination of the fortunate ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and that it is poſſible, that the means may ſometime be diſcovered of governing theſe incidents, and thus producing a new era in the art of education!"</p>
                     <p>Similar to this it has often been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the firſt impreſſions made on our infant minds by accidental diſguſt, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or flattery, are the frequent cauſes of our antipathies or averſions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue through life to bias our affections or miſlead our judgments. One of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance can trace the origin of many of his own energies of action from ſome

                     <p>LISPING is a defect of pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion occaſioned by children's making uſe of the ſound of the letter TH ſibilant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the letter S; as inſtead of "is it ſo," they ſay "ith it tho." To break this habit they muſt be taught to pronounce the S, by putting the point of the tongue againſt the roots of the upper teeth; and not to put it between their teeth as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the TH. This is eaſily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by putting their own finger againſt the point of the tongue, as it comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their teeth, in attempting to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the letter S, and puſhing it back into the mouth.</p>
                     <p>I once ſaw a young lady, who after ſhe had left ſchool, had the habit of uſing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:033601_0138_0FF7A26B67227A78"/>tho' not conſtantly, the gutteral CH inſtead of the letter S, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly diſagreeable to Engliſh ears. She corrected this ill habit by being taught, as above, how to place the tongue in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the S, but not without many trials and much attention for ſome weeks; as great efforts and pertinacious induſtry are required to break any habit, which has been long eſiabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Many children from the difficulty of ſpeaking it are liable to a defective pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the letter R; this in indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt general in ſome parts of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and is ſaid to be a ſound unknown in China; which obliged the catholic miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries ſent thither by Louis the 14th to change the name of the virgin Mary, from Maria into Malia, or from Mary into Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In ſpeaking the letter R the middle of the tongue is made to vibrate with ſemivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal air; whereas in pronouncing L, the edges of the tongue only vibrate; the
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:033601_0139_0FF7A26DDF1C3008"/>Northumberland vernacular R is formed with ſibilant air inſtead of ſemivocal air, or differs from the true R, as S differs from Z. Both which ſhould be explained to thoſe children, who have this imperfect pronunciation.</p>
                     <p>Among the lower orders of the people of London, who are called Cockneys, the letter W is pronounced ſibilant like the German W, and not ſemivocal like our vernacular one; this ſeems to reſemble the ſound of V to inattentive ears; and theſe Cockneys, are thence ſuppoſed to uſe V inſtead of W, as Vomen and Vine, inſtead of Women and Wine. This defect is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conquered by teaching ſuch children to give more vocal ſound to their W, by ſounding it at firſt like OO.</p>

                     <p>THIS impediment of ſpeech has ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally for its remote cauſe a too great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, or baſhfulneſs, joined with an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of ſhining in converſation; and for its immediate cauſe an interruption of the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the initial letter of a word with the remainder of it. Which aſſociation is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered by the ill-introduced ſenſation of awe, baſhfulneſs, deſire of ſhining, or fear of not ſucceeding; and then violent vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary efforts are in vain employed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the broken aſſociation, and give riſe to various diſtortions of countenance, as explained in Zoonomia, vol. II. claſs iv. 2.3.1.</p>
                     <p>That this impediment of pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is altogether a diſeaſe of the mind, and
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:033601_0141_0FF7A273280890D0"/>not of the organs of ſpeech, is ſhewn by the ſtammerer being able to ſpeak all words with perfect facility, when alone, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating a play; but begins to heſitate, if any one approaches; or even if he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, that he is liſtened to. Thoſe words alſo are moſt difficult to him to pronounce, which he is conſcious, he cannot change for others, as when he is aſked his own name, or the names of other perſons, or of places; and the more ſo if he is aware, that the hearer is impatient to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that he cannot conjecture the name, before it is ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>It requires great attention, and much time to overcome this bad habit; they ſhould be daily exerciſed in ſpeaking ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle words as in ſpelling; and when they heſitate or find difficulty in announcing the beginning of a word, they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it frequently aloud without the initial letter, and at length repeat it with the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial letter in a ſoſter tone.</p>
                     <p>

Suppoſe the ſtammerer finds difficulty in ſpeaking the word "Paper," and ſays p, p, p, p, repeatedly, but cannot join the a after it. He muſt be taught to pronounce aper, aper, aper, without the initial p, for many ſucceſſive times; and this aper ſhould be ſpoken aloud with more breath than common, as if an h preceded it; and at length he ſhould add in a ſofter tone the letter p to it.</p>
                     <p>This, together with an hourly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpeaking and reading ſlowly, and practiſing in this manner every word, which is not readily ſpoken, both in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and in company, I am informed is the principle, on which thoſe maſters cure this impediment, who make it a profeſſion; and to this ſhould be added a frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the ſociety of ſtrangers, in order to acquire leſs agitation or anxiety about the opinions of others.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXXIII. SQUINTING.</head>
                     <p>THIS defect of viſion, which is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrabiſmns, may frequently be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered in children, if it be attended to early, before it has been long eſtabliſhed by habit. In this deformity it generally happens, that one eye is better than the other, which induces the child to view ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with the beſt eye, and to hide the center of the noſe. This greater irritabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of one eye is often occaſioned, I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, in infancy, by tying a bandage for too long a time over an eye, which has happened to be ſlightly inflamed, and thus decreaſing its power of action by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſe; in the ſame manner the large muſcles of the body become weakened by long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action; and the right arm is generally
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:033601_0144_0FF7A27AF0126580"/>ſtronger than the left from its having been more frequently exerciſed.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe if the beſt eye be for an hour or two, or longer, covered every day with gauze ſtretched upon a circular piece of whale-bone, ſo as to render the viſion of this eye as indiſtinct as that of the other, the child will naturally turn them both to the ſame object, and in a little time the weak eye will become ſtronger by being uſed, or the ſtrong one weaker by disuſe, and the child will ceaſe to ſquint.</p>
                     <p>Another kind of ſquinting is owing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to a bad habit, and conſiſts in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at objects with one eye only at a time. The owl bends both his eyes upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which he obſerves; and by thus perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually turning his head to the thing he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, appears to have greater attention to it; and has thence acquired the name of the bird of wiſdom. All other birds, I believe, look at objects with one eye only, but it is
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:033601_0145_0FF7A27C8207C680"/>with the eye neareſt the object attended to; whereas in this kind of ſtrabiſmns the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon attends to objects with the moſt diſtant eye only. This habit has probably been produced, by a cap worn in infancy, which projected forward beyond the head on each ſide, like the bluffs of a coach-horſe, ſo as to make it eaſier for the child, as he lay in his cradle, to view oblique objects with the eye moſt diſtant from them; which kind of cap is therefore to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>A curious caſe of this ill habit of viſion is related in the Philoſ. Tranſact. vol. 68. by Dr. Darwin; which was relieved by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a parchment gnomon on the noſe of the little boy, which projected about an inch from the ridge of it, and cauſed him for a time to view oblique objects with that eye, which was neareſt them.</p>

                     <p>BY confinement in a ſchool-room for many ſucceſſive hours, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſuffered to vary their poſture, ſome of the more active and lively chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are liable to gain tricks of involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary actions, as twitchings of the face, reſtleſs geſticulations of the limbs, biting their nails, &amp;c. which are generally at firſt occaſioned by the want of ſufficient bodily exerciſe to expend the ſuperfluous animal power, like the jumping of a ſquirrel in a cage; but are alſo liable to be caught by imitation of each other.</p>

                     <p>AND kibed heels, are inflammations liable to affect tender children in many ſchools during the winter months. The latter of theſe complaints is generally ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the coldneſs of a brick or plaſter floor to their feet, or to their ſitting in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed ſhoes and ſtockings, after walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the wet; and the former to their being kept too long from the fire in the cold parts of the ſchool-room without gloves.</p>
                     <p>Nothing prevents or cures theſe mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies but a due attention to keep the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of delicate children warm, either by clothing, exerciſe, or fire. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the heels or toes may be
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:033601_0149_0FF7A28608513A08"/>ſometimes removed by covering them with a double linen rag moiſtened in a ſatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine ſolution made by diſſolving half an ounce of ſugar of lead in half a pint of water, to be renewed morning and night. As the ſwelling of the fingers thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced is liable to continue, and to injure the ſhape of them, it becomes of greater importance; but may in ſome meaſure be afterwards diminiſhed or removed by the frequent application of vitriolic Ether to them.</p>
                     <p>The ſkin of the lips, and of the hands and arms of children is liable to become inflamed, and chopped, or rough, in froſty weather, owing both to the coldneſs and dryneſs of the air. The former is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the application of a lip-ſalve made by mixing minium or red lead with ſpermaceti and oil to a proper conſiſtance; or by blue mercurial ointment. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by wearing leathern gloves, the inſide of which is ſmeared with ſpermaceti ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:033601_0150_0FF7A287985A9E80"/>with a little oil, or with pomatum; gloves thus prepared prevent too great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation from the ſkin in froſty air, and the conſequent too great dryneſs and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</p>

                     <p>THE rheumatiſm, and other inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diſeaſes, are frequently occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned in crowded ſchools by placing ſome of the beds with one ſide againſt a wall; where the weaker child confined by a ſtronger bedfellow is liable to lie for hours together with ſome part of it in contact with the cold wall; which in the winter months has often been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with fatal conſequences; and eſpecially in thoſe boarding ſchools, where the beds are ſmall, and but one blanket allowed to each of them, and a ſcanty feather-bed.</p>
                     <p>We are indued with a very accurate ſenſe to diſtinguiſh heat and cold, which
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:033601_0152_0FF7A28DD82E4AD8"/>ſhould be nicely attended to; as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of both of them are injurious to health, and more ſo in our ſleeping than in our waking hours. The extreme of heat is not much experienced in this climate, except when it is artificially produced; but that of cold is the cauſe of numerous diſeaſes of the moſt fatal tendency. A ſevere continued froſt may may be borne by the ſtrong, who can keep themſelves warm by their activity, but is deſtructive to the weak and ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. In the year 1795 the weather in January, and in one week of February was uncommonly ſevere; the ſame five weeks in January and February 1796 were uncommonly mild; and it appears by the bills of mortality in London, that 2823 people died in theſe five weeks of froſt in 1795; and that only 1471 died in the ſame five weeks of mild weather in 1796, which is not much more than half the number.—See a paper by Dr. Heberden in Philoſ. Tranſact. for the year 1796.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="unknown:033601_0153_0FF7A28F65E821D0"/>
Some miſinformed parents have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that a hard bed contributes to harden their children in reſpect to their bearing cold, and have on that account laid them on ſtraw-mattreſſes, or on beds with boarded bottoms. The only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between lying on a ſoft or hard bed conſiſts in this; the weight of the body in the former caſe preſſes on a larger ſurface, and in the latter on a leſs; neither of which has any reference to the habits of tenderneſs or hardineſs in reſpect to cold and heat; unleſs indeed a feather-bed is ſo ſoft, that, as the child ſinks down in the middle of it, the riſing edges bend over him, and in part cover him. Perhaps beds made of ſoft leather properly prepared, and inflated with air, as the Emperor of Germany was ſaid to uſe in camp, might be preferable on this account to feather-beds.</p>
                     <p>The beds for young children cannot therefore be too ſoft, however they may
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:033601_0154_0FF7A290F5DABA58"/>contribute to the indolence of grown people provided they do not keep them too warm by bending over them as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove deſcribed. But the too great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of beds is, I believe, frequently inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the ſhape of infants by occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to reſt on too few parts at a time; which hardens thoſe parts by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and prevents their proportionate growth. It alſo occaſions their ſleep to be leſs ſound by the uneaſineſs it cauſes, and in conſequence leſs refreſhing.</p>
                     <p>The feet and knees and hands of weaker children are liable to become cold in bed in winter, on which account it is more ſalutary for them to ſleep with a bed-fellow, rather than alone; as they then naturally put their cold knees or hands to their companion in bed, and thus frequently prevent rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, and other inflammatory diſeaſes of fatal event. For the ſame reaſon it is better for a new born infant to ſleep
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:033601_0155_0FF7A292969C0660"/>with its mother in winter, or with a young nurſe, than in a ſolitary crib by her bed-ſide; unleſs the artificial warmth of the room be more nicely graduated, than is commonly done.</p>
                     <p>For the ſame reaſon, where children are too feeble from illneſs, a fire ſhould be allowed in their bed-chamber in cold weather; as the cold air is otherwiſe injurious to their lungs, which cannot be clothed ſo as to prevent the contact of of the air, like the other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; a fire contributes alſo to ventilate a room, and to circulate the air in it, and thence to render it more ſalutary; but it ſhould not warm it to more than 60 or 65 degrees, that its temperature may not differ too much from that of the external atmoſphere; as thoſe, who are kept generally too warm, are liable to take cold, at every blaſt of air, not from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The univerſal analogy derived from other animals, which produce a feeble offspring, evinces the truth of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, both in reſpect to the ſoftneſs, and the due degree of warmth of their beds: Birds line the neſts for their young with feathers; the eider duck, and the rabbit, pluck the down from their own breaſts to increaſe the ſoftneſs of the beds for their tender offspring; and brood them with their wings, or claſp them to their boſoms for the ſake of warmth.</p>

                     <p>MILK is the food deſigned by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for young animals, and ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them in its recent ſtate. As the cream is the moſt nouriſhing part of the milk, and is eaſier of digeſtion than the coagulable or cheeſy part; and as milk conſtitutes a principal portion of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of children; to take off the cream once, or even twice, as is practiſed in ſome boarding ſchools, before it is given to the children, is a ſhameful circumſtance of parſimony, and very injurious to their healths.—See ſect. xxx, on puniſhments.</p>
                     <p>Nor ſhould the milk given to children be long kept in a boiling heat; becauſe much of its fragrant oil is then evaporated,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:033601_0159_0FF7A29CF4E1E720"/>as is evident from the fine odour of the ſteam of it, when taken from the fire; and its further deterioration from long boiling is ſhewn by its then inducing conſtipation, which is contrary to its effect in its recent and natural ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs even new milk does not always agree with children, after they have paſſed the years of infancy. For milk ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the ſtomach muſt be always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly curdled or coagulated, before it can be digeſted, or converted into nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: Hence milk is always found curdled in the ſtomachs of calves, and the acid juice of their ſtomachs is uſed to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate their milk in the proceſs of cheeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making: Now the ſtomachs of young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren abound more with this acid juice than in their riper years, and when a ſufficient quantity of it is not produced for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of curdling the milk, which they drink, it is liable to diſagree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="159" facs="unknown:033601_0160_0FF7A29E889FA828"/>
To theſe few therefore, whoſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs do not eaſily digeſt the coagulable part of milk, other fluid ſood ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to breakfaſt, as gruel, or tea with cream and ſugar in it, and with bread and butter; and to ſupper, a ſlice of cold meat, or of cheeſe, or tart, or bread and butter, with ſmall beer or water for drink; but it is probable, that milk might be made to agree with all ſtomachs, if it was previous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly curdled by rennet, as I have often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended with ſucceſs to elderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; or by letting it ſtand, till it becomes ſpontaneouſly ſour like buttermilk, as is the cuſtom of the inferior people of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; except nevertheleſs where the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte of the child is owing to prejudice or caprice, which is then incurable but by time.</p>
                     <p>For dinner animal food plain dreſſed, with vegetables or bread, and pudding of wheat flour, milk, and eggs, with ſugar or butter, are more nouriſhing than vegetable
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:033601_0161_0FF7A2A2067394B0"/>ſuſtenance alone. Wheat flour contains more nutriment than that of rice, or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, or oats; as it poſſeſſes more ſtarch in proportion to its bulk, and a gluten ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to animal matter. But much ſalt or ſpice ſhould not be allowed in the diet of children, as they are certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome by inducing a weakneſs of the capillary and abſorbent ſyſtems of veſſels in conſequence of their too great ſtimulus, and contain no nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>As butter and ſugar are perhaps the moſt nutritive of animal and vegetable ſubſtances, they may be more eaſily taken to exceſs; on which account ſome miſtaken parents have totally prohibited the uſe of them; which is a great diſadvantage to weaker children, who require more nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diet in leſs bulk than ſtronger ones.</p>
                     <p>For the drink of the more robuſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren water is preferable, and for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ones, ſmall beer; but in this, as well as
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:033601_0162_0FF7A2A39827EA08"/>in the choice of ſolid food, their palates ſhould be conſulted; for the nice diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ſenſe is beſtowed on us by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to diſtinguiſh, what the ſtomach can beſt digeſt. It ſhould however be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in artificial viands the taſte cannot diſtinguiſh, what is unwholeſome; as ſugar may be mixed with arſenic. So in the drinking of fermented liquors, as ale or wine, which are chemical productions, the palate is not to be conſulted; a glaſs of mere wine ſhould never be given to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as it injures their tender ſtomachs like a glaſs of brandy or rum or gin to a grown perſon; and induces thoſe diſeaſes, which it is often erroneouſly given to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; as weakneſs of digeſtion, with the production of worms in conſequence. Wine nevertheleſs diluted with thrice its quantity of water may be allowed, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, inſtead of ſmall beer; or ale or cider diluted with thrice their quantities of water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="unknown:033601_0163_0FF7A2A53503DE70"/>
Ripe fruits, or fruit pies, are peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable to the conſtitutions of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as well as agreeable to their palates; as they are known to prevent biliary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, and conſequent jaundice; and on the ſame account to render the ſkin clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and fairer, as well as to counteract the tendency to putrid diſeaſes. Theſe ſhould therefore be allowed to children at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and may either occaſionally conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a part of their diet; or may be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them, when they lay out part of their pocket-money with huckſters, in preference to ſeed-cakes, gingerbread, or ſugar-plumbs; the former of which are generally made of bad flour deteriorated by ſpice; and the latter are liable to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured with gamboge, vermillion, verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe, or other noxious drugs.</p>
                     <p>Too long faſting, or food of leſs nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment than they have been accuſtomed to, are peculiarly injurious to children; as they weaken their power of digeſtion, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:033601_0164_0FF7A2AA08A958A0"/>their ſtrength, and impede their growth. The children of the inferior poor, and of families, which have adopted ſome ill-adviſed rules of abſtemious diet, are frequently ſtarved into the ſcrophula, and become pale-faced and bloated, owing to deficiency of the quantity of blood, and to want of ſufficient ſtimulus to the abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>If young people are thought to be too corpulent, a diminution of food with an increaſe of exerciſe, when they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their full growth, may be uſed with advantage; but even then not without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Since young ladies, after they have left ſchool, who by ill advice uſe too great abſtinence, are liable to become pale and emaciated, and to fall into univerſal debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; which remains through a diſeaſed and comfortleſs life.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. A DUE regard to the prudent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditure of their money, a proper care of their clothes, and a parſimonious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the lapſe of time, ſhould be incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated into the minds of young ladies. To effect theſe purpoſes one efficacious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, where the uſual exhortations fail, may be to ſuffer their imprudence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome inconvenience to themſelves; which they ſhould be permitted to feel to a proper degree.</p>
                     <p>Thus a profuſe unneceſſary expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their pocket money will ſhortly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce poverty; which ſhould by no means be alleviated by a freſh ſupply of money; till the inconvenience produced has effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:033601_0166_0FF7A2AD531EED90"/>a conviction of the impropriety of their conduct. Except when the expenditure has been made for ſome laudable purpoſe, and then no time ſhould be loſt in reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of repeating it.</p>
                     <p>The ſame mean may be uſed in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to their omiſſion to take care of their clothes; they ſhould find the neceſſity of repairing them with their own hands, or of foregoing ſome viſiting amuſements, till new ones can be procured; that thus the conſequent inconvenience may teach them economy, if they are otherwiſe too inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the uſual admonitions on theſe ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to the economy of time the hours of amuſement and of exerciſe ſhould be regularly counted; and the length of time young ladies employ in dreſſing ſhould be nicely attended to; as in adult life the hours conſumed at the toilet of ſome ladies is perfectly ridiculous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:033601_0167_0FF7A2B019D55F70"/>them from more important duties. Perhaps a ſtated time might be allowed the young ladies for adjuſting the articles of their dreſs, that they might acquire a habit of diſpoſing them with neatneſs, taſte, and elegance, and yet with expedition.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Men are generally trained from their early years to the buſineſs or profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in which they are afterwards to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; but it moſt frequently happens to ladies, that tho' deſtined to the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of a future family, they receive ſcarcely any previous inſtruction; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this important office with a profound ignorance of the value of money, and of the proper application of the things, which ſurround them.</p>
                     <p>Many young ladies deſtitute of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and without a home, are continued at ſchool to a later age; ſuch ſhould be formed into a claſs, and properly inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in domeſtic economy; each of them
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:033601_0168_0FF7A2B2958A7338"/>ſuperintending the buſineſs of the family, a week or a month by turns; not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the table, and directing the cookery, but they ſhould alſo be taught other parts of domeſtic employment, as cutting out linens, and making them up with plain and ſtrong needle work, either for their own families, or to be given as clothing for neceſſitous infants or mothers.</p>
                     <p>Such an addition of domeſtic know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and benevolent induſtry to orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental accompliſhments would give the ſchool, that procures it, a decided advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over other ſchools, which have no ſuch inſtitution.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXXIX. SCHOOL-EDUCATION.</head>
                     <p>THE advantages of a ſchool-educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where twenty or thirty children are properly inſtructed, over that in a private family are derived from ſeveral ſources. Firſt, it muſt be obſerved, that almoſt all our exertions in early life are owing to our imitating others; in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood we are moſt liable to imitate the actions of thoſe, who are ſomewhat old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ourſelves; and in manhood, of thoſe who are in ſomewhat higher life; whence the general prevalence of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion in dreſs and manners. Now there are more examples to cauſe imitative activity in well conducted ſchools, and the children in conſequence become more active in the purſuit of their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:033601_0170_0FF7A2B69EB22B68"/>and in the acquirement of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments.</p>
                     <p>It may be added, that not only chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, before they have acquired the uſe of reaſon or voluntary deliberation, but that the greateſt part of adult mankind learn all the common arts of life by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating others; and that even dumb creatures ſeem capable of acquiring knowledge with greater facility by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating each other, than by any methods, by which we can teach them. Thus dogs, when they are ſick, learn of each other to eat graſs as an emetic; and cats to moiſten their paws for the purpoſe of waſhing their faces. And the readieſt way to inſtruct all brute animals is by practiſing them with others of the ſame ſpecies; which have already learnt the arts, we wiſh them to acquire, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in Zoonomia, vol. I. ſect. 22.3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="unknown:033601_0171_0FF7A2B84B298370"/>
A ſecond advantage of ſchools, when well conducted, is that children often take pleaſure in teaching each other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that at boy's ſchools I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerved, that the lower claſſes have learnt more from their ſchool-fellows of the higher claſſes, than even from their maſters; which has ſometimes ariſen from the friendſhip, or vanity of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der boy, and ſometimes from the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lower one; but has in all caſes been advantageous to both of them.</p>
                     <p>A third ſuperiority of ſchool educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſes from an emulation, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally exiſts, where many purſue the ſame ſtudies, but which ſhould not be encouraged by rewards or degradations; as it then may degenerate into envy or hatred; but ſhould in general be left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to its own operation; as mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſect. xxx.</p>
                     <p>A fourth advantage of ſchool-educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from the children acquiring a
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:033601_0172_0FF7A2BCB5912A50"/>kind of practical phyſiognomy; which renders them more intelligent, and more intereſting companions; and is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conſequence in our paſſage through life, than almoſt any ſingle accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as explained in ſect. vi. and ſect. xxiv. of this work.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, where languages are learnt by converſation, as is generally practiſed in teaching the French language, a ſchool-education properly conducted, is much ſuperior to that of a governeſs in a private family. And languages are ſo much eaſier taught to children by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation than by the abſtract rules of grammar, that Mr. Locke is ſolicitous to have the latin and greek languages taught by converſation in boys' ſchools; and thinks the time of learning words might thus be much ſhortened, which now occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies ſeven or eight years; part of which might be much better employed in acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knowledge of things.</p>
                     <p>

The Philoſopher, who deſpiſing the goods of fortune ſaid, "he was rich, though he carried about with him every thing, which he poſſeſſed," meant to aſſert, that ſtrength of mind joined with ſtrength of body, were ſuperior to any other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of life. A good education furniſhes us with this ineſtimable treaſure; it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies us at home, travels with us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; delights us in ſolitude, graces us in ſociety; comforts us in misfortune, guards us in proſperity; contributes to the happineſs of others, and enſures our own.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>CORNELIA, daughter of Scipio Africanus, and mother of the Gracchi, was not more diſtinguiſhed by the Nobility of her rank, than by the luſtre of thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which adorned her character—a moſt pleaſing and amiable trait of which ſhines in that little incident recorded to her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal honour. A Lady of Ionia coming one day to viſit her, impatiently expected to be ſhewn the ſplendor and magnificence of her toilette, which ſhe ſuppoſed, from her rank and fortune, to be very ſuperb. The illuſtrious Roman prolonged the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation till her children were at hand, and then introducing them to her viſitor—"Theſe, ſays ſhe, are my jewels."</p>

The writer of theſe Letters has ſo great a veneration for the domeſtic character of this Lady, that ſhe thinks ſhe cannot do better than give them to the public, under the ſignature of Cornelia. And whatever their other defects may be, they have this at leaſt to recommend them, that the ſame ſentiments of maternal tenderneſs which influenced the Roman Matron, gave riſe to theſe epiſtles, and prompted a fond Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to become an Author.</p>

                     <p>A DESIRE of happineſs is the firſt propenſity of the heart.—It is born with us, and to attempt its ſuppreſſion were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually fruitleſs and wrong; for the Author of Nature has done nothing in vain, and the happineſs he has imprinted on the mind ſo clear an idea of, has ſomewhere an exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto you have obeyed the impulſe of nature in the artleſs purſuits of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; but the time is at hand, when this ſweet tranquillity will be interrupted by the buſtle of the world, which will not longer permit you to repoſe in the ſimple amuſements of dreſſing dolls, purſuing butterflies, or plucking, daiſies. Sweet
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:033601_0194_0FF7A3C06856B4B8"/>dear delights of innocence: on which, as you climb the rugged heights of life, you will look back with fond regret.</p>
                     <p>But we are not born for ourſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and therefore have duties to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, obligations to diſcharge, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to encounter; in the courſe of which, many a ſevere check is given to this happineſs which we all ſo ardently ſeek; yet the deſire of it will even acquire ſtrength by the repulſe, and there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet a wretch who had found it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by misfortune. I wiſh the ſucceſs of this paſſion could be ſhewn as demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable as its exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, all mankind are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the ſame object, though in ſuch oppoſite directions, that if it were not for their concurrent teſtimony, it would be ſcarcely credible that they had each the ſame view. Yet it is the fate of moſt of them to ſit down at laſt, in the very ſame
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:033601_0195_0FF77EBC45D89500"/>diſpoſition which Solomon was in when he complained, rather peeviſhly it muſt be owned, that all was vanity and vexation of ſpirit. Man walks indeed in a vain ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and 'tis pitiable to reflect that a being of ſo tranſient a duration ſhould yet waſte the trifling portion of time allotted him in vain and fruitleſs purſuits, and after all the ſchemes of the ſanguine, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the active, to find the deſired at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment as far off as ever.</p>
                     <p>But this has been the caſe of millions, and I am afraid will continue to be ſo, at leaſt till we are unanimous in deciding on that grand point wherein this good, of which we have all ſo high an idea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts: an agreement from which alas, we are at the fartheſt diſtance imaginable. And here, my deareſt girls, lies the whole of the miſtake. The Creator has not been wanting to provide a happineſs exalted as the mind itſelf can conceive; but man himſelf errs in the purſuit of it; ſome
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:033601_0196_0FF77EBFDA831FE8"/>placing it in riches, ſome in power, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one in an age ſuppoſing it to be where it really is—in the practice of virtue.</p>
                     <p>But while the human heart is ſet on acquirements, in which it can find no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction if attained, the ſpan of life muſt neceſſarily be paſſed in reſtleſs anxieties and melancholy diſappointment. It was the aim of philoſophy, to draw juſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of things, and to prevent its pupils from being dazzled with the ſplendor of wealth and power; it taught that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign good was to be found in rectitude of will. It would be a ſhame for us to be at a loſs on ſuch an important ſubject, who have received leſſons from a much better maſter than ever gave lectures in the ſchools of Athens.</p>
                     <p>Reſt aſſured that in the exerciſe of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and religious duties, the mind will find her ſolid happineſs. Wandering in reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſearch, like Noah's dove, 'tis here ſhe
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:033601_0197_0FF7A2EDDEF074B8"/>finds at length the welcome olive, the branch whoſe verdure blooms for immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Should you doubt the aſſertion, be prevailed on at leaſt to try the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <head>LETTER II.</head>
                     <p>PLEASURE has ſomething ſo allur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the very name, that it is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing it finds ſo great a number of vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. On no account would I have you inſenſible to its attractions, but rather lead you to its flowery paths, and conduct you to the moſt refined delights. Theſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you can never obtain, except you are guided in the choice by taſte and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A taſte in pleaſure is neceſſary for the ſelection of ſuch as are above the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries of the vulgar, ſuitable to delicate and refined minds, and correſpondent to the nobleſt ſentiments; of courſe depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant more on intellectual, than on corporeal faculties. Taſte never fails to reject what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is groſs and ſenſual; yet even among the more reſined pleaſures, a ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is wanted, to diſcriminate the ſolid
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:033601_0199_0FF7A2F442A546D0"/>and rational, from the frivolous and faſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. The elegant hand of faſhionable diſſipation has often given a poliſh to what, in its own nature, can never deſerve the name of pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Under this head muſt be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the various ſpecies of faſhionable amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are injurious either to health or fortune. One would ſcarcely ſuppoſe ſuch purſuits as theſe ſhould ever be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with the name of pleaſure. Yet when numbers are daily ſeen hazarding, not only extravagant ſums, but peace of mind alſo, at the gaming-table—When the order of nature is inverted, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments of repoſe are bartered for mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night routs, we muſt conclude that ſuch valuable ſacrifices are not made but with the expectation of ſome ſupreme pleaſure to reward them: how ſeldom ſuch rewards are found, can beſt be determined by the teſtimony of the diſſipated and gay, who after they have waſted the moſt valuable
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:033601_0200_0FF7A2F5D29AAE18"/>bleſſings of life, as time, health, ſpirits, &amp;c. will generally confeſs that they have never found the ſatisfactions they ſought after.</p>
                     <p>To be able to diveſt real enjoyment from the falſe gloſſes the world has put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, is a piece of wiſdom becoming a philoſopher; but it is a piece of wiſdom, you my dear girls, muſt alſo acquire, if you expect to be happy. Faſhion has ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated to itſelf the prerogative of fixing the criterion of pleaſure; but faſhion is often a dangerous director, and is at beſt an imperfect one; for who has a power of effectually biaſſing the natural diſpoſition of another; if therefore what is called amuſement be not agreeable to the real turn of the mind, it ceaſes to be viewed in that light, and can only be conſidered as an irkſome conformity to the taſtes of others.</p>
                     <p>Yet, abject as ſuch a ſubmiſſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is, there are thouſands who vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:033601_0201_0FF7A2F75EF848A0"/>yield to it who are content to live, move, and act, not as they like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as the polite world thinks fit to dictate. I am no advocate for affected ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity in things merely indifferent; but when the idol faſhion breaks in upon the rules of virtue, as it too often does, or the true enjoyment of life, this is ſo mean a ſlavery that a rational being might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to deſpiſe it.</p>
                     <p>When therefore reaſon and religion have given the clue to your pleaſures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve always to have them of your own chuſing, and not of other people's. The ſanction of numbers is the cauſe that draws youth from virtue and happineſs: reaſon, when aided by a proper education, would, if left to herſelf, point out the way to both.</p>
                     <p>There are pleaſures, my dear girls, to be met with in this journey of life, pure and ſublime ones too, if we look for them through the medium of unvitiated taſle.

But if you aim at more exalted, more rapturous ſenſations, give full ſcope to the impulſes of benevolence; try what it is to heal the broken-hearted; diffuſe joy through the manſions of ſorrow, and reſcue merit from the preſſure of indigence and misfortune. —Theſe employments are capable of yielding pleaſures ſuitable to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted capacities, boundleſs as the moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine imagination can paint them.</p>
                     <p>But if ſo vaſt a multitude have erred in the purſuit of pleaſure, through levity, not an inconſiderable number, of a very oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite temper, are at equally as great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from it: theſe are the moroſe and cynical, who will not condeſcend to the ſober ſatisfactions that are to be found in a domeſtic circle, where the ſocial affections are cultivated: if the gay and volatile miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the nature of pleaſure, theſe ſeem to

                     <p>Ever be your hearts open to the ſweet emotions of ſocial love, and you will not have cauſe to complain that the path of human life affords nothing but briars and thorns.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it from the relative duties alone we can derive happineſs; the amuſing, the intereſting book of nature is open to all who can read it: here you meet with eternal variety, order, and beauty; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand charms await the mind which poſſeſſes a taſte for ſimple pleaſures; to ſuch the whole creation is a boundleſs ſource of rational amuſements. Happy, ineffably happy, they who can be pleaſed with art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nature, and contemplate, with delight, the noble imagery with which ſhe abounds. For my part, I ſhould deſire no greater

                     <p>EVERY one knows that human life is expoſed to various miſeries; but every one does not know, at leaſt does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the far greater part of theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries ſpring from the paſſions: yet the paſſions, you reply, are implanted in us by nature—we cannot eradicate them.</p>
                     <p>That is true; you cannot eradicate the paſſions, nor is it expedient you ſhould; for as we are the workmanſhip of Infinite Wiſdom, ſo doubtleſsly the propenſities He has formed us with, are in themſelves very good; but then their good or ill ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency muſt be determined by this ſingle queſtion, Whether they govern us, or we govern them? In the latter caſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe ſalutary breezes, which waft health and ſweetneſs on their wings: in
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:033601_0206_0FF7A303222D8300"/>the former they may be compared to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hurricanes, which tear up all before them, and deform the beauteous aſpect of the moſt luxuriant climates. There is more felicity to be found in the world than is often ſuppoſed; but never let us pretend to look for it before we have ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced the paſſions; the perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention we muſt have with them will elſe interrupt our ſucceſsful ſearch.</p>
                     <p>Pride, my dear girls, is a vice that ſprings up in the mind, almoſt without her attending to it: its characters are an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate ſelf-love, conceitedneſs, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, with a profound contempt of every other perſon; ever inſatiable in its deſire of reſpect, extremely ſuſceptible of the ſlighteſt affronts, and jealous of the leaſt tribute of applauſe paid to another. Perſons of this caſt cannot in the nature of things be happy, as they may be ſaid to live in a ſtate of hoſtility with all the world; like Iſhmael, they have their hands againſt
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:033601_0207_0FF7A3059B2F8C88"/>every man, and every man's hand is againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Ambition condemns its wretched vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to forego the ſweets of content and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eaſe, for the uneaſy dreams of rank and power. It is happy for the world when fate denies to the ambitious that power to which their deſires are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſpiring. Innumerable are the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid deeds, which the hiſtoric page records, that have been perpetrated by the impulſe of this reſtleſs paſſion; yet if in pity to mankind, its direful effects are reſtrained, ſtill the boſom where it rages muſt be a prey to inexpreſſible agonies.</p>
                     <p>Envy is a natural attendant on pride and ambition: it has very aptly been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a vulture preying on the vitals, and there could not poſſibly have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed a more expreſſive ſimilitude. That mind which is capable of regarding with the leaſt degree of regret, the more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:033601_0208_0FF7A30817FEE608"/>acquirements of another as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſource of diſquietude and muſt ever pine beneath the inexpreſſible miſery, which is both the conſequence and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſo baſe a propenſity. As en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy is the meaneſt of all the paſſions, ſo in its own nature it is the moſt oppoſite to happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Covetouſneſs is a vice that abſorbs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry finer feeling of the ſoul. Whatever ſordid ſatisfaction the miſer may feel in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſing his treaſures, yet the cares which unavoidably attend it, and the ſolicitude the preſervation of it demands, more than balance the ſelfiſh gratification. He knows nothing of the ſweet emotions of charity and benevolence, and muſt be ever a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the noble ſenſations they excite.—It is well if the ſuggeſtions of his bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs avarice do not prompt him beyond the bounds of integrity. The honeſty of a covetous perſon can be but doubtful at the beſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="unknown:033601_0209_0FF7A309A5B050C0"/>
A revengeful diſpoſition is as dreadful to ſociety as burdenſome to itſelf: it is the whirlwind of the ſoul, which under its dominion reſembles a fury of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal regions. What ſad cataſtrophes have been effected by revenge! what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible torment overwhelms the heart, where that dreadful venom operates!</p>
                     <p>It is eaſy to perceive, by the ſlighteſt glance, that every one of the paſſions here enumerated are totally deſtructive of peace: there can be no ſuch thing as tranquillity in the breaſt which they inhabit. Let it, then, be the care of my deareſt girls, to guard againſt the fatal aſcendancy of either of them. There cannot be a more lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table object than a human being who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to become the ſport of paſſions: a barque in a ſtorm, driven by winds, and ſhattered by the tempeſt, exhibits but a faint picture of ſuch a wretch, whoſe days paſs in continual anguiſh; he looks for peace, but finds deſpair; caſts oblique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:033601_0210_0FF7A30B36D53758"/>on the wiſdom and goodneſs of Providence; diſtruſts his attributes; cuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es his own being and dies if poſſible more wretched than he lived.</p>
                     <p>The infinitely wiſe and good Creator ſaw the abundant evil that would accrue to mankind from the degeneracy of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and therefore in his goodneſs deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at an appointed time to promulgate a religion, the aim of which ſhould be to regulate the paſſions, and direct them to their proper channel; ſuch is the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian revelation; in its ends and nature an antidote to moral evil.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the natural paſſions of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind may be reduced to two—the love of pleaſure and the love of praiſe; and from the corruptions of theſe may be traced every irregular affection of the heart—when men no longer knew the true ſource from whence to look for happineſs, or approbation, it is not much wonder it
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:033601_0211_0FF7A30EDBBF0700"/>ſhould be ſought in power, riches and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence; not that the love of theſe ſhould branch into ſelf-love, vain glory, and all the other evil paſſions, which cauſe ſo much miſery in the world.</p>
                     <p>The regulation of the heart and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, is a point then of the utmoſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſince on it depends your preſent peace and eternal glory. "Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life." And when you have repelled the approach of any paſſion, guard ſtill more effectually againſt its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, by endeavouring to eſtabliſh in your mind the contrary virtue;—as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſubdue pride and cheriſh humility; guard againſt the deſire of power and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, by attaining that poverty of ſpirit which is content with little, and deſires no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe but that of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Never loſe ſight of this truth—that there is no happineſs adequate to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:033601_0212_0FF7A311603842B0"/>of the human ſoul, but what is found in the exerciſe of piety and virtue; nor any praiſe worthy her regard, but what reſults immediately therefrom.</p>

                     <p>THE moſt glorious conqueſt you can poſſibly obtain is that of yourſelves. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon was of opinion, that he who could govern his own ſpirit, had attained a much higher point of dominion, than if he ſhould rule a kingdom. It is certainly much eaſier to give wiſe and upright laws to others, than to obey them ourſelves; and when you can controul your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, you will have learned the whole eſſence of moral philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>But a negative virtue is not all that is to be attained, although thouſands content with it, maintain through life the character of good ſort of people.—The epithet, however, contains no very high eulogium, thoſe good kind of folks ſeldom riſe above a mediocrity in goodneſs. It certainly is
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:033601_0214_0FF7A315691833E0"/>not ſufficient to abſtain from evil, a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian muſt be diſtinguiſhed by active virtue.</p>
                     <p>The Chriſtian religion is a beautiful comment on the moral law. The prieſt who paſſed by the wounded Jew, was, for aught we are told to the contrary, a very good ſort of man, and had ſome ſentiments of compaſſion, for he went and <hi>looked</hi> on the poor creature, and no doubt kindly <hi>wiſhed</hi> it had been in his power to relieve him; but the good, the benevolent Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, was the generous, <hi>active</hi> friend, whoſe character will never be read without being admired. The lawyer alſo poſſeſſed a tolerable ſhare of negative merit, having always kept the commandments; yet ſays our Saviour, thou lackeſt one thing—that heroic benevolence, which diſregards all attention to ſelfiſh gratification, in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ardour with which it contributes to the neceſſities of mankind.</p>
                     <p>Theſe inſtances are fine illuſtrations of the Moſaic diſpenſation, and eminently
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:033601_0215_0FF7A317EB49E0F0"/>tend to exalt human nature to the higheſt poſſible perfection. It is not enough, ſay the goſpel tenets, that ye refrain from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual violence to any one—you ſhall love your enemies, and do good to thoſe that hate you. Severe injunction!—yet you ſee by it to how refined a pitch the virtue of a chriſtian muſt aſpire.</p>
                     <p>Do not then reſt ſatisfied with being as juſt or kind as the letter of the law exacts—be actively good, and ſeek occaſions of exerciſing your kindneſs and charity—to adminiſter as far as we are able to the wants of our fellow creatures—to reclaim the vicious—to vindicate the character of the injured—aſſert the claims of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and oppreſſed—reconcile differences, and be indefatigable in the promotion of peace and happineſs to all within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of our ability, are employments wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a rational being.</p>
                     <p>There are many caſes that occur in life, wherein thoſe who will obey only the
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:033601_0216_0FF7A31AA38F9B70"/>rules of legal juſtice, muſt fall ſhort of thoſe notions of honeſty, which natural reaſon and conſcience ſuggeſt; as a good mind wants not the bonds of human laws, ſo on ſome occaſions it riſes to a generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is ſuperior to their narrow limits. Obey the innate ideas of rectitude which God himſelf has ſtamped on the human ſoul—and think it not ſufficient to be juſt, except you are generous alſo.</p>
                     <p>Let your conduct be regulated by the niceſt rules of propriety and prudence; and let your boſoms glow with the enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm of virtue, that you may ever ſhine forth the ſteady, zealous friend, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volently active neighbour, and the truly uſeful member of ſociety; conſidering yourſelves as citizens of the world, whoſe only buſineſs it is to do good.</p>

                     <p>BUT ſo exalted and refined a turn of ſentiment is never the production of ignorance. It is only in cultivated minds we muſt look for it; for the prime fruits of virtue grow not in the ſoil that has never been broken up by moral inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A virtuous and intelligent friend is perhaps the moſt valuable acquiſition a young perſon can make; but as one of this deſcription may never ſall to your lot, ſupply the want thereof, as well as you can, by books.</p>
                     <p>By all means cultivate a taſte for reading, but take care that your taſte be a juſt one—that is, be more deſirous of inſtruction than amuſement or you will profit but little by literary purſuits. Thoſe who read merely to pleaſe the
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:033601_0218_0FF7A31DC64817E0"/>imagination, may be ſure of not reading to advantage, and do ſeldom acquire a reliſh for works of ſolid merit and utility. I have never known a young perſon who was paſſionately fond of novels capable of reliſhing any thing ſuperior to them. For my own part, I had rather ſee a girl wholly ignorant of the alphabet, than at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to that ſpecies of writing; for I am convinced that infinitely more have erred in the conduct of life from that cauſe, than from any other. The ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ideas they impreſs, are fatal illuſions to miſlead the poor reader, who, after waſting days and years in the ſtudy, is ſtill an utter ſtranger to the world ſhe lives in—and, what is worſe, inſpired with the moſt erroneous notions of it, which commonly lead to ſome falſe ſtep, or ill-judged connection, that ſecures her a wretch for life. It cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe—for the ſcenes, characters, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, theſe books deſcribe, are to be found no where but in the author's ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:033601_0219_0FF7A32232960AF0"/>fancy. They have nothing to do with the real knowledge of the world; and conſequently, thoſe who think to ſteer through it by ſuch guides, muſt, in the end, find themſelves miſtaken. Juſt as well may a traveller think to make the tour of Europe by a chart of Aſia.</p>
                     <p>If curioſity muſt be amuſed, and the imagination pleaſed, why may not the underſtanding be improved at the ſame time? This is very practicable, for there are many works of genius extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well calculated to anſwer each of theſe ends; but they are not the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Sir ſuch a one, Miſs what d'ye call um, or any of thoſe futile produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the preſs daily emits, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the taſte, and corrupt the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the age.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain mental vigour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to virtue as well as to happineſs, but modern novels, under the ſpecious
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:033601_0220_0FF7A323C364A318"/>maſk of refined ſentiments, introduce a dangerous ſoftneſs that has often deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both. True refinement is the glory of a rational creature, but whatever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervates the mind, muſt debaſe it. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus thought ſo, I ſuppoſe, when he baniſhed the poets from his common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; yet ſurely he lived near enough to Athens to have learned to draw a proper line between ferocity and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy.</p>
                     <p>The paſſion for novelty, ſo inherent in youth, may be abundantly gratified, by the ſtudy of hiſtory. Here you meet with new and uncommon events—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted with a variety of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and are enabled to form a juſt eſtimate of mankind; for except allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a few local cuſtoms or prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, human nature was the ſame two thouſand years ago as at this time. There is ſomething extremely agreeable to the mind in weighing and examining the
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:033601_0221_0FF7A3254F86B370"/>actions of celebrated perſonages, who, in their day, made the mighty tremble—in marking the riſe or fall of empires, and to be able to determine the ſecret cauſes of thoſe revolutions which once aſtoniſhed the world.</p>
                     <p>The ages appear as inconſiderable points, to thoſe who are acquainted with hiſtory—they ſee the various nations of the earth paſs in review before them, and trace a more than human power buſy in the affairs of men—by taking in at one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive view ſo vaſt a tract of time, they diſcern the nice connections of that ſcheme of Providence, which often appears broken and irregular, when contemplated only through the medium of a few years.</p>
                     <p>It is almoſt impoſſible to be well verſed in the characters of the politer nations of antiquity, without watching ſomething of that magnanimity which diſtinguiſhed them; and I know not why an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:033601_0222_0FF7A326DF89E9E0"/>with their manners ſhould not be thought as neceſſary in the ſyſtem of FE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MALE EDUCATION, as it uſually is in that of the other ſex. If the Greek and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man veterans diſplayed qualities which the heroes of the preſent day would be proud to imitate, their wives and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were often patterns of ſuch virtue, as would be allowed to dignify a lady of the eighteenth century.</p>
                     <p>Read modern hiſtory as well as antient—the knowledge of the nations who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the globe as well as yourſelves, is amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intereſting—the heart, too, may be the better for it—narrow prejudices are removed, and the better mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted with each other, the more the divine principle of philanthropy muſt be extended. National enmity has no other parent but ignorance—the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, the philoſophic mind, even through the veil of different tongues and cuſtoms, can diſcern a kindred being—a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:033601_0223_0FF7A32A9262A658"/>of that univerſal family, whoſe head is the Deity.</p>
                     <p>Next to travelling itſelf, nothing tends more to enlarge the ideas than journals of travels and voyages, if the writers have been faithful and accurate; and you will read them with infinite pleaſure, if you have been careful to acquire a knowledge of geography. This renders you familiar with the countries you read of—You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect their ſoil, climate, and productions —know their reſpective boundaries, and can readily mark out their place on the globe.</p>
                     <p>Having thus, my dear girls, pointed out to you ſo exhauſtleſs a ſource of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will only for the preſent add, that I am, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>AS long as curioſity continues a leading feature in the human character, Biography will form a favourite ſpecies of reading. Every body is eager to pry into the private character of a celebrated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, and are better pleaſed to know, how ſuch an one acts in domeſtic life, than in the ſenate, or the field. And, indeed, it is there that the beſt eſtimate of the real deſcription can be formed.</p>
                     <p>The private lives of famous perſons afford much edification to the reader; the vice or meanneſs too often there diſplayed, teaches us not to be dazzled by the blaze of popularity or power; and to contemn that virtue which is built on the deſire of fame alone. If on the other hand, by following theſe darlings of fame to the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:033601_0225_0FF7A32EA2312C80"/>or the fire-ſide, we diſcover the ſame nobleneſs of heart that diſtinguiſhes them with the multitude, juſtly they become patterns for our example; the mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices to find ſomething about them that is <hi>imitable,</hi> for though few are called forth as diſtinguiſhed actors on the theatre of the world, all may, if they pleaſe, be <hi>great</hi> in private life: That is, may acquire thoſe amiable qualities of mind, which can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtitute real greatneſs; without which the hero is no more than a hypocrite, and even the robe of royalty, but a tinſel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to cover real meanneſs.</p>
                     <p>Your chief aim ſhould be the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the human heart, and that is in general more fully diſcovered in trifling traits and circumſtances, than by impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant actions performed under the public eye. But you no where find human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo impartially delineated, as in the ſacred writings. There the hiſtorians, neither influenced by paſſion nor preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,

                     <p>The Jewiſh writers had the faireſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities imaginable for exaggerating the virtues of their heroes, conſidering the miraculous powers ſo often exerted in their behalf. Such an adventure as that of David with Goliah, would have been thought by a Pagan writer, ſufficient grounds for exalting his favorite to a God: yet the inſpired Biographer has drawn that Prince with all his frailties about him; all the inequality of humanity; ſometimes glowing with the rapturous devotion of a Seraphim;—at others, enſlaved by the meaneſt paſſions.

The ſcriptures alſo finely illuſtrate many parts of profane hiſtory: we are told of embattled armies, and cities level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the duſt; but it is only in holy writ we find thoſe armies prophetically marſhalled, and that deſtruction denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced perhaps an hundred years before the event.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the productions of this kind, are the Spectator and the Rambler; as conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous for the elegance of their language, as the ſoundneſs of their morality. But there are no better rules for the moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of life, than are found in the writings of Solomon, and the Son of Sirach; which, though compoſed ſo many ages ago, may yet be read to much advantage, by thoſe

                     <p>If you are fond of poetry, be careful to read only what is good of it.

Elegance of numbers though a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, is yet the loweſt recommendation of good poetry;—its characteriſtics are dignity of thought, purity of expreſſion, and, above all, the beſt principles of piety and morality. For this reaſon, thoſe poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical pieces extant in the Bible, are by good judges, allowed to be truly ſublime.

Natural hiſtory affords a delightful ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy—it is not however expected that you ſhould have a ſyſtematic idea of every ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, animal, or inſect; but it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, for one who is bleſt with lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and opportunity, not to have at leaſt a general knowledge of the moſt conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of Nature's works:—to be ignorant of the beauty and properties of thoſe, is to wander over the fair creation, as Thomſon expreſſes it, "with brute unconſcious gaze." The curious and intelligent ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator finds the variegated face of nature, a ſource of rational amuſement, and reads in glowing characters the wiſdom of the Deity. It is not in ſuch purſuits that the human mind acquires thoſe illiberal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents which ſo often diſgrace it;—all it here finds is noble and beneficent, worthy that Divine Author, whom to know and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, in the proper glory of an intelligent being.</p>

                     <head>LETTER VII.</head>
                     <p>AMONGST the accompliſhments neceſſary to the female character, I think needle work may claim the firſt place, it having ſo cloſe a connection with neatneſs which is indiſputably requiſite to render you comfortable to yourſelves, or amiable in the eſteem of others. The ladies of the laſt century certainly held needle-work in much greater eſtimation than thoſe of the preſent; witneſs the many laborious performances that yet remain as proofs of their amazing induſtry in this reſpect—but the world is ever prone to extremes, and becauſe this art was then purſued to the excluſion of every intellectual accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, there are many in our days who ſeem to think it beneath their ſtudy or ambition.</p>
                     <p>The Mahometan ſentiment which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſome years ago, of the inferiority of the female mind, ſeems exploded in this
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:033601_0233_0FF7A341790A8A00"/>age of univerſal refinement: and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of cultivated underſtanding is no longer a phenomenon. The paths of knowledge are rendered acceſſible—men of learning have ſtooped from the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſcience to accelerate the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the other ſex—they abridge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile, explain for their aſſiſtance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement in polite literature.</p>
                     <p>Make all the uſe you poſſibly can of ſuch advantages, and be convinced that the cultivation of the mind will exalt you in the eſtimation of rational beings—will open to you exhauſtleſs ſources of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and delight, of which the ignorant can have no conception. Yet be careful, my dear girls, never to overlook one femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine grace or accompliſhment. There is a line of character drawn between the ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which neither can paſs without becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contemptible. It is not to make you deſpiſe thoſe acquirements which have ever been appropriated to the female ſex, that
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:033601_0234_0FF7A34319072E48"/>you are incited to mental attainments, but to render you ſtill more valuable as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and the better your minds are cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, the more you will ſee the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of attending to thoſe minutiae which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the condition in which Providence has placed you.</p>
                     <p>I do not ſee how you can acquit your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves tolerably in domeſtic life, without a knowledge of needle-work; but granting your rank and fortune may place you above the abſolute neceſſity of learning that part of it which is called plain work—yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how far the ornamental kinds may be of uſe to amuſe the intervals of pleaſures, or other purſuits, as well as to promote the diſplay of an elegant taſte. Even our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent amuſements require variation, and the mind may be agreeably relieved, by imitating with the needle the beautiful productions of nature—but there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which places a ſkill in needle work in a much more important point of view,
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:033601_0235_0FF7A347A7EE6598"/>and that is, the inconſtancy of fortune, which in her capricious moods has been often known to compel thoſe, whom once ſhe ſmiled on, to procure their ſubſiſtence by thoſe very arts which were acquired only for amuſement.—Whatever may be a reſource againſt that mutability which marks all human affairs, becomes an object of importance.</p>
                     <p>A proficiency in the arts of domeſtic management and oeconomy, ought juſtly to be ranked among the accompliſhments of a young lady. You muſt be unacquainted with nothing that appertains to good houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery. Some girls have I known profeſs ſo violent an attachment to literary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, that they are content to remain igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of common attainments. This ſhews a pitiable weakneſs—elevated minds are attentive to every thing; and, believe me, it is very poſſible to poſſeſs a competent knowledge of polite literature, and be well verſed in the methods of well governing a
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:033601_0236_0FF7A34934A48C18"/>houſe at the ſame time—the latter quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications have of themſelves conſtituted many an uſeful character in female life, which is more than can be ſaid of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Blend, therefore, my beloved girls, <hi>polite</hi> with <hi>uſeful</hi> acquirements, and you will be what I wiſh you.</p>
                     <p>In writing, acquire, if poſſible, a good hand, yet that is not ſo eſſentially neceſſary as the being able to write grammatically—the violation of the <hi>common</hi> rules of gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, is an indiſputable mark of low breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and although my Lord Cheſterfield ſarcaſtically ſaid that bad ſpelling was only allowable in a woman, it certainly is not allowable in any one, who pretends to an education above the vulgar. Could you write as fine a hand as even A—n him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, bad ſpelling would diſgrace the whole. The ſubſtituting <hi>have</hi> for <hi>has, are</hi> for <hi>is,</hi> &amp;c. infallibly ſinks you in the eſtimation of well bred perſons. In order to avoid errors of this kind, habit is to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:033601_0237_0FF7A34ACAFAC698"/>guarded againſt. If in your early years you are not careful to write and ſpell correctly, it is a thouſand to one if you ever do. You ſee, therefore, of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it is that you pay a preſent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe points.</p>
                     <p>I reckon among the uſeful attainments, the ability of penning an epiſtle with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and elegance—many fortunate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in life may be facilitated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by—a well written letter has often effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what verbal requeſts have ſought in vain—beſides this conſideration, how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt the ſweet intercourſe of friendſhip be improved by a free and intelligent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence! Two friends, though placed at the extremities of the globe, may thus enjoy all the pleaſures of ſuch a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but except you attain the deſirable habit of expreſſing your ſentiments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out embarraſſment, hope not to enjoy any thing of ſo delicate a ſatisfaction. Letters ſhould be the pictures of the ſoul; and ſo
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:033601_0238_0FF7A34C89FD2100"/>they always would be if people acquired only the ſkill of expreſſing their thoughts juſt as they ariſe. Write as you would ſpeak, were the perſons you addreſs imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before you. There is no more than this neceſſary to eſtabliſh that eaſineſs of ſtyle which is the chief beauty of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolary correſpondence. That good breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I hope will be habitual to you, will dictate thoſe terms and forms of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, the condition of thoſe to whom you write requires.—We do not always find the moſt learned people write the moſt agreeable letters—perhaps for no other reaſon than that they take too much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about it, and, like the good Archbiſhop of Benevento, reject the firſt thought that occurs. Some that I have known indite an epiſtle in ſuch a ſtiff and formal ſtyle, and load it ſo diſguſtfully with tautology, that one would almoſt take it for an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. When you write a letter, my dear girls, forget the idea of pen, ink and paper—ſuppoſe only you are ſpeaking to
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:033601_0239_0FF7A3510B376620"/>the perſon, and you will write an <hi>agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> if not a <hi>fine</hi> letter—to effect the latter, ſomething muſt have been effected by dame Nature—however, this I know— that the moſt elevated ſentiments would not look graceful in ſuch compoſitions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept accompanied by perfect eaſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and have the appearance of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpontaneouſly from the heart. Many excellent models of epiſtolary writing have been recommended to young proficients. You cannot have better than thoſe aſcribed to Pope Ganganelli;—whoever was the author, he has certainly hit on that eaſe, ſprightlineſs and elegance, which it is my earneſt wiſh may characteriſe whatever falls from your pen. Would to Heaven that all the world poſſeſſed the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and liberality of ſentiment which breathes through every one of thoſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant epiſtles.</p>

                     <p>WHEN you compare the ankward motions of a ruſtic, with the genteel and graceful movement of a perſon of education, you cannot but be aſſured of the utility of dancing, but it ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgotten, that to give this ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of mein and air is the chief end of that polite accompliſhment;—to loſe ſight of this idea, is to take away the real worth of that branch of genteel ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation:—to reduce it to an unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, if not pernicious attainment. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a knowledge of dancing may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conduce to ſocial pleaſure, and in that light be eſteemed an agreeable and innocent recreation, I cannot help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the ſame application that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to form an opera dancer, may very well be diſpenſed with in a young lady of a different character. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant leaps and geſtures of ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:033601_0241_0FF7A354282A7C68"/>females, make me think of the ſpeech of Philip of Macedon to his ſon, on another occaſion—I am ready to aſk if they "are not aſhamed to <hi>dance</hi> ſo well."</p>
                     <p>There is ſcarcely a human ſoul, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever apparently dead to ſenſibility, but is in ſome meaſure alive to the extatic charms of muſic. The ſtory of Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us is more than a fable—minds almoſt as inert and inanimate as trees themſelves, have been moved by the power of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſounds:—why elſe does the gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruſtic, follow with ſuch manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, the itinerant muſician; and why but that the effect of muſic on the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is ſo inconteſtibly proved, has the army adopted the ſons of Apollo with thoſe of Mars? Since then this ſcience has ſo great an influence on the feelings of the ſoul, is it not ſurprizing that the polite world ſhould not be more ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of enjoying thoſe ſublime ſenſations,
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:033601_0242_0FF7A356D4CDAB18"/>which the beſt pieces are ſo abundantly capable of exciting, and not reſt poorly ſatisfied with the luke warm pleaſures of ſing-ſong, while the noble compoſitions of great maſters, lie bye totally diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Indulge, my dear girls, a turn for muſic, if nature has given you ſuch; but do not permit a ſong tune, or an opera air to be the limits of your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in that enchanting ſcience.</p>
                     <p>Drawing, painting, &amp;c. juſtly form a part of polite education, becauſe they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh an agreeable, as well as rational amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They lead to a familiarity with the beauties of nature, and that can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail to advance the mind a degree high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, even to the contemplation of her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Author. But if it had not this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py tendency, drawing is ſtill a laudable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, becauſe an innocent one; and whatever furniſhes a recreation of that character, may certainly be deemed an auxiliary to virtue.</p>

An acquaintance with the languages of polite nations, greatly enlarges the mind. It is the property of ignorance to eſteem nothing valuable that a foreign country produces; and ſcarcely to allow that its inhabitants are human. Nothing tends more immediately to remove ſuch illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral prejudices, than ſtudying the language of the people thus deſpiſed. The ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious contemner is ſurpriſed to find them rational, and expreſſing ſimilar ideas with thoſe of his own country.</p>
                     <p>If neceſſity or inclination ever leads you from your native land, a previous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the language of thoſe you reſide among, would much facilitate your pleaſure and convenience; would open to you the avenues of ſocial love and friendſhip, and take off much from thoſe comfortleſs ſenſations the mind is apt to feel in the idea of being amongſt a people it knows not. For this end, perhaps it may be ſufficient to acquire a knowledge
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:033601_0244_0FF7A35BFAFAC910"/>of the French tongue, that being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood by intelligent perſons of every European nation. But there is another advantage attending this branch of polite accompliſhment, and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to you, my dear girls will be the moſt uſeful—I mean the being able to read in their original, thoſe beautiful compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which loſe many of their excellencies by tranſlation; for this reaſon become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted alſo with the Itaſian: but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Virgil you tell me have beauties that can never be tranſlated—true, yet theſe, I fancy, you muſt be content to taſte as pure as the labors of the learned afford them; the Greek and Latin tongues, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no part in the polite ſyſtem of female education at preſent, nor certainly ever can in the <hi>uſeful.</hi>

                     <p>Arithmetic is a dry ſtudy, yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very uſeful one, to thoſe who would manage their affairs with oeconomy and prudence;—a thorough knowledge of the

                     <p>From a total ignorance of letters in female life, we are advanced to an age which requires every girl to be made a grammarian; yet it unfortunately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that of the numbers who profeſs to have ſtudied the grammar of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tongue, few ſpeak or write it with that accuracy which could be wiſhed; indeed the progreſs that women uſually make in that ſcience, is ſeldom of itſelf ſufficient to give an habitual elegance of expreſſion; they are more indebted for it to frequent reading of the beſt authors, and the converſation of thoſe who have themſelves acquired it perfect;—what you can, acquire of grammar by ſuch aſſiſtances of theſe. There is an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable neceſſity for you to write and ſpeak Engliſh correctly; acquire that qualification as eaſily as you can, but nothing will more facilitate it than the methods I have mentioned.</p>

Geography is a ſtudy that will pleaſe you an hundred times better—this is not like the former, a ſet of dry rules, but almoſt every advance you make therein, will abundantly repay your pains by the novelty of the information it produces. Beſides, I cannot imagine how the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent relations that occur in common diſcourſe will be intelligible, without ſome acquaintance with this ſtudy. I am ſure if you are no geographer, even a newſpaper will be as inexplicable as an Egyptian hieroglyphic. Attain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent knowledge of the globe on which you live, that your apprehenſion of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom may be enlarged; which it will be in a much higher degree, if you take care to acquire a general idea of the ſtructure of the univerſe. It is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected you ſhould become adepts in aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, but a knowledge of its leading principles you may and ought to obtain.

                     <p>AN accompliſhed character, has ſo many charms, that nothing needs be ſaid to induce you to <hi>wiſh,</hi> at leaſt, for its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. Yet painful application muſt render that wiſh effectual—a reflection however that ſhould excite your emulation, rather than deſpondency—trivial acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may content the indolent and timid, but the arduous and difficult are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per aim of elevated minds. Courage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to the warrior alone—it is as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found in the cloſet, as the field.</p>
                     <p>That reſolution which is neceſſary for every valuable purpoſe of life, is the fruit only of active minds, and was never found with indolence and ſloth;—determine therefore to conquer every tendency to an inactive temper. Whenever you feel in yourſelves an inaptitude for doing what neceſſarily ought to be done, rouze that
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:033601_0249_0FF7A3671C0F45F8"/>moment, or you will give ground to an enemy the moſt deſtructive to happineſs and virtue; and who once entrenched is hard to be diſlodged. Never defer to the next hour, that which ſhould be the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the preſent. "Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it, with all thy might," ſaid a very wiſe man many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago; indeed there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept throughout the ſacred writings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated with greater energy than this of diligence. It is the ſoul of virtue— the foundation of honor and affluence.</p>
                     <p>Many a bright and ſhining talent lies hid in a napkin, for want of activity to unfold it; nor do we unfrequently meet with perſons ſtruggling with diſtreſſes, which require only their own exertions to remove. Indolence takes hold of the diſpoſition much oftener than is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; it is poſſible to be wholly under its dominion, and yet ſuſpect nothing of it; and, what is yet more ſtrange, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:033601_0250_0FF7A369A0CDFEB8"/>one's ſelf to be the moſt diligent perſon in the world at the very time. You have ſeen numbers of buſtling peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are always in a hurry, and ſo perplexed do they appear with buſineſs, as never to be able to enjoy a friend or themſelves. It would ſeem hard at firſt ſight, to accuſe them of indolence, and yet they are of all people moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly under its power: for an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual diligence would ſo comfortably arrange the affairs of life, that none would be found to intrude on another. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſurpriſing diſpatch with which ſome in public ſtations, manage a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the moſt important concerns; —to contemplate them, one would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conclude, nothing too extenſive for the compaſs of the human mind;—dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is the charm which effects it all.</p>
                     <p>In that diſmal catalogue of diſeaſes which imbitter mortality, not a few owe their exiſtence to indolence. The indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent labourer who toils for daily bread,
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:033601_0251_0FF7A36B2D92A428"/>knows nothing of that ſad train of ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſorders which render life itſelf burdenſome to the wealthy. In ſome caſes, poverty might juſtly be called a bleſſing. Great are the atchievements which reſolution and diligence can effect: —in nothing is their power more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly ſeen, than in the cultivation of the mind; to reflect on the progreſs of the human underſtanding—to compare the refinements of philoſophy with a ſtate of ſavage nature—a Newton, with an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of New Holland, we ſhould almoſt conclude ſome ſupernatural power muſt have contributed to give the former ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite a ſuperiority in the ſcale of beings. Without the quality I have recommended it could never have been attained, for though much be owing to accidental ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, ſuch as the being born in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened country afford, yet no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable portion of diligence is required to render theſe advantages perſonally effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. It is this, my dear girls, that makes them yours, and without it, the ſoul will
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:033601_0252_0FF7A36EA1695458"/>remain as uninformed as if deſtined to a land where ſcience never darts a cheering beam.</p>
                     <p>It may ſeem ſtrange to tell you of old age, before you have ſcarcely paſſed your infancy; yet I muſt not conceal from you, that a period will arrive, when exterior at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions will be no more:—when mental acquirements will prove your higheſt luſtre and ſublimeſt comfort. However deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable an ignorant woman appears at any part of her life, in the decline of it ſhe is ſure to become far more contemptible; at that time it is the improvements ſhe has made in early days, that give dignity of character. An old age of cards neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeds a youth of folly. Pope could not have ſaid any thing more deſtructive of the inſignificancy of thoſe ancient ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, than he has expreſſed in that conciſe ſatire. If you would avoid the contempt which never fails to attend a frivolous old age, you muſt paſs a youth of diligence and application.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="261" facs="unknown:033601_0253_0FF7A37052349948"/>
But then the pleaſures reſulting from it ſurpaſs deſcription, the ſatisfactions of a rich cultivated mind are only fully known to the happy poſſeſſor; one of them, we are aſſured, is a noble independence, which creates, if I may ſo ſpeak, its own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; is not indebted to diſſipation, or the caprice of others; but can derive from itſelf, exhauſtleſs reſources for ſolitude or ſociety. Ordinary perſons are obliged to fly from Ennui to the regions of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſuperior beings, who have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed the fields of uſeful and polite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, can from themſelves ſelect materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for the moſt exquiſite enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>Do you think this an acquiſition worth deſiring—then never forget that it can be obtained only by diligence and active in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. Habits of indolence are deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of every valuable attainment, and they are as much ſo of happineſs, as they are known to be of virtue.</p>

                     <p>CULTIVATED minds have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which ſurpaſs the vulgar apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They have their pains as well— for there is an evil peculiar to refined feeling, of which the untaught ruſtic is happily ignorant. This happens when refinement, or at leaſt the affectation of it, is carried to ſuch an extreme, that it degenerates into falſe delicacy. The ſymptoms of the malady are a kind of ſecret diſſatisfaction with every thing— the common bleſſings of life are deſpiſed, as inadequate to the refinement of their ideas, and every petty ſlight angmented by ſuch a quickneſs of perception, as leads them to ſee affronts, when none perhaps have been intended. And this peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irritable temper they are pleaſed to dignify with the name of ſenſibility, and pique themſelves on a diſpoſition that diſqualifies them for ſocial virtue or ſocial
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:033601_0255_0FF7A3768FCBE260"/>happineſs. What pity, that a quality meant to highten every real bleſſing, ſhould be aſcribed to the mere chimera of a ſickly brain! Never may you, my dears, by indulging theſe fictitious feelings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine away the felicity, which a kind Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſcatters in your path of life. Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in your boſoms humility and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—theſe will teach you to make the beſt of your lot, whatever it be, and give a reliſh to every enjoyment—all is ſerene where they reſide. Humility, by arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating nothing to herſelf, remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt at the ſupercilious ſcorn of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or pride; and good-nature, by caſting a veil over the foibles of others, preſents to our view the beſt ſide of this motley ſcene.</p>
                     <p>Without doubt, ſuperior minds have a quicker ſenſe of what is beautiful in nature, or deſirable in life, than a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, whoſe ideas extend not beyond his daily occupations—perhaps they feel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:033601_0256_0FF7A3781D192860"/>more acutely the evils of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet the perſons who ſuffer moſt by this affected ſenſicility are not they who have the greateſt ſhare of afflictive events, but the idly ſpeculative, who being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to no good purpoſe, have time to nouriſh thoſe artificial feelings which Nature knows nothing of.</p>
                     <p>Senſibility!—What is it?—Is it not that delicate perception of natural and moral beauty, which the Creator has implanted in the ſoul to exalt its happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and awaken its nobleſt paſſions? How greatly, then, do they err who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in the room of this beſt gift of Heaven, that which is the very weakneſs of humanity, pride and peeviſhneſs?</p>
                     <p>It is paying a very poor compliment to literary purſuits, to ſuppoſe they are productive of that ſoftneſs which unfits the mind for enduring the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of life. And thoſe attainments
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:033601_0257_0FF7A379AC6B27A0"/>are of little value that ſerve no better purpoſe than to barb the arrows of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune with ſtings which the enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed never feel. But probably they who dream of ſuch effects are the ſuperficial, who never dived beyond the ſurface of literature, and whoſe feeble intellects are unable to digeſt even the little they have imbibed.</p>
                     <p>If you have really made any advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in mental improvement, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate the powers of the ſoul, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire her with that magnanimity which is certainly neceſſary to the happineſs of a being, who is every moment expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſorrow and diſappointment. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue not yourſelves on any refinements that are ſhort of this effect.</p>
                     <p>Some, I know, are even reſtrained from the exerciſe of benevolence by this affectation of ſenſibility; their feelings are too tender to bear with ſcenes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:033601_0258_0FF7A37C381EAB30"/>and too refined for the duties of ſocial life; they therefore keep at an unfriendly diſtance from ſociety, leſt the ignorance or rudeneſs they there may meet with, ſhould wound their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive delicacy; but how is this obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the injunction of the Apoſtle, who exhorts us to be kindly affectioned one to another, bearing with each others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities?</p>
                     <p>In fine, my dear girls, come to the feaſt of ſocial life, accompanied by the virtues of humility and charity, and you will not ariſe diſſatisfied from the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE often thought that the great prevalence of vice ariſes chiefly from a culpable weakneſs of temper—for there is nothing ſo amiable in it that it ſhould be followed for its own ſake. It is the mere want of reſolution that betrays ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into the dreadful abyſs of ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>

                     <p>But, in my opinion he muſt be a poor philoſopher who cannot, and would have made but a ſorry figure in the portico or lyceum.</p>
                     <p>It is not meant to inculcate to you a boiſterous, imperious carriage. May my girls poſſeſs every feminine grace and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but theſe cannot be ſupported with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome portion of reſolution. There is
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:033601_0260_0FF7A3813AC39440"/>a proper firmneſs, without which neither virtue, happineſs, or dignity of character can be long maintained. Diſtruſt thoſe who extol the ſoft irreſolution of the ſex— it is the very rock on which thouſands of deluded females have been loſt.</p>
                     <p>Be poſſeſſed of the true principles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and rectitude, and dare to adhere to them in ſpite of ſolicitation, or that ſtill more powerful means of temptation, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule. Eſtabliſh your opinions on truth and reaſon, and maintain them, when neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with firmneſs;—ſome people give up both their faith and their friends, for want of reſolution to defend them.</p>
                     <q>Too weak to think, too indolent to chuſe.</q>
                     <p>In buſineſs, and the affairs of life, a proper firmneſs is indiſpenſably neceſſary. Thoſe who can be influenced by every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer, or intimidated at every appearance of difficulty, muſt of courſe be deſultory
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:033601_0261_0FF7A382D628A738"/>and unſettled. They affect nothing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, becauſe they know not how to perſevere in any undertaking. Obſtacles will attend the beſt concerted ſchemes, and mankind will ever think differently about them; but the truly wiſe will await with ſteady patience the iſſue of thoſe meaſures they have been careful to found in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the moral fitneſs of things. Some will undertake nothing, till they ſee the path ſmooth before them, and attain almoſt a certainty of ſucceſs. Such will find their lives waſted, before they have determined on the plan of it. Thoſe who beſt know the ſtate of humanity, will be convinced, that to deſign prudently and act firmly, is all that can be done by mortals.</p>
                     <p>Without reſolution, it will ſometimes be impoſſible to act agreeably to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of right reaſon, and virtue, for theſe are not always the <hi>ton;</hi> and when that is the caſe, no inconſiderable ſhare of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:033601_0262_0FF7A3854FECACE8"/>is requiſite to repel the attacks of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule or amuſement—nor can the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of knowledge be explored, without a portion of it—for, "there is nothing truly valuable to be attained without pains and labour." Diſmayed at the proſpect, the indolent, as deſcribed by Solomon, cry, "a lion is in the ſtreet"—Rather may my dear girls be animated with a nobler ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, to ſurmount every difficulty which would retard their acquiſition of merit and ſelicity. Parnaſſus itſelf was a craggy rock, but then the muſes dwelt on its top.</p>
                     <p>But if reſolution be neceſſary to the attaining whatever is valuable or deſirable in life, it is no leſs ſo to the ſupporting us under a deprivation of it. The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong—hence it follows, that the wiſeſt meaſures do not always meet with ſuceeſs, nor can virtue itſelf prevent the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of affliction—in ſuch circumſtances fortitude gives a dignity to ſuffering, and
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:033601_0263_0FF7A387CD01AA88"/>tends alſo to alleviate the weight of it. Every one knows the ſentiment of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher— <q>that a good man ſtruggling with adverſity, is a ſight on which the gods themſelves might look down with delight.</q> However that be, it is certain that ſuch a character never fails to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the reſpect and veneration of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Magnanimity, of all the qualities of the mind, ſeems moſt ſecure of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The Saviour of the world incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it, when having forwarned his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their approaching ſufferings, he enjoined them to poſſeſs their ſouls in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Patience is amongſt the Chriſtian duties, what magnanimity is in the liſt of heroic virtues. They are ſynonimous terms—both imply that calm, unſhaken fortitude, which is at once characteriſtic of the hero and the Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>But do not conclude this firmneſs of mind—this laudable reſolution is calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only to be admired. It is of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:033601_0264_0FF7A38A5002DC98"/>actual ſervice to the unfortunate, not only by enabling them to ſuſtain the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of their ſufferings, but by opening a way to better proſpects. The timid and irreſolute ſink at the approach of adverſity, into a deſpondency the moſt unfriendly to their affairs, by precluding that courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous induſtry which might render them more tolerable; and therefore, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, augment the very evils of which they complain.</p>
                     <p>Cultivate in all circumſtances this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate conſtancy—it will aid you in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of every good and valuable end. In proſperity, will ſecure you from the corruptions of vanity—impart dignity and ſerenity to adverſity. In fine, you cannot, I think, but be ſteady in the practice of virtue, if you are firm in the expectation of its rewards.</p>

                     <p>MY epiſtles to you, my dear girls, are written without the leaſt attention to method; their reſpective ſubjects have more the appearance of chance, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and therefore, may be juſtly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led curſory thoughts on various ſubjects. Young folks, I know, do not love preciſe rules, and perhaps you deem the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of my letters their chief merit. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, however, one more—that of ſincerity, and believe that the ſentiments they contain, flow from the heart; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I need not add the word <hi>ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As I diſclaim all methodical arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my ſubjects, I will here give you my thoughts, on that very important part of female ſtudy, dreſs. Be not afraid that I am about to confine you to a primitive plainneſs, though probably, ſuch a mode
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:033601_0266_0FF7A38E62780D08"/>may be found more advantageous to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and elegance, than modern finery; yet I ſhall recommend that which is at once agreeable to faſhion, and your own rank and circumſtances. To reconcile theſe three conditions, is no eaſy taſk, yet herein lies a chief perfection of the female character; few women poſſeſs the happy art;—yet thoſe who do, muſt be allowed a very ſuperior degree of merit. It is no inconſiderable trait in the character of an amiable young lady, that ſhe knows how to ſupport a genteel appearance; and yet pay a juſt regard to the frugality, which probably her limited circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                     <p>A fantaſtical and expenſive turn in dreſs, is the certain mark of a little mind; but that attention to it, which principally regards neatneſs, is extremely laudable. Reſolve to be always neat, or you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be well-dreſſed:—a dirty ruffle, a torn apron, &amp;c. are ſufficient to diſgrace
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:033601_0267_0FF7A390E6A595D0"/>the moſt ſplendid apparel. Neatneſs is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in your power, and will always ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you reſpectable in whatever rank of life you are placed; but finery without it is nothing more than a ridiculous glare, which is never ſeen but with diſguſt.</p>
                     <p>Faſhion has impoſed ſome general rules, which may innocently be followed under the reſtrictions I have mentioned. Your clothes may be made according to the mode, though the materials which compoſe thern, be leſs coſtly than if they belonged to a dutcheſs. An uncouth, ill-faſhioned habit, derogates even from the importance of a philoſopher; and it is not till after a near acquaintance, that merit is diſcovered through a ſhabby garment—ſo much are mankind governed by appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>"Prithee good Xenocrates (ſaid Plato to his pupil) ſacrifice to the graces." That great man knew how much the mental ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:033601_0268_0FF7A3936AD72DA8"/>compliſhments might be illuſtrated and adorned by a poliſhed exterior;—a wiſe perſon, it is true, would not make this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the criterion of merit, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, would not readily look for worth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath an ungraceful exterior.</p>
                     <p>After all, my dear girls, eſteem the frivolous, though often troubleſome arts of dreſs, but as a tax you are in ſome ſort obliged to pay to the folly of the age. Remember on all occaſions, that external ornaments cannot make you better or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier women. Great minds, however they may have judged it neceſſary to conform to inſignificant cuſtoms, have always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded them in their proper light. The attention ſuch are ſeen to ſhew to the idol faſhion, is only a good natured condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the weakneſs of mankind, in points they judge of an indifferent nature, and much too trifling to become the objects of their ſerious cares. The ſilly and ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant are they who love dreſs for its own ſake.</p>

                     <p>NEXT to our own principles, we are to regard thoſe of our companions; for they are almoſt of as much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to us, as by long and intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance they generally become our own. Virtuous habits are ſtrengthened by example—ſo are vicious ones, but in a much higher degree; nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be a point of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than the choice of companions.</p>
                     <p>A great deal has been written on the ſubject, and every one who has the care of youth, fails not to inculcate the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good company;—the only misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is, that the term has ſeldom been ſufficiently explained, and the young mind is left to annex to it the ideas of birth and fortune, till by degrees the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is ſuppoſed to imply both theſe qualifications.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="278" facs="unknown:033601_0270_0FF7A3968BE034F8"/>
The reſult has been the diſturbance of all order in ſocial life;—each claſs of people quitting their own ſphere to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate with thoſe of ſuperior rank; and theſe again, inſpired by the ſame ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, repel with ſcorn the ambitious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſolicitous only to attract the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſtill greater folks than themſelves. Thus in the room of that ſocial amity with which the human heart ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, it is unhappily divided between the throbbings of ambition, and the pangs of offended pride.</p>
                     <p>It is evident, that in this buſtle, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attention is paid to the accidental cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of rank and affluence, than to real merit; we ſhould not elſe ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſee people of the middling rank, when flattered by the notice of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, ſo elated with the honour of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what they call good company; when perhaps, that ſuperior is conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for almoſt every vice and meanneſs.
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:033601_0271_0FF7A39B079A2AC0"/>This is a grand miſtake ſurely—as fatal to happineſs, as to morals.</p>
                     <p>Good company can only mean perſons of noble ſentiments, refined manners, and enlightened underſtandings. But theſe qualities are not to be expected, where the ſcantineſs of fortune, has abſolutely exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the means of education; for the human mind becomes every thing by culture. It is therefore found, that in the lower ranks of ſociety, where poverty has denied time and abilities for that happy employ, the worſt habits, and moſt depraved morals prevail; for this reaſon you are not to chuſe companions from ſuch a claſs.</p>
                     <p>In fine, your aſſociates muſt be thoſe of a liberal and virtuous education. It may happen you may find a friend of this deſcription, whoſe relative or neceſſary connection, may not be eligible for you. In this caſe ſhe is by no means a proper companion, as her own merit, however
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:033601_0272_0FF7A39C944F14D8"/>great, will not compenſate for the danger you incur in frequently mingling with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of improper character.</p>
                     <p>A cultivated mind is the proper ſoil for every moral and ſocial virtue—it is moſt likely to be found where Heaven has beſtowed an eaſy fortune, conſequently the genteeler ranks of life will be moſt likely to afford you proper companions. But here let merit alone, and not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious circumſtances, influence your ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—deſpiſe that contemptible weakneſs which piques itſelf on the rank, rather than the mental value of an acquaintance; and never let a principle of vanity lead you to the ſervile imitation of vice or folly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſanctioned by wealth or titles. Little minds are ever dazzled by ſhew and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour— it is the property of the enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to diſtinguiſh perſonal worth from external advantages. I ſhould think you diſgraced by an acquaintance with an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, if ſhe was not as much diſtinguiſhed by virtue as power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="281" facs="unknown:033601_0273_0FF7A39E1FF4B5B8"/>
Be careful not to form an acquaintance too haſtily—many a virtuous girl has funk for ever in the eſteem of the world, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen in company with thoſe of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reputation. In vain ſhe declares her ignorance of the real character of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. She having admitted them to her ſociety without the requiſite inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that point, infallibly renders her own prudence ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>A very extenſive acquaintance is not neceſſary to ſocial happineſs. A few ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect friends will moſt conduce to that end; and it is among theſe that
<q>"The free full converſe of the friendly heart"</q>
flows with uninterruption and delight— unfeigned chearfulneſs and real enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exiſt much oftener in theſe little circles, than in large and ceremonious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. But ſhould your ſtation in life render a large acquaintance unavoidable,
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:033601_0274_0FF7A39FB0667508"/>you will obſerve to all, a free unreſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed politeneſs, without admitting every one indiſcriminately to your confidence. Be ever frank and eaſy, without revealing your own ſecrets, or thoſe of your friends, and make none your intimates but thoſe of worth and honour.</p>
                     <p>Much, very much of human happineſs depends on the proper choice of acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance —an ill choſen friend has power to mar our felicity as much as an amiable and faithful one contributes to it. The heart is formed for ſocial intercourſe; and when that intercourſe is founded on the moral, and religious virtues, it gives a zeſt to the other enjoyments of life.</p>

                     <p>THERE are certain reſtrictions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render the gift of ſpeech what the great Creator deſigned it—a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal means of happineſs to his rationl crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The firſt of theſe is an habitual care never to violate the laws of truth. The pleaſures reſulting from mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation vaniſh entirely, when no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence can be placed in the ſpeaker's veracity. Thoſe who ſpeak merely from the ſuggeſtions of imagination, or, what is worſe, malignity, are juſtly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with half the ſtrife that diſturbs the peace of ſociety. Such perſons are the moſt dangerous companions, and need only to be known to be generally diſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and avoided. Indeed, ſo high a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard veracity obtains among people of refinement, that you cannot offer a more groſs affront than to accuſe them of the violation of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="284" facs="unknown:033601_0276_0FF7A3A5B711FDF0"/>
Of all that has been ſaid in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cato's character, nothing reflects ſo great a luſtre on it, as that ſtriking, though tacit eulogium, beſtowed on him in one of the Roman Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where a cauſe being to be tried which required two witneſſes, and one only appearing, the Judge declared he could not diſpenſe with the law, even <hi>though Cato himſelf were the witneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, as Archbiſhop Tillotſon fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves, a conſtant adherence to truth has the leaſt trouble and difficulty in it, it ſits always upon the lips; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a lye is troubleſome, and needs a great many more to make it good.</p>
                     <p>Next to the character of a liar, that of the detracter is the moſt odious—a habit of traducing the reputation of others, by ſpeaking all the ill we have heard of them, or putting the worſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions on their actions, is totally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:033601_0277_0FF7A3A746C2FCD0"/>to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, which breathes nothing but candour and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. There is alſo ſomething extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mean in the practice, as the accuſed perſons have ſeldom an opportunity of refuting the charge. The cruel aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is borne on the wings of ſcandal from circle to circle, nor perhaps reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the injured party till the wound given to reputation is too deep for cure.</p>
                     <p>Barbarous as ſuch a cuſtom is, I need not ſay how greatly it prevails in almoſt all companies. I have, however, the charity to believe it does not always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from malice or envy. When no knowledge has been treaſured up in the mind—no uſeful information acquired, converſation cannot receive aid from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual ſtores—what then, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it?—muſt it flag and ſilence—dreadful ſilence reign?—No, ſomething muſt re-kindle it; and when no ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſubject ariſes, that ſomething muſt be
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:033601_0278_0FF7A3A8D80830F0"/>ſcandal. This, though it may be a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of the crime, is yet no excuſe; for the wounds given by unmeaning ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance are as deep as thoſe inflicted by premeditated rancour. How ſhameful is it that an impertinent eagerneſs for talking ſhould thus wantonly explore the ſecret receſſes of domeſtic life, and preſume to judge of actions, the motives of which cannot be ſcanned by theſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant prattlers!</p>
                     <p>The moſt effectual way to ſecure yourſelves from the commiſſion of this vice, will be the adorning your minds with ſuch acquiſitions of knowledge, and uſeful intelligence, as will enable you to furniſh ſubjects for converſation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſcending to frivolity or detraction. But ſhould you not be ſo happy as to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs theſe deſirable reſources, I hope you will have ſo much candour and good-nature as to be content with being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a dull and lifeleſs companion, rather than indulge an eagerneſs for talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:033601_0279_0FF7A3AD670E5638"/>at the expence of other people's good name.</p>
                     <p>Detraction is not only a violation of the rules of religion, but is alſo ſo impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic a crime, as no one who wiſhes to be well received in the world would ever commit—for a perſon who is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſcandal, is a terror to ſociety; the reſpect they receive, reſembles the homage the Indians are ſaid to pay to the Devil, rather to evade his maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than procure his love. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever curioſity may, for a while, liſten to an ill-natured anecdote, yet be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the relator is regarded with a ſecret diſguſt by every benevolent perſon, who naturally expects to meet the ſame cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious fate, when opportunity ſerves.</p>
                     <p>Good policy will therefore correct a cenſorious diſpoſition; yet, I truſt your reſtraint will be derived from a ſuperior motive, namely, the obligations of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which forbid to ſpeak evil of any,
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:033601_0280_0FF7A3AEF40959A0"/>or to judge uncharitably of another. The conſciouſneſs of having always obeyed theſe divine injunctions, will afford the conſolation, under the pain you may perhaps feel from the unjuſt aſperſions of others—for ſuch, probably, you will meet with in your journey of life, as no innocence can always be a defence from unmerited cenſure; and when this chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be your caſe, you will derive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable comfort, from the reflection of having treated the world more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly than it has treated you.</p>
                     <p>Whatever you ſay, ſhould be meant for the entertainment or inſtruction of the company, rather than the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vanity. Many are ſo much actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by ſelf-love, that they never ſpeak or act, but to be applauded. Hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes affectation—the moſt diſguſting qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in nature. Diliver your ſentiments as they occur, without affecting more graces in your tone or geſture than
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:033601_0281_0FF7A3B085DEE630"/>are your own—theſe, well managed, will be enough to render you amiable. All may be agreeable in their natural ſphere, but when they innovate on that of others, the attempt is commonly fruſtrated.</p>
                     <p>Above all, never affect that kind of wit which aims at ſevere retorts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee—it has generally ill-nature for its baſis, and ſeldom makes a ſally but it procures an enemy, if it does not loſe a friend. There is nothing in it to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired but the readineſs of thought, which gives it birth—but when the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſeems <hi>aimed</hi> at, rather than <hi>poſſeſſed,</hi> it is abſolutely contemptible.</p>
                     <p>In fine—ſincerity, candour, and good ſenſe, muſt be the ornaments of your converſation. Politeneſs will give an agreeable luſtre to theſe qualities, but remember, it can never be a ſubſtitute for them.</p>

                     <p>"HAIL politeneſs, power divine!" ſays the ſonnet, and ſurely no neceſſary invocation; for politeneſs, dear girls, is the friend of ſocial happineſs and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic peace; if it was the faſhion, in this age, to have houſehold gods, I would ſurely give it a pre-eminent place amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>I know not how it happens, but peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſeem to think, they are obliged to be polite every where but at home—and there it is they are moſt required to be ſo; for the refined ſatisfaction of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intercourſe, cannot long ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. I am convinced, that domeſtic quarrels and diſguſts, would much ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer ariſe, if the parties were always as polite as affectionate.</p>
                     <p>But what is politeneſs—is it the law of faſhion, or a ſyſtem of rules?—No—it
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:033601_0283_0FF7A3B6EB1F4A98"/>is the divine principle of benevolence, branched into a thouſand little chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and flowing through all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutiae of human life. Education may improve, but can never give it, for it muſt be founded in the ſoul, or is never ſeen in full perfection. A painter may learn the rules of deſign, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of colours; but if he poſſeſſes not the enthuſiaſm of the art, his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will be lifeleſs and inſipid.</p>
                     <p>Politeneſs is that a miable diſpoſition, which delights in the happineſs of others—conſults their eaſe—prevents their wants—and yields them every poſſible convenience. This is the ſource of thoſe civilities and attentions, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a well-bred perſon—without it, etiquette dwindles into unmeaning cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                     <p>You perceive then, that not only an attention to external graces, but a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:033601_0284_0FF7A3B878FB1110"/>of the diſpoſition is neceſſary to conſtitute a polite perſon. Acquire the amiable temper I have deſcribed, and you will infallibly pleaſe with that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive eaſe which is thought ſo requiſite to be attained, that the world has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in its room its wretched reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, effrontery:—but no more like the amiable original, than an ordinary ſtatue to the Venus of Medicis.</p>
                     <p>I have often thought, that the beſt Chriſtian is likely to be the moſt polite perſon. This is an aſſertion you have not been uſed to hear, yet may well enough be warranted by the tenor of the goſpel precepts, which inculcate the being ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of another's weakneſs—to prefer each other in honor—to give reſpect where due—with others to the like purpoſe. Now if theſe excellent leſſons contain (as I think will be allowed) the ſubſtance of what, at this day, is termed good breeding. St. Paul muſt be a better

                     <p>NOTHING is more talked of than religion—nothing leſs underſtood—with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comprehending what it really is, the ſpirit of bigotry would arrogate the whole, nor allow of its being without the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted pale of a particular ſect.</p>
                     <p>I have juſter notions of religion—ſee it as it is—not a mode of ceremonies, but a divine principle influencing the whole moral conduct; its ſimple, fixed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſenſe, is briefly love of God, and good will to mankind. This, dear girls, is the ſum of all religion; without it, vain were the oblations of the Jewiſh church—vain are the ceremonials of the Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>The "love of God," is an expreſſion that, of late years, has been as groſſly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as the word religion. Strange as it may
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:033601_0287_0FF77EB8FB519BA0"/>appear, there have been thoſe, who lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt immoral lives, have ſtiled themſelves the lovers of the God of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—whoſe tongues could utter a pious eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, while their hands were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the moſt flagitious crimes. But be not deceived—this exalted character belongs neither to bigotry nor enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm. The love of God is not a paſſion, but a rational principle; it is thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of reverence and gratitude, which naturally ariſe in a generous mind when reflecting on one ſupreme beneficent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who is the immediate author of all good, and the fountain of all perfection. This conviction is the parent of unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed piety; the ſoul cannot but adore the Being ſhe believes to be all-wiſe, almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and eternal;—ſhe cannot but love him who is the ſource of unnumbered bleſſings; nor chuſe, but dread to offend him whoſe nature ſhe believes to be holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Hence the ſource of moral virtue—ſin is avoided, becauſe diſpleaſing to the
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:033601_0288_0FF7A3C1F58969F0"/>will of the Deity; and virtuous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are acquired, becauſe agreeable to a Power who is able to reward every endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pleaſe him, with eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Such a filial, rational love, muſt be the fruit of every mind that is not ignorant of the being and attributes of God;—or that has not received from bigotry or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, any miſtaken notions of him. To prevent being diſturbed by the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual pride of hypocritical fanatics, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there is an invariable teſt by which you may know if you have the love of God. Aſk your own heart, if it ſeeks the favour of the Deity above every other conſideration? If it values this more than its deareſt intereſts, and even life itſelf, a ready affirmative puts the queſtion out of all doubt.</p>
                     <p>Be aſſured, my dear girls, that nothing ſo highly elevates and adorns

No one who has experienced the viciſſitude of ſublunary things, but muſt highly value the privilege of poſſeſſing a friend, that would at all times be acceptable—ready to hear the complaints of affliction, and all powerful to relieve them.</p>
                     <p>Such a friend you may enjoy in the Divine Being; of what conſequence is it then that you acquire a taſte for the exerciſes of devotion; that you cultivate a friendſhip with heaven, and accuſtom your hearts to talk with God. This is an emphatical expreſſion of David, and gives you an idea of rational and ſincere prayer—which conſiſts not in formal addreſſes, but is the genuine language of the heart. Such a divine intimacy has ſomething in it extremely ſuitable to the nobleſt ſenſations of the ſoul; and
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:033601_0290_0FF7A3C5F65A0448"/>therefore may well be ſought after as a ſource of refined and exquiſite felicity.

                     <head>LETTER XVII.</head>
                     <p>THE generality of people ſtyle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, without underſtanding the value or the neceſſity of chriſtianity; and perhaps neither the one nor the other can be ſeen in a proper light, without taking a comparative view of the human ſoul before and after the fall.</p>
                     <p>It is not for my humble pen to illuſtrate the excellency of a ſyſtem which has God himſelf for its author—nor is it my deſign to attempt a taſk ſo far above my abilities: yet that you may not wholly take your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon truſt, I would call your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what man was when firſt created.</p>
                     <p>But a little inferior to angels, his reaſon was clear, his ſoul all purity, and his mind all intelligence—fit companion for natures wholly ſpiritual, and enjoying the moſt familiar intercourſe with them. That
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:033601_0292_0FF7A3CB1F820A40"/>grand queſtion which has ſince agitated the ſchools of philoſophy, of what was the chief good of man, was all apparent to the firſt of the human race: he ſaw perfectly clear, that it conſiſted in the entire aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his will to that of the Deity—and in the purſuit found a full unmixed felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But he was created with the power of doing otherwiſe, or where would have been the merit of obedience? The duty of free agency, muſt be far preferable to that which ariſes from blind neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>Adam continued a happy being as long as his will remained conſonant to that of his Maker; but at the inſtant it deviated therefrom, he fell from happineſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The conciſeneſs of the ſcripture hiſtory, leaves unthinking minds in doubt as to the nature of Adam's tranſgreſſion, but undoubtedly it originated in the mere deſire of doing contrary to the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;—he forgot that the Diety was his happineſs, and he ſought it in his own will.
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:033601_0293_0FF7A3CCABE51750"/>It was herein he ſinned, and not ſimply by eating the forbidden fruit, for at the very moment Adam became capable of imagining there might be a good abſtract from the favour of God—that moment he fell.</p>
                     <p>The Creator ſaw at one comprehenſive view, the miſeries which would accrue to mankind, from the voluntary perverſion of the intellectual and moral powers;— then was the ſcheme of Chriſtianity deviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as an effectual means of reſtoring hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature to the happineſs and perfection it originally poſſeſſed. The purpoſed bleſſing was graciouſly announced in that prediction, that the poſterity of Eve ſhould cruſh the ſerpent's head.</p>
                     <p>The human reaſon thus clouded, it is almoſt ſurpriſing to reflect by what rapid ſteps the world became immerſed in the worſt ignorance and vice. Thoſe who ſtill retained ſome idea of the Sovereign Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:033601_0294_0FF7A468B9A47070"/>had recourſe to a viſible ſymbol of his Majeſty; for their intellectual faculties were too groſs to apprehend an immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Deity—it ſoon happened that the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol itſelf was made the object of divine worſhip; and hence, doubtleſs, the origin of idolatry, which in the time of Abraham had ſo generally ſpread over the earth, that it appeared neceſſary to the Supreme Governor of the Univerſe to call that good man from his country and his kindred to ordain him the father of a nation; who being, by numerous and peculiar laws, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the reſt of the would, might preſerve, uncorrupt, the knowledge of the Divine Nature. The Bible will convince you how ineffectual, not only theſe laws, but the frequent and ſignal manifeſtations of Almighty power were to ſecure that people from the groſſeſt idolatry, the rights of which were now become ſo terrible to the imagination, that they even burnt their children alive, in ſacrifices to their horrid idols. What a picture is here of human
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:033601_0295_0FF77ECDA82F6250"/>nature! that nature which once ſo nearly approached the angelic! Do you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſee the neceſſity of a Redeemer? Let us purſue the thread of hiſtory, and take a ſuperficial view of the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated nations which peopled the earth before the glorious aera of his appearance.</p>
                     <p>The Egyptians were very early eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for learning, laws and arts—they were a numerous, powerful, and wealthy people, but ſo groſsly idolatrous, that they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhipped images, but beaſts, inſects, and even vegetables. The manufactures and extenſive commerce of Phoenicia, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome advance in refinement—but national intercourſe in thoſe wretched times ſerved but to promulgate national idolatries. Babylon, that mighty ſeat of empire ſurpaſſed moſt other nations in the ſuperb materials of her Gods. Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers there obſerved the motions of the Heavens, and bowed in adoration to the ſplendid hoſts that adorned them. Cyrus,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:033601_0296_0FF77ECF37BD64D8"/>who erected the Perſian on the ruins of the Babyloniſh Monarchy, knew nothing of the Almighty Being who named him, an age before he had exiſtence, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Liberty to his captive people. Alexander, who in his turn ſubverted this extenſive empire, could only blend his Grecian idols with the Perſian—for dark, deplorably dark, was every corner of the habitable earth, except the inconſiderable land of Jukea, where only a few deſpiſed, enfeebled tribes, poſſeſſed the light of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred knowledge.</p>
                     <p>What a ſpectacle for the Father of the univerſe! who produced a world to know him and be happy! how much muſt his divine compaſſion be excited, on contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating his glorious work in ruins!—to redeem it was an effort worthy of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>We now come to the enlightened ages of Greece and Rome—a period when I fancy I ſee the human ſoul like a brilliant
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:033601_0297_0FF77ED183CD30B8"/>gem, illuſtrious in the duſt. What noble ſtruggles did then the human reaſon make to free itſelf from the incumbent load or darkneſs and error! Then lived thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous worthies, whoſe names are yet precious to poſterity. What greatneſs of ſoul—what a taſte for ſolid glory—what elevated ſentiments did they not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? Yet theſe men, ſo far ſuperior to the reſt of their ſpecies, acknowledged a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of deities, whoſe moral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were infinitely inferior to their own, and to whom they ſcrupled not to aſcribe actions which themſelves would have bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to acknowledge. Every paſſion of the human mind was perſonified, and deified; ſtatues graced every corner of their ſtreets. Yet were there not wanting ſome among them who made bold advances in ſearch of better informatiòn—like benighted tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, they followed the moſt diſtant gleam of light, yet all they could obtain was doubt and obſcurity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="306" facs="unknown:033601_0298_0FF77EEC236343E0"/>
At this period, when reaſon had done all it could do to regain its native rights and privileges—the Saviour of the world appeared, at whoſe ſacred preſence idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try fled, and the knowledge of the one true God began to enlighten mankind. They were no longer compelled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, "Where is God our maker?" They knew him, and were inſtructed in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip. The doctrines which the divine Meſſiah taught, eminently tended to reſtore human nature to the rectitude and happineſs it had loſt—they were calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to harmonize the paſſions, regulate the affections, and exalt the ſoul to a ſenſe of her own dignity, by revealing in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt terms, the immortality of her nature—a point which philoſophy had long ſought to explore through the dim veil of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conjecture.</p>
                     <p>A curſory view of the tenets of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is ſufficient to evince, that they are deſigned to eſtabliſh the happineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:033601_0299_0FF7A3CE5B7DEB08"/>even in the preſent life. Conſider the benevolence and charity they incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate—the patience, meekneſs, moderation, contempt of worldly pleaſures and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the generous clemency to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; with the reſt of that bright aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of virtues they enjoin, and you will confeſs it a matter of wonder that the felicity of Eden is not already reſtored to thoſe countries where the religion of Chriſt is profeſſed—and the reaſon it is not ſo can be none other, than that of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands who daily make profeſſion of it, ſo few have a competent knowledge of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and deſign. Born in a Chriſtian land, they think ſuch a ſcrutiny ſuperfluous. Thus they call themſelves Chriſtians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any thing of the ſpirit of Chriſt. —And thus the human race is ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to a thouſand miſeries, for want of applying to themſelves the remedy which alone could put an end to moral evil.</p>
                     <p>

May you, my dear girls, be effectually convinced of the ineſtimable value of this divine diſpenſation, and think with Dr. Young, that
<q>"A Chriſtian is the higheſt ſtyle of man."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are no virtuous diſpoſitions—no generous affections—no truly noble ſentiments, that are not compriſed in that ſublime character. Poſſeſs it, my young friends, for no higher diſtinction, or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter felicity, can poſſibly be wiſhed you by CORNELIA.</p>
