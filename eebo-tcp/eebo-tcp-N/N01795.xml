            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Papers and Pamphlets you lately ſent me were a very acceptable Preſent, for which I return you hearty thanks. We that live more than half a hundred Miles from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, are apt to be very fond of knowing what's a doing among you; tho' ſometimes after we know it, we find too much reaſon to lament it. So it hath happened in part to me. The pleaſure of a Letter from my Friend, and of learning the Remarkable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Town was conſiderably dampt by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern which one of the Pamphlets gave me. I mean that Entitled, <hi>The Diſtreſſed State of the Town of Boſton.</hi> Not that my Perſonal Intereſt is any more affected by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Pamphlet, than that of almoſt any ordinary man in the Province. My Intereſt either doth already, or will very quickly (as you well know) lye chiefly the ſame way with the Intereſt of the Author of the Pamphlet, who is (I ſuppoſe) one of them that caſt their Bread upon the Waters. But my trouble proceeded only from a Sincere Regard to the Publick Welfare, which I apprehend the Gentleman hath utterly miſtaken, &amp; even the true Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his own Town too; &amp; yet he hath ſet his Miſtakes (as I take 'em to be) in ſo plauſible a light, as will be very likely to lead many others aſtray with him; And ſhould the Government and Country fall into his meaſures, I am greatly deceived if we ſhould ever ſee good Days again, ſo long as ſuch meaſures ſhould be purſued. Beſides, the Gentleman hath repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented things in ſuch a ſmart and moving manner as
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002128_0003_0FBC21654BFF9C08"/>
(I fear) will tend much to ſtir &amp; irritate men's Paſſions and revive thoſe Heats and Animoſities, which have done us too much miſchief already.</p>
            <p>However, I don't imagine he did this with any deſign to diſturb the publick Peace. I ſuppoſe theſe things lay much upon his Spirits; and therefore when he ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to writing, his heart (unobſerved by him) waxed hot within him, and that naturally and almoſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily enlivened and ſharpened his expreſſion.</p>
            <p>As to your deſire of my Thoughts upon the ſubject, the place which I live in is ſo remote, that I cannot be informed of the certain truth of ſeveral matters of Fact, which might ſerve much to enlighten and direct me; but yet I am perſwaded from the Reaſons of things, that (as I ſaid before) the Gentleman is utterly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his Notions of the true Intereſt of his Country. However, I am liable to miſtakes as well as he; I muſt leave it therefore with you, and with any to whom you ſhall think good to communicate my thoughts, to judge of the juſtneſs of them, and whether my Reaſons are ſufficient to ſupport them.</p>
            <p>In ſetting down my thoughts, I ſhall take notice,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of ſome ill Uſes which have been made of our Province Bills, and ſome unhappy Conſequences of making ſuch evil uſes of them. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall make ſome Remarks upon the moſt obſervable Paſſages in the Pamphlet it's ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, concerning the ill Uſes which have been made of our Province Bills, and the unhappy Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch uſes.</p>
            <p>When the Government firſt iſſued out our Province Bills, the <hi>Trading Part</hi> of the Country found themſelves furniſhed with a <hi>New Medium of Exchange,</hi> which would anſwer the ends of Trade well enough among ourſelves: Upon this they quickly improved the Advantage put into their hands to import foreign Commodities in far greater quantities than the produce of the Country would make Returns for; and therefore they ſoon began to export the Silver Mony paſſing among us to make Returns with; which Silver they bought up with the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002128_0004_0FBC21676A13D5D8"/>
               <hi>new Medium</hi> which the Government had put into their hands. When by this means Silver became a little ſcarce, they were obliged to give ſome conſiderable advance in Province Bills to purchaſe it. And this advance became greater ſtill and greater in proportion as Silver grew more and more ſcarce. Beſides, which I think ſome have remarked, that it received an obſervable Increaſe, upon the Poſtponing the Taxes, and the Emiſſions of Loan Mony once and again; ſo that it was lately at the rate of about <hi>Twelve Shillings</hi> an Ounce, and I ſuppoſe it continues thereabouts ſtill.</p>
            <p>Now Silver having for this Reaſon been reſerved for divers Years paſt to be ſold for Exportation, by this means Paper gradually became almoſt the only Medium of Exchange among our ſelves: The very <hi>Counters</hi> which paſs among us for <hi>Penies</hi> had like all to have been ſwept away: Many of the Traders ſometime after the Emiſſion of the Loan Mony (as I remember) buying them at conſiderable Advance in Province Bills to ſend away, tho' they paſs but for <hi>half-pence</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; ſo vile were the <hi>Province Bills</hi> in the Eyes of the Men, who now cry, they ſhall be undone if they have not more of them, that <hi>they would laviſh them away at the rate of Twelve Shillings for an Ounce of Silver, and give four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pence (as I think I have been told) ſome of them did for a dozen Counters, which they knew would go but for half-pence a piece abroad!</hi> And I deſire to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>very Men who turn poor Labourers and Trad<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>  men off with one half or Two Thirds Goods, can't still find Province Bills enough to purchaſe Silver at the rate of about Twelve Shillings an Ounce, whenever they hear of any to be ſold?</hi> But this only by the <hi>By</hi> at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now as the Value of Paper hath gradually ſunk in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with Silver, ſo the Merchants have advanced upon their Goods in ſome proportion, and ſo the Price of the Country's produce hath been gradually riſing alſo</hi>; ſave that thro' the abundant Bleſſing of God upon the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry of the Land laſt Year, the plenty of Proviſions hath lowered the Price of it for the preſent; but had it not been for the plenty, the price of it would have
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002128_0005_0FBC2168DFABF8A0"/>
been as extravagant and the ſale as quick as ever. ſomething of the ſame nature may be ſaid of our Oyl, which partly thro' the good Succeſs of our Whale-men laſt Winter, but more eſpecially by an Accident (which I forbear to mention) is ſaid to be falling too. But as for other things which have not met with ſome ſuch accident<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="7 letters">
                  <desc>〈7 letters〉</desc>
               </gap>ration, as far as I can learn, their price continues as high as ever.</p>
            <p>That this is a true account of the riſing of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and Neceſſaries of Life to the extravagant price they have been at for ſome Years paſt, is evident, <hi>becauſe any man might all along, and may ſtill with Silver Mony, at ſeventeen peny weight, buy almoſt any Commodity or Neceſſary, at pretty near the ſame rate he might before our Province Bills were first iſſued out.</hi> I ſay almoſt any Commodity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at pretty near the ſame rate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe I am ſenſible that in ſome things, at ſome times there hath been a difference eſpecially thoſe things that are proper to be exported to other Countries, as Fiſh, Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) for which there is another manifeſt Reaſon to be aſſigned, and that is this, That the Importation of foreign Commodities was for ſome Years ſo vaſt, that all the Silver our Merchants could procure, and the whole Produce of the Country beſides, were not ſufficient to anſwer for it. <hi>This obliged our Merchants to catch greedily at any thing that would ſerve to make Returns with, and this gave the Poſſeſſors of ſuch things an advantage to raiſe the price of them, even above the difference which there was between Paper and Silver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Trading part of the Country making an ill uſe of the advantage which the Emiſſion of Province Bills gave them, by importing a vaſt quantity of needleſs foreign Commodities, have in the firſt place found themſelves neceſſitated to buy up, and ſend off all our Silver and Gold to the perplexing and almoſt ruining the whole Country: and ſecondly becauſe Theſe and the whole Produce of the Country together were not enough to make Returns with, therefore they have catch'd ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly at every thing fit to be exported, and by doing ſo have rais'd the price of ſuch things: And this they have
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002128_0006_0FBC216B65BC04D8"/>
done to their own Confuſion, for now the price of ſuch things is ſo high that there is hardly any thing f<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to be exported, that will turn to any account in other Countries; <hi>And ſo no man knows where to make an Adven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, to ſee a new peny for an old one:</hi> Not becauſe there is not mony enough ſtill to purchaſe all the produce of the Country fit for Exportation (for if there were not, and ſo theſe things lay upon the Producer's hands, I am ſure they would ſoon be cheap enough) but becauſe we value our Paper mony ſo little, and prize our Country's produce ſo high, that every thing coſts more pence here among our ſelves, than it will fetch again abroad in Fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reign Countries. Now whether Emitting more Bills be the way to encreaſe our Value for them, or to lower the price of our Country's Produce, I leave the World to Judge.</p>
            <p>But this Miſchief of ſending off our Silver and Gold, and raiſing the Country's produce to ſuch an extravagant price, is not all, for before the Law for ſhortning Credit, the Gentlemen concerned in Trade (to clear their Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and Shops of Goods the faſter and make room for a new Store, and Enliven Trade) were very fond of Truſting out great quantities of Goods, with almoſt any Body that would take them, And I doubt the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour prevails two much ſtill. Now we ſimple Country People being mightily pleas'd with fine things far fetcht and dear bought (ſo long as we could have goods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying ready mony for them) made no ſcruple, many of us, to take up much more upon truſt than we earnt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to pay for, hoping that a plentiful Crop of Corn or ſome other Smile of Providence would enable us to pay for all, one time or other. And ſince, when we have been dunn'd and worried by our Creditors, we have cry'd out for more mony too. Whereas the truth of the Caſe is, if there had been a Million of Province Bills Emitted, we could not have paid our Debts, unleſs Mony had been given us, or we had ſold or Mortgaged our Lands to procure it, for we have had nothing to ſpare, which was worth mony, but what we have had and may ſtill have mony for (unleſs it be Proviſion juſt at this time
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002128_0007_0FBC216CA2F81278"/>
by reaſon of the preſent plenty of it) but all we could produce hath not been near enough to diſcharge the vaſt Debts we had fooliſhly contracted.</p>
            <p>And now what ſhall be done in ſuch unhappy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? Why, ſay the Traders, <hi>Do but two things and the Wheels will all be ſet a moving again, and every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy almost will have an opportunity to improve his Talent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let the Act for Limitation of Credit be repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If this be done, Country People will throng our Warehouſes and Shops again, and take as much on truſt as ever. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let a private Bank be eſtabliſhed. This all honeſt well-meaning People will go and Mortgage their Eſtates to, for mony to pay us for the Goods we have <hi>truſted</hi> them with: We ſhall moſt of us be Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers our ſelves, and by that means (firſt) we ſhall have mens Eſtates mortgaged to us. And then (in the next place) we our ſelves ſhall get the very mony again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for which thoſe Eſtates were mortgaged. When we have gotten ſuch a fine ſum of mony, we ſhall ſnatch at every thing fit for Exportation more briskly than ever. This will raiſe the price of ſuch things higher than it hath been yet, and then it will turn to but little Account to ſend them elſewhere; and ſo we ſhall complain again, <hi>that no man knows where to make an Adventure to ſee a new peny for an old one</hi>: Unleſs (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) thoſe of us that are Bankers, ſhould have our Mouths partly ſtopt with forfeited Mortgages, and the reſt of us ſhould take better Care than we uſed to do, to truſt none but ſuch as have good real Eſtates, which will pay for all at laſt.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood to think, that the Author of the <hi>Distreſſed State,</hi> &amp;c. and other Gentlemen in Trade, who wiſh to have the Limitation Act repealed and a private Bank eſtabliſhed, do really ſay, or ſo much as think within themſelves, that all the above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pernicious conſequences would follow thereupon. Far be it from me to imagine ſo vile a thing of them. My opinion is, that they are ſenſible that ſuch a Repeal and ſuch an Eſtabliſhment would give them ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

Relief, and that they have never look'd throughly into the Train of wretched Conſequences which will enſue.</p>
            <p>I have therefore mentioned theſe things only as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which I apprehend will unnavoidably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from the natural operation of things, upon the Repeal of that Act, and the ſetting up of a private Bank, whether Men are ſenſible of it now or not. But I believe the Conſequences will appear genuine to every diſintereſted Perſon (as ſoon as ever they are ſuggeſted to him) without any Argument to demonſtrate them to be ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I proceed now in the ſecond place, to make ſome Remarks upon the moſt obſervable Paſſages of the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet it's ſelf. In doing which I ſhall have frequent recourſe to the Truths already advanced.</p>
            <p>Boſton, <hi>which was within theſe ten Years one of the moſt flouriſhing Towns in America, will within half ſo many more Years be the most miſerable Town,</hi> &amp;c. page 1. The flouriſhing of Boſton depends upon the flouriſhing of its Trade. The Diſtreſſed State of the Trade of <hi>Boſton,</hi> is not owing to the want of Province Bills wherewith to purchaſe the produce of the Country to be exported on Adventures. All the produce of the Country is now bought up, and moſt of it at an extravagant price too; and all the Silver and Gold beſides, as faſt as it comes in, by our Authors own Acknowledgment, <hi>p.</hi> 3. The Difficulty is owing therefore to the high price of the Country's produce, that it won't turn to account to ſend it elſewhere. And this is a miſchief the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have brought upon themſelves by the means abovementioned; and the emitting more Bills of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit will rather encreaſe than leſſen the evil, becauſe it will occaſion the Value of the Bills ſinking yet lower, and the produce of the Country riſing higher in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
            <p>But if there were nothing of all this, yet I ſhould not wonder that the Trade of <hi>Boſton</hi> fails now conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably; and I believe it will continue to do ſo (at leaſt for a time) more and more. For this I think I can give two good reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002128_0009_0FBC216F9BE2E2B0"/>1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Several other Towns in this and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Provinces, which during the late French War, depended chiefly upon Supplies from <hi>Boſton,</hi> and traded themſelves but little, and ſome not at all to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts, are now getting more and more into a foreign Trade, to the ſupplying in good meaſure not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only, but of the adjacent Country alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The extravagant Price foreign Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities have been at for ſome years paſt, hath put Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People lately upon making more for themſelves and buying leſs from abroad. And this I hope they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do ſtill more &amp; more; for which reaſon I could almoſt wiſh, that the price of foreign Goods might yet continue as high as ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Medium of Exchange is ſo exhauſted, that in a little time we ſhall not have wherewith to buy our daily Bread,</hi> p. 1. Actions ſpeak louder than Words, and with more truth and certainty. It is a certain Truth, that the greater want men feel of any thing, the more they value it, and the more loath they are to part with it. Therefore I beg you, Sir, to inform me whether your Merchants can ſtill find Province Bills to laviſh away at the rate of <hi>Twelve Shillings</hi> an Ounce for Silver, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they can hear of any to be ſold. If this be the Caſe (as I doubt it is, for our Author himſelf confeſſes, <hi>p.</hi> 3. that Silver and Gold is bought up yet, as faſt as it comes in) then 'tis certain, the Merchants have Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um enough to carry on the ſame Trade ſtill, which hath hurt the Country and themſelves too all along, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting not only all the produce of the Country bought at an extravagant Price, but alſo all the Silver and Gold they can get beſides, in order to bring in a needleſs exceſſive quantity of foreign Commodities, or to pay for them which are already brought in. And whilſt this Trade is driven, 'tis vain to look for better Times. For while more is imported from other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and conſumed among us, than our own produce alone can ballance, we muſt continue growing poorer daily. And while there are ſo many Province Bills ſtanding out, as that Merchants can find their Intereſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002128_0010_0FBC21729BBADC98"/>
in buying Silver with them, moſt things will unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably continue dear, in proportion to the difference the Merchants make between Paper and Silver.</p>
            <p>And indeed if Province Bills were become ſo ſcarce, that the Merchants cou'd not catch at the produce of the Country ſo eagerly as to hold up the Extravagant Price of it, and ſo had no occaſion, nor indeed poſſibilty of ſparing them to buy Silver, I don't ſee that any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would be put to much greater difficulties than they are now. For if it were once come to this, that the Merchants cou'd not find their intereſt in exchanging Province Bills at any advance for Silver, then our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Bills would be equally prized, and would purchaſe as much as Silver at <hi>ſeventeen peny weight,</hi> as indeed they ought: And ſo the price of all things would fall in proportion.</p>
            <p>Now if by the lowering of the price of other things, Twenty Shillings will purchaſe me as much a while hence as Forty will now, then when ſuch time comes, I ſhall be able to ſhift as well with Twenty, as I can now with Forty. So that the growing Scarcity of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Bills, ſeems to be the only means to raiſe the Value of them, &amp; to leſſen the price of the Country's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. And when once our Bills are valued as high as Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, then the Silver and Gold, which our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acknowledges comes in, will be ſure to ſtay among us; and not before. Then alſo the cheapneſs of things fit to be Exported, would ſoon teach our Merchants where to make Adventures to ſee ſomething more than a new peny for an old one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next comes a complaint of the vaſt number of Law ſuits, of Writs out against honeſt Houſekeepers, who can't raiſe mony to pay their Debts, unleſs they will ſell their Houſes at half value. And this becauſe they are oblig'd to work for half or two thirds Goods.</hi> With us in the Country Eſtates are near as high in Value as ever. No man hath Houſes or Lands to ſell, but what may have Mony for them if he be reaſonable in his Demands. If Eſtates are ſunk near half the value in Boſton, I deſire to be informed, whether Numbers of Tradeſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

have not removed thence into the Country within theſe few Years? And whether by this means Tenements and Houſes have not been emptied of their Inhabitants? If this be the caſe, 'tis no wonder their price is fallen; for who that hath an Houſe to live in himſelf, would buy one (for ought he knows) to ſtand empty? Or who that has no Houſe of his own, would give a great price for one, when enough others ſtand empty ready to receive him for an eaſy Rent?</p>
            <p>I deſire alſo to be informed what it was that drove theſe Labourers and Tradſmen out of <hi>Boſton?</hi> Whether it was not being turn'd off with half Goods, by them that ſav'd their Bills to buy Silver, that they might ſend for more Goods, and ſo pay their Labourers again after the ſame manner? If this be ſo, the caſe of your Labourers is much to be pitied, and they would conſult their own Intereſt if more of them would remove into the Country. We want their Labour, and ſhould be glad to give them their Wages. We can't make the improvement of our Lands which we deſire, for want of Labourers: Labourers think us obliged to them, if they will work for us at almoſt any rate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Law which was made about Twenty Months ſince to ſhorten Credit, happened to be very ill timed,</hi> &amp;c. I alſo am of the ſame Opinion but for a very different reaſon; And I will add, not <hi>ſo effectual</hi> as were to be wiſhed neither, I think not <hi>ſo effectual,</hi> becauſe ſo long a time as two Years was allow'd for truſting; and ſo people have not been ſufficiently diſcouraged from running needleſly into Debt. Whereas had the time been limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to but a quarter or half a Year, far the greateſt part of the Debts, which our Author complains men are now arreſted for, had never been contracted. And I think it was ill timed, becauſe it was not made many Years ago: If it had, and had been made ſo ſtrict as to have utterly prevented truſting one another in Trade, I am ſure the Silver and Gold could never have been ſwept away, nor any of the Calamities we are now groaning under been brought upon us. For it is eaſie to ſee, that if we had never truſted one another, the worſt Husbands
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002128_0012_0FBC2174E546F418"/>
of us all could not have ſpent more than we earnt; for when we muſt pay ready Mony for every thing we buy, we can't buy more than we earn Mony to pay for; unleſs we borrow Mony at Intereſt to ſupport our Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance; a thing which but few would have been ſo fooliſh as to have done. Indeed when Debts are already contracted, Do but ſet up a Bank to borrow of, and we have found from ſad experience already, that men will be ready enough to mortgage their Eſtates for mony to pay their Debts. But (I ſay again) where Debts were not before contracted, few men would have been ſo fooliſh, as to borrow Mony at Intereſt to provide needleſs Fineries and Gew-Gaws for their Families. The Folly of ſo few could not have affected the Country. Now as none of us could have ſpent more than we earnt, had we not truſted one another, ſo doubtleſs many people in the Country wou'd have been ſo prudent as not to ſpend ſo much. And had ſome earnt more than they ſpent, and none been in a capacity to ſpend more than they earnt, I am ſure the Country in general muſt have been on the thriving hand: It could not have conſumed ſo much in foreign Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as it would have raiſed of it's own Produce. The Exportation therefore would have been greater than the Importation of foreign Commodities; and ſo Silver and Gold, inſtead of being exported at the rate it hath been, would have been continually coming in to make the Ballance.</p>
            <p>And as, if we had never fallen into the way of Truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſhould never have come into the Difficulties we now labour under, ſo, if we cou'd all agree to leave it quite off, it would immediately begin to turn the Scales in our Favour: For when no man can conſume more than the yearly product of his Husbandry, Manu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>facture, Fiſhery, &amp;c. will furniſh him with mony to pay for, if at the ſame time there be a number of People who wont ſpend all their yearly produce for foreign Commodities; then it is plain, that the yearly Produce of the Country muſt be more than the Conſumption oe it; and if the yearly produce of the Country be morf
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002128_0013_0FBC217666ABEED0"/>
than it's Conſumption, then there will be yearly a Surplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Produce of the Country to be exported. For this overplus (part of our Export) it will be to no purpoſe to bring in foreign Commodites, becauſe the Country will not conſume ſuch a quantity: Therefore our Merchants muſt have their Returns for this Surpluſage <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our Produce in Gold or Silver, <hi>Immediately,</hi> unleſs they have Debts to pay firſt in foreign Countries. All this (I think) is as plain and certain as a Mathematical Demonſtration, and I challenge any man to confute it. I dont therefore ſee need of any other Project. Do but wholly leave off truſting, this alone will do the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and make all things begin to go well quickly. If you object, That it is impracticable to contrive a Law ſo as to put an utter end to Truſting; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that is a Miſtake. I think if I had time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the Argument, I could eaſily tell how an effectual Stop might be put to truſting by a Law, in ſuch a natural and neceſſary way, as that hardly any body would ever come to ſuffer the Penalty of it; and then certainly, no body hath any reaſon to fear it.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it is the Duty of Civil Rulers to conſult the Welfare of the Publick. Our Legiſlators ſaw the Door, at which all our Calamities have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in upon us, ſtanding wide open: They have puffit it partly to; and ſo have in ſome meaſure checkt the madneſs of the People, who without Fear or Wit were running into Debt, to their own Ruin, and the Ruin of them that truſted them, and of the whole Country. And now whether what our Legiſlators did, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Juſtice and Mercy, let the World judge I am only ſorry that the Door was not cloſe ſhut and barr'd. If it had been ſo, we ſhou'd have felt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable effects of it before now. There would have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no opportunity for the Oppreſſion complain'd of p. 2. And the Mercy of the Government in hindering inconſiderate People from doing themſelves harm, would have prevented the need of Private Perſons extending their Compaſſion and forbearance to <hi>them</hi> whom they had dealt much more kindly with, if they had refuſed to truſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002128_0014_0FBC2178E20219B8"/>I ſhall add one thing more, with reference to the Limitation of Credit, which I dont remember that any of the Writers about our preſent difficulties have taken any notice of. Nothing is more certain, than that a Trade may be gainful (at leaſt for a time) to Merchants, which yet may prove <hi>ruinous</hi> to their Country. It is ſaid the Trade with <hi>France</hi> would ruin <hi>England</hi> by draining it of its Mony, if the dangerous Importations from <hi>France</hi> were not diſcouraged by exceſſive Duties in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. England</hi> being a Sovereign State, may ſecure it's ſelf this way; but we who are a poor dependent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, may not diſcourage ſome Importations which we may think injurious to us, by incumbering them with heavy Duties. The only way we have to ſecure our ſelves, is to put an end to Truſting, or to allow but a very ſhort time for it. For if People may not only pay out all the Mony they earn for foreign Goods, but may alſo run as much into Debt as they pleaſe beſides; and if they are gotten very much into the way of doing ſo, then it is very likely that as the Merchants have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready carried off all our Silver, ſo they will in a ſhort time make themſelves Maſters of moſt of our Lands alſo for Book Debts. Since we have loſt our Silver, it concerns us to look well to our Lands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I believe by this time every Body's Belly is full of the Publick Bank,</hi> &amp;c. I wiſh it were ſo; but I fear this is not the caſe. I know no good that it hath done: But if I am not miſtaken, it hath prolong'd our Miſeries, divided the Country into Parties, and given many menan Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to involve themſelves worſe than they were before.</p>
            <p>Many of the Borrowers of the Loan Mony, and of ſuch as have a mind to borrow, are become ſo vain as to fancy, that <hi>that</hi> Mony will at laſt be paid by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or elſe that it will never be paid at all. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I can't tell what might be done of that nature, if Borrowers ſhould generally have the doing of it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I hope I ſhall make it evident, that it is every Man's Intereſt, who is not a Borrower to conſent to neither of theſe Things.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, I am ſure it is not juſt that my Eſtate ſhould be taxed to help <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:002128_0015_0FBC217A21B3EA18"/>
voluntarily, and it may be needleſly run himſelf into.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond, the not paying theſe Bills in at all, This every Man that hath any of them in his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is concerned to look to, whether he knows it or not. And that for this reaſon; It is not the Governments ſaying, This indented Bill of ſo much, ſhall be in value equal to Mony, and ſo turning it into the world, which really gives it it's value (as ſome perhaps fondly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) but becauſe we know that we muſt all pay Taxes, and theſe Bills will enable us to pay theſe Taxes as well or better than any thing elſe; therefore it is that we value the Bills yearly emitted, for defraying the Charges of the Government, and if theſe Taxes had never been poſtponed, the demand the Bills would have been in for paying Taxes, would have made us eſteem them at an higher rate than we do now.</p>
            <p>Again, becauſe we know that there are good real Eſtates laid in Pawn for all the Bills emitted by way of Loan, and becauſe we know that within a certain Term of Years, if we have any of theſe Bills in our hands, the borrowers muſt certainly buy them of us at their full value to redeem their Mortgages: Therefore it is that we accept the Loan Bills, and eſteem them as Mony. Now if this be the truth of the Caſe, then, if ever it ſhould be enacted that theſe Bills ſhould never be call'd in, they would at once loſe all their value, and be worth no more to them that have them in their keeping, than ſo many bits of Blank Paper.</p>
            <p>Or if the calling in of theſe Bills ſhould be deferred beyond the ſet time, it will make men doubt whether they will ever be call'd in or not, and ſo their value will ſink in proportion to the Jealouſie men have about it, which will likewiſe be to the Loſs of the Poſſeſſors of them; ſo that it is plainly the Intereſt of every man in the Province that is not a Borrower, and hath any of theſe Bills in his keeping, that they ſhould be called in preciſely at the time appointed, to redeem the Eſtates that are laid in Pawn for them. For nothing elſe but this, when the time is once expired, can make
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002128_0016_0FBC217BA077DFD8"/>
them as good as Mony to thoſe in whoſe hands they ſhall be at that time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There will be more than Threeſcore Thouſand Pounds to pay, and nothing to pay it with; for the Bills come in for the Interest: How then ſhall the Principal be Paid? This is putting men on impoſſibilities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all a great miſtake; and yet it is a miſtake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Man I meet with has fallen into, and is concerned about. If any man wou'd clear up the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and publiſh it to the World, it would tend much to quiet the Minds of People, and ſo do good Service However, I cannot but wonder a little that thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who are not able to ſolve the difficulty themſelves, ſhou'd imagine the General Aſſembly cou'd all be ſo much in the dark as not to ſee ſo very obvious an Objection as this, and provide againſt it. Sir, I have neither Law-book nor Votes of the Houſe by me, and therefore I fear I ſhall not be able to ſolve the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſo clearly as otherwiſe I cou'd. However, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the Act for emitting the 100000 <hi>l.</hi> Loan, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly provides, <hi>That the Profits (that is the Interest) be applyed for &amp; towards the ſupport of the Government, as the General Court ſhall from time to time direct.</hi> Now the Intereſt of the Loan Mony is but 5000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, whereas, the General Court (if I miſtake not) hath for ſome Years paſt granted at leaſt 10000 <hi>l.</hi> to defray the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Government; now this is the whole Intereſt of the Loan Mony and as much more emitted yearly. If it be objected, that when 10000 <hi>l.</hi> is granted yearly for the ſupport of the Government, there is alſo at the ſame time a Tax granted to his Majeſty in ſome Year to come, for calling in theſe Bills again. I anſwer, that this will create no difficulty to the Borrowers of the Loan Mony; becauſe theſe yearly Emiſſions for the Support of the Government muſt continue till the ten Years for the ſtanding out of the Loan Money are expired: And the Taxes granted for calling in theſe Bills, are ſet at ſeveral Years diſtance (the number of Years I dont now certainly remember,) ſo that the very laſt Year of the Loan Mony, there will be Bills enough ſtanding out,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002128_0017_0FBC217D1D17C4E8"/>
to pay not only the Intereſt, but alſo the whole Principal.</p>
            <p>But there is another anſwer eaſier to be underſtood than this. Some years ago, the Tax for bringing in our Province Bills was Two and Twenty Thouſand Pounds a year. At length the Government thought fit to eaſe the People of ſo great a Burthen, and ſo reduced the Tax to but Eleven Thouſand Pounds a year, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to bring in the other half by Impoſt, Exciſe, &amp;c. After the Emiſſion of the Loan Mony the Tax was again reduced (to what Sum I don't now remember) and the Intereſt of the Loan Mony was added to the Impoſt and Exciſe, to help make up the Two and Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, which ſhould have been brought in by the Tax alone. So that every Year that Five Thouſand Pounds is paid as Intereſt of the Loan Mony, at the ſame time Five Thouſand Pounds which wou'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been brought in by Tax, is left ſtanding out. And therefore at the Ten Years end, there will be Fifty Thouſand Pounds ſtanding out, which, had it not been for the Intereſt of the Loan Mony, would have been paid in by that time by Tax. And this the Borrowers of the Loan Mony will have to pay that part of their Principal with, which hath been drawn in by Intereſt.</p>
            <p>I hope this comes fully up to the Difficulty, and is plain enough for any Man that will but ſet himſelf a thinking, to underſtand; and will clear the Government of the unjuſt Imputation of being worſe than the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Taskmaſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are told, we muſt expect no more Bills, and Silver and Gold is bought up for the Factors as fast as it comes in, and Shipt home,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>And ſo it always will be, while we have ſuch plenty of Bills that the Merchants and Factors can find Advantage in doing ſo. But I ſhould think it prudence for the men who drive this Trade, not to liſp ſo much as a word about the miſeries of poor People in Boſton. I believe other Folks will think of theſe miſeries often enough, and of the true reaſon of them, without being put in mind, by the Men that cauſe them. If our own Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are not guilty, but they are the Foreign Factors
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002128_0018_0FBC217FD1745A70"/>
only that drive this Trade, let not our own Merchant join with them in a Cry for more Province Bills, and make the miſeries of poor people in Boſton a Plea for it; but let them tell the world the plain Truth, That theſe poor People are paid in Goods for their Labour <hi>not for want of Province Bills, but becauſe Factors ſave their Province Bills to buy up Silver and Gold, as faſt as it comes in, that they may ſhip it home to their Principals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo procure more Goods to pay Labourers and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with: Let them tell the world, that it is by this means that Honest, Induſtrious People in Boſton are brought to ſuch Extremities, as to ſell their Pewter and Braſs to buy Food.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Gentlemen who are againſt emitting more Bills, think we have Mony enough; that there are two hundred thouſand pounds out in all the Provinces. A wonderful Caſh to manage the Trade of the four Governments</hi>: &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>I am my ſelf at preſent in no Capacity to conjecture the Sum of the Bills ſtanding out in the four Provinces; but let it be what it will, I think I am capable of proving, that there are enough of them to carry on a Trade as large, as it is for the Intereſt of the Provinces to have carried on. And I hope I ſhall do this with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that every man can underſtand. There are Province Bills enough to buy up, at a reaſonable rate, all that can be ſpar'd of the Product of the Husbandry, Fiſhery, &amp;c. of the whole Country. Let them that have any of theſe things to ſell, offer them but at any thing near the rate they uſed to ſell them for ſome Years ago for Silver, and I am certain they will ſoon find Buyers, and Mony enough. Nothing will ly upon their hands, except there be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not fit to be exported, which great plenty hath made a Drug of.</p>
            <p>Now if there be Mony enough to buy, at a reaſonable rate, all the Produce of the Country that can be ſpared, then every man that raiſes any thing to make Mony with, may turn it into Mony, and lay out all that Mony with Traders for foreign Commodities, if he pleaſes. So that it is a plain Caſe, that we have Bills enough ſtill to enable every Man in the Province (if they were all minded to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002128_0019_0FBC2180E038BBC8"/>
be ſo much of Simpletons) to ſpend all that he can earn in the Year, on Traders for foreign Commodities. And what wou'd the Traders have more? Muſt Men ſpend more than they earn? Muſt publick &amp; private Banks be eſtabliſhed, that ſo when People have ſpent all they have earnt, they may know where to go and borrow more, to lay out for things they have no need of? And muſt the Lands of the Country groan under Taxes and Mortgages to uphold theſe Fooleries? All this muſt be done forſooth! Not for fear Trade ſhould not be large enough ſtill, but for fear it ſhould not be ſo large as it hath been for many Years paſt, to the impoveriſhing and almoſt ruining the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I have read but little in the Hiſtory and the Cuſtoms of other Countries: Pray, Sir, inform me, whether the Governments of other Countries, uſe, when Traders have fool'd away all their Silver and Gold, to be ſo very careful to provide another Medium for them, to play the Fool with again? I am apt to gueſs, that the Care in ſuch Caſes hath commonly been, to lay Trade under ſuch Reſtraints, as that it can't be carried on, but to the Advantage of its Country.</p>

               <hi>Out own Bills are boarded up, with what noble Deſign I know not, but it gives room to ſuſpect the worst,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>This Cry I have obſerved frequently to be made at ſome convenient Seaſons; but why Mony ſhould be hoarded juſt at ſuch Times, or why men ſhould hoard Mony now, that have not always made it their Cuſtom to do ſo, I never could well imagine. It is commonly accounted a true Saying, that <hi>Intereſt will not lye</hi>; therefore I can't think that any let their Mony lye by them unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, in hopes of getting their <hi>Neighbours Lands at half Value</hi>; becauſe I ſee no likelihood that ſuch a thing will ever be effected. When once our Province Bills are by their Scarcity become equal in value to Silver, If the Government will but admit Taxes to be paid, and Mortgages to be redeemed with Silver, or the produce of the Country, thoſe that have hoarded up Province Bills, will be glad to break up their Hoards, and get rid of them as faſt as they can, leſt they ſhould become uſeleſs to them. Indeed if any Gentlemen that employ
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002128_0020_0FBC2182918801B0"/>
a great number of Labourers, do (at ſome Seaſons when it will ſerve a Turn to have a Clamour raiſed) turn off their Workmen with two thirds inſtead of one half Goods, or make them wait a great while for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part, and tell them they can't help it, the Bills are hoarded, when it may be at the ſame time they are buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Silver with them; (I ſay if any do ſo) it is plain there may be advantage in it; and ſo there is room to <hi>ſuſpect the worſt</hi>; tho' I don't know that any ſuch thing as this hath been practiced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Gentlemen that cry, no more Bills, are only Uſurers, and men who live on Salaries, Officers of the Courts and Lawyers, &amp;c. p.</hi> 4. I will add all underſtanding Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, that I meet with, who have been ſo good Husbands as not to entangle their Eſtates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not ſinking the Bills of Credit that will bring in Silver, &amp;c.</hi> If he had ſaid ſinking the Credit of the Bills it had been very juſt. <hi>It must be done by going of Manufactures, &amp;c.</hi> No great matters will or can ever be done at Manufactures while Labour is ſo dear; and La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour will always be dear, while Bills are cheap. Ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſity is the Mother of Invention, and will teach men more Projects as well as more Induſtry and Good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry than the Emiſſion of more Bills. I deſire to be informed what Project, what Manufacture hath been ſet on foot to any purpoſe, by the 50 and 100 Thouſand Pounds lately Emitted? <hi>The mony hath been generally Borrowed (as far as I can learn) to pay Debts contracted before, by virtue of long Credit.</hi> And if an hundred Thouſand Pounds more were emitted it would quickly go the ſame way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am ſorry to ſee the Miniſters of the Town ſo Silent &amp;c. p.</hi> 5. If any of thoſe Gentlemen can by writing ſet the true Intereſt and Duty of the Country (at ſuch a day as this) in a clear light, they will do God and their Country excellent Service: but I hope they will be very cautious what they deliver in the name of God from the Pulpit, about theſe matters of doubtful Diſputation which perplex the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002128_0021_0FBC2184F3A48CF0"/>
               <hi>The Gentlemen who oppoſe the Schemes for Emitting more Bills on Land Security never propoſe any other, &amp;c. p.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>No Projects will ſerve the turn, without Induſtry, Frugality and good Huſbandry. Do but leave off Truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſhorten Credit as much as poſſible, and this will make us all Induſtrious, Frugal, and Prudent, whether we will or not, And I believe in the way we are now in nothing elſe will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſt certainly it was a very wrong ſtep to cruſh the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Bank, &amp;c.</hi> I can't but hope that it will ſtill be cruſh't. And that for the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſuch an Emiſſion of Bills will keep their Credit always low, and that will make the produce of the Country proportionably high, that it wont turn to Account to ſend it elſewhere, and ſo our Merchants will always be at the ſame Loſs they are now, where to make Adventures. It will alſo make Labour always dear, ſo that we ſhall never make any great Improvement in Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry or Manufactures. And at this rate Silver and Gold will always be one of the beſt things that we can make Returns with, and therefore will be bought up and Shipt off as faſt as it comes in, and ſo we ſhall never get through our Difficulties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe we have found by the unhappy Experience of the Publick Bank, that if there be but a Bank to run and borrow at, the Ill Husbandry, Vanity and Folly of the People is ſuch; that in a ſhort time moſt of the Eſtates in the Country would become involved; And I think it much more for the Strength, Safety, and Intereſt of the Country both Civil and Religious, that the Eſtates ſhould continue as at preſent in many mens hands, than that a few Gentlemen ſhould be Landlords, and all the reſt of the Country become Tenants.</p>
            <p>If you ask me why theſe Ill conſequences will follow upon a Bank in this Country rather than in England? I anſwer, becauſe as I obſerv'd before, We are not a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign State. We may not check an extravagant Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation and Conſumption of ſome foreign Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by heavy Duties. The only way of doing this is, by ſhortning Credit, ſo that People may not be able
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002128_0022_0FBC21861DF3DCA8"/>
to conſume more than they earn: And by not ſuffering a Bank for People to run to, and undo themſelves by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I am againſt a private Bank, becauſe that when the Province Bills which are now out, ſhall once be drawn in, all the Caſh of the Country will then be at the direction of the Bankers. And it is eaſy to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee this Conſequence, that whatever Project they may have in their heads, how inconſiſtent ſoever it may be with the publick Welfare, they wont want means to bring it to paſs. Nothing will be reſtrained from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fortifying our expoſed Settlements wou'd encourage Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Sit down and till the Earth. This would bring dawn the prices of Linen, Canvas, Proviſions. p.</hi> 8. I am incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to think on the contrary, that one Reaſon of the great ſcarcity of Proviſions we have been afflicted with of late years, was that ſo many People have gone into new Plantations, where they have not yet been able to raiſe their own proviſions. It would conduce more to the bringing down Proviſions, to have the Land already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, better Improved by more Labourers upon it, than to have new unſubdu'd Lands enter'd upon.</p>
            <p>But if our Author indeed deſires, that the price of theſe things ſhould be brought down, why does he tell us Country People in the next Page that the want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will lower the price of all our produce, that he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us alſo to joyn with him in a cry for more Mony? The falling of our Proviſions will <hi>enable him to export them to the Iſlands as in former times. If there was a Bridge, &amp;c.</hi> The Poor who want Imployment, wou'd do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervice, to diſperſe themſelves in Country and till the Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I hope our Friends will ſend men ſpirited for our Relief, to repreſent them,</hi> &amp;c. I hope alſo Men of a Publick Spirit, and heartily concerned for the Welfare of their Country, will be ſent. <hi>Not Sheriffs and Lawyers,</hi> &amp;c. I will add, not Men in difficult Circumſtances, who have involved themſelves by their own Indiſcretion. They that can't order their private Affairs with Diſcretion, will make but poor Managers for the Publick. Beſides,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002128_0023_0FBC21879FC462A0"/>
whatever ſhall be propoſed for the Publick Good, Men in a needy Condition will be ſure to conſider in the firſt place how it will affect themſelves, and if it be likely to increaſe their Straitneſs and Difficulty a little, (tho' but for a time) they had need be Men of great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity to give their Conſent to it.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you my Thoughts with a ſincere aim at the Good of my Country; and without prejudice or affection to any Man, or Party of men. If you think they may be of Publick Service, you have leave to make them as publick as you pleaſe. If they are juſt, no man hath reaſon to be angry: If they are Miſtakes, I shall be heartily ſorry for it. If the Miſtakes are dangerous, I hope the Gentlemen who think them ſo, will be ſo juſt to their Country as to warn it of them.</p>
            <p>I have written theſe things in the utmoſt Hurry im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable, for fear of loſing the Opportunity to convey them. If you meet with any thing out of Place, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed too ſharply or too obſcurely, impute it to my great Haſt, which wont allow me to correct and alter.</p>
