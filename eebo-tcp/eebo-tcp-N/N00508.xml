            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PLague, Fire and Earthquakes are amongst the most terrible Judgments, whereby the great and holy God doth manifest his sore displeasure against a sinful People, and his indignation and hatred of their heinous and crying Sins. <hi>These three</hi> have befallen <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> in the GREAT DYING Year, 1665. the <hi>second</hi> in the GREAT BURNING Year 1666. and the <hi>last</hi> in the GREAT TREMBLING present Year 1692. and the Month of <hi>September</hi> is remarkable in all these. The <hi>Plague</hi> (as I remember) being then at the highest, the great <hi>Fire</hi> began on <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temb.</hi> 2. and the <hi>Earthquake</hi> was on the Eighth of the same Month; on which day of the Month <hi>Josephus de bel. Jud. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. writes thus; Jerusalem <hi>was taken the second year of</hi> Vespasian's <hi>reign on the eighth day of</hi> September, <hi>and having been already five times before surprized, it was finally again destroyed.</hi> This was <hi>London's</hi> trembling, but

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Because God hath made use of Earthquakes (in former times) as forerunners of great Calamities to come.</hi> So according to Christ's prediction, this Sign went before the destruction of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Josephus de bel Jud.

If the quantity was less, taking its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in some certain place, and proceeding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, seeking to get out, but could not, it would have required more time to travail under ground to such distant Towns and Cities, as in <hi>England,</hi> and so many places beyond Sea, and so could not have been at all, at the same time.</p>
            <p>And if it were from the immediate hand of God was it not for some great end that God should do so great a work, which he doth more rarely do? Is not the meaning of it, a warning to all that have been shaken by it, to forsake sin, and turn to God by repentance and reformation, or else look
<pb facs="unknown:000634_0006_0FA962FC3A4FD370"/>
for some other stroke? while we go on in a course of great provoking sins, when God hath shaken his Rod over us, might we not fear it will some time fall upon us? But whether it were natural or Supernatural, should not all places that trembled by it, without Reformation, fear and tremble at the Judgments that may follow it? when God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to punish, and Men not so much as begin to repent and turn, doth not he threaten he will go on to punish seven times more, and seven to that? and many times seven more to that? when a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple still walk contrary to him? <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.15. to 40.</p>
            <p>Some would fain deny the matter of Fact, but that there are so many Witnesses to testifie against them. Some that own it, make light of it, and do not at all think it portends any more Calamity to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Tho' I dare not undertake to tell what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Judgments (which are at God's ordering) this Earthquake doth presage, without Reformation; yet may I not ask this <hi>sober</hi> Question, If this late Earthquake have not good effect upon our Hearts and Lives, may we not fear lest those Judgments may follow, which we read in Scripture God hath sent upon a People for those very sins which do

That Scripture (amongst many, <hi>Isai.</hi> 3) may serve for a Glass to see our sins, and what Judgments we may fear, if they be continued in; which are sins that bring Kingdoms and Cities to ruin.

            <p>WOnderful, many wonderful things are done by the Lord of Heaven and Earth, by reason whereof his People may in triumph, and the Wicked in terror say, <hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongst the gods</hi> (or mighty ones) <hi>who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, working wonders?</hi> sometimes in the Heavens over our heads; sometimes on and within the Earth under our feet: In <hi>both</hi> the works of God have been so amazing, that night fill the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Heaven above, and of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, with admiration of his Divine Perfections.</p>
            <p>First; God's works have been astonishing in the Heavens over our Heads, which because they are too high, and above <hi>our present Theme and Subject,</hi> I shall but briefly mention <hi>three</hi> of them, and

The Earth is a setled, fixed Body, and therefore it is an act of mighty power in God to <hi>shake</hi> it, and to make it move: but the Sun is as a Bridegroom coming out of his Chamber, rejoycing as a strong man to run a race, according to the ordinary Law of Creation and Government in continual motion, and therefore a mighty work of God alone to cause its motion to cease and stand still. The making of the Sun to stop, which naturally cannot but move, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Earth to shake and move, which naturally cannot but stand still, is an effect of equal power. The command of God doth change the Earths station into motion, and the Suns motion into standing still. Josh 10 12. <hi>Then spake</hi> Joshua <hi>to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the</hi> Amorites <hi>before the Children of</hi> Israel, and he said in the sight of <hi>Israel, Sun stand thou still upon</hi> Gibson, <hi>and thou Moon in the valley of</hi> Ajelon. Verse 13. <hi>And the Sun stood still, and the Moon stayed until the People had avenged themselves upon their Enemies. So the Sun stood still in the midst of Heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</hi> Verse 14. <hi>And there was no day like that, before it or after, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for</hi> Israel. Where is observable, (1.) That <hi>Joshua</hi> spake first to the Lord, and then to the Sun; for it was not <hi>Joshua</hi>'s voice, but God's power that put a check to the motion of the Sun. (2.) God hearkened to the

The motion of the Sun is naturally progressive, or going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and if it should make more haste by many degrees in its diurnal Motion, it must be by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Divine, and not Humane; yet in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of men, it is a greater thing, that it should go backward, and would c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So the Sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down. Hezekiah</hi> prayed, God promised, gives him a sign for his assurance of the performance, and the sign (tho' miraculous) was effected, and the mercy asked, was bestowed: God caused the Sun to go backwards to confirm the faith of his People in his Promise that his work for their deliverance should go forwards.</p>

Thus it is manifest that God doth great things in Heaven above; the Sun moves or standeth still, goes backwards or forwards, shines not, to give light at noon day, &amp; for some hours together unto the Earth at all, or else makes light in one part, when it doth not in another; and all this at the pleasure of the great God.

               <p>Doct. II. <hi>God needs not length of time to do the most great and wonderful works. Suddenly</hi> there was an <hi>Earthquake.</hi> God can make it move in an instant. When its said God in <hi>six</hi> days made this World, it's not to be understood that he did need so many days to make it in. It was his pleasure to take that time to finish, beautifie and compleat it. When God did create the Earth, and brought it out of nothing, it was <hi>suddenly</hi> done. He did but speak, <hi>Let it be,</hi> and it <hi>suddenly</hi> started out of Nothing into Being. <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an instantaneous action</hi>: he that did so <hi>suddenly</hi> and so <hi>easily</hi> make it, can as suddenly and as easily make it quake and tremble. How suddenly did God make the Earth to quake where <hi>London stood,</hi> and after his shaking of it, through his great mercy yet <hi>doth stand!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When men thought of no such thing, not the <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> in his Study, nor the <hi>Trader</hi> in his Shop, nor the <hi>Workman</hi> at his Work, nor the <hi>Drunkard</hi> at his Cups, when none of these had any apprehension of it. <hi>Suddenly,</hi> The <hi>Student</hi> thought his Desk, on which he was writing, to be removing from him, and when he drew it towards him, it went back again, several times: the <hi>Trader</hi> suddenly seeth a motion in his Wares, and the <hi>Workman</hi> the moving of his Tools without hands, and the <hi>Drunkard</hi> thought indeed the Earth did stagger more than he: many suddenly felt their Chairs to move under them, and could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently discern the reason, but thought some living Creature had been under their Seats, and did disturb them. Suddenly, many, most that I have spoken with, discerned a dizziness in their Heads, and in the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000634_0020_0FA96309D12D7600"/>
instant thought the motion was there, not imagining any thing of the <hi>shaking</hi> of the Earth: <hi>Suddenly</hi> they feared the falling of their Houses; but at first particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons thought there was some defect and fault in their own particular dwellings, till they did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the motion was general, and heard others say of their Houses as they found in their own: and all this was <hi>suddenly</hi> done. In a minute, in a moment God can cause an unexpected <hi>Earthquake.</hi> Men must have time to do the <hi>smallest,</hi> but God needs none to do the <hi>greatest</hi> work.</p>
               <p>Doct. III. <hi>Tho' an Earthquake suddenly come, and quickly go, and nothing is destroyed thereby, yet it is and might be truly called a great Earthquake.</hi> It is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said in this Text this Earthquake <hi>suddenly</hi> came, we do not read it lasted long nor that the Prison-house, or Persons in it, were destroyed or hurt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, yet we read it was a <hi>great Earthquake.</hi> When many Houses are swallowed up, and many Men, Women and Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But such a one as was so lately in <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> when not one House was destroyed, nor one Person consumed, seems to be so small (especially now it is over and all safe) as is not worth their observation, for People now are as little concerned already, as if it had not been, or they had quite forgotten that it was. But let such slighters of this late work of God, and regardless of this Judgment, and calling of it a little thing, tell me</p>
               <p n="1">1. Was not <hi>this a great Earthquake</hi> that made so many Houses as be in such a great City as this to

move, and shake, and tremble, tho' they stood? Is it not a great thing to make one of <hi>London</hi> streets, and the Houses therein so to quake? much more two or ten, much more all and every one?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Was it not a <hi>great Earthquake</hi> that <hi>did reach so far,</hi> and extended it self so many miles at the same instant of the same day to so many places in <hi>England</hi> as we have heard.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet more, was it not a <hi>great Earthquake</hi> when it did enlarge it self, and reached <hi>at the same time</hi> to so <hi>many Cities and Towns beyond the Sea</hi>? Did God stretch out his Arm so far, and do you look upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as a little thing, not worthy your observation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, or spiritual improvement of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it were so small in your Eyes, <hi>what made so many to be in so great a consternation</hi>? why did so many run out of their Houses, and such as were sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at their Tables hasten from their Dinners with their Napkins in their hands, to get into the Streets? why did so many run from their Shops? what was the reason, of the sudden, common cry, by so many, one by one, <hi>My House is falling,</hi> and <hi>my House is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and my <hi>Children above will he destroyed</hi> and <hi>yet I dare not go up to fetch them down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. How little do you know, if this <hi>late Earthquake had been a little more, and had lasted a little longer, a few minutes more, how near you &amp; your Houses would have been to a subversion and total overthrow</hi>? or how near the trembling Earth might have been to opening, and swallowed up both you and your Habitations? For all that you know <hi>by this Earthquake</hi> you were upon the brink of ruine, a little more might have brought you down; and yet will you slight this work of God, as if it were a small, a very little thing?</p>
               <p n="6">6. As small a thing as you look upon it to be,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000634_0022_0FA9630B4883E2C8"/>
                  <hi>could any man, or men, could all the mighty men upon the Earth have caused such a shaking and trembling of the Earth, and all upon it.</hi> Could all the mighty <hi>Captains, Lord Generals, Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours,</hi> with all their Armies, have had such an Influence upon the Earth? if they can batter down strong Walls, and Cities, and Castles with their Instruments of War, yet can any of them, or all of them, cause such a shaking of the Earth as that so lately was? do you ascribe great things to Men, and call them so, that are far inferiour to this, and yet let this pass by with so little observation, as if it were a work so small?</p>
               <p n="7">7. If men <hi>could shake</hi> the Earth and your Houses as God did, could they so securely have <hi>preserved</hi> them from falling, and you from hurt, as God did? Was the shaking of your Houses, so much, and the preserving of them so shaken, so great a mercy, in it self, and yet so little in your eyes? and last no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with a due impression in your memories?</p>
               <p n="8">8. While you look upon <hi>this Earthquake</hi> to be so small a thing, can you look upon <hi>your preservation to be so great a mercy as indeed it is?</hi> whilst you lessen the <hi>work</hi> of God, the more you lessen the mercy of God? did God shake you and your Houses, and not overturn you and them, and was not this great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? Oh! take heed you do not diminish this work of God's power in your own apprehensions, and consequently your <hi>danger then,</hi> and God's mercy now in your safety. Lord!

least in thy wrath yet greater, thou cause the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it to shake and tremble more, and do that execution that should make all confess and say (that deny this) that suddenly there was a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</p>
               <p>Doct. IV. <hi>Tho' some Earthquakes have their natural causes, yet some do arise from the immediate hand and power of God without such causes. Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were imprisoned; in Prison they prayed, and sang Praises, in testimony that God heard their Prayers, he immediately causeth <hi>this Earthquake</hi> under the Prison. Judicious Expositors assert this Earthquake to be miraculous.</p>
               <p>In treating on this I shall take this course:</p>
               <p n="1">I. Distinguish between <hi>Earthquakes figurative</hi> and <hi>metaphorical,</hi> and such as are <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>real</hi>: because both are spoken of in Scripture, this will be requisite to remove the ambiguity of the word, that one might not be taken for the other.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Distinguish <hi>real Earthquakes</hi> into <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>supernatural.</hi> In respect of the Earth it self, whose nature is to rest and stand still, such shakings and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be termed <hi>contra natural,</hi> but in respect of the second Causes in Nature, which sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such tremblings and quakings in the Earth are called <hi>natural,</hi> in contradistinction from those which are caused <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> God's immediate hand, without such causes, and are therefore <hi>supernatural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. I shall give a short account what <hi>natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> assert to be the <hi>Causes</hi> of such <hi>Earthquakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Point at the <hi>several sorts</hi> or <hi>kinds</hi> of such <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> and give the names which <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> from them, do call them by.</p>

               <p>Earthquakes and movings of the Earth are often taken <hi>meataphorically</hi> for <hi>great Commotions, alterations made in States, Kingdoms and Church,</hi> and for sore and heavy Punishments inflicted by God upon wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and disobedient People. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 29.6. <hi>Thou shalt be visited of the Lord of Hosts with Thunder and with Earthquake, and with great Noise, with Storm and Tempest, and the Flame of devouring Fire.</hi> A figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive description of God's Anger against <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; as much as to say, Heaven and Earth shall concur to their ruine; yet some Expositors say, this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake may be understood according to the letter. <hi>Isa.</hi> 24.18. <hi>The foundations of the earth do shake.

               <p>
                  <hi>Real and proper Earthquakes are either such as are caused by God's immediate Hand and Power, or such as have their Causes in Nature</hi>; tho' <hi>these</hi> also are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and ordered and ruled by the powerful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and do not come (as some call it) by <hi>chance.</hi> Tho' the finger of God be in those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Causes, yet such as have been without them must be wholly and only from God. And I shall gather these out of the Scripture, that we might learn to fear and tremble before this great God that needs no winds and vapours, nor any kind of Creature to make the Earth to shake and tremble. And they are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The shaking of the earth at God's giving of the Law to</hi> Moses, <hi>and the Children of</hi> Israel. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.

18. <hi>And Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole Mount quaked greatly.</hi> That this quaking of the Mount was <hi>literal,</hi> and not <hi>figurative, Rivet</hi> argues, because it is joyned with the smoke, and Thunders &amp; Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings properly to be understood, and saith, That the causes of the moving of the Earth, and of the Mountain as it were leaping at the presence of God, are not to be searched for in Nature, nor should we dispute concerning <hi>Phisical</hi> Reasons of this Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for when all things done here are miraculous, the glory of God is obscured, if where he acts <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> and in an extraordinary manner, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Divine, we enquire after second Causes, which in such events are none. <hi>Psa.</hi> 68.7. <hi>O God! when thou wentest forth before thy people; when thou didst march through the wilderness Selah.</hi> Verse 8. <hi>The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God; even</hi> Sinai <hi>it self was moved at the presence of God, the God of</hi> Israel.</p>

Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> relating <hi>Moses</hi> his Prayer at large, records, that whilst he spake those words, and intermixed them with tears, the Earth instantly trembled, and shaking began to move (after such a manner, as when by the violence of the wind a great billow of the Sea floateth and waltereth) hereat were all the People amazed: but after that, a horrible and shattering noise was made about their Tents, the Earth opened and swallowed up both them, and all that which they esteemed dear, which was after a manner so exterminate, as nothing remained of theirs to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held whereupon in a moment the Earth closed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the vast gaping was fast shut, so as there appeared not any sign of that which had happened.

Were you not then under great Consternation, when you thought those Houses you had slept in, you must not only so quickly die in, but be buried in them too: That the Houses you had built or rented to shelter you from Storms and Tempests, should bring that Destruction upon you, which many Storms and Tempests had not done? Have not you of late years heard terrible and roaring Thunderings, God Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with a Voice which none can imitate? Have you not seen great Flashings of Fire and Lightnings, which made the Night like Day, that you said you could see to take up a small thing from off the ground, and were not you then glad you had an House over your head? But when this late Earthquake was, were not you afraid because you had an House over your head, when you thought it would fall upon your head and whole Body? And when this Earthquake was, did you not make as much haste to get out of it, as in Storms and Tempests you ever did to get into it? Is this already forgotten? What! so soon! It is hard to express the fears that many then were filled with, and it is sad to see how little God is feared

since by many that then did fear so much. Beside your own late Experience, Sacred Scripture, as well as Historical Writers, do Record the fears of Men in times of Earthquakes, 1 Sam. 14 15 <hi>There was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison and the spoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Valiant Men of War, that are not afraid of Swords and Bullets, but with undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courage assault their Enemies, and when many lie dead on both sides, fight on with boldness, that fear not so much the shaking of Spears and Pikes, as the shaking of the Earth; the Host trembled, the Garrison trembled, and the Spoilers themselves did also tremble. Spoilers tremble! What! those that had spoiled so many upon the Earth, they tremble lest they should be spoiled by the quaking Earth. The Host, the People, the Garrison, the Spoilers, and Earth did tremble, surely it was a very great trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, Mat. 27.54. <hi>When the Centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, they feared greatly</hi> Captains, Men of great Spirits, at the quaking of the Earth are filled with great fear. Mat. 28.2. <hi>Behold, there was a great Earthquake.</hi> 4 <hi>For fear of him</hi> (the Angel whose Ministry God used to cause that Earthquake) <hi>the Keepers did shake, and became as dead men</hi>: An Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake is so terrible, causing such frights and fears, that makes Men (as the saying is) look like Death. Acts 16.26. <hi>And suddenly there was a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</hi> 29. <hi>He</hi> (the Jaylor) <hi>called for a light, and sprung in, and came trembling.</hi> The Gaol trembled, and the Jaylour tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

he had shut, and lockt, and made them fast, the quaking of the Earth did open, he could not keep himself from trembling. An Earthquake will make even a Jaylour to tremble.</p>
               <p>But why such fear and trembling in Men, when such shaking and trembling in the Earth?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In some,</hi> it may arise <hi>from the apprehensions of the terrible Wrath of an Angry God.</hi> There have bin some Earthquakes, that were Tokens of God's Grace and Favour; as the Earthquake shaking the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Prison, in favour to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> testifying that God had heard their Prayers made in Prison, and that by it he would deliver them, as he did. And that in <hi>Acts</hi> 4 31. the Apostles prayed, and at their Prayers the place was shaken; the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the place made them stand the faster in their Faith in God, and trusting to him. But usually Earthquakes are indications of God's Wrath and sore Displeasure. When Men run on in sin against God, to shew his Indignation against it and them, he sometimes will not suffer the Earth to stand still quiet under them. Psal. 18.7. <hi>The Earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the Hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</hi> When Men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that God is provoked, and they may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it, when God in such a terrible manner doth shew it, knowing they are no more a Match for God, than a Worm is to an Angel, or a Child to a Giant; it may put them into such amazing Frights and Fears, saying, God is angry, what shall we do? The Omnipresent God, is angry, whither shall we go? The Just and Holy God is angry, with what can we appease him? He doth shew his Anger, &amp; we do see it, and how shall we escape? God is wroth, and the Earth trembles before him: God is
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000634_0045_0FA963234BF635C8"/>
wroth, and is come down in sore displeasure, and the Earth quaketh at his presence; our Heads are giddy, but not with Wine; we reel but not with strong Drink. <hi>O stay your selves, and wonder; cry ye out, &amp; cry, they are drunken, but not with wine, they stagger, but not with strong drink, Isa.</hi> 29 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Conciousness of their own Guilt: <hi>When the Earth did quake, it did not only wake the Jaylour out of his Natural Sleep, but also out of his Spiritual Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; Conscience was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not that which is the most Terrible, when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching in so Terrible a manner, make the stoutest heart to quake? If they have no thoughts of Hell and Damnation, yet Death by the trembling of the Earth presents it self unto their thoughts: and though they would not think of it yet they must; though they would divert their minds from it, yet they cannot send these thoughts away till another season: though many go to Hell without fear of Hell, and seldom think of it till they feel it, yet when Death seems to be coming to them by an Earthquake, it almost kills them with the terrour of it, being ready to die with fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of such a Death</p>
               <p>There are these Circumstances in this Case that fill men with these amazing fears upon the account of Death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The sudden surprizal.</hi> An Earthquake comes suddenly in a minute; many times without notice and warning, as this in <hi>London</hi> lately did; and it seems to bring Death with it, and often doth; now an Evil that suddenly comes, doth the more amaze, when in a minutes time, there is not space for men to recollect their thoughts, and fortifie themselves with actings of Reason, or Grace (which Alas are not so ready) against advancing Death. In sickness men have time to prepare and make ready for it, and to allay the fears thereof; but in a moment to be in danger of Death, the fears are more raging and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, and less help against them. Fear without a Remedy must be great Fear.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The suddeness of Death,</hi> the apprehended nearness of it. The danger did not only seize them suddenly. What! die so soon! what, within a minute or two? will Death stay no longer? can it not a minute more be delayed? what! so soon step into Eternity? so
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000634_0047_0FA9632808DCD838"/>
suddenly, must I hasten into another everlasting World? I never did so suddenly remove from one House to another, and must <hi>I</hi> now so suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from one World to another? from a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral into an eternal World? and yet not to leave this, nor to go into that? It is hard to imagine the power and strength of fear that must invade and fill them in such distress<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The unavoidableness of Death</hi> apprehended in an over throwing Earthquake augments their fears, or torments them with despair of Life. If a man be sick, the means he useth keeps up his hope of Life, and the more he hopes he shall live, the less are his fears of Death. But in a desolating Earthquake, what hopes can Men have? whither can they in a moment go to escape the ruine? what present Friend can help them, when they and their Friends are in the same equal danger? when one must not die without the other? If they stay within doors they apprehend they may be killed with the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l of their Houses: if they run out, they know not but they may be destroyed with the downfal of their Neighbours. Will they hasten into the Fields? what! in a minute? alas! they have not time allowed for such an escape, or if they had, there the Earth in an Earthquake might swallow them up. No where safe, every where in great fear.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Apprehensions of sudden, unavoidable Death, and this when <hi>they are in health and strong,</hi> aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates their case, and augments their fears. What! am I well, and yet must die? strong in health, and yet now must die? hath Death forgot its old way of sending Harbingers before it, before it came it self? did it use to send its Serjeants to arrest, before it cast Men into the Prison of the Grave, and must I be

haled away without Summons? Some have been weaned from the love of Life, and made weary of it by long and languishing Sickness, by wracking &amp; tormenting Pains, and must I in my Youth, or in middle Age, under no pain, with my strength firm, yield to Death? All this doth fill with greater fear.</p>

Others, in other cases, first die, and then are buried, first expire, and then are carried to their Graves; but in an Earthquake must I be buried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live? first buried and then die? others are carried from their house, when dead, unto the grave, and must mine own house be my grave, and that while I do live? Behold! the Earth quakes under me, my House trembles over me. Oh! what if my trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling House should fall, and I in it? what if the Earth should sink under me? what if this quaking Earth should open its mouth, and eat me up alive? what if it should cleave asunder (as in its shaking it hath sometimes done? and swallow me up as it hath done thousands of others? when others die another way, doth this loving Mother lay their dead Bodies in her Bosom, must I die this way, and go down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live into her bowels? did I live in my Mothers womb before I was born, and must I live (awhile) in this common Mothers bowels, after I am therein buried? This being not the common death of all Men, makes it more terrible to those that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in an Earthquake they must not die as others do.

the danger thereof. Tho' they leave their Goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind them in their Houses, they will attempt to fly to save themselves. Numb. 16.32. <hi>The earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to</hi> Korah, <hi>and all their Goods.</hi> Verse 34. <hi>And all</hi> Israel <hi>that were round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them fled at the cry of them: for they said, lest the Earth swallow us up also.</hi> Zach. 14.5. <hi>And ye shall flee to the valley of the Mountains—yea, ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the Earthquake in the days of</hi> Uzziah <hi>King of</hi> Judah.

Great and terrible Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings were before it, then great and unusual storms of Winds, then arising a great and sudden Noise, the Sea wrought, the Waves swelled, the Earth was shaken, Buildings trembled, some did burst asunder, and others first lifted up, fell down. A great and horrible Noise was heard, Walls by contrary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons driven sometimes this way, sometimes that were broken and fell, the Sea with boisterous storms did mount and toss to and fro; the Earth where no Buildings were, was greatly moved: such a thick dust was raised, and so great a darkness upon all, that they could not see one another, nor speak, nor hear one the other, and by reason of the violence of the Wind, and greatness of the dust, could scarcely breathe Trees pluckt up by the roots were cast down upon the ground, many, very many were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
