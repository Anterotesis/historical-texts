            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>To deſcribe the character of the good SOLDIER, as formed upon the principles and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, will perfectly ſuit the preſent occaſion; this, therefore, ſhall be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in the following Diſcourſe, founded on thoſe words of St. Paul, 2 <hi>Timothy,</hi> chapter ii. and the latter part of the ſecond verſe—"A GOOD SOLDIER OF JESUS CHRIST."</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY has an excellent effect on the characters of men, in all the relations which they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in life. It renders them uſeful to ſociety, as well as happy in themſelves. It leads the ſoldier in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to true glory in the path of virtue, and by giving him a juſt ſenſe of his relation and obligations to his Maker, qualifies him for the ſervice of his country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028069_0004_0FD68FD54E044D78"/>
IT is highly pleaſing to contemplate the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſign of the goſpel inſtitution. By ſubduing the paſſions of men, thoſe ſources of contention, and reforming the heart, this divine religion ſhall ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately exclude war from the face of the earth; and by diffuſing univerſal charity, produce univerſal peace. But this great event can only be conſidered as the ſubject of prophecy, the accompliſhment of which, though certain, is probably far diſtant in futurity.</p>
            <p>IT adds a grandeur to ſcripture prophecy, when we conſider it as directing its eye through ſuch long extended periods of time as aſtoniſh the minds of mortals; though they ſink to nothing in the ſight of Him whoſe exiſtence is eternal, and with whom a thouſand years are as one day, and one day as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY is emphatically the work of God. Introduced and eſtabliſhed by the exerciſe of miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous powers, it made ſurpriſing progreſs, ſo long as it was ſupported and confirmed by <hi>that</hi> inconteſtible evidence of its divine original; ſince which its preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence has been very unequal, ſlow at the beſt, and on the whole extremely ſhort of what its early ſucceſs ſeemed to indicate. The re-appearance of its divine Author, attended with the ſame miraculous powers, an event plainly predicted, will go far towards effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his gracious purpoſe. But nothing ſhort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated appearances of this nature, or ſucceſſive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028069_0005_0FD68FDB82089588"/>
of Chriſtianity, each more illuſtrious than the preceding, can complete the great deſign. When death ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory, tears ſhall be wiped from all faces, a new heaven and new earth ſhall ariſe from the aſhes of the old, and the world become a kingdom of righteouſneſs and peace.</p>
            <p>As the progreſs of the ſeaſons cannot, ſo neither can the advancement of Chriſtianity, be accelerated beyond the deſign of its Author. One part muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to another; and it is as abſurd to expect general peace in the preſent ſtate of human nature, as the fruits of ſummer amid the froſts and ſnows of winter. It is only by reſtoring man to his primitive character, the moral image of his Maker, an event which we as confidently expect as the return of ſeaſons, that wars ſhall ceaſe to the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p>IN the preſent ſtate of mankind, with reſpect to moral and religious improvement, war is neceſſary upon the ſame principle, and for the ſame reaſon, that the exerciſe of the ſword of juſtice is neceſſary in the hand of the magiſtrate. As the one vindicates the rights, and protects the lives of individuals, the other with equal reaſon protects and vindicates the rights of nations.</p>
            <p>NATIONAL pride, the eager thirſt for property, and the equally eager luſt of dominion, may produce ſuch injuries and inſults, as to excite rational reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the breaſts of the moſt diſpaſſionate, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028069_0006_0FD68FDF9E61F828"/>
it a duty indiſpenſable for a people to arm in defence of that inheritance which Heaven has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, and of which, it would be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious <hi>tamely</hi> to ſuffer men to deprive them. Whilſt Chriſtianity forbids every other ſpecies of war, it ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idently enjoins that <hi>ſelf-defence</hi> which is the firſt law of nature, and muſt be in force ſo long as we have an enemy to threaten, or an intereſt to defend. Our text implies, the conſiſtency of war with the religion of Chriſt; as we can hardly ſuppoſe the inſpired author would have alluded to a calling which Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity forbids, to illuſtrate the character of the Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>THE ſoldier, therefore, in the preſent ſtate of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, is a profeſſion as honourable as it is uſeful. He is, in the hand of Providence, and under the direction of the magiſtrate, the ſafety of his country, the protector of her honour and her intereſts. This uſeful charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is highly adorned and rendered ſtill more uſeful to ſociety by the influence of Chriſtianity, which, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſting men into the ſervice, and forming them as good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, qualifies them in the higheſt degree for the ſervice of their country.</p>
            <p>SELF-COMMAND—a true ſenſe of honour—the love of glory—patriotiſm and courage, diſtinguiſh the good ſoldier; and theſe are produced in the greateſt perfection by an acquaintance with Chriſtianity. The firſt leſſon taught under the diſcipline of Chriſt is <hi>ſelf-command,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:028069_0007_0FD68FE0A18CDA18"/>
a diſpaſſionate attention to the voice of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and truth; chooſing peace as the greateſt good, and engaging in war only to enſure the bleſſings of peace. The ſoldier of the Prince of Peace formed by his religion, muſt be the ſon of peace; he will never be the aggreſſor on the rights of others; he wears on his breaſt, what ought to be the motto of every Chriſtian, <hi>Bear and forbear;</hi> he is not eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, nor ſuffers reſentment, that enemy of peace, lightly to enter his boſom; he is not overcome of evil, but endeavours to overcome evil with good.</p>
            <p>THERE is, however, a certain point, beyond which forbearance is folly, and yielding is madneſs; this is the point of honour to which the Chriſtian ſoldier carefully attends, and by which he governs his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER the crooked policy of this world may have ſuggeſted to the contrary, the honour and rights of nations, as well as of individuals, are beſt vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the generous maxims of the goſpel: and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be moſt ſucceſsfully expreſſed, when juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by reaſon dignified with religion, and attended with the cleareſt evidence not only of juſtice, but even of forbearance towards the offending party. The Chriſtian ſoldier draws his ſword at the call of juſtice, in the cauſe of human happineſs; it is purſuing this cauſe with propriety, that conſtitutes the dignity and honour of his character.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:028069_0008_0FD68FE4AAEA9A50"/>
HONOUR, as taught by Chriſtianity, is indeed widely different from that which is founded on the capricious maxims of the world. The Chriſtian ſoldier is the votary of <hi>true</hi> honour; he feels its worth; it warms his heart, and nerves his arm; he underſtands and obeys its dictates, while he feels the utmoſt contempt for its tawdry counterfeits.</p>
            <p>HONOUR, alas! thou ſtrangely proſtituted name! how art thou degraded by being connected with characters and with actions, as deteſtable to human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity as they are inconſiſtent with reaſon and religion! How often is thy ſacred name applied to a phantom engendered by the worſt paſſions of the human heart, and cheriſhed at the expenſe of human happineſs! How art thou degraded when made to attend the bloody progreſs of him, who deſtroys thouſands to gratify his own pride or luſt of dominion; that his vile head may be adorned with a crown, and his name be tranſmitted to poſterity as the conqueror of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. How art thou degraded when called in to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify a barbarous cuſtom of avenging perſonal injuries at the expenſe of life, in defiance of civil order, in the face of law, reaſon, conſcience, and religion. The Chriſtian ſoldier will vindicate thy rights, and teach mankind that honour and virtue are inſeparable; that not he who enſlaveth, much leſs who deſtroyeth, but the ſaviour and friend of man, who after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Saviour of the world, expoſeth or even
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028069_0009_0FD68FE6D66B8C38"/>
layeth down his own life for the good of others, is the man of true honour; that the dignity of private character is better aſſerted, by treating perſonal inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with an indignant ſilence, or puniſhing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender by making him feel your ſuperior goodneſs, than by indulging a petulant reſentment, the evidence of a little mind, or purſuing that revenge which is the effect of a vicious heart. "He that is ſlow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth, his ſpirit than he that taketh a city."</p>
            <p>THE hope of glory animates the Chriſtian ſoldier; but it is a glory founded on ſolid and rational princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and not that empty, viſionary thing which faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the hearts of the proud and the vain, but which vaniſhes when examined in the light of reaſon and religion.</p>
            <p>THE great Author of the univerſe ſeeks his own glory in all that he does; this is his undivided object in the creation and government of the world, in the miſſion of his Son, and the diſpenſation of his grace. But this glory reſults from the happineſs produced, and ſhines with a luſtre exactly proportioned to it. Here than we find a ſtandard by which to eſtimate the dignity of all rational creatures. He who beſt improves the powers entruſted to him for promoting general good, obtains the prize; and the greateſt glory reſults from the greateſt uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:028069_0010_0FD68FE81000B9B8"/>
MAN is at beſt extremely limited in his capacity for doing good, and in his opportunities for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that capacity. Providence does, however, in ſome inſtances, after long intervals, and by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable concurrence of circumſtances, exhibit the human character to great advantage, and with ſuch improvement as to excite the admiration of the world.</p>
            <p>How illuſtrious does the ſaviour of his country appear, and with what real glory adorned, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſucceſsfully drawn his ſword to vindicate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted rights of a great nation; the object obtained, preſides over her counſels in peace, and directs them with ſuch exquiſite ſkill as to promote her domeſtic proſperity and happineſs, and her foreign influence and honour. The glory of his country ſeems centred in him, and in connexion with his name will be immortal.</p>
            <p>BY far the greater part of mankind are, from the order of ſociety or the allotments of providence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a narrow ſphere; they are not, however, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the proſpect and purſuit of glory, the certain reſult of filling with propriety the place aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned us, and acting our part well in the world's great drama. The moſt obſcure character has its connexions, and conſequently its influence on ſociety, which being directed in favour of virtue and human happineſs, ſhall not loſe its reward; for however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed ſuch perſons may paſs down the ſtream of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028069_0011_0FD68FEBA8C73D50"/>
time, they are diſtinguiſhed by Him whoſe eye ſeeth all things, and ſhall finally meet with the public ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of their Redeemer and Judge.</p>
            <p>No ſeaſon is ſo quiet in this turbulent world, as to exclude the propriety of military preparation; the beſt ſecurity for peace, is to be prepared for war. Too great a diſtinction between the civil and military characters is productive of evil. The wiſdom of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment ſhould aim to unite both in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; that every citizen may conſider himſelf as a ſoldier, and every ſoldier may remember that he is a citizen.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY will effect this genuine patriotiſm. To the Chriſtian, the love of his country is domeſtic love enlarged. It deſtroys trifling diſtinctions, and while it embraces with warmth the intereſts of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular nation, it is corrected by the love of human kind.</p>
            <p>HOW deſpicable was the patriotiſm which taught the Grecian and Roman ſoldier to ſeek the aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſement of his own, at the expenſe and with the ruin of every other country. The Chriſtian ſoldier views things on a more extended plan. The world is his country; man his brother; and nothing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as foreign to him, which relates to the good of the ſpecies; when purſuing the intereſt of a part, he does not overlook the good of the <hi>whole;</hi> when he unſheathes his ſword, it is not to inflict miſery on
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028069_0012_0FD68FECC8EC7838"/>
others, but to defend the inheritance which God has given him; the juſtice of his cauſe gives ſteadineſs to his temper, and firmneſs to his arm, in the greateſt dangers.</p>
            <p>NATURE has inveſted death with terrors; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to feel them, is a vain boaſt; ſome ſtronger paſſion may ſtifle, nothing but religion can raiſe the ſoul above, the fears of death, or inſpire a rational courage in the views of it.</p>
            <p>IT is madneſs, and not courage, to dare death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a hope beyond it. If this momentary life is to be our all, and exiſtence to ceaſe with our ceaſing pulſe, reaſon urges to protract it by every poſſible expedient; for what can compenſate for the loſs of being? How are the ſenſeleſs aſhes of the hero af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the preſervation or the ruin of his country? both are to him perfectly indifferent.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER the underſtanding may be dazzled by the falſe reaſonings of thoſe, who with an abſurd zeal have abuſed the powers of eloquence, to weaken the evidence of a future ſtate, candour on reflection will acknowledge, that it is weakening, if not deſtroying the great principle of morality, and the only ſolid ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in the hour of danger.</p>
            <p>As the proſpect of immortality, ſo every thing rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative to man riſes or falls. Exiſtence is hardly worth acknowledging, if confined to a tranſient, anxious
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028069_0013_0FD68FEF93674900"/>
being of threeſcore years and ten. Connected with a future ſtate, the great doctrine of the goſpel, man holds a nobler rank in the ſcale of rational creatures, his intereſts become more important, and he feels a debt of gratitude to the Author of his being.</p>
            <p>PERSUADED of, and looking forward to an happy immortality, man conſiders himſelf as a pupil edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated here, for a more valuable inheritance hereafter. God is his inſtructor; nature and revelation, reaſon and conſcience point out the leſſons which he is to learn and practiſe; providence exerciſes the diſcipline by which they are enforced.</p>
            <p>IN general, we are taught to place our hope in God, as our reconciled Father in Jeſus Chriſt; to love him with our whole heart, and our neighbour as ourſelves; to purſue true glory, by becoming workers together with God, in promoting, according to our abilities, the good of ſociety, the order, virtue and happineſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>THE glory acquired in this way will be ſolid and laſting. It depends not on the page of hiſtory, nor on marble monuments. It may be ſaid of ſuch, their witneſs is in heaven, and their record is on high. It has no connexion with the opinion which the world may entertain of us; it is ſufficient, that the Lord knoweth who are his. The good man is ſatisfied from himſelf, and rejoiceth in the proſpects of that period, when the Captain of his ſalvation ſhall crown
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028069_0014_0FD68FF114A77DA8"/>
with unfading glory his good ſoldier, who in this ſtate of trial has acted his part well, and been faithful unto death.</p>
            <p>FORMAL, complimentary addreſſes we deſpiſe: You, Gentlemen, of this Ancient and Honourable Company, will excuſe me from every thing of the kind; and permit me to addreſs you with that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſincerity which peculiarly ſuit my profeſſion and my age.</p>
            <p>YOU ſee at once what muſt be the drift of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, if connected with the preceding diſcourſe. It is not to remind you that your Company is <hi>ancient and honourable;</hi> that it has been an ornament to your country; has furniſhed thoſe who have done honour to the character of the ſoldier; and that veterans, who have bled in the cauſe of their country, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted their names in your rolls. Theſe things may be mentioned as excitements to emulation. Degen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eracy is diſgraceful. But our grand object is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, Gentlemen, that to be good ſoldiers, you muſt be good men and good Chriſtians; that to be qualified to ſerve your country effectually, you muſt ſerve the Lord Chriſt; and that unleſs this is the caſe, whatever names you may aſſume, whatever pomp you may exhibit, whatever patriotiſm or courage you may profeſs, it is all idle parade; a kind of ſcenery, which may amuſe and pleaſe for a time, but when the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain drops, darkneſs and deſpair ſucceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:028069_0015_0FD68FF28DCF0CA8"/>
THE character of the good ſoldier and the good citizen are eſſentially the ſame; religion is the baſis of both. Piety is the parent of ſocial and perſonal virtue; theſe render men mutual bleſſings</p>
            <p>VICE diſſolves the bonds of ſociety; weakens the force of law; enflames and ſets at liberty the unruly paſſions of men; produces contention, confuſion and miſery. Religion the reverſe; ſtrengthens the ſocial bond; gives energy to law; reſtrains the paſſions; produces order, peace, and public happineſs. No government can be happy, no free government can long exiſt, unleſs its character is prevailingly virtuous.</p>
            <p>THE good ſoldier muſt be a patriot; he loves his country, and conſults her intereſts; but, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible is that patriotiſm, which will not diſpoſe a man to do the moſt eſſential, and perhaps the only thing he is capable of doing for the good of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that is, to be virtuous. We cannot all fill pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, we may fill our private ſtation, ſo as to render it a poſt of honour. If we are not called to ſhow the good ſoldier in the field, we may do it to as good purpoſe at home, by oppoſing <hi>vice,</hi> our own and our country's greateſt enemy.</p>
            <p>YOU, Gentlemen, are conſidered as our firſt mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary corps; your example will do much towards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting a military ſpirit, giving it proper direction, and fixing the hitherto undeſcribable point of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary honour. If you connect it with the dignity of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028069_0016_0FD68FFC080E4950"/>
religion, and the amiable forms of ſocial and private virtue, the effect will be happy; and within the ſphere of your influence, the good ſoldier, the man of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, the good man, and the good Chriſtian will be the ſame. May the God of armies bleſs you! and may your inſtitution flouriſh, till wars ſhall ceaſe by the prevalence of the kingdom of the Redeemer. May you keep in view and ſteadily follow him; obey his orders; do his well; and he will certainly lead you to <hi>victory</hi> and to <hi>glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS reſpectable auditory will indulge me with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that although we exclude politics from the deſk any farther than as eſſentially connected with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we may be permitted on this occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the gratitude we feel to Providence for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent form of government with which our country is favoured; and for the happy effects we have derived from it for ſucceſſive years; nor do we conſider ſome difference of opinion upon political ſubjects as an evil; it leads to inveſtigation, conſequently to the diſcovery of truth. That free government is in real danger which meets with no oppoſition; and a dead uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of opinion diſcovers ſuch an apathy in the public mind as threatens the death of liberty.</p>
            <p>THE only evil we diſcover here is a want of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, where different opinions are abetted. Suppoſe our neighbour to be in an error, why ſhould we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the heart for the errors of the head? But alas!
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028069_0017_0FD68FFE20931C80"/>
where or whoſe is the error? Is it yours? or is it mine? Let each take his ſhare of that weakneſs and liability to err, which is common to us all, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe himſelf if he findeth the pride of his heart betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into an imaginary infallibility, or to think the worſe of another, merely on account of his hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a different opinion.</p>
            <p>LET us cultivate that charity which thinketh no evil, and which by cementing our hearts will prevent the ill effects ariſing from different political views. Our political hemiſphere has been clouded, and we have been threatened with the calamity of foreign war; but we flatter ourſelves, that the bleſſing of Heaven upon the prudent meaſures of our national government, will diſperſe the cloud, and that the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of peace will ſtill be indulged to our favoured country; that her riſing glory will anſwer the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectations and fervent prayers of her friends. But a nobler object ſhould terminate our views; another and a better country beyond the grave. It has been purchaſed for, revealed to, and urged upon us by the moſt powerful motives. Let us embrace the animating hope, and under the influence of it ſteadily endeavour to act our parts well, as good ſold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
