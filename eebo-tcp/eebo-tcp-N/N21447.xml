            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AT a time like the preſent, when the Liberties of the People are in danger; when the executive and legiſlative powers have united to denounce the POPULAR SOCIETIES; and when there is great reaſon to fear that the ſupineſs of the friends of Liberty will enable its enemies to accompliſh its deſtruction; it behoves every lover of his country, every advocate for the equal rights of man, to awake from the dream of deluſive ſecurity, and exert every energy of his nature, to enlighten and preſerve his fellow-citizens.</p>
            <p>The DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES have been ſtigmatized with the opprobrious epithets of Anarchiſts and Diſorganizers; they have been loudly rated as wanting in political knowledge, and deſtitute of integrity; and the public has been earneſtly called upon, not to conſider them with the eye of friendlineſs and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, but with the determined frown of indignation and contempt.</p>
            <p>An enquiry naturally ariſes here—What have theſe people done? Wherefore are we required to ſuſpect or deteſt them? It would be out of place, were I here to enter into a formal juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their principles and conduct; neither do I deſign it. It muſt be left to time, and to the unbiaſſed judgment of future generations, to determine candidly on this great queſtion.</p>
            <p>But whether the Democratic Societies have, or have not, been ſucceſsful in the demonſtration; there can be no doubt, in the mind of every intelligent obſerver of the condition of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that a dangerous Coalition exiſts (<hi>actively,</hi> if not <hi>formally</hi>) to deſtroy the general influence of the people; or, at leaſt, ſo to modify it, as may be moſt advantageous to the perſonal aggrand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſement of the Coalition.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are beſt acquainted with the hiſtory of theſe States, as well while under the authority and controul of Great Britain, as ſince the acknowledgement of their independence, have not failed to obſerve that this ſpirit of Ariſtocracy has manifeſted itſelf in various ways, and under very various forms, at different times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:028171_0003_0FD73525B22F7D08"/>
The deſign of the Britiſh Miniſtry, beyond diſpute, was to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the political and religious ſupremacy of their country over ours. A plan was undoubtedly in agitation to ſaddle us with an hereditary nobility; and a ſufficient number of <hi>right reverend</hi> bigots was to be diſtributed among us, who might wield the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of opinion in ſupport of that power which gave them being, and maintained them in the enjoyment of its advantages. The revolution diſconcerted theſe meaſures. But though, for awhile, it prevented any attempts to carry them into execution, it did not deſtroy that ſecret longing which had been excited by the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the vile inſtruments of the mother country.</p>
            <p>It might be <hi>dangerous,</hi> and it certainly would be <hi>imprudent,</hi> to develope the ſecrets of all ſucceeding attempts. Theſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately for America, have hitherto failed of ſucceſs. GOD grant that all future ſimilar deſigns may be equally ineffectual! The ſureſt means of cauſing them to be ſo, is, early to alarm the public mind concerning all men and all motions which appear to aim at the eſtabliſhment of an undue influence in the hands of any particular deſcription of citizens; and (the Honourable Legiſlator will pardon me if I miſapply his words) <q>gibbet them to public deteſtation.</q> This is the more neceſſary, as it is impoſſible to determine to what exceſſes even that aſſumption of power, which is apparently moſt innocent, may lead thoſe who exerciſe it: and, as there is reaſon to fear, there are thoſe in exalted ſtations who would gladly ſing "the ditty of Republicaniſm," in deriſion, at the funeral of LIBERTY.</p>
            <p>My enquiries have led me to examine, with more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon attention, the ſubject of <hi>Policy,</hi> eſpecially the policy of the United States: and this, becauſe it appears evident to me, that, hitherto, our government is only a government of expedients; and that the <hi>great principle,</hi> by which the complicated affairs of this vaſt continent are to be directed, is not yet diſcovered. To this end, the moſt exact ſcrutiny has been made into the hiſtory, manners, circumſtances, &amp;c. of this country; and, above all, into the characters and ſituations of thoſe perſons who have at different periods taken the lead in civil, ſocial, military, and political life, throughout the ſeveral States. It was in the courſe of this ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny that the following POEM (the firſt Book of which is now given to the public) fell into my hands.</p>
            <p>The Author of this work was, as acknowledged therein, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in one of thoſe plots againſt the liberties of the people, of which I have taken notice; and, I have good reaſon to believe,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:028171_0004_0FD73525B56962B8"/>more deeply implicated in it than he aſſumes to be in the Poem. At any rate, he was the confidential friend of the man moſt active in its promotion. To the furtherance of this ſcheme, not Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans only, but Foreigners alſo, were aſſociated; and all their projects were dear being carried into effect, by the aſſiſtance of a number of Foreign Envoys—<hi>three, in particular</hi>—though but one (probably for poetical reaſons) is taken notice of in the Poem. The cauſes of their failure are exhibited at large in the work itſelf.</p>
            <p>The Author ſubmitted in ſilence to the demolition of his hopes; and ſolaced himſelf by compoſing this Poem at his country-ſeat, whither he had retired, and where he died a few years ſince,—with the reputation of a great Patriot! The manuſcript, which probably was never intended for publication, at length paſſed into my hands. Hitherto I have kept it (even from the knowledge of my moſt intimate friends), together with copies in his own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of a few of the Author's original letters, as a precious evidence of the factious deſigns of certain aſpiring characters in our country; and nothing but our preſent alarming ſituation could have induced me to make it public, while ſo many of the perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages commemorated in it are yet alive. But the luſt of power, when once excited, however it may be repreſſed for a time, can never be extinguiſhed but with life. And when I ſee the ſame ſpirit, which has been ſo often ſubdued, again ſtarting into action—and my countrymen again likely to become its victims—I ſhould be wanting in that patriotiſm by which I profeſs ever to be guided, were I to be deterred by fear of <hi>any man,</hi> however exalted in ſtation, from making every poſſible exertion in their behalf.</p>
            <p>The publication of this Poem, at this time, appeared to me to promiſe ſome advantage to the general cauſe of Liberty. It may awaken ſome attention to our preſent condition; and, by ſhewing (even under the guiſe of intereſted praiſe) the means which <hi>have been</hi> uſed to acquire undue conſideration and power, teach my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens to look warily about them, and ſee whether like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns are not now forming, and whether they ought not to be on their guard. It may ſerve to <q>counteract certain <hi>political here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi>
               </q>—I repeat it again, <q>
                  <hi>certain political hereſies</hi>—which have ſprung up among us.</q> And it may excite them to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, that ARISTOCRACY has ever impoſed itſelf upon the necks of all former Republics, till, by its increaſing weight, it has ſunk them in ſlavery; and rouſe into action that energy of Freemen, always ſuperior to the force of Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:028171_0005_0FD7352A3AC2F800"/>
In reſpect to the literary merit of the Poem, it is probable the opinions of men will differ, as their own prejudices and wiſhes are expoſed or flattered. I ſhall attempt no vindication of it in a critical point of view. But I ought to exculpate the Author from one charge, to which he may, in the opinions of thoſe who do not read attentively, have expoſed himſelf: I mean that of <hi>ſelf-vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſervable that the writer every where repreſents himſelf and his friends as influenced ſolely by <hi>ſelf-intereſt:</hi> and it may ſeem improbable that ſuch a confeſſion ſhould proceed from any one who was really ſo influenced. The following extract of a letter, by the ſame hand, will determine the Author's own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on this queſtion. The letter is written to the friend here celebrated under the name of ARISTUS, and bears date November, 1786.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Let others think as they pleaſe: we, who have ſuch ample experience, have long ſince diſcredited the dream of diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted benevolence. Surely no diſpute can be more ridiculous than thoſe which have ariſen on this ſubject, unleſs it ſhould be thoſe reſpecting the propriety of employing (what are called) iniquitous means to obtain a good end. Opinions of this ſort are well enough to amuſe the vulgar; and to be played off on thoſe weak, but well-deſigning men, who muſt have Scripture for every thing they do.</q> And, in another letter to the ſame perſon, he ſays—<q>In the proſecution of this deſign, I have no doubt of your inflexible adherence to that maxim which has ſo long been the governing rule of our actions, <hi>That if the</hi> END <hi>is deſirable, we are not to hold queſtion reſpecting the</hi> MEANS. Our motto ſhould be RESPICE FINEM, but not in the ſenſe of the Philoſopher.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A more ſerious objection ſeems to lie againſt the machinery of the Poet. Nor do I know of any juſtification of it, other than by ſuppoſing it a mere play of the fancy: for it could not be meant by him to inſinuate that the deſigns of his friend were infernal; and it is certain that the Author regarded Heaven and Hell, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Futurity, equally fabulous as the theology of the Greeks or Hindoos, and alike the property of every dealer in rhyme—to be the elegant decorations of the Epopea, or the pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous ornaments of the Sonnet.</p>
            <p>Here, then, the Editor takes his leave, for the preſent, of the reader; aſſuring him, that, if this Firſt Book of 'ARISTOCRACY'
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:028171_0006_0FD7352C182EA4B0"/>ſhall be eſteemed of value, the remaining ones ſhall be preſented to him with all convenient expedition. The Editor, indeed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned at firſt to have publiſhed the entire work: but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from ſo doing, by a fear leſt its ſize would prevent that general circulation which might be ſecured by a leſs immediately expenſive mode of publication.</p>

Such exclamations of admiration as the author forces from us by the charms of his verſe, may be paſſed over, without their being looked upon as any way implicating us in the villainy of the friends of ARISTUS And here it becomes us to give the author all due credit for the ſublime uſe he has made of machinery ſo common as that of the infernal regions.
