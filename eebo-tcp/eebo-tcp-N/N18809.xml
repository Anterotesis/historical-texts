            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is noble in you, CANDIDUS, to declare, that you don't wiſh <hi>the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> to be monopolized <hi>by your ſex only;</hi> nor do I wiſh it to be by ours. A republic of women in ſcience, would be to me as extraordinary and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic in private life, as in the ſtate: All I wiſh is, that the daughters of the land (on whom much depends) might enjoy ſimilar privileges with the ſons; for though it is not given them to riſe ſo high in the ſcale of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as the lords of the creation, that tranſmit their names to poſterity, yet as virtuous acts will confer more real honor than a <hi>name,</hi> why ſhould they be denied it? Candour muſt allow,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024450_0013_0FC74DEB0F9A5AB0"/>
that God nor nature has not excluded women from being ornaments to their families, however ſome have chuſed to treat us <hi>even</hi> below rationality. Lord <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> for one, has been very illiberal to us in ſeveral of his letters, wherein he treats us, "as tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling children, capable of nothing but wrangling and quarrelling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> weak crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are bloated up with ſelf-conceit, and foſtered up by vanity:" For he further adds, "women have an intolerable ſhare of it; no flattery, no adulation is too <hi>groſs</hi> for them." We are not obliged to this great maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of politeneſs, for his ſarcaſtical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, on the weak endowments and very narrow faculties of female minds. Had his lordſhip humanely conſidered, that it was to a woman he owed his birth, filial reverence might have induced him to have drawn a veil over female imbecillity, eſpecially
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024450_0014_0FC74DEDC3D32428"/>
as it is allowed, by very competent judges, that a tenderneſs and reſpect for the fair-ſex is a criterion of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal politeneſs, and refinement of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: But I hope the virtues of women, in all ages, have, in general, been <hi>ſuch,</hi> that the bare mention of them will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently refute ſo cruel an aſſertion.</p>

It muſt indeed be allowed, that the preſent mode of education lies too much in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal qualifications, which, like an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the firſt concoction, ſpreads its pernicious influence over our whole lives.

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024450_0015_0FC74DEF3377C030"/>
it is impoſſible to ſay how much the ſoul is curbed in her moſt noble productions, and uſeful actions, in which the female powers are not taught to expand. I am certain, numbers of us are more obliged to nature and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for inſtruction, in many parts of laudable improvement, than to all we learn at ſchool. I ſpeak from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: We are forced to ſtruggle for the little knowledge we attain, as a ſwathed infant does for liberty, that is pinioned down, body and limbs, by an injudicious <hi>nurſe.</hi> This being my caſe among many others, I muſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely diſclaim the courage you attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to me, i. e.

Prudence, Oeconomy, and an obliging deportment in the domeſtic ſphere, I well know, render us far more pleaſing and uſeful in the private walks of life, than mere learning can do, without the former attainments.

Perhaps Providence, foreſeeing how rigorouſly we are denied thoſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and acquiſitions that you enjoy ſo freely, has endowed our minds with ſtronger propenſities to virtues of a calm, but magnanimous turn, to compenſate, in ſome degree, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous trials that fall to the lot of ſome women, particularly thoſe who are linked in wedlock, with men of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, weak, impetuous, or churliſh temper.

The late ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Mrs.<hi>Rowe</hi> is one among many, whoſe character is a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of this aſſertion; for ſhe, in obſcure life, and with a mediocrity of fortune, was truly exemplary in exalted beneficence, aſcetic piety, and great humility; and to the bright aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage of theſe, and other virtues, ſhe added thoſe real accompliſhments, and knowledge in literature, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn high ſtations. Would the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking part of women endeavor to imitate ſuch a model of human per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, much money might be ſaved from being laviſhed away in ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

ornament, and much time redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from being ſpent in diverſions of doubtful innocence. Mrs.<hi>Rowe's</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate charities were greater in her ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than thoſe public ones of great perſonages, whoſe names are recorded in hiſtory: That informs us, St <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine's</hi> hoſpital, near the Tower, had the honor to be founded and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by four queens of England. Queen <hi>Matilda</hi> or <hi>Maud,</hi> was the firſt found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, whoſe graces of mind and perſon, we are told, ſeemed to contend for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valſhip; yet her ſupreme humility did not allow her to be conſcious of either. Queen <hi>Eleanor,</hi> wife to King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, was next, whoſe conjugal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was of ſuch a magnitude, that ſhe ſaved her huſband's life at the greateſt hazard of her own. Queen <hi>Philippa</hi> was the third foundreſs of this noble hoſpital; the ſplendor of her virtues I will not enlarge more on
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024450_0055_0FC74E9AF7D4A9E0"/>
than I have already done: Nor ſhall I expatiate upon thoſe of the fourth queen, <hi>Catharine,</hi> (dowager) I ſuppoſe to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. To theſe royal dames, (of ancient times) I might add a long liſt of noble ladies now living, that petitioned to his late majeſty for, and liberally ſubſcribed to, the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the foundling-hoſpital.</p>
                  <p>Though my examples of female ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, or arguments for female lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, are by no means exhauſted, I will obtrude but one character more, of the former, to your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—It is that of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> (Margaret) counteſs of Richmond and Derby, and mother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh. This lady was greatly diſtinguiſhed for her piety, though it was ſtrongly tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with the ſuperſtition of thoſe times. Her charities were very great and extenſive: She performed, all her life time, ſo many noble acts, and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:024450_0056_0FC74EA49A9294F0"/>
charitable deeds, that as <hi>Stow</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it, "they cannot be recited in a ſmall volume." I ſhall mention only three; the two colleges ſhe founded at Cambridge, one to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the other to St. <hi>John</hi> his diſciple; and the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar ſchool at <hi>Winbourne:</hi> And ſhe kept conſtantly in her houſe twelve poor perſons, whom ſhe maintained in every reſpect; and her high rank<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis ſaid of this illuſtrious lady that, by her birth and marriage with the Earl of Richmond, ſhe was allied to thirty kings and queens.</note> was ſo far from inſpiring her with pride or haughtineſs, that ſhe would frequently dreſs the wounds of poor diſtreſſed people with her own hands.</p>
                  <p>So much to the memory of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned dead! The celebrity of living ladies, I ſhould be happy to ſee recited by your pen, as I flatter myſelf they muſt retain the eſteem of the moſt

               <head>TO FULVIA: ON THE TRANQUIL PLEASURE OF RURAL FELICITY.</head>
               <p>I HAVE left the buſy town, and all its tumultuous joys, for ſeveral weeks paſt, to viſit ſome very worthy friends, who live a retired life in the humble vale of <hi>Calmly.</hi> That you have not heard from me ſince I have been there, is owing to my incapacity of entertaining a <hi>lady</hi> of your gaiety of temper, with volatile news from a village, where amuſements ſeldom riſe higher than a mountebank parade, or the rural felicity of a <hi>May-pole.</hi> No doubt but you will rally me for vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garity of taſte, when I tell you I was a
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024450_0059_0FC74EB04AC3FB40"/>
ſpectator of theſe ruſtic diverſions. But don't be ſevere on me, for you know my veneration for antiquity; and I can plead ſuperiors in rank, who attended the feſtivities of a May-day, long before your humble ſervant was in being.<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe feſtivities were formerly attended by perſons of diſtinction.</note> My being accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here at this time was a fortunate circumſtance, as it gave the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants (of the higheſt claſs) an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to pay their reſpect to their worthy prieſt, by inviting his gueſt to their <hi>May-pole.</hi> I knew the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paid me, meant as much reſpect as a ticket from a ducheſs to a birth-night ball; and as ſuch I received the ſimplicity of peaſants with grateful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. I excuſed myſelf from being near the centre of entertainment, as both my friends at the vicarage were invalids, for which reaſon I confined
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:024450_0060_0FC74EB174B54D28"/>
myſelf to the limits of their paddock. But though I could not, with proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhare the honors of the day, in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing round the <hi>May-pole,</hi> I was near enough ſtationed to be happy in ſeeing much innocent joy diffuſed over the face of the harmleſs cottagers, without any luxurious expence. How cheaply may pleaſure be procured, where the mind is not tainted with ambition or extravagance! A ploughman's whiſtle, or a milk maid's ſong, ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys as much muſic as thoſe Italian notes, for which you often pay a very high price at the opera. But then they would not have the force of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, which has a moſt powerful charm for <hi>Fulvia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fine weather, and this gay ſeaſon of the year, when <hi>nature wantons in her prime,</hi> I ſuppoſe, contributed to the chearfulneſs of this rural aſſembly.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:024450_0061_0FC74EC244870EC0"/>
However, the delight ſo apparent in their aſpect, communicated itſelf to my mind; and it was equal, if not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, to any I ever felt, when I have been a ſpectator of the proud parade which attends the king when he goes to the parliament houſe, or the glare and feſtivity that accompanies a lord mayor's ſhow. Theſe pageants of a day wear off the mind with the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions of it, or elſe leave it to reflect on the caprices of fortune: For you know, the followers of theſe triumphal appearances are often divided into parties of <hi>huzzaers,</hi> or <hi>hiſſers,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing (perhaps) for why, or what; but as one leads the other, they form a clamor, which majeſty it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cannot ſilence.
<q>"What king ſo ſtrong, can tie the gall up in the ſlanderous tongue?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>That monarch never can, who is
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:024450_0062_0FC74EC716DD60D8"/>
giddy with unbridled power, and thirſt of unlimited ſway; who does not uſe his prerogative of human greatneſs for the good of his ſubjects, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, whether in church or ſtate, and bounds his ambition by this reaſon.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not moralize with you, <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who, I am ſure, will not envy me the ruſtic enjoyment of plebeian ſports, whilſt you can range unrival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Kenſington gardens, and the park; and, at other times, diſplay yourſelf in all the pride of beauty, glittering with jewels in a ſide-box, the maſquerade, or Ranelagh, with all your ſurrounding beau attendants: Theſe inflate your mind with empty adulation, and make you think you are ſomething above the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and incapable of change, pain, or the innovations of age and diſeaſe. Alas! what is there our weak ſex will not believe, when we are compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:024450_0063_0FC74EC818D7F858"/>
with the attributes of a deity? Pleaſure we ſtill purſue in every delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive form, though when it has run its wild career, it generally leaves us near the ſame ground on which it firſt found us; ſeldom on better.</p>
               <p>But theſe, you will tell me, "are cold, phlegmatic ſentiments, to which you will not attempt to lower your i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas: They can only be adopted by ſome country parſon's wife, or forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken old maid, who never breathed the fragrant air of St. James's, and can have no perception of the glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of ſubduing hearts.</p>

of the homage paid to beauty, than the deaf can be a judge of harmony, the blind of ſymmetry, or the prude of politeneſs." Such being the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of your heart, I am afraid I ſhould have but ill ſucceſs, were I to invite you to leave the <hi>beau-monde</hi> party, (who are daily offering up the incenſe of flattery to your greedy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) and, for variety's ſake, wiſh you to try what the country will afford: A different entertainment I'll aſſure you, as you have never been out of the ſmoke of London, I will try to give you a ſpecimen of what delights me here.</p>
               <p>My reverend friend, in whoſe hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable manſion I now am, performs all the duties of his function, with great regularity and exemplary piety. He has long ſince renounced popular applauſe, for the ſolid ſatisfactions of
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024450_0065_0FC74ED846865D48"/>
duty. His congregation highly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him in the pulpit, and love and eſteem him out of it. With gentle remonſtrance he ſilences any little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes that may ariſe amongſt his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, and nips contention in the bud, betwixt diſſenting parties. In many of the exigencies that occur in life, this worthy man has ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>lawyer</hi> as well as the <hi>divine:</hi> and has been thought the former in courts of judicature, where he has pleaded the cauſe of the widow and orphan with reſiſtleſs energy, without fee or reward, <hi>when he ſaw his help in the gate.</hi>

               <p>I often enjoy the luxury of mental food, when I go by invitation) to my friend's library, not <hi>with remnants of Latin to puzzle the vicar,</hi> but with queſtions relative to opinions, books, or authors. Theſe my preceptor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately condeſcends to anſwer, and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024450_0066_0FC74ED9F3FEFD48"/>
conveys inſtruction to his female pupil, without oſtentation of learning, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of reproof. Moſt generouſly my friend points our ſome latent flaw in my conduct or ſentiments, that was before unknown to myſelf; and by ſome amicable oppoſition in argument, rectifies my judgment, by politely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me ſenſible of my errors. The ſtream of converſation is generally turned into ſome improving or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing channel, without degenerating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tittle-tattle, or dwelling on the faults of the abſent; the errors of whom, this ſociety think it prudent to forget, and ſeldom allow themſelves to make a comment on it. In other company, I have often obſerved with concern, ſcandal gives a zeſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and if one cannot dwell on that topic in modern viſits, or enlarge on faſhions, &amp;c. &amp;c. a ragout is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to compleat the table. As I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

always partake of this feaſt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with innocence to myſelf, nor ſtem its tide by reſerve, I have often turned from it, and combated your railery on the occaſion, with ſilent ſmiles, but not of approbation. To accept of an invitation to an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment reaſon condemns, is to me like being duped by that enchantreſs, whoſe bed was covered with fine linen, and ſtrewed with roſes, but thorns were planted in the pillow of reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But here it is far otherwiſe, the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton never invited the libertine to come in and ſmell of her myrrh, cinnamon, &amp;c. &amp;c. with half the propriety that I again ſolicit you to come and regale your mental faculties, in this ſociety at <hi>Calmly.</hi>—Believe me, <hi>Fulvia,</hi> it would ſtrengthen your reaſon, and give a laſting poliſh (tho' not a modern one) to your manners.

               <p>The world, in general, have a very illiberal opinion of the conduct and manners of women, who are deemed <hi>learned,</hi> an epithet of frightful import! With it, we are looked on, by our own ſex, as owls among the leſſer birds; and, by the lords of the creation, as having a ſuperficial, pragmatical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

               <p>To be a wife, Maria, ſuch as I could wiſh you, requires more care, more temper, more conduct and ſolidity, than young women uſually pretend to; therefore, to become a wife, it were neceſſary to become a new woman, in the moſt eſſential parts of her conduct. The very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the obſequiouſneſs of a lover, and the authority of a huſband, will ſet this in a proper light. To the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your marriage it is your reign; your lover is proud to oblige you, watches your ſmiles, is obedient to your commands, anxious to pleaſe you, and careful to avoid every thing you diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; but you have no ſooner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced that harſh word <hi>obey,</hi> than

you give up the reins, and it is his turn to rule ſo long as you live. Then it is that he, very juſtly expects an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate return. He has ſerved you with fidelity; and the laws of nature, the bonds of ſociety, and the injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of religion, now claim your grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience—not to the mandates of a tyrant, but your chearful ſubmiſſion, and pleaſing compliance to the ſoft dictates of a friend, a guardian, and protector. Yet this is ſo oppoſite to the vain pleaſure of a rule, and ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be reliſhed at the firſt, that many young girls, ſoon after their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, think themſelves ill treated if they are ever ſo gently contradicted, and ſeem, by their perverſe manner, to think eternal adoration their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular due, and that their huſbands ought to kneel like their lovers, and fawn like their lap dogs, to their lives end.

them in an advantageous point of view, or making them objects of envy or imitation, would only render the huſband contemptible, the wife deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. A quite contrary mode of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour is abſolutely neceſſary in every woman, who is ambitious of honor, or barely deſirous of reſpect.</p>
               <p>The moment a woman enters into the nuptial ſtate, ſhe ſhould look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herſelf as a new being, or rather as being in a new kind of exiſtence. She ought to look upon the trifles which before delighted her, with the ſame eyes as a man views the baubles of his infancy. The pleaſing levities, and agreeable fooleries of a girl, are particularly diſguſting in a wife, and very often receive a conſtruction not at all redounding to her underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or her modeſty. The honor of a woman, and that of a ſoldier, is juſtly ſaid to be equally delicate, it muſt not
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:024450_0088_0FC74A78B9286E58"/>
be trifled with; but the reputation of a wife exceeds both; it muſt not be injured, even in thought. Hence you may perceive, of what importance it is for a married woman, to attend to ſeeming trifles, both on account of the unfavorable impreſſions her huſband may receive on her neglect, and what conſtructions a buſy world may put on it. It is neceſſary for her to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh, in a great meaſure, her young female acquaintance; at leaſt, to be careful of going abroad with parties of them, except in the company of her huſband; for you ſeldom know a knot of young females without their attendant beaux, whoſe politeneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuſe compliments to a lady mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe ſhe may be married; and theſe compliments may ſometimes be impertinent, often miſconſtrued, and are generally improper for the ear of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:024450_0089_0FC74A8493A39298"/>
a married woman. But the relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing of all male acquaintance is an indiſpenſible point, where reputation is regarded, and intended to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Innocent freedoms between the youthful of both ſexes may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, before matrimony, without the cenſure even of the moſt rigid cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic; but after that, they become cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in the eye of the world, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuffered without a manifeſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the character of a virtuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

               <head>ON THE TENDERNESS AND FORTITUDE OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER.</head>
               <p>ALTHOUGH delicacy and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs be the moſt amiable ornaments of the female character, and are thoſe properties which more immediately inſure our veneration, and command our love; yet is not fortitude in the hour of trial, nor foreſight in that of danger, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from their other virtues.</p>
               <p>The devotion of women towards the objects of their duty and affection, has been carried, in many caſes, to ſuch extremes of ſenſibility, that the weakneſs of their natures has been forgotten in the day of trouble, and when the body would have ſunk had it not been ſupported by the vigor of the mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:024450_0091_0FC74A87C2E6D410"/>
How often have theſe amiable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of parential affection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubial love hung over the bed of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for weary days and ſleepleſs nights, without the ſigh of impatience, or the murmer of complaint! The victims of ſentiment, and abſorbed by duty, how frequently do they teſtify their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although, perhaps, to an unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ungrateful object, when their reward, alas! happens to be inſulting language, and a breaking heart! How diſtreſſing is it to ſee them ſteal aſide to wipe away, in private, thoſe tears, which, if publicly encouraged to flow, would ſtrike with contrition and ſhame the unworthy partaker of their cares! Tender to exceſs, when tenderneſs is a duty, and undaunted to the extreme, when courage becomes a virtue; we ſee them collected in danger, patient of cold, of hunger, and fatigue; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſhare the ſtony pillow or the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:024450_0092_0FC74A8E86920990"/>
noiſome draught—to deſpiſe the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wind, the beating rain, or the lathing ſurge—provided only they can ſoften miſery, and prove their love.</p>
               <p>In thoſe trying and eventful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life, when the balanced mind requires a counſellor to fix its reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a friend to point out, and to ſhew by example, the neceſſity of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; how often have women exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, upon thoſe occaſions, inſtances of courage the moſt heroical, of reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the moſt philoſophical, and of a contempt of death, to be admired, at leaſt, if not imitated! and of this poſition we have many vouchers in the annals of ancient hiſtory, as well as in the occurrences of our own.</p>
               <p>The life and death of Portia, one of the moſt illuſtrious, as well as one of the moſt virtuous and accompliſhed of the Roman matrons, affords a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prominent, and, if I may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:024450_0093_0FC74A900BB00120"/>
the expreſſion, a very ſtriking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the intrepid deſpondency of a female kind, which ſhares in, and is determined to partake of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of diſappointed and heroic love. The daughter of Cato, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned of the ſenators of Rome, for auſterities of manners and integrity of heart; ſhe ſeemed to have derived from the paternal ſource the dignity of a more than female deportment in life, and of a more than manly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in death: and the means that ſhe employed to rid herſelf of a painful exiſtence were unprecedented for their application and effect. So ſoon as ſhe heard of the overthrow and fate of her beloved Brutus, ſhe ſwallowed the burning coal; as if the exceſs of her virtue could only be meaſured by the extremity of her ſuffering.</p>
               <p>There are but few characters in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory that excite the feelings of the
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:024450_0094_0FC74A95F073B790"/>
reader ſo much as the unhappy fortune of Agrippina, the illuſtrious widow of the great Germanicus. A peculiar tenderneſs of ſentiment is always found to accompany her name; and the eye ſeems to droop with compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſoul to melt with pity, whenever this virtuous and amiable mourner is brought to remembrance, and bears with a feeble ſtep and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected look, the urn that contains the aſhes of her lamented huſband: a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that has always been a particular favourite with the lovers of painting, and which will ever ſtrike and intereſt the mind of ſenſibility, ſo long as the pen can immortalize, or the pencil charm.</p>
               <p>The fortitude of Arria has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded on marble, and adds, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an amiable example, but a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born proof, of the undaunted vigor of the female mind.</p>
               <p>

Paetus, the huſband of Arria, was a favorite of Nero, and to whom he confided a ſecret of importance, with a ſtrict injunction that he ſhould not communicate to any perſon whatever, the nature of its contents; but ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular an affection did he bear to his wife, that he could not help committing to her breaſt the particulars with which he was inſtructed; but he ſoon had occaſion to repent of his indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and her life, as well as his own, became the victim of her imprudence and breach of truſt.</p>
               <p>While the one was lamenting in priſon the abuſe of confidence, and the weakneſs of love, and in moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary expectation of an ignominious and a painful death, the other found an opportunity to introduce herſelf into his preſence, and with a dagger, which ſhe had hitherto concealed, ſhe inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her breaſt a deadly wound, and
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:024450_0096_0FC74AA132D5CF28"/>
then drawing out the fatal inſtrument, ſhe preſented the point to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and accompanied it with theſe memorable words: "The point to me is ſoft, but the wound that it will occaſion thee is truly painful"</p>
               <p>This kind of fortitude, reſulting from deſpair, is unamiable, if not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting in itſelf, and partakes more of ferocity, than of that patient firmneſs, and affecting reſolution, of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bright examples may be given in the Engliſh hiſtory.</p>
               <p>When Prince Edward was wounded by a poiſon'd arrow from the hand of a Saracen, in the time of the cruſades, his wife, the beauteous Eleanor, with ſignal love and pious hazard, applied her balmy lips to attract the venom it had left; an inſtance of affection and fortitude without a rival, and which danger could be only juſtified by the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:024450_0097_0FC74AA2028ED8A0"/>
tranſcendant merit of the object for whom it was incurred.</p>
               <p>The conduct of Margaret of Anjou, after the defeat of the Sixth Henry at the battle of Hexham, preſents a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtance of female heroiſm; as the field of combat was at too great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the Scottiſh territories to permit the Lancaſtrians to retreat with ſafety, and as the country abounded with mountains and woods, they were not only annoyed, but frequently cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by the enemy. The Queen, in her flight with the prince, betrayed by the ſplendor of dreſs, was ſurrounded and taken by a party of banditti; but while they were diſputing about the ſpoil, ſhe made an eſcape, and had not proceeded far before ſhe was again met by a ſingle robber; when, collecting all her fortitude, ſhe advanced towards him, ſaying, "Here, friend, protect thy prince." The man, ſtruck with
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:024450_0098_0FC74AA4DBE4EA38"/>
awe, inſtantly obeyed the mandate, and conducted his royal charge to a village adjoinining to the ſea, from which they paſſed into the dominions of the Duke of Burgundy in Holland.</p>
               <p>Many other inſtances of tenderneſs and fortitude, produced by inſtinctive or acquired love, might be adduced to the honor of the female character, in the exalted ſituations of life: and even in the more humble and neglected ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of ſociety, the affection and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of women, although ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by diſtreſs and miſery, have not been without the excitements of applauſe and imatation; for virtue is often concealed by rags, and greatneſs of ſoul confined by want of action.</p>
               <p>Do we not frequently obſerve theſe amiable ornaments of human nature, theſe refiners of our pleaſures and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menders of our hearts, whoſe tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſoftens the rigor, and whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

inſtructs us to bear the rebuffs of life;—do we not frequently ſee theſe angelic conſolers watch over, with care and perſeverence, the bodily ſuffering; and endeavor, by the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of tears, and the energy of words, to divert the merited afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a worthleſs huſband, a cruel parent, or a profligated and ungrateful ſon!</p>
               <p>However painful the knowledge of infidelity and the abuſe of tenderneſs may be, yet is there an unſpeakable comfort to be derived from the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling performance of moral duties, be the objects of them ever ſo undeſerving of regard: and he who can affix a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cenſure of inhumanity, or want of ſentiment, upon that ſex, from whom our principal comforts in life are derived, ought to live forever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from thoſe delights, which a rational intercourſe of thought, and a

confidence of mind, in an union of love and virtue, can only produce, ſubſtantiate, and enſure.</p>

               <head>ON CONVERSATION: FROM MISS MORE'S ESSAYS.</head>
               <p>IT has been adviſed, and by very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable authorities too, that in converſation, women ſhould carefully conceal any knowledge or learning they may happen to poſſeſs. I own with ſubmiſſion, that I do not ſee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the neceſſity or propriety of this advice. For if a young lady has that diſcretion and modeſty, without which all knowledge is little worth, ſhe will never make an ostentatious parade of it, becauſe ſhe will rather be intent on acquiring more, than on diſplaying what ſhe has.</p>
               <p>I am at a loſs to know why a young female is inſtructed to exhibit, in the moſt advantageous point of view, her
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:024450_0102_0FC74AB57B023F38"/>
ſkill in muſic, her ſinging, dancing, taſte in dreſs, and her acquaintance with the moſt faſhionable games and amuſements, while her piety is to be anxiouſly concealed, and her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge affectedly diſavowed, leſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhould draw on her the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an enthuſiaſt, or the latter that of a pedant.</p>
               <p>In regard to knowledge, why ſhould ſhe for ever affect to be on her guard, leſt ſhe ſhould be found guilty of a ſmall portion of it? She need be the leſs ſolicitous about it, as it ſeldom proves to be ſo very conſiderable as to excite aſtoniſhment or admiration: for, after all the acquiſitions which her talents and her ſtudies have ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her to make, ſhe will, generally ſpeaking, be found to have leſs of what is called <hi>learning,</hi> than a common ſchool boy.</p>
               <p>It would be to the laſt degree pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:024450_0103_0FC74AB70F23ABE0"/>
and abſurd, for a young woman to pretend to give the <hi>ton</hi> to the company—to interrupt the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of others, and her own opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of improvement, by talking when ſhe ought to liſten—or to introduce ſubjects out of the common road, in order to ſhow her own wit, or to expoſe the want of it in others: but were the ſex to be totally ſilent when any topic of literature happens to be diſcuſſed in their preſence, converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would loſe much of its vivacity, and ſociety would be robbed of one of its moſt intereſting charms.</p>
               <p>How eaſily and effectually may a well-bred woman promote the moſt uſeful and elegant converſation, almoſt without ſpeaking a word! for the modes of ſpeech are ſcarcely more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable than the modes of ſilence. The ſilence of liſtleſs ignorance, and the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſparkling intelligence, are
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:024450_0104_0FC74AC51970C970"/>
perhaps as ſeparately marked, and as diſtinctly expreſſed, as the ſame feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings could have been by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal language. A woman, in a company where ſhe has the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, may promote any ſubject by a profound and invariable attention, which ſhows that ſhe is pleaſed with it, and by an illuminated countenance, which proves ſhe underſtands it. This obliging attention is the moſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering encouragement in the world to men of ſenſe and letters, to continue any topic of inſtruction or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they happen to be engaged in: it owed its introduction perhaps to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, the beſt introduction in the world for a ſubject of ingenuity, which, though it could not have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally propoſed without pedantry, may be continued with eaſe and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; but which will be frequently and effectually ſtopped by the liſtleſſneſs
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:024450_0105_0FC74AC61275C0F8"/>
inattention, or whiſpering of ſilly girls, whoſe wearineſs betrays their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and whoſe impatience expoſes their ill-breeding. A polite man, however deeply intereſted in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on which he is converſing, catches at the ſlighteſt hint to have done: a look is a ſufficient intimation, and if a pretty ſimpleton, who ſits near him, ſeems <hi>diſtraite,</hi> he puts an end to his remarks, to the great regret of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable part of the company, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might have gained more improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the continuance of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, than a week's reading would have yielded them: for it is ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as this, that give an edge to each other's wit, "as iron ſharpeneth iron."</p>
               <p>That ſilence is one of the great arts of converſation is allowed by Cicero himſelf, who ſays, there is not only an art, but even an eloquence in it. And this opinion is confirmed by a great
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:024450_0106_0FC74AC790D8B6B0"/>
modern<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Bacon.</note> in the following little anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote from one of the ancients:</p>
               <p>When many Grecian philoſophers had a ſolemn meeting before the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of a foreign prince, each en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to ſhow his parts by the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy of his converſation, that the ambaſſador might have ſomething to relate of the Grecian wiſdom. One of them, offended, no doubt, at the loquacity of his companions, obſerved a profound ſilence; when the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, turning to him, aſked, <q>But what have you to ſay, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it?</q> He made this laconic, but very pointed reply: <q>Tell your king that you have found one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Greeks who knew how to be ſilent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is a quality infinitely more intoxicating to the female mind than
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:024450_0107_0FC74AC9B9160380"/>
knowledge, this is wit, the moſt capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating, but the moſt dreaded of all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents: the moſt dangerous to thoſe who have it, and the moſt feared by thoſe who have it not. Though it is againſt all the rules, yet I cannot find in my heart to abuſe this charming quality. He who is grown rich with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, in ſafe and ſober dulneſs, ſhuns it as a diſeaſe, and looks upon poverty as its invariable concomitant. The moraliſt diſclaims againſt it, as the ſource of irregularity; and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bankrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy itſelf; for he conſiders it as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of extravagance and beggary. The cynic will aſk of what uſe it is! Of very little perhaps: no more is a flower garden, and yet it is allowed as an object of innocent amuſement and delightful recreation, A woman who poſſeſſes this quality, has received a moſt dangerous preſent, perhaps not
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:024450_0108_0FC74ACB373C6568"/>
leſs ſo than beauty itſelf: eſpecially if it be not ſheathed in a temper peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly inoffenſive, chaſtiſed by a moſt correct judgment, and reſtrained by more prudence than falls to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lot.</p>
               <p>This talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for as wit is the immediate property of its poſſeſſor, and learning is only an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the knowledge of other people, there is much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that we ſhould be vain of what is our own, than of what we borrow.</p>
               <p>But wit, like learning, is not near ſo common a thing as is imagined. Let not, therefore, a young lady be alarmed at the acuteneſs of her own wit, any more than at the abundance of her own knowledge. The great danger is, leſt ſhe ſhould miſtake pert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, flippancy, or imprudence, for
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:024450_0109_0FC74ACEF88B24B8"/>
this brilliant quality, or imagine ſhe is witty, only becauſe ſhe is indiſcreet. This is very frequently the caſe; and this makes the name of wit ſo cheap, while its real exiſtence is ſo rare.</p>
               <p>Leſt the flattery of her acquaintance, or an overweening opinion of her own qualifications, ſhould lead ſome vain and petulant girl into a falſe notion that ſhe has a great deal of wit, when ſhe has only a redundancy of animal ſpirits, ſhe may not find it uſeleſs to attend to the definition of this quality, by one who had as large a portion of it, as moſt individuals could ever boaſt:
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>'Tis not a tale, 'tis not a jeſt,</l>
                        <l>Admir'd with laughter at a feaſt,</l>
                        <l>Nor florid talk, which can that title gain,</l>
                        <l>The proofs of wit forever muſt remain.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Neither can that have any place,</l>
                        <l>At which a virgin hides her face;</l>
                        <l>Such droſs the fire muſt purge away; tis' juſt</l>
                        <l>The author bluſh there, where the reader muſt.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:024450_0110_0FC74AD07B3CE2F0"/>
But thoſe who actually poſſeſs this rare talent, cannot be too abſtinent in the uſe of it. It often makes admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, but it never makes friends; I mean, where it is the predominant fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the unprotected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs ſtate of womanhood calls for friendſhip more than for admiration. She who does not deſire friends, has a ſordid and inſenſible ſoul; but ſhe who is ambitious of making every man her admirer, has an invincible vanity, and a cold heart.</p>
               <p>But to dwell only on the ſide of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; a prudent woman, who has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the reputation of ſome genius, will ſufficiently maintain it, without keeping her faculties always on the ſtretch to ſay <hi>good things.</hi> Nay, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation alone be her object, ſhe will gain a more ſolid one by her forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; as the wiſer part of her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will aſcribe it to the right mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024450_0111_0FC74ADC40B601C0"/>
which is, not that ſhe has leſs wit, but that ſhe has more judgment.</p>
               <p>The fatal fondneſs for indulging a ſpirit of ridicule, and the injurious and irreparable conſequences which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attend the <hi>too prompt reply,</hi> can never be too ſeriouſly or too ſeverely condemned. Not to offend is the firſt ſtep towards pleaſing. To give pain is as much an offence againſt humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as againſt good breeding; and ſurely it is as well to abſtain from an action becauſe it is ſinful, as becauſe it is unpolite. In company, young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies would do well, before they ſpeak, to reflect, if what they are going to ſay, may not diſtreſs ſome worthy perſons preſent, by wounding them in their perſons, families, connexions, or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious opinions. If they find it will touch them in either of theſe, I would adviſe them to ſuſpect, that what they are going to ſay, is not ſo <hi>very</hi> good
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:024450_0112_0FC74ADE0212DA70"/>
a thing as they at firſt imagined. Nay, if even it was one of thoſe bright ideas, which <hi>Venus has imbued with a fifth part of her nectar,</hi> ſo much greater will be their merit in ſuppreſſing it, if there was a probability it might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. Indeed if they have the temper and prudence to make ſuch a previous reflection, they will be more richly rewarded by their own inward tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, at having ſuppreſſed a lively but ſevere remark, than they could have been with the diſſembled ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of the whole company, who, with that complaiſant deceit, which good breeding too much authoriſes, affect openly to admire what they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly reſolve never to forgive.</p>
               <p>I have always been delighted with the ſtory of the little girl's eloquence, in one of the children's tales, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from a friendly fairy, the gift
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:024450_0113_0FC74ADF847C3950"/>
that at every word ſhe uttered, pinks, roſes, diamonds, and pearls, ſhould drop from her mouth. The hidden moral appears to be this, that it was the ſweetneſs of her temper which produced this pretty fanciful effect; for when her malicious ſiſter deſired the ſame gift from the good natured tiny intelligence, the venom of her own heart converted it into poiſonous and loathſome reptiles.</p>
               <p>A man of ſenſe and breeding will ſometimes join in the laugh, which has been raiſed at his expenſe, by an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured repartee: but it was very cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and one of that ſhocking ſort of truths, which, as they can ſcarcely be pardoned even in private, ought ne-never to be uttered in public, he does not laugh becauſe he is pleaſed, but becauſe he wiſhes to conceal how much he is hurt. As the ſarcaſm was uttered by a lady, ſo far from
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:024450_0114_0FC74AE5562ADDA0"/>
ſeeming to reſent it, he will be the firſt to commend it; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that, he will remember it as a trait of malace, when the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhall have forgotten it as a ſtroke of wit. Women are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priviledged by their ſex to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome or cruel things, that this is the very circumſtance which renders them more intolerable. When the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is no relief to him who is wounded, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that the hand which ſhot him was a fair one.</p>
               <p>Many women, when they have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite point to gain, or an earneſt wiſh to bring any one over to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, often uſe a very diſingenious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: they will ſtate a cauſe ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and then avail themſelves of it, in whatever manner ſhall beſt anſwer their purpoſe; leaving your mind in a ſtate of indeciſion as to their real
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:024450_0115_0FC74AE64732B660"/>
meaning, while they triumph in the perplexity they have given you, by the unfair concluſions they draw, from premiſes equivocally ſtated. They will alſo frequently argue from excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions inſtead of rules, and are aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when you are not willing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a prejudice, inſtead of a reaſon.</p>
               <p>In a ſenſible company of both ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, where women are not reſtrained by any other reſerve than what their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural modeſty impoſes—and where the intimacy of all parties authoriſes the utmoſt freedom of communication—ſhould any one enquire what were the general ſentiments on ſome particular ſubject, it will, I believe, commonly happen that the ladies, whoſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations have kept pace with the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have anticipated its end, and are ready to deliver their ſentiments on it, as ſoon as it is finiſhed. While ſome
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:024450_0116_0FC74AE7C4FA23B0"/>
male hearers, whoſe minds were buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſettling the propriety, comparing the circumſtances, and examining the conſiſtencies of what was ſaid, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to pauſe and diſcriminate, before they think of anſwering. Nothing is ſo embarraſſing as a variety of matter; and the converſation of women is often more perſpicuous, becauſe it is leſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored.</p>
               <p>A man of deep reflection, if he does not keep up an intimate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the world, will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo entangled in the intricacies of intenſe thought, that he will have the appearance of a confuſed and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expreſſion; while a ſprightly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will extricate herſelf with that lively and "raſh dexterity," which will almoſt always pleaſe, though it is very far from being always right. It is eaſier to confound than to convince an opponent; the former may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:024450_0117_0FC74AEF34055E18"/>
by a turn that has more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than truth in it. Many an excellent reaſoner, well ſkilled in the theory of the ſchools, has felt himſelf diſcomfited by a reply, which, though as wide of the mark, and as foreign to the queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, as can be conceived, has diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed him more than the moſt ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling propoſition, or the moſt accurate chain of reaſoning could have done; and he has borne the laugh of his fair antagoniſt, as well as of the whole company, though he could not but feel, that his own argument was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the fulleſt demonſtration: ſo true it is, that it is not always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be right, in order to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded.</p>
               <p>But let not a young lady's vanity be too much elated with this falſe applauſe, which is given, not to merit, but to her ſex: ſhe has not, perhaps, gained a victory, though ſhe may be allowed a
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:024450_0118_0FC74AEFF8269A70"/>
triumph; and it ſhould humble her to reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her ſtrength, but to her weakneſs. It is worth while to diſcriminate between that applauſe, which is given from the complaiſance of others, and that which is paid to our own merit.</p>
               <p>Where great ſprightlineſs is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bent of the temper, girls ſhould endeavor to habituate themſelves to a cuſtom of obſerving, thinking, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. I do not mean that they ſhould devote themſelves to abſtruſe ſpeculation, or the ſtudy of logic; but ſhe, who is accuſtomed to give a due arrangement to her thoughts, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon juſtly and pertinently, on common affairs, and judiciouſly to deduce ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects from their cauſes, will be a better logician than ſome of thoſe who claim the name, becauſe they have ſtudied the art: this is being <q>learned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the rules;</q> the beſt definition,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:024450_0119_0FC74AF331D6A2F0"/>
perhaps, of that ſort of literature which is propereſt for the ſex. That ſpecies of knowledge, which appears to be the reſult of reflection rather than of ſcience, ſits peculiarly well on wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. It is not uncommon to find a lady, who, though ſhe does not know a rule of ſyntax, ſcarcely ever violates one, and who conſtructs every ſentence ſhe utters, with more propriety than many a learned dunce, who has every rule of Ariſtotle by heart, and who can lace his own thread-bare diſcourſe with the golden ſhreds of Cicero and Virgil.</p>
               <p>It has been objected, and I fear with ſome reaſon, that female converſation is too frequently tinctured with a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious ſpirit, and that ladies are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom apt to diſcover much tenderneſs for the errors of a fallen ſiſter.
<q>If it be ſo, it is a grievous fault.</q>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:024450_0120_0FC74AF4856FA1D0"/>
No arguments can juſtify, no pleas can extenuate it. To exult over the miſeries of an unhappy creature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human: not to compaſſionate them is unchriſtian. The worthy part of the ſex always expreſs themſelves humane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the failings of others, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their own undeviating good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot help remarking; that young women do not always care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtinguiſh between running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the error of detraction, and its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite extreme of indiſcriminate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. This proceeds from the falſe idea they entertain, that the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is wrong, muſt be right. Thus the dread of being only ſuſpected of one fault, makes them actually guilty of another. The deſire of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the imputation of envy, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels them to be inſincere; and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:024450_0121_0FC74AF5F5AF9378"/>
a reputation for ſweetneſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and generoſity, they affect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſpeak of very indifferent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters with the moſt extravagant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. With ſuch the hyperbole is a favorite figure; and every degree of compariſon, but the ſuperlative, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as cold and inexpreſſive. But this habit of exaggeration greatly weakens their credit, and deſtroys the weight of their opinion on other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; for people very ſoon diſcover what degree of faith is to be given both to their judgment and veracity. And thoſe of real merit will no more be flattered by that approbation, which cannot diſtinguiſh the value of what it praiſes, than the celebrated painter muſt have been at the judgment paſſed on his works by an ignorant ſpectator, who, being aſked what he thought of ſuch and ſuch very capital, but very
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:024450_0122_0FC74B01B9FEFC20"/>
different pieces, cried out in an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rapture, "All alike! all alike!"</p>
               <p>It has been propoſed to the young, as a maxim of ſupreme wiſdom, to manage ſo dexterouſly in converſation, as to appear to be well acquainted with ſubjects, of which they are totally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; and this, by affecting ſilence in regard to thoſe, on which they are known to excel.—But why counſel this diſingenuous fraud? Why add to the numberleſs arts of deceit, this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of deceiving, as it were, on a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled principle? If to diſavow the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they really have, be a culpable affectation, then certainly to inſinuate an idea of their ſkill where they are actually ignorant, is a moſt unworthy artifice.</p>
               <p>But of all the qualifications for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, humility, if not the moſt brilliant, is the ſafeſt, the moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the moſt feminine. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:024450_0123_0FC74B08A36B7970"/>
of introducing ſubjects, with which others are unacquainted, and of diſplaying talents ſuperior to the reſt of the company, is as dangerous as it is fooliſh.</p>
               <p>There are many, who never can forgive another for being more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and more accompliſhed than themſelves, and who can pardon any offence rather than an eclipſing merit. Had the nightingale in the fable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered his vanity, and reſiſted the temptation of ſhowing a fine voice, he might have eſcaped the talons of the hawk. The melody of his ſinging was the cauſe of his deſtruction; his merit brought him into danger, and his vanity coſt him his life.</p>

               <p>The preſent age may be termed, by way of diſtinction, the age of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a word, which, in the implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it now bears, was unknown to our plain anceſtors. Sentiment is
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:024450_0125_0FC74B0BC83E3EA8"/>
the varniſh of virtue, to conceal the deformity of vice; and it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common for the ſame perſons to make a jeſt of religion, to break through the moſt ſolemn ties and engagements, to practiſe every art of latent fraud and open ſeduction, and yet to value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on ſpeaking and writing <hi>ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this refined jargon, which has infected letters, and tainted morals, is chiefly admired and adopted by <hi>young ladies</hi> of a certain turn, who read <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental books,</hi> write <hi>ſentimental letters,</hi> and contract <hi>ſentimental friendſhips.</hi>

               <p>Error is never likely to do ſo much miſchief, as when it diſguiſes its real tendency, and puts on an engaging and attractive appearance. Many a young woman, who would be ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely flattered at the idea of a ſentimental connexion, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:024450_0126_0FC74B0E4E1E9408"/>
with a dangerous and deſigning man, who, by putting on this mark of plauſibility and virtue, diſarms her of her prudence, lays her apprehenſions aſleep, and involves her in miſery—miſery the more inevitable, becauſe unſuſpected. For ſhe who apprehends no danger, will not think it neceſſary to be always upon her guard; but will rather invite than avoid the ruin, which comes under ſo ſpecious and ſo fair a form.</p>
               <p>Such an engagement will be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dearer to her vanity, than an avowed and authorized attachment; for one of theſe ſentimental lovers will not ſcruple very ſeriouſly to aſſure a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous girl, that her unparalleled me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit entitles her to the adoration of the whole world, and that the univerſal homage of mankind, is nothing more than the unavoidable tribute extorted by her charms. No wonder then, the
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:024450_0127_0FC74B10DA9782A8"/>
ſhould be ſo eaſily prevailed on to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that an individual is captivated by perfections which might enſlave a million. But ſhe ſhould remember, that he, who endeavours to intoxicate her with adulation, intends one day moſt effectually to humble her. For an artful man has always a ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to pay himſelf in future for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſent ſacrifice. And this prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of praiſe, which he now appears to laviſh with ſuch thoughtleſs profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is, in fact, a ſum economically laid out to ſupply his future neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; of this ſum he keeps an exact eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and at ſome diſtant day promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf the moſt exorbitant intereſt for it. If he has addreſs and conduct, and the object of his purſuit much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſome ſenſibility, he ſeldom fails of ſucceſs; for ſo powerful will be his aſcendancy over his mind, that ſhe will ſoon adopt his notions and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:024450_0128_0FC74B13678D9088"/>
Indeed it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſhe poſſeſſed moſt of them before, having gradually acquired them in her initiation into the ſentimental charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. To maintain that character with dignity and propriety, it is neceſſary ſhe ſhould entertain the moſt elevated ideas of diſproportionate alliances, and diſintereſted love; and conſider for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, rank, and reputation, as mere chimerical diſtinctions and vulgar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices.</p>
               <p>The lover, deeply verſed in all the obliquities of fraud, and ſkilled to wind himſelf into every avenue of the heart, which indiſcretion has left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded, ſoon diſcovers on which ſide it is moſt acceſſible. He avails him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of this weakneſs by addreſſing her in a language exactly conſonant to her own ideas. He attacks her with her own weapons, and oppoſes rhapſody to ſentiment. He profeſſes ſo ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:024450_0129_0FC74B1B94ECDB78"/>
a contempt for the paltry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of money, that ſhe thinks it her duty to reward him for ſo generous a renunciation. Every plea he artfully advances of his own unworthineſs, is conſidered by her as a freſh demand, which her gratitude muſt anſwer; And ſhe makes it a point of honor to ſacrifice to him that fortune which he is too noble to regard. Theſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of humility are the common arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the vain; and theſe proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of generoſity the refuge of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious. And among its many ſmooth miſchiefs, it is one of the ſure and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful frauds of ſentiment, to affect the moſt frigid indifference to thoſe external and pecuniary advantages, which it is its great and real object to obtain.</p>
               <p>A ſentimental girl very rarely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains any doubt of her perſonal beauty; for ſhe has been daily accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:024450_0130_0FC74B1E6AB8B8C8"/>
to contemplate it herſelf, and to hear of it from others. She will not therefore be very ſolicitous for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of a truth ſo ſelf-evident; but ſhe ſuſpects, that her pretenſions to underſtanding are more likely to be diſputed, and, for that reaſon, greedily devours every compliment offered to thoſe perfections, which are leſs obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and more refined, She is perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that men need only open their eyes to decide on her beauty, while it will be the moſt convincing proof of the taſte, ſenſe, and elegance of her admirer, that he can diſcern and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe qualities in her. A man of the character here ſuppoſed, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſinuate himſelf into her affections by means of this latent but leading foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which may be called the guiding clue to a ſentimental heart. He will affect to overlook that beauty which attracts common eyes, and enſnares
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:024450_0131_0FC74B1F508AD530"/>
common hearts, while he will beſtow the moſt delicate praiſes to the beauties of her mind, and finiſh the climax of adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, by hinting that ſhe is ſuperior to it.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>But nothing, in general, can end leſs delightfully than theſe ſublime at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, even where no acts of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction are ever practiſed, but they are ſuffered, like mere ſublunary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, to terminate in the vulgar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe of marriage. That wealth, which lately ſeemed to be looked on with ineffable contempt by the lover, now appears to be the principal attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the eyes of the huſband: and he, who but a few ſhort weeks before, in a tranſport of ſentimental generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wiſhed her to have been a village maid, with no portion but her crook

               <p>On the other hand ſhe who was lately

is ſhocked to find herſelf at once ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all her celeſtial attributes. This late divinity, who ſcarcely yielded to her ſiſters of the ſky, now finds herſelf of leſs importance in the eſteem of the man ſhe has choſen, than any other mere mortal woman. No longer is ſhe gratified with the tear of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited paſſion, the ſigh of diſſembled rapture, or the language of premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adoration. No longer is the altar of her vanity loaded with the oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                  </gap> herſelf degraded from the dignities and privileges of a goddeſs, to all the imperfections, vanities, and weakneſſes of a ſlighted woman, and a neglected wife. Her faults, which were ſo lately overlooked, or miſtaken for virtues, are now, as Caſſius ſays, ſet in a note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book. The paſſion which was vowed eternal, laſted only a few ſhort weeks; and the indifference, which was ſo far from being included in the bargain, that it was not ſo much as ſuſpected, follows them through the whole tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome journey of their inſipid, vacant, joyleſs exiſtence.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the <hi>completion</hi> of the ſentimental hiſtory. If we trace it back to its beginning, we ſhall find, that a damſel of this caſt had her head originally turned by pernicious read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:024450_0134_0FC74B2478F538F8"/>
and her inſanity confirmed by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent friendſhips. She never fails to ſelect a beloved <hi>confidante</hi> of her own turn and humor, though, if ſhe can help it, not quite ſo handſome as herſelf. A violent intimacy enſues, or, to ſpeak the language of ſentiment, an intimate union of ſouls immediately takes place, which is wrought to the higheſt pitch, by a ſecret and volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous correſpondence, though they live in the ſame ſtreet, or perhaps in the ſame houſe. This is the fuel which principally feeds and ſupplies the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous flame of ſentiment. In this correſpondence the two friends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage each other in the falſeſt noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons imaginable. They repreſent ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic love as the great important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of human life, and deſcribe all the other concerns of it as too low and paltry to merit the attention of ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated beings, and fit only to employ
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:024450_0135_0FC74B3147DE9A48"/>
the daughters of the plodding vulgar. In theſe letters, family affairs are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented, family ſecrets divulged, and family misfortunes aggravated. They are filled with vows of eternal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and proteſtations of never-end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love. But interjections and quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are the principal embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe very ſublime epiſtles. Every panegyric contained in them is extravagant and hyperbolical, every cenſure exaggerated and exceſſive. In a favorite, every frailty is heightened into a perfection, and in a foe, degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into a crime. The dramatic po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, eſpecially the moſt tender and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic, are quoted in almoſt every line, and every pompous or pathetic thought is forced to give up its natural and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious meaning, and, with all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of miſapplication, is compelled to ſuit ſome circumſtance of imaginary woe of the fair tranſcriber. Alicia is
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:024450_0136_0FC74B330FEF8F30"/>
not too mad for her heroics, nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimia too mild for her ſoft emotions.</p>
               <p>Fathers <hi>have flinty hearts,</hi> is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion worth an empire, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſed with peculiar emphaſis and enthuſiaſm. For a favorite topic of theſe epiſtles is the groveling ſpirit and ſordid temper of the parents, who will be ſure to find no quarter at the hands of their daughters, ſhould they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to be ſo unreaſonable as to direct their courſe of reading, interfere in their choice of friends, or interrupt their very important correſpondence. But as theſe young ladies are fertile in expedients, and as their genius is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more agreeably exerciſed than in finding reſources, they are not without their ſecret exultation, in caſe, either of the above intereſting events ſhould happen, as they carry with them a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain air of tyranny and perſecution
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:024450_0137_0FC74B3443E0E798"/>
which is very delightful. For a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited correſpondence is one of the great incidents of a ſentimental life—and a letter clandeſtinely received, the ſupreme felicity of a ſentimental lady.</p>
               <p>Nothing can equal the aſtoniſhment of theſe ſoaring ſpirits, when their plain friends or prudent relations preſume to remonſtrate with them on any impropriety in their conduct. But if theſe worthy people happen to be ſomewhat advanced in life, their contempt is then a little ſoftened by pity, at the reflection that ſuch very antiquated, poor creatures ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to judge what is fit or unfit, for ladies of their great refinement, ſenſe, and reading. They conſider them as wretches utterly ignorant of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime pleaſures of a dilicate and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſion; as tyrants whoſe authority is to be contemned, and as ſpies whoſe vigilance is to be eluded. The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:024450_0138_0FC74B3A275D8B90"/>
of theſe worthy friends they term ſuſpicion, and their experience dotage. For they are perſuaded, that the face of things has ſo totally chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince their parents were young, that though they might then judge tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for themſelves, yet they are now (with all their advantages of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and obſervation; by no means qualified to direct their more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened daughters; who, if they have made a great progreſs in the ſentimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal walk, will be no more influenced by the advice of their mother, than they would go abroad in her laced pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or her brocade ſuit.</p>
               <p>But young people never ſhow their folly and ignorance more conſpicuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than by this over confidence in their own judgment, and this haughty diſdain of the opinion of thoſe who have known more days. Youth has a quickneſs of apprehenſion, which it
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:024450_0139_0FC74B3B1283CAB8"/>
is apt to miſtake for an acuteneſs of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration. But youth, like cunning, though very conceited, is very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted, and never more ſo than when it diſregards the inſtructions of the wiſe, and the admonitions of the aged. The ſame vices and follies influenced the human heart in their day, which influence it now, and nearly in the ſame manner. One, who well knew the world and its various vanities, has ſaid: <q>The thing which hath been, it is that which ſhall be, and that which is done is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſun.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo a part of the ſentimental character, to imagine that none but the young, and the beautiful have any right to the pleaſures of ſociety, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the common benefits and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of life. Ladies of this turn alſo affect the moſt lofty diſregard for uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:024450_0140_0FC74B3CB4879608"/>
qualities and domeſtic virtues, and this is a natural conſequence; for as this ſort of ſentiment, is only a word for idleneſs, ſhe who is conſtantly and uſefully employed, has neither leiſure nor propenſity to cultivate it.</p>
               <p>A ſentimental lady principally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues herſelf on the enlargement of her notions, and her liberal way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This ſuperiority of ſoul chiefly manifeſts itſelf in the contempt of theſe minute delicacies, and little decorums, which, trifling as they may be thought, tend at once to dignify the character, and to reſtrain the levity of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the ſex.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the error here complained of, originates in miſtaking <hi>ſentiment</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> for each other. Now I conceive them to be extremely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Sentiment is the virtue of <hi>ideas,</hi> and principle the virtue of <hi>action.</hi> Sentiment has its ſeat in the head, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:024450_0141_0FC74B3EBB05E0E8"/>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> principle conceives juſt notions, and performs good actions in conſequence of them. Sentiment refines away the ſimplicity of truth and the plainneſs of piety; and, as a celebrated wit<note n="*" place="bottom">See Voltaire's Prophecy concerning Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau.</note> has remarked of his no leſs celebrated co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, gives us virtue in words and vice in deeds. Sentiment may be called the Athenian who <hi>knew</hi> what was right, and principle the Lacedemonian who <hi>practiſed</hi> it.</p>
               <p>But theſe qualities will be better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified by an attentive conſideration of two admirably drawn characters of Milton, which are beautifully, delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diſtinctly marked.

<pb n="143" facs="unknown:024450_0146_0FC74B5333554BE0"/>
(not the ſort I have been deſcribing) may be ſo connected with principle, as to beſtow on it its brighteſt luſtre, and its moſt captivating graces. And enthuſiaſm is ſo far from being diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, that a portion of it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps indiſpenſibly neceſſary in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging woman. But it muſt be the enthuſiaſm of the heart, not of the ſenſes. It muſt be the enthuſiaſm which grows up with a feeling mind, and is cheriſhed by a virtuous educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—not that which is compounded of irregular paſſions, and artificially refined by books of unnatural fiction and improbable adventure. I will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven go ſo far as to aſſert, that a young woman cannot have any real greatneſs of ſoul, or true elevation of principle, if ſhe has not a tincture of what the vulgar call Romance, but which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a certain way of thinking will diſcern to proceed from thoſe fine
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:024450_0147_0FC74B589E1CA9F8"/>
feelings, and that charming ſenſibility, without which, though a woman may be worthy, yet ſhe can never be ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>But this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched, as it is very apt to lead thoſe who poſſeſs it into incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, from which leſs intereſting characters are happily exempt. Young women of ſtrong ſenſibility may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the very amiableneſs of this temper, into the moſt alarming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. Their taſtes are paſſions. They love and hate with all their hearts, and ſcarcely ſuffer themſelves to feel a reaſonable preference, before it ſtrengthens into a violent attachment.</p>
               <p>When an innocent girl, of this open, truſting, tender heart, happens to meet with one of her own ſex and age, whoſe addreſs and manners are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, ſhe is inſtantly ſeized with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire to commence a friendſhip
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:024450_0148_0FC74B5C080855E0"/>
with her. She feels the moſt lively impatience at the reſtraints of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the decorums of ceremony. She longs to be alone with her, longs to aſſure her of the warmth of her tenderneſs, and generouſly aſcribes to the fair ſtranger all the good qualities ſhe feels in her own heart, or rather all thoſe which ſhe has met with in her reading, diſperſed in a variety of heroines. She is perſuaded, that her new friend unites them all in herſelf, becauſe ſhe carries in her prepoſſeſſing countenance the promiſe of them all. How cruel and how cenſorious would this inexperienced girl think her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, who ſhould venture to hint, that the agreeable unknown had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in her temper, or exceptions in her character! She would miſtake theſe hints of diſcretion for the inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of an uncharitable diſpoſition.
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:024450_0149_0FC74B5D860E56B8"/>
At firſt ſhe would perhaps liſten to them with a generous impatience, and afterwards with a cold and ſilent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. She would deſpiſe them as the effect of prejudice, miſrepreſentation, or ignorance. The more aggravated the cenſure, the more vehemently would ſhe proteſt in ſecret, that her friendſhip for this dear injured crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (who is raiſed much higher in her eſteem by ſuch injurious ſuſpicions) ſhall know no bounds, as ſhe is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it can know no end.</p>
               <p>Yet this truſting confidence, this honeſt indiſcretion, is, at this early period of life, as amiable as it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and will, if wiſely cultivated, produce, at its proper ſeaſon, fruits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more valuable, than all the guarded circumſpection of premature, and therefore artificial prudence. Men, I believe, are ſeldom ſtruck with theſe ſudden prepoſſeſſions in favor of each
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:024450_0150_0FC74B6645BEB400"/>
other. They are not ſo unſuſpecting, nor ſo eaſily led away by the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of fancy. They engage more warily, and paſs through the ſeveral ſtages of acquaintance, intimacy, and confidence, by ſlower gradations; but women, if they are ſometimes deceived in the choice of a friend, enjoy even then an higher degree of ſatisfaction, than if they never truſted. For to be always clad in the burdenſome armor of ſuſpicion, is more painful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, than to run the hazard of ſuffering now and then a tranſient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
               <p>But the above obſervations only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the young and the inexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; for I am very certain, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are capable of as faithful and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable friendſhip as any of the other ſex. They can enter not only into all the enthuſiaſtic tenderneſs, but into all the ſolid fidelity of attachment. And

if we cannot oppoſe inſtances of equal weight with thoſe of Nyſus and Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alus, Theſeus and Pirithous, Pylades and Oreſtes, let it be remembered, that it is becauſe the recorders of thoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters were men, and that the very exiſtence of them is merely poetical.</p>
