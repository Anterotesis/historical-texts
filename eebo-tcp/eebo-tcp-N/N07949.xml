            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE exceeding Riches of divine Grace in our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, afford us matter for Wonder, Love and Admiration. That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſo wonderfully condeſcend, for our Salvation, as to be born of a poor Virgin, <hi>be made of a Woman, made under the Law, that he might redeem them that were under the Law:</hi> that he ſhould humble himſelf to all thoſe ignominious Circumſtances in which he lived and died; he <hi>humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> when, with infinite Eaſe, he could have ſpoken all his Perſecutors into the very Deeps of Hell. This is wonderful. But what is ſtill more aſtoniſhing, and ſpeaks the Heights and Depths of infinite boundleſs Love, is that he ſhould <hi>wed</hi> ſuch vile Worms of the Duſt, ſuch polluted Monſters, who <hi>have played the Harlot with many Lovers,</hi> and take them into the Arms of his Love, yea into his Boſom, to all the Indearments of that wonderful Relation in the new and everlaſting Covenant, in which Chriſt and Believers are one. That Chriſt ſhould be a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for Souls, a loving, kind and tender Huſband, expreſſed in his GIVING HIMSELF for them: And that he ſhould <hi>ſo give himſelf a Ranſom</hi> for them, that he might purchaſe to himſelf a glorious Church <hi>without Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch Thing,</hi> muſt appear to be infinite Love and Condeſcention. And this is the very Caſe; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſeeks this in all he has done,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010146_0003_0F7D1CB1C310C270"/>
and is doing as Mediator. This is the End, the important End of the Goſpel; and for this noble, glorious Purpoſe are the Miniſters of it ſent forth; and thus we read 2. Cor V. 20. <hi>Now then we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you, in Chriſt's Stead, be ye reconciled unto God.</hi> And according to this, ſays the Apoſtle in the Text, <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Huſband,</hi> i. e. I have been the Inſtrument of it. I have drawn up the Contract fairly before you, and have beſought, and prayed you, in Chriſt's Stead, to be reconciled to God; and I perſuade my ſelf that I have been ſo happy as to be inſtrumental of bringing many of you into that bleſſed Marriage Covenant with Chriſt: And this was one great View I had in it <hi>that</hi> I might at laſt preſent you as a chaſte Virgin to Chriſt, preſent you holy and pure, true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, according to the true Intent of the Covenant, to his Acceptance and Glory, and your Joy and Comfort.</p>
            <p>Therefore was the holy Apoſtle <hi>Jealous over them with a godly Jealouſy,</hi> i. e. he had a tender Fear and Concern for them, when their falſe Teachers were endeavouring to ſeduce and lead them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Simplicity of the Goſpel, and to undervalue him, although he had been the Inſtrument of their Converſion from Heatheniſm to Chriſtianity, and had planted the Goſpel among them with indefatigable Pains and Induſtry. <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 18.3, 9, 10, 11.</note> And indeed it muſt give every true and faithful Miniſter a very painful and affecting Concern to ſee the LORD's FLOCK carried away captive; and in Danger of being devoured with greedy Wolves: to ſee them that they have laboured to eſpouſe to one Huſband, Chriſt, ſnared and led away after other Lovers; for how ſhall they preſent ſuch as a chaſte Virgin to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That they may be the happy Inſtruments of Souls being eſpouſed to Chriſt, and preſent them finally, to him, pure, holy and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is the great Deſign of their Office. For this they are Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors. And O how bleſſed to be ſuccesful! How greatly to be deſired?</p>
            <p>Suffer me then to treat this noble and divine Subject under the following Propoſitions, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:010146_0004_0F7D1CB2631844A8"/>I. As it is the great Deſign, ſo it ſhould be the earneſt Deſire and Endeavour of the Miniſters of Chriſt to eſpouſe Souls to him, as to one Huſband.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thoſe Miniſters who are made the happy Inſtruments of eſpouſing Souls to Chriſt ſhall have the great Honor, the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Satisfaction, Joy and Comfort of preſenting them as a chaſte Virgin to him.</p>
            <p>I return to the firſt Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As it is the great Deſign, ſo it ſhould be the earneſt Deſire and Endeavor of the Miniſters of Chriſt to eſpouſe Souls to him, as to one Huſband.</p>
            <p>Here I would, by divine Help, ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What it is for Souls to be eſpouſed to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this is the great End and Deſign of the Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. And therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it ſhould be the earneſt Deſire and Endeavor of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to eſpouſe Souls to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am to ſhew what it is for Souls to be eſpouſed to the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>And this, ſurely, can be nothing leſs than <hi>to be united to him in the Covenant of Grace, by Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has pleaſed God, in his infinite Love, to think upon our fallen guilty Race, who had broken the Covenant of Works, and brought themſelves thereby, under it's ſevere and terrible, though infinitely righteous, Curſe. When that holy Covenant could afford us no Help, but, on the contrary, doomed us to eternal Woes: the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moment we might expect the tremendous Diſplays of divine Juſtice, behold, the bleſſed Jeſus appears in the precious Promiſe! God ſays Help upon one that is <hi>mighty to ſave, able to ſave all, even to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him.</hi> God reveals his moſt gracious Covenant for his choſen People, in and through Chriſt, who <hi>is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by Means of Death, for the Redemption of the Tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the Promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inheritance</hi>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010146_0005_0F7D1CB32BFD4E88"/>It is indeed very wonderful that ever the glorious JEHOVAH ſhould take ſuch a Method for our Salvation. That ever there ſhould be ſuch a Thing as an everlaſting Covenant, between the Father and the Son, for our Redemption: that the eternal Son of God ſhould be the Mediator of the new Covenant, the Covenant of Grace, in which all true Believers are united to Chriſt, by a divine Faith. By this moſt gracious Covenant are the Faithful ſaved from deſerved Wrath, and <hi>raiſed up to ſit together in heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to his eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>This is a Covenant that has it's Foundation all laid in Grace; for it is a Covenant of Mercy for Covenant Breakers; a Covenant of Grace for guilty, Hell deſerving Creatures, for ever inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of helping themſelves in any Meaſure at all. And O how great this ſalvation! God the Father lays the Foundation, and in the Fulneſs of Time gives his own only Son out of his Boſom; Chriſt comes, and lays down his Life, and purchaſes all the Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Covenant: the holy Spirit is given to <hi>open our Eyes, and to turn us from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God; that we may receive Forgivneſs of Sins, and Inheritance among them which are ſanctified by Faith that is in Chriſt.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 26.18.</note> The poor Soul is taken moſt freely, out of his unregenerate State, <hi>in the Day of</hi> God's <hi>Power</hi>; cut off from the wild Olive, and graffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true; planted in Chriſt; born from above, being begotten again to a lively Hope by the Reſurrection from the Dead, and made a Partaker of the divine Nature.</p>
            <p>To bring this to paſs, God is pleaſed to write to us the great Things of his Law, and <hi>thunder</hi> forth the terrible Curſes thereof from Mount Sinai. To ſet Home, upon the Conſcience, the awful Truths of his holy Word, and awaken the ſecure Sinner by a Spirit of Conviction; to ſhew him his loſt Eſtate, his guilty, filthy Circumſtances; that he is juſtly deſerving of the divine Diſpleaſure, and going to Deſtruction, and unable to help himſelf.</p>
            <p>It is true that God has appointed various Duties to be done; the Word, Sacraments and Prayer are the outward and ordinary Means by which Chriſt communicates to us the Benefits of Redemption.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010146_0006_0F7D1CB3E1D69900"/>
And theſe Duties are to be attended as proper Means of Grace, yet will never ſave a Soul, nor can they give Relief to one under ſuch diſtreſſing Circumſtances. No, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe</hi> God, or to gain any true Comfort to the Soul. True God is pleaſed to order the Word of Faith, the bleſſed Goſpel to be preached to them that are in ſuch a Condition; ſo God has written to us the great Things of his Goſpel, and <hi>to us is the Word of this Salvation ſent.</hi> Chriſt was ſent, and his Miniſters are ſent <hi>to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the Opening of the Priſon to them that are bound</hi>; and not only ſo but alſo to call even to the Ends of the Earth to <hi>look</hi> unto Chriſt <hi>and be ſaved</hi>; to <hi>behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the World.</hi> And hence we find the Apoſtles Paul and Silas, exhorting the trembling Jaylor <hi>to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and he ſhould be ſaved.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 16.31.</note> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Arm of the Lord muſt be <hi>revealed,</hi> or the Goſpel <hi>Report</hi> will not be <hi>believed</hi> even by the convinced Sinner. In the Day of God's Power his ſtubborn Will ſhall be bowed, and the Word of the Goſpel be made the effectual Means of his Converſion and Salvation. The Eyes of his Underſtanding are opened to a divine Diſcovery of the bleſſed Redeemer in his Mediatorial Fulneſs and Glory. To behold <hi>his Glory, the Glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of Grace and Truth</hi>; and <hi>of his Fulneſs to receive, and Grace for Grace.</hi> To receive him as the <hi>End of the Law for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to every one that believeth</hi>: to caſt his whole Soul upon him and reſt upon him, as the only Propitiation for our Sins, and not for our's only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole World. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce, moſt heartily and freely, in the only Way of Salvation by him. To take him upon his own Terms, or Propoſals of Agree<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, embrace him by Faith and Love, and cleave unto him with a cordial Affection, from a Senſe of his infinite Worth and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, divine Amiableneſs and tranſcendant Beauty and Glory. Thus are Souls eſpouſed unto Chriſt as to one Huſband, joined unto him, and made one with him in the new Covenant, ordered in all Things, and ſure: And theſe be they which follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth. I proceed to ſhew,</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:010146_0007_0F7D1CB4A9963D80"/>II. That it is the great End and deſign of the Goſpel Miniſtry to eſpouſe Souls to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now if the Miniſters of the bleſſed Jeſus, are ſent to preach the Goſpel, to preach Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, to preach Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Faith towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it muſt be the Deſign of their Miniſtry to bring Souls to eſpouſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It is not here to be ſuppoſed that it lies in their Power to bring Souls to eſpouſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but that Chriſt does it by them, and they ſhould deſire and endeavour to be inſtrumental of it. The goſpel Covenant is that only in which Souls are eſpouſed to Chriſt. And it is this that Miniſters are to preach; and they are to make Uſe of the Goſpel Arguments and Motives for this great Purpoſe. To exhibit the ſweet and powerful Invitations, Calls and Promiſes of it, that by theſe they may be ſweetly <hi>compelled</hi> to come to the Marriage of the King's Son, and partake of the great Goſpel Supper. Moreover, Miniſters are Ambaſſadors of the bleſſed Jeſus. So our Apoſtle, <hi>Now then, we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as tho' God did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſt's Stead, be ye recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God.</hi> Great and ſovereign Princes ſometimes ſend their Ambaſſadors into foreign Countries, to obtain, by Suit, a Bride for themſelves. And the Lord Jeſus does ſo likewiſe, he ſends his Miniſters to ſeek a Bride for himſelf; to invite and call Souls to a Marriage with him in the Covenant of Grace. Hence we find our bleſſed Saviour diſcourſing of the Kingdom of Heaven by Way of Similitude likning it to a certain King that made a Marriage for his Son, and ſent forth his ſervants to invite and call Gueſts to the Wedding, Mat. 22.1, 10. We have the ſame Thing in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Luke 14.16, 24. This, this is the great Thing they are ſent upon to bring Souls to the Marriage, and muſt gather them even out of the Highways and Hedges, that our Lord's Houſe may be filled. O then how ſhould the Love of Chriſt conſtrain them! Methinks I hear the bleſſed Jeſus ſaying, <hi>Simon Son of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, loveſt thou me?—Feed my Sheep.—Feed my Lambs.</hi> O how much have Miniſters to do to <hi>watch</hi> for Souls as they that muſt give Account? How ſhould they watch every Opportunity to commend
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010146_0008_0F7D1CB6CE39A1D0"/>
their glorious LORD in all his Beauty, tranſcendant Beauty, Glory and Excellency; and become all Things to all Men, that by all Means they may gain ſome to Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is the great Thing that Chriſt's Heart is upon. Our dear Lord and Maſter has his Heart upon this as the great Thing in which his Glory as Mediator and Head of the Church conſiſts. O how was his Heart upon it, in the Days of Eternity; when he was daily his Father's Delight, and was rejoicing always before him? Then he rejoiced in the habitable Part of his Earth, and his Delights were with the Sons of Men. <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 8.30, 31.</note> And ſurely his Heart muſt be greatly upon it, when he came down, and taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled in Fleſh, and dwelt among us. When he humbled himſelf in ſuch an amazing Manner in his Birth, Life and Death for our Sakes. Submitted to all Ignominy and Sorrow: was a <hi>Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief.</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Iſa. 53, 3.</note> He bore the Malice of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men and Devils; and ſuffered the Hidings of his Father's Face. <hi>Was ſtricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted; was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our Iniquities. The Chaſtiſement of our Peace was laid vpon him, that by his Stripes we might be healed.</hi> And O how was his Heart upon eſpouſing us to himſelf, when <hi>for the Joy that was ſet before him, he endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the Shame</hi>; and was ſo <hi>ſtraitned till it was accompliſhed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when we conſider him as an Interceſſor, conſider him in all his Offices; in all the indearing Characters in the bleſſed Goſpel; and in all the Offers, Pains and Care of it in ſending his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to preach <hi>Peace by Jeſus Chriſt, and pray us in his Stead to be reconciled to God,</hi> muſt we not be conſtrained to ſay that his Heart was upon eſpouſing Souls to himſelf; and of bringing many Sons and Daughters unto Glory? and if this be the Caſe, how evidently does it appear to be the great Work and Buſineſs of Miniſters, the very End and Deſign of their Office to win Souls to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as it is abſolutely impoſſible that even Souls ſhould be ſaved any other Way, than, by a Myſtical, and vital Union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; ſo the very Buſineſs of his Miniſters muſt be about it. Indeed there is no other Way of Salvation for
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010146_0009_0F7D1CB79062EE58"/>
Sinners, but by the only Redeemer; and no other Way of being ſaved by him, but by Faith in him, which Faith is the very Act of the Soul whereby it receives him as both Lord and Chriſt, or, as he is repreſented and offered to us in the Goſpel. And thus we become intereſted in his Merits. As the Bride becomes inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in her Huſband's Eſtate and Priviledges by Marriage, ſo the believing Soul becomes, intruſted in the Righteouſneſs and Grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Marriage with him. Faith brings the Soul into a Union to Chriſt, and to a Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his Eſtate, if I may ſo ſay, and thus it is that we are juſtified by Faith alone; and that <hi>by him, all that believe, are juſtified from all Things, from which they could not be juſtified, by the Law of Moſes. Where is boaſting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? Nay; but by the Law of Faith.</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. 3.27.</note> Therefore <hi>let him that glorieth, glory</hi> only <hi>in the Lord.</hi> And let Miniſters be careful to preach Righteouſneſs by Faith, without the Deads of the Law; yet be conſtant in affirming, that they which have believed in God be careful to maintain good Works; yea and that whoſoever would find the Mercy of God, muſt ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the third Thing propoſed,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſhew that it ſhould be the earneſt Deſire and Endeavour of the Miniſters of Chriſt, to eſpouſe Souls to him. And if it is their Work and Buſineſs, and a Work of ſo great Importance, they ought to go about it with their Hearts engaged in it, with very ardent Deſires that it might be accompliſhed, and ſhould uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to promote it, that their great Maſters Intereſt may be advanced. Here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſhould be their <hi>earneſt, fervent Deſire.</hi> Miniſters ſhould not take the Overſight of the Flock of Chriſt by Conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy Lucre, but with a ready Mind, ready to lay down their Lives in the glorious Cauſe, to lay down their Lives for the Brethren. The Love of Chriſt and Souls ſhould conſtrain them; and not the Love of this vain, tranſitory World. O how ſhould the Miniſters of Chriſt <hi>travail in Birth</hi> for their dear People
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010146_0010_0F7D1CB81D33D868"/>
with St. Paul, <hi>'till Chriſt be formed in them</hi>? <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. 4.19.</note> Such ſhould be their Deſires, earneſt, painful Deſires for the Converſion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to God, and very eſpecially of thoſe committed to their more immediate Care. If they are the Friends of the Bridegroom, (as indeed they ſhould be) how greatly ſhould they deſire to have the Weeding furniſhed with Gueſts: And the King of Zion crowned in the Day of his Eſpouſals, the Day of the Gladneſs of his Heart. Surely, not to deſire it a above every worldly Advantage, above their Honor, or Eaſe, or any Thing ſecular, muſt be highly criminal in the Sight of God, who has ſent them out upon ſuch Buſineſs. <hi>Jeruſalem's Peace</hi> ſhould be preferred <hi>above their chief Joy.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 137.6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. They ſhould <hi>earneſtly endeavour</hi> to bring about the bleſſed Match between Chriſt and Souls.</p>
            <p>What indefatigable Pains ſhould the Miniſters of the bleſſed Jeſus take, to eſpouſe Souls to him in the Goſpel Covenant? Here let me ſay,</p>
            <p>Much Pains ſhould be taken in the Study, that beaten Oil may be brought into the Sanctuary. Wiſe Preachers will give <hi>good Heed, ſeek out, and ſet in Order</hi> their Diſcourſes: they will <hi>ſeek to find out acceptable Words, even Words of Truth.</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Eccleſ. 12.9, 10,</note> They ſhould <hi>give themſelves to Reading, Meditation and Prayer.</hi> Miniſters ſhould be praying Men. <hi>We will give ourſelves continually to Prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the Word,</hi> ſay the APOSTLES. And they ſhould <hi>ſtudy to ſhew themſelves approved unto God, Workmen that need not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2.15.</note> O how great Need is there that Miniſters ſhould be furniſhed with a good Fund of Knowledge, both human and divine? They ſhould ſearch the Scriptures and other Writings with unwearied Attention and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. They ſhould have good Learning, as well as true Grace; and labor to improve in their Studies, that their Profiting may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto all, while they bring forth out of their Treaſures <hi>Things new and old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſhould alſo labor moſt fervently in the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> When they come to ſtand before God and his People to Miniſter in holy
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010146_0011_0F7D1CB8606C7210"/>
Things, with what Gravity and Decency, Solemnity and Reverence ſhould they be clothed? What a holy Zeal and heavenly Fervor ſhould they put on; and, in the Strength of the Lord declare all his Works, declare all the Council of God? And give to every one his Portion in due Seaſon?</p>
            <p>They ſhould preach the Law, for by it is the Knowledge of Sin; by it are the careleſs and carnal, the vicious and profligate, and every unregenerate Sinner to be awakned, that they may flee from the Wrath to come. And they ſhould preach the Goſpel, ſound the <hi>Jubilee</hi> Trumpet, proclaiming Liberty for the <hi>inſolvant Debter,</hi> the poor miſerable Bond Slave to go out free, and poſſeſs the rich Inheritance among the Saints in Light. And, O how earneſt and fervent ſhould they be in inviting and calling them that are bidden to the Wedding? yea, and how inſtant in Seaſon and out of Seaſon, taking every Opportunity, that, by all Means, they may gain ſome to Chriſt? And, O how ſweet and joyful, to bring one Gueſt to the Wedding!</p>
            <p>Again how faithful ſhould they be in Adminiſtring the Seals of Gods gracious Covenant, to his viſible People? And alſo in warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admoniſhing the ignorant and ſcandalous; and in diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diſcipline of Chriſt's Houſe according to his Mind?</p>
            <p>Again, what Pains and Endeavours ſhould be uſed in <hi>viſiting and catechiſing,</hi> and, in private, inſtructing and feeding the Flock of Chriſt? Surely their Converſation ſhould be ſavory, and <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Grace to the Hearers</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And they ſhould be <hi>examples to the Flock, in Word, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Tim. 4.12.</note> 
               <hi>In all Things ſhewing themſelves Patterns of Good Works.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Tit. 2.7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>How <hi>winning</hi> ſhould Miniſters be in their Preaching, Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Behaviour? How wiſe and prudent? How kind and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, courteous and affable, apt to teach, ever ready to adviſe and counſel; to remove Doubts and Difficulties, direct under Trials and Temptations? to ſtrengrhen the weak, encourage the faint and timorous, comfort the ſorrowful diſtreſſed Chriſtian, and alarm the ſecure Sinner, as well as detect the cloſe Hypocrite? And never
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010146_0012_0F7D1CBC059C91B8"/>
ſhould the Servant of the Lord reſt eaſy while there is a Soul out of Chriſt. It ſhould be his fervent Deſire, and moſt diligent Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to have all eſpouſed to him; for, O how cutting the Thought to looſe one Soul! Would to God that all might <hi>be ſaved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth</hi> as it is Jeſus!</p>
            <p>Thus having briefly ſpoken to the firſt Propoſition, I proceed to the other, viz.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thoſe Miniſters who are made the happy Inſtruments of eſpouſing Souls to Chriſt ſhall have the unſpeakable Satisfaction, the great Honor, Joy and comfort of preſenting them as a chaſt Virgin to him.</p>
            <p>Indeed every true and faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Eyes of the LORD, tho' Iſrael be not gathered; and great ſhall be their Reward in Heaven. God will reward them, not ſo much according to their Succeſs, as according to their Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Yet, certainly <hi>they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Dan. 12.3.</note> It is not only poſſible, but probable that they will have ſome additional Honors and Comforts, ſome Joys which may exceed; Joys in their ſpiritual Children, whom they have begotton through the Goſpel. But here let me obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſome Miniſters have been, are, and doubtleſs will be, the happy Inſtruments of eſpouſing Souls to Chriſt. God is pleaſed graciouſly to bleſs their Labors for the Conviction and Converſion of Sinners. It is not in them, let them labor ever ſo faithfully, but of God alone that ſheweh Mercy. Paul himſelf may plant, and Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los water in vain, except God giveth the Increaſe. Without the Father draws, no Man can come to Chriſt; for the carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God, the will ſet in Oppoſition againſt him. There muſt, therefore, be the Day of God's Power to bring the Sinner to a Goſpel Submiſſion. And that Chriſt's faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have good Ground to expect. A moſt wonderful Promiſe our dear Lord and Maſter has left for them, <hi>LO, I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, even to the End of the</hi> World. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. 28.20.</note> And as God has been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make ſuch abundant Proviſion in the Goſpel, and ſo many
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010146_0013_0F7D1CBD334B9B68"/>
precious Promiſes of the Spirit to be poured forth, as Floods, and as Waters upon the dry Ground, we may well look for glorious Days of Reformation; and therefore that God will make ſome, at leaſt, of his faithful Mininers happy Inſtruments of bringing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sons and Daughters unto Glory.</p>
            <p>It is ſo commonly, if not always, that where Chriſt ſends his Miniſters, he has choſen Veſſels to be called in, and brought Home to himſelf: and wherever it is ſo, he will undoubtedly bleſs their Labors for gathering in his Harveſt. It has pleaſed God, <hi>by the Fooliſhneſs of preaching</hi> (tho' not by fooliſh Preaching) <hi>to ſave them that believe.</hi> He is indeed all in all, and the Inſtrument nothing but an Inſtrument, and no more of an Inſtrument than he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make it: but bleſſed be his Name, he is many times pleaſed to make his Miniſters wonderful Inſtruments of a glorious Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What Wonders were done by the preaching of the Apoſtles and Miniſters, in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity? And what great Things have been done many times ſince, when the Goſpel has been preached in it's Power and Purity? What was done by the Inſtrumentality of Luther, Calvin and others about 250 years ago. A Reformation which has not been loſt to this Day. And how has God ſucceeded the Labors of ſome of his Miniſters in our Day, for the building up of his Kingdom and Intereſt among us? True, we have great Reaſon to mourn many ſorrowful Things, as the Prevalence of Errors and Diviſions, and the awful Profanity and Wickedneſs of Multitudes in the Land; and that after, yea in the Midſt of great Judgments and Mercies, Nevertheleſs there are a goodly Number, who evidence, by their Virgin Purity and Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they are eſpouſed to one Huſband, even Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such miniſters of Chriſt as are inſtrumental of eſpouſing Souls to him <hi>ſhall preſent them to him as a chaſte Virgin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would ſpeak of the Time when they ſhall preſent them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Shew <hi>how</hi> they ſhall preſent them to Chriſt</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am to ſpeak of the Time when the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt ſhall preſent believing Souls to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:010146_0014_0F7D1CBDD1BD4668"/>And it may be ſaid that they are preſenting them in their daily Prayers, and in the Adminiſtration of the holy Ordinances of the Goſpel. But then, the Time referred to is very likely the great and laſt Day, the Day of Judgment. Then ſhall they come, and appear before their LORD and Maſter to give Account of their Stewardſhip, and then ſhall they ſay, <hi>Here Lord am I, and the Children which thou haſt given me.</hi> I have delivered to them thy Word; And thro' thy Grace, they have received it, believed in thy Name, and obeyed thy Will. They have kept thy Word. And now LORD, let them be glorified with thee according to thy moſt gracious Promiſe. This will undoubtedly be the Time, when, in a very eſpecial Manner, they ſhall preſent them before the LORD JESUS CHRIST; and then ſhall they be led in to the King in Raiment of Needle Work, in the pure and fine Linen which is the Righteouſneſs of Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am to ſhew How the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhall preſent thoſe whom they have eſpouſed to him, and that is <hi>as a chaſte Virgin.</hi> So they ſhall preſent them <hi>pure and holy</hi>; for they ſhall be perfectly holy, being made free from all Sin: yea, they ſhall be really and poſitively holy, being waſhed, juſtified and ſanctified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Spirit of our God. The holy Image of the bleſſed God is in ſtamped, and compleated upon them; and they are transformed by the renewing of their Minds by the Holy Ghoſt. And how great is this Purity and Holineſs? 'Tis the Price of Chriſt's Blood, and the Labor and Operation of the bleſſed Spirit, who creates the Soul anew, and forms it after the divine Image, <hi>in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi> Not only are they <hi>Partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> but their whole Nature and Temper is divine and heavenly. All the Graces of the Spirit are grown up to Perfection, and Sanctification is compleated; ſo there is no Alloy, no Remainders of Corruption, but a perfect Soundneſs in every Part.</p>
            <p>They ſhall alſo preſent them <hi>free and intire</hi> Believers eſpouſed to Chriſt, are eſpouſed to him <hi>only,</hi> being divorced from all other former Lords, who had Dominion over them. They were once as baſe, vile Harlots, with their Affections ſet upon many Lovers;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010146_0015_0F7D1CBE7B6B1EE0"/>
but the Wonders of divine Grace have made them as a chaſte Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, ſpotleſs, innocent, pure and clean. They are married to Chriſt, and kept pure and intire: they are brought to be wholly for Chriſt, and for no other. Their Love is pure Virgin Love, undivided ſound and unblemiſhed. And they are now, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Chriſt, <hi>without Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch Thing.</hi> Theſe are the wiſe Virgins, who ſhall go with the Bridegroom, when he ſhall come, into the Marriage Chamber, and be for ever with the LORD. Such ſhall the Miniſters of Chriſt preſent unto him, and in ſuch a Condition ſhall they preſent them at that great Day. Suffer me once more to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="3">3. With what great Satisfaction the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent theſe chaſte Virgins to him. The APOSTLE ſpeaks, in our Text, as if it was his great Deſire that he might ſo preſent the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church to Chriſt. He was therefore, jealous over them with a godly Jealouſly, leaſt he ſhould be diſappointed of preſenting them in this Manner. And ſurely, if it was a Matter of no great Importance; if it would be no great Satisfaction, Joy or Comfort to him, he would not be ſo concerned about it. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude that the true and faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, will have abundant Satisfaction, when they come before their LORD and Maſter, with a <hi>Here</hi> LORD <hi>am I, and the Children which thou haſt graciouſly given thy Servant.</hi> They muſt have great Satisfaction, Joy and Comfort in the Glory and Honor of their dear and bleſſed LORD, in ſo many Seals of their Miniſtry; ſo many joined to him in the Covenant of Grace, eſpouſed to him, as a chaſte Virgin to one Huſband. They muſt have their Joy fulfilled, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them received into the Preſence of their glorious LORD, <hi>to behold his Glory,</hi> and partake of the Bleſſings of the Marriage Feaſt. And will it be no Honor, Joy or Comfort, to have ſo many Stars in their Crown? Verily, <hi>they are their Joy and Crown,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. 4.1.</note> eſpecially <hi>in the Day of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How bleſſed will the true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt be at that great Day, who will then have not only their own Salvation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in, but the Salvation of ſo many precious Souls, thro' their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010146_0016_0F7D1CBF3427B710"/>
Inſtrumentality? And now to look back upon all their Labors and Sufferings in the glorious Cauſe of the bleſſed Jeſus; and all the Dangers and Difficulties through which they, by the Help of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, have led the Flock of Chriſt, muſt be refreſhing and comforting. And if any ſhall have an Additional Happineſs they will: If any ſhall have a larger and weightier Crown of Life and Glory ſuch Miniſters will have. And then he that ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they that reap, ſhall rejoice together. And as a Father has a peculiar Joy in his Children, ſo theſe Fathers in Chriſt will have a peculiar and ſpecial Joy in their ſpiritual Children. And very likely good Miniſters of Chriſt, will have ſomething ſpecial to do, in leading, and aſſiſting the Church of God, in Heaven, to all Eternity; may go before in the heavenly Worſhip and Services. <note n="*" place="bottom">The four Beaſts, or rather the four living Creatures in the Rev. IV. ſuppoſed to intend, or to be Repreſentatives of, the Miniſters of Chriſt, are repreſented V. 6. as <hi>full of Eyes before and behind</hi>; and in V. 8. <hi>full of Eyes within,</hi> which may denote their exquiſite Knowledge and Diſcerning in divine Things; that they look, not only within, to themſelves and for themſelves, but <hi>before and behind</hi> them, even to all that are about them. And V. 9, 10. We read that <hi>when thoſe</hi> living Creatures <hi>give Glory and Honor, and Thanks to him that ſat on the Throne, who liveth for ever and ever, the Four and Twenty Elders,</hi> which are ſuppoſed to repreſent the Church, <hi>fall down before him that ſat upon the Throne, and worſhip him that liveth for ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>the four living Creatures,</hi> the Miniſters of the Goſpel, lead the <hi>Four and Twenty Elders,</hi> the Church, in the heavenly Worſhip.</note> Indeed, we, poor ſhort ſighted Creatures can know, in this our imperfect State, but very little of thoſe Things: God has reſerved the Diſcovery of them, chiefly for that bleſſed Period before us; but doubtleſs the Satisfaction of the Friends of the Bridegroom, at that Day, will be great, and their Joy will be full, to ſee the Spouſe of Chriſt brought Home, thro' ſo many Tribulations; and led in to the King, who <hi>will wipe away all Tears from her Eyes, and lead her to living Fountains of Water.</hi>

For the higheſt ſovereign Monarch among the Kings of the Earth, to ſtoop to marry the vileſt Harlot among his worſt Enemies, his open, and avowed Enemies, would look like Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention, and may be ſome faint Shadow of this; but really there would then be an infinite Diſproportion; for it would be but one of his Fellow Worms; and their Natures are the ſame. But for the God of Nature, the Creator of the Univerſe, by whom all Things do conſiſt, to veail his Divinity in Humanity, and freely ſubmit to all thoſe cruel Sufferings which our dear Redeemer did; and then take ſuch vile Creatures, his worſt Enemies, and the Bond Slaves of the Devil into his Boſom, is truly aſtoniſhing, and marvelous. Such his Grace finds them, but, how glorious is the Change at once made when they are brought Home to Chriſt in Regeneration and Converſion in Juſtification, Adoption and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? They are then made Children and Heirs, <hi>Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 8.17.</note> to an Inheritance incorruptible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled and that fadeth not away. Surely we may well cry <hi>Grace, Grace to it from the Bottom to the top Stone.</hi> And let his Name have endleſs Praiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Honor and Dignity is conferred upon every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever? That they ſhould be brought into ſuch a Union with the Prince of Life, ſuch a Relation to the bleſſed God and only Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, be joined to the Lord in an everlaſting Covenant, be made one with Chriſt, taken ſo near to him, and <hi>raiſed up to ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. 2.6.</note> 
                  <hi>To ſit with him in his Throne, even as—he is ſet down with his Father in his Throne,</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. 3.21.</note> how great the Honor and Dignity?</p>
               <p>If the Chriſtian had been ſet over all the World, or had been exalted to rule and command all the Angels in Heaven, it would
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010146_0018_0F7D1CC0F715E5F0"/>
not have been equal to the Honor that he is now raiſed to in his Marriage with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is God over all bleſſed for ever. And is it not a great Honour to be made a Partaker of the divine Nature, and inveſted with all the Privileges of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant? Theſe, theſe are Honors that are high and noble, and truly divine for which every Child of God ſhould be thankful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We alſo ſee here the wonderful Love of God and Chriſt to his People. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>what Manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">1. John, 3, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Here in,</hi> verily, <hi>is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> 
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Chap. 4.10.</note> Herein is Love, that Chriſt, when we were his bitter Enemies, ſhould die for us. His Love was ſtronger then Death.</p>
               <p>And that he ſhould take our defiled Souls, our guilty Perſons into his Boſom; that he ſhould make ſuch rich and ample Proviſion for us, as if a common Place in Heaven was not good enough for us, when we moſt juſtly deſerved the very Deeps of Hell, and the full Vials of the Wrath of God to be poured upon us for ever and ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O the Height and Depth, the Length and Breadth of this unmeaſurable Love! How full of Wonders, amazing Wonders!</p>
               <p>Again,</p>
               <p n="4">4. How myſterious and wonderful the Way and Manner of a Sinner's Juſtification before God? That infinite Wiſdom ſhould pitch upon ſuch a Method for the Glory of divine Juſtice and the Honor of the great Redeemer, that it muſt be brought about by our Eſpouſals to Chriſt, when we were infinitely unworthy, and ill deſerving. That we ſhould be brought into ſuch a Relation to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thereby become intereſted in his Riches and Righteouſneſs, ſpeaks the Wiſdom of God, and the exceeding Riches of his Grace; and ſhews how he can be juſt, and, yet, the Juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus. Let us admire and adore, wonder, love and praiſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This alſo affords a moſt plentiful and free Invitation to poor, miſerable and enſlaved wretched Sinners, to come and join them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in an everlaſting Covenant. And
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010146_0019_0F7D1CC166373018"/>
O that they would be perſuaded to come, and be bethrothed unto the Lord <hi>in Righteouſneſs, and in Judgment, in Lovingkindneſs and in Mercies.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſ. 2.19.</note> If any thing can be alluring and inviting this muſt be. Indeed there is every ſuitable and proper Motive to induce Souls to come and be ſaved: Yet nothing will avail, till the LORD ſhall, in the Day of his Power, open their Eyes and turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God. LORD, what is Man! But,</p>
               <p n="2">II. Is it the great End and Deſign of the goſpel Miniſtry, to eſpouſe Souls to Chriſt? Hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How deeply concerned ſhould Miniſters be to proſecute that great and good Deſign? Surely with Aaron they ſhould bear the People upon their Hearts <hi>before the Lord continually</hi>; <note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. 28.30.</note> and wreſtle and plead for the Bleſſing. They ſhould labor with the greateſt Aſſiduity with every one under their Care, and with others as they ſhall have convenient Opportunity, to bring them to comply with the Goſpel Call, and Invitation, and come to the Marriage of the King's Son.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How great a Bleſſing is the Goſpel Miniſtry? if ſuch be the noble and glorious Deſigns there of as the eſpouſing of Souls to the bleſſed Jeſus, and preparing a Bride to be preſented faultleſs and blameleſs before the Preſence of his Glory at laſt, it muſt be a great and rich Mercy to enjoy the Goſpel Miniſtry. O how wonderfully are many favored with Aſcenſion Gifts, and yet how inſenſible of the Mercy of God therein! Even ſome of the moſt faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt are illy treated, and their Counſel deſpiſed and rejected by thoſe whom they would fain eſpouſe to the bleſſed Jeſus. But let ſuch know that the Time is coming when they ſhall know that there has been a Prophet among them. It will be very terrible by and by for ſuch as receive not the Teſtimony of the Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Chriſt will take all that is ſaid and done againſt them, as ſaid and done againſt himſelf. Therefore let People beware how they conduct towards Chriſt's Miniſters, and ſee that they eſteem highly of their Office, and be very thankful for them. They ſhould eſteem them great Bleſſings, and the richeſt Treaſures they
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010146_0020_0F7D1CC263FAA1E0"/>
poſſeſs, next to ſpiritual Bleſſings. And they ſhould be much in Prayer for them, love and honor them as their Lord's Ambaſſadors: hearken to the Word they preach in the Name of the Lord, and the private Counſels and Inſtructions they give them, and do as the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> ſearch the Scriptures and ſee whether they ſpeak according to that unerring Rule, or not.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Should it be the earneſt, fervent Deſire and Endeavor of Chriſt's Miniſters to eſpouſe Souls to him? Hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Miniſters ſhould be holy and good Men.</p>
               <p>If ſuch be their Work and Buſineſs, and they are to go forward in it with fervent and earneſt, hearty Deſires for the Glory of God in the Salvation of Souls, they had need to be godly and gracious, holy and righteous Men: For what Deſires can a wicked Man have for the Glory of God, the Intereſt of the great Redeemer and the Good of precious Souls? True, he may have many Deſires from ſelfiſh Views, or Ends. But will ſuch an one <hi>travail in Birth</hi> like the Apoſtle, <hi>till Chriſt be formed in his People?</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. 4.19.</note> Will he wreſtle and plead as Jacob and Moſes till he obtains the Bleſſing? Can he out of Love to Chriſt, with Peter, feed Chriſt's Sheep and Lambs? Rather will he not regard the Fleece more than the Flock? And inſtead of preaching Chriſt Jeſus the LORD, will he not preach himſelf? O how great Danger, that while the blind lead the blind they will both fall into the Ditch? Indeed ſuch an one may preach good Truths, and even to Edification, but all the while he is a Stranger to thoſe Truths and knows them not in their Spirituality and Glory. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Miniſters greatly need the Preſence of Chriſt, and the Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of his Spirit with them. If, as we have heard, ſuch is to be their Labor, and Endeavour for the Converſion and Salvation of Sinners, they really need the Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt with them, even his promiſed Preſence; <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 28.30.</note> and the Holy Ghoſt quickning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, ſanctifying and comforting them. This will wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthen and help him in his great and difficult Work. How will his Soul be full of heavenly Matter, and his <hi>Tongue</hi> as <hi>the Pen of a ready Writer,</hi> 
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Pſal. 15.6.</note> and the holy Fire of Love and Zeal, burn
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010146_0021_0F7D1CC2E22D5420"/>
                  <hi>Seraph</hi> like in the Preſence of the eternal Jehovah? Then will he <hi>be ſtrong in Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2, 1.</note> and with heroic Courage and Fortitude engage in the Work of the Lord his God, and plead his Cauſe againſt the mighty. He will labor, and not faint; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all his Time and Talents for the Intereſt of the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the Good of Souls. Therefore, what Reaſon have they to be humbled to the Duſt, and mourn the Want of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence? And how earneſtly ſhould they ſeek it; and not allow themſelves to live eaſy and contented without it? For Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be cold and dead, lifeleſs and ſlothful is a greater Sin than for a private Chriſtian, a more heinous Sin againſt their Lord and Maſter, and a great Injury to the Intereſt of Souls. O that our Hearts and Lips were ever <hi>touched</hi> as <hi>with a live Coal from the Altar.</hi> 
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">6 Iſa. 6, 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. How few Miniſters do their Duty as they ought? How great Reaſon have they to be humbled, and aſhamed before the Lord, and cry with the Prophet <hi>My Leanneſs, my Leanneſs</hi>! And how ſhould they look to the great Atonement for themſelves as well as the People! Bleſſed be God, there is enough in our great High-Prieſt for the Prieſthood, as well as the Congregation. Were it not ſo, we could not hold up our Faces before the LORD. Here is our Refuge. But O let us, who are Miniſters, bewail our Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs and Unprofitableneſs, look over our Miniſtry, and view our ſhort comings, which may be ſeen in every Part of our Miniſtry; and let us fly to the Blood of the Covenant with an <hi>O God deliver me from Blood Guiltineſs.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 51.14.</note> And would to God that we, and every Miniſter, might be more concerned to be found faithful! A very ſad Account the unfaithful Miniſter will have to give up at laſt. And inſtead of a goodly Number of precious Souls, eſpouſed, through his Inſtrumentality, <hi>to one Huſband, to preſent, as a chaſte Virgin to Chriſt,</hi> he ſtands with a ghaſtly Number, whoſe Blood is required at his Hands. Tremble, my Soul, at the awful Thought! Blow the Trumpet in Zion, and warn the wicked of his Ways!</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Shall thoſe Miniſters who are inſtrumental of eſpouſing Souls to Chriſt, finally have the unſpeakable Joy and Satisfaction of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010146_0022_0F7D1CC3A991E050"/>
them, at laſt, unto him? How ſhould this <hi>animate</hi> and <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> every Miniſter in his great and difficult Work?</p>
               <p>Miniſters have a very great and difficulty Work, a weighty Work that lies heavy upon their Souls. A very great and difficult Thing it is to bring Souls to eſpouſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Many make light of the Invitation, and will not come to the Wedding. Miniſters have various Tempers and Conſtitutions to deal with; a Flood of Errors and Corruptions to withſtand, and guard againſt: Temptations to remove by all poſſible proper Means. Hard Hearts, ſtupied Conſciences; worldly, carnal, looſe, profane and profligate Sinners to deal with; and what not? for the Children of apoſtate <hi>Adam</hi> have run into thouſands of Diſorders, and wild Mazes of Sin and Error, out of which they muſt be brought, or they will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably periſh. And there is a Legion, yea Legions of Devils, ever in buſy Employ to prevent the Succeſs of the Goſpel. Beſides, the good Miniſter has a bad Heart of his own to grapple with, which renders his Work the more difficult. And how many more Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties has every true Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt? How many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courgements, and Heart-breaking Conſiderations? yet, bleſſed be God, he has an over ballance for them all. In due Time he ſhall reap if he faint not. <hi>He that goeth forth, and weepeth, bearing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Seed, ſhall doubtleſs come again with Rejoicing, bringing his Sheaves with him</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 126, 6,</note>. The thought of winning Souls to Chriſt, and of preſenting them at laſt, as a chaſte Virgin to him, affords a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Support and Comfort under every Diſcouragement. To be the happy Inſtrument of the Converſion of one Soul is a great Thing: to be the Inſtrument of Good to one of the leaſt of all Chriſt's Houſhold, is a Matter of ſo much Importance, that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Labor cannot be ſaid to be in vain; no, but eternal Honor will redound to God, and Good to that Soul, yea, and a glorious Reward too to the good Miniſter himſelf. Let them therefore, be animated in their Work, and take Comfort in it. It is a good Work; a glorious Work; the Work of the Lord. Let them labor and not faint; preſs forward, and <hi>look to Jeſus</hi> their Lord and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our Faith</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 12.2.</note>, and <hi>endure as ſeeing
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010146_0023_0F7D1CC461CE01C8"/>
him that is inviſible,</hi> 
                  <note n="§" place="bottom">Chap. 11.27.</note> knowing that <hi>great is their Reward</hi> from their Father which is <hi>in Heaven</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. 5.12.</note>.</p>
               <p>And now as I am going to take the Care of one of Chriſt's little Flocks in the Wilderneſs, what ſhall I ſay to myſelf upon ſo ſolemn an Occaſion? Senſible, in ſome Meaſure of my great Inſufficiency <hi>for theſe Things,</hi> I would humbly bow my Neck to Chriſt's Yoke, depending upon his abundant Grace to be ſufficient for me in the great and important Work; and would engage to perſevere in it, by his Help, <hi>without which,</hi> I ſee, <hi>I can do Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In my early Days I freely gave up myſelf to the bleſſed Jeſus, with a fervent Deſire to ſerve him in the Work of the glorious Goſpel. The ardent Deſire of eſpouſing Souls to Chriſt, was the prevailing Motive with me, to devote myſelf to ſtudy under many Diſadvantages, and cauſed me to perſevere until I entered upon the Work. And bleſſed be God who has in any Meaſure, owned my worthleſs Endeavours for the good of Souls.</p>
               <p>Indeed it has pleaſed a holy, righteous and ſovereign God, in his all wiſe and all governing Providence to call me to leave that dear People in <hi>Norwich,</hi> to which I lately ſtood in the paſtoral Relation, to the great Grief of us both. Yet thro' Grace, I eſteem <hi>this</hi> with all my Sorrows but my <hi>light Afflictions,</hi> and <hi>not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Glory to be revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as I am now called to leave my Friends, to go a conſiderable Diſtance into the Wilderneſs, to an infant Plantation, where the Goſpel is ſo greatly needed, I chearfully comply, hoping in God's own Time, to ſee the Wilderneſs and the Deſart to rejoice, and bloſſom as the Roſe, ſo that <hi>the Glory of Lebanon, the Excellency of Carmel and Sharon ſhall be given to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they ſhall ſee the Glory of the Lord, and the Excellency of our God</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 35, 1, 2. See the reſt of the Chapter.</note>. If thro' the abundant Grace of God, I may be the happy, tho' unworthy Inſtrument of eſpouſing Souls to Chriſt, and may at laſt, preſent them as a chaſte Virgin to him, it will be the Sum of all my Deſires. To this End I earneſtly aſk an Intereſt in all your Prayers, and humbly commend myſelf to the Grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.</p>
               <p>And now my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, may I, your moſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010146_0024_0F7D1CC5E4A9AA78"/>
unworthy Brother <hi>in the Kingdom and Patience of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 
                  <note place="bottom">Rev. 1.9.</note>, be ſuffered humbly to beſpeak your tender Care and Concern for the Spouſe of our royal and worthy Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt. O that it might be our Study, Prayer and Labor to eſpouſe Souls, precious and immortal Souls to Chriſt. Can we be eaſy to live, to preach, to pray or Converſe to no ſuch bleſſed Effects? Should we not <hi>travail in Birth again</hi> for our dear People, <hi>till</hi> Chriſt be formed in them? O to ſee the Kingdom of our dear Lord advanced, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion flouriſhing, the Land, Emmanuel's Land, a Mountain of Holineſs and a dwelling Place of Peace, and Truth, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the Beauty of the Lord upon his People, how fervently to be deſired! Let us think no Pains too great, no Labor too hard to win Souls to Chriſt. Let us lye at the Throne of Grace and take no Denial there, and lye upon our People, and take no Denial of them. <hi>For Zion's Sake,</hi> let us <hi>not hold our Peace, and for Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem's Sake</hi> let us <hi>not reſt, until the Righteouſneſs thereof go forth as Brightneſs, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſa. 62.1.</note>. And let us think often of the <hi>preſenting</hi> Time, which is at Hand; and God of his infinite Mercy grant that we may preſent a glorious Number as a chaſte Virgin to Chriſt, and meet a <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servants, enter into the Joy of your</hi> LORD. Once more,</p>
               <p>Let me addreſs this numerous Congregation in the Name of the Royal Bridegroom, and invite you all to come and be eſpouſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this one Huſband. I beſeech you in the Bowels of Chriſt, by all his Worth and Excellency, and by all the Bleſſings and Comforts of his Love, and by the Dreadfulneſs of his Wrath, that ye delay not the Matter, but come to a preſent Reſolve for Chriſt. As ever ye would be preſented faultleſs and blameleſs before the Preſence of his Glory with exceeding Joy, and <hi>inherit the Kingdom prepared for the royal Bride from the Foundation of the World,</hi> now conſent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace. And the Lord be with you, AMEN.</p>
