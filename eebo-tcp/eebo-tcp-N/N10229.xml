            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SO much hath been ſaid upon the ſubject of Slave-Keeping, that an Apology may be required for this Addreſs. The only one I ſhall offer is, that the Evil ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. This may in part be owing to the great attachment we have to our own Intereſt, and in part, to the ſubject not being fully exhauſted. The deſign of the following addreſs is to ſum up the leading arguments againſt it, ſeveral of which have not been urged by any of thoſe Authors who have written upon it.</p>
                  <p>Without entering into the Hiſtory of the facts which relate to the Slave Trade, I ſhall proceed to combat the principal arguments which are uſed to ſupport it.</p>
                  <p>I need hardly ſay any thing in favour of the Intellects of the Negroes, or of their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for virtue and happineſs, although theſe have been ſuppoſed, by ſome, to be inferior to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012993_0004_0F90412904BEDBE8"/>
thoſe of the inhabitants of Europe. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which travellers give us of their ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, humanity, and ſtrong attachment to their parents, relations, friends and country, ſhow us that they are equal to the Europeans, when we allow for the diverſity of temper and geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us which is occaſioned by climate. We have many well-atteſted anecdotes of as ſublime and diſintereſted virtue among them as ever adorned a Roman or a Chriſtian character. But we are to diſtinguiſh between an Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can in his own country, and an African in a ſtate of ſlavery in America. Slavery is ſo foreign to the human mind, that the moral faculties, as well as thoſe of the underſtanding are debaſed, and rendered torpid by it. All the vices which are charged upon the Negroes in the ſouthern colonies and the Weſt-Indies, ſuch as Idleneſs, Treachery, Theft, and the like, are the genuine offspring of ſlavery, and serve as an argument to prove that they were not intended for it.</p>
                  <p>Nor let it be ſaid, in the preſent Age, that their black color (as it is commonly called) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                           <p>The Europeans having extirpated the Americans, were obliged to make ſlaves of the Africans for clearing ſuch vaſt tracts of land.</p>
                           <p>Sugar would be too clear, if the plants which produce it were cultivated by any other than ſlaves.</p>
                           <p>Theſe creatures are all over black, and with ſuch a flat noſe that they can ſcarcely be pitied.</p>
                           <p>It is hardly to be believed that God, who is a wiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhould place a ſoul, eſpecially a good ſoul, in ſuch a black ugly body.</p>
                           <p>The Negroes prefer a glaſs necklace to that gold, which polite nations ſo highly value: can there be a greater proof of their wanting common ſenſe?</p>
                           <p>It is impoſſible for us to ſuppoſe theſe creatures to be men, becauſe, allowing them to be men, a ſuſpicion would follow, that we ourſelves are not Chriſtians."</p>

The vulgar notion of their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Cain, who was ſuppoſed to have been marked with this color, is too abſurd to need a refutation.—Without enquiring into the Cauſe of this blackneſs, I ſhall only add up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, that ſo far from being a curſe, it ſubjects the Negroes to no inconveniencies,

                  <p>It has been urged by the inhabitants of the Sugar Iſlands and South Carolina, that it would be impoſſible to carry on the manufactories of Sugar, Rice, and Indigo, without negro ſlaves. No manufactory can ever be of conſequence enough to ſociety to admit the leaſt violation of the Laws of juſtice or humanity. But I am far from thinking the arguments uſed in favour of employing Negroes for the cultivation of theſe articles, ſhould have any Weight.—M. Le Poivre, late envoy from the king of France, to

Compare then the price of the Cochin-Chineſe production with the ſame commodity which is cultivated and prepared by the wretched ſlaves of our European colonies, and judge if, to procure ſugar from our colonies, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to authorize by law the ſlavery of the unhappy Africans tranſported to America. <note n="§" place="bottom">White ſugar, of the beſt quality, is ſold for three Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars the Cochin-China quintal, which weighs from I50 to 200 pounds French.

I have never ſeen an Account of the Spaniſh Regulations in writing, but I underſtand that they are to the following Effect: As ſoon as a ſlave is landed, his Name, Price, &amp;c. are regiſter'd in a public Office, and the Maſter is obliged to allow him One Working Day in every Week to himſelf, beſides Sundays, ſo that if the Slave chuſes to work for his Maſter on that Day, he receives the Wages of a Freeman for it, and whatever he gains by his Labor on that Day, is ſo ſecured to him by Law, that the Maſter cannot deprive him of it. This is certainly a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Step towards the aboliſhing abſolute Slavery. As ſoon as the ſlave is able to purchaſe another working Day, the maſter is obliged to ſell it to him at a proportionable price, viz. I-fifth Part of his original Coſt: and ſo likewiſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining 4 Days at the ſame Rate, as ſoon as the Slave is able to redeem them, after which he is abſolutely free. This is ſuch an Encouragement to Induſtry, that even the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent are tempted to exert themſelves. Men who have thus worked out their Freedom are inured to the Labor of the Country and are certainly the moſt uſeful Subjects that a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony can acquire.

Think of the many thouſands who periſh by ſickneſs, melancholy, and ſuicide, in their voyages to America. Purſue the poor devoted victims to one of the Weſt India iſlands, and ſee them expoſed there to public ſale. Hear their cries, and ſee their looks of tenderneſs at each other, upon being ſeperated.—Mothers are torn from their Daughters, and Brothers from Brothers, without the liberty of a parting em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. Their maſter's name is now marked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their breaſts with a red hot iron. But let us purſue them into a Sugar Field: and behold a ſcene ſtill more affecting than this—See! the poor wretches with what reluctance they take their inſtruments of labor into their hands,—Some of them, overcome with heat and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſeek to refreſh themſelves by a little reſt.—But, behold an Overſeer approaches them—In vain they ſue for pity.—He lifts up his Whip, while ſtreams of Blood follow every ſtroke.

behold a man, who from his countenance and deportment appears as if he was deſcended from illuſtrious anceſtors—Yes—He is the ſon of a Prince, and was torn by a ſtratagem, from an amiable wife and two young children.—Mark his ſullen looks!—now he bids defiance to the tyranny of his Maſter, and in an inſtant—plunges a Knife into his Heart.—But let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from this Scene, and ſee the various modes of arbitrary puniſhments inflicted upon them by their maſters. Behold one covered with ſtripes, into which melted wax is poured—another tied down to a block or a ſtake—a third ſuſpended in the air by his thumbs—a fourth—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not relate it.—Where now is Law or Juſtice?—Let us fly to them to ſtep in for their relief.—Alas!—The one is ſilent, and the other denounces more terrible, puniſhments upon them. Let us attend the place appointed for inflicting the penalties of the law.

                  <p>THERE is no Subject ſo ſacred that has not ſometimes been expoſed to Oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy. The immortality of the Soul, the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Morality, and even the Exiſtence of a Supreme Being, have all in their Turns been treated as unworthy of Belief. On the other Hand, there is no Subject ſo ſubverſive of the Happineſs of Mankind, but what has had its Advocates.—Adultery—Perjury,—and even Suicide, have all been defended as lawful. Poſterity will hardly believe that human Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity could riſe higher, and that a Man had lived, who had undertaken to defend SLAVERY. Should they ſeek his Name or Country, how will they be ſurprized to hear that he was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from a Briton;—that he lived under the Protection of British Laws:—And that he was ſtill connected with Great Britain. The Perſon I mean is the Author of a Pamphlet, entitled <q>Slavery not forbidden by Scripture,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012993_0035_0F9041488DEFE2E8"/>
or a Defence of the Weſt-India Planters,</q> &amp;c. and who calls himſelf a WEST-INDIAN.</p>
                  <p>THE Author of this Defence begins, by pleading in behalf of the Slavery of the Negroes in the Weſt Indies, <q>the imperfections of all human Inſtitutions <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 2.</note>.</q> This muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by every Body, but is by no means an Apology for our not doing every thing that lies in our Power to Remedy them.

Shall Phyſicians ceaſe to relieve the Pains of the Sick, becauſe the Body muſt at laſt pay the Tribute to Mortality? Shall the Clergy ceaſe to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Duties of Religion, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put an entire ſtop to the progreſs of Vice and Infidelity?—</p>
                  <p>IMPROVEMENTS of all kinds in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety are progreſſive. It is impoſſible to review the Conſtitution and Laws of Great Britain, without admiring the gradual Improvements which have been made in both: Many of

which at their firſt Propoſal were no Doubt treated as viſionary and impracticable. The abolition of domeſtic Slavery is not an Utopian Scheme. It was aboliſhed by Conſtantine the firſt Chriſtian Emperor throughout the Roman Empire. It ceaſed in many parts of Europe after the Reformation. It is unknown in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. It's Foundations are now ſhaking in Spain and Portugal. It begins to looſe Ground in America. The Aſſembly of Virginia have petitioned for a Law to prevent the future im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Negroes amongſt them. The Aſſembly of Pennſylvania have impoſed a Duty of twenty Pounds Currency upon every Negro, imported into the Province. The inhabitants of the Province of Maſſachuſetts Bay have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed their Repreſentatives to enact Laws to reſtrain it. Reaſon and Humanity with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to Negro Slavery, have at laſt awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Weſt-Indies, and many reſpectable Planters now wiſh to extricate themſelves from it. With ſuch Succeſs and Proſpects, I venture once more to take up my Pen in behalf of the poor Africans. Great Events have often been brought about by ſlender Means. Permanent

"For Rebellion, the Puniſhment is burning them, by nailing them down on the Ground, with crooked Sticks on every Limb, and then applying the Fire by Degrees from the Feet and Hands, burning them gradually upon the Head, whereby their Pains are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant.

to give in their Names. But for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Human Nature I ſhall ſuppreſs them. Let not our Author after this, be offended at the harſheſt Epithets that can be given to thoſe who inflict theſe Puniſhments. If he is, let him defend the Weſt-India Planters from the Aſperſions of Dr. Campbell, who ſpeaking of the Negroes in the Weſt Indies, ſays, "They endure a Slavery more complete, and attended with far worſe Circumſtances, than what any People in their Condition ſuffer, in any other Part of the World; or have ſuffered, in any other Period of Time <note n="§" place="bottom">Account of European Settlements in America.</note>." Let him defend them from the Aſperſions of Huberus, who in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the neceſſity of a mild Slavery in ſome Countries adds, "I ſpeak only of that kind of Slavery which was in Uſe amongſt civilized Nations—not of that which prevails amongſt BARBARIANS, or which the Africans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in America <note n="‖" place="bottom">Praelect.

                  <p>THE Author of the Defence endeavours to palliate the Severity of the <hi>penal</hi> Laws which relate to Slaves in the Weſt-Indies by ſaying, that they may appear "harſh at firſt Sight <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 18.</note>".

What a Door is here opened for Injuries of all kinds againſt the Slaves!—Even Self Preſervation, the firſt Law of Nature, which often ſhews itſelf in Inſtinct, anticedent to the ſlower Operations of Reaſon, is here ſuſpended by the Law of the Land <note n="*" place="bottom">

Deſpotic Governments always require ſevere Laws.

have generally travelled together. Moreover the Heat of the Climate in Africa, by bringing on Indolence of Mind, and Body, expoſes them at all Times to Slavery, while the Fertility of the Soil renders the Want of Liberty a leſs Evil to them, than it is to the Inhabitants of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, or leſs Warm and fruitful Countries<note n="†" place="bottom">Monteſquieu.</note>. Theſe laſt Cauſes, have likewiſe fixed Slavery in Aſia: but from the undivided Nature of this Country, it has not been confined as in Africa to petty Monarchies, but extended through large Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires: Hence the Aſiatics are a civilized People.</p>
                  <p>COULD it be proved, that the Negroes are the only People in the World, who are ignorant of a Supreme Being, or that Worſhip Idols, it might add Weight to our Author's Argument<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 16.</note> derived from theſe Facts, to ſhew that they are an inferior Race of Men.

                  <p>THREE Cauſes concur to check Populati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Country, namely, Luxury, Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Slavery. The firſt of theſe by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing our wants, encreaſes the difficulties of ſupporting a Family; the ſecond renders the Sexes unfit, while the laſt abates the Appetite, for propagating the Species. All theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their Effects according to their Degree, or according to their being more or leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined. Slavery operates differently, whether it be of a political, or domeſtic Nature. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Slavery in ſome Countries has but little influence upon Population, ſuch as in ſome parts of Aſia, and Africa. In others it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates againſt it, as in Ruſſia, and moſt of the ſtates of Italy. Domeſtic Slavery in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012993_0066_0F904165C4AC4618"/>
ſometimes exiſts under ſuch alleviations as to have little influence upon Population. This was the caſe in Egypt. The Iſraelites multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in a rapid manner during their Captivity. That they were treated with Lenity we learn from the hiſtory of Joſeph. Had Maſters poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a right over the Lives of their Slaves, Potiphar would have avenged the diſhonour Joſeph was accuſed of attempting to bring on his Bed, and not have conſigned him over to be tried, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and puniſhed by the municipal Law of the Country. Slaves encreaſed nearly in the ſame proportion as Freemen in the virtuous Ages of the Roman Empire. We read of ſome who owned 10,000, and others 20,000 of them. That the Romans treated their Slaves with Lenity, we learn from the teſtimony of Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca <note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſt. 47.</note>. It is true the Romans imported many Slaves from the Barbarous Countries they ſubdued, but this was in the declenſion of their Empire. It was not 'till this time that we read of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtula, or Houſe of Correction for Slaves. They partook of the diſſolute manners of their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012993_0067_0F9041670DC39328"/>
and therefore foreign ſupplies were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to repair the waſte which Debauchery had, introduced amongſt them. It is true alſo, the right of Life was held over Slaves, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were inflicted upon them in criminal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But the ſame right was held by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans over their own Children, and Tortures were inflicted in like caſes upon Freemen. They were ſeldom put in Execution upon either, in the early Ages of the Empire. Slaves multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied among the antient Germans, by whom they were treated with the Familiarity of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, according to the Teſtimony of Tacitus <note n="*" place="bottom">De Morib. German. Chap. 20, 25.</note>. Slaves have multiplied moreover in the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern and Middle Colonies of America. But in the Weſt-Indies they have never encreaſed by ordinary Population. We ſhall firſt prove this Fact, and then aſſign the reaſons of it.</p>
                  <p>LIGON in his Account of Barbadoes tells us that in the year 1646 there were 20,000 Whites on that Iſland, beſides, to uſe his own Words "a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Upon a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary enquiry into the ſtate of the African Trade in the year 1728 it appeared that in three years only the number of Negroes imported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Barbadoes, Jamaica, and Antigua amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 42,000, beſides what were carried to St. Kitts, Nevis, and Monſerrat. From this it appears, that the Iſland of Jamaica, allowing it only an equal proportion with Barbadoes and Antigua, imported 14,000 Negroes in three years. When we conſider the great increaſe of the demand for Sugar, and the other Produce of that Iſland, ſince the year 1728, we cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of leſs than 5,000 Negroes being imported there every year ſince.

If in the latter they have encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a few thouſands within theſe forty years it is not owing to ordinary Population, but to the many new Eſtates which have lately been ſettled on that Iſland.

The true Cauſe of their Want of Increaſe reſults from the Intercourſe of the Whites with the young Wenches, who derive no inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Emolument therefrom, and as childbearing world put an end to this Commerce, they viciouſly uſe every Precaution to avoid Conception; and if theſe prove ineffectual, they even procure repeated Abortions, which incapacitates them for Child bearing in a more advanced Age.

A Planter in one of the Weſt-India Iſlands who felt ſome uneaſineſs in his Mind from keeping Negro Slaves, wrote lately to a learned Divine in London, to know whether it was unlawful. The Divine wrote for anſwer, that the Jews had Slaves—that it was not forbidden in the New Teſtament—that domeſtic Slavery had exiſted in every Age and Corner of the World—and that by treating his Slaves well, he committed no Crime in keeping them. Had this Planter liſtened a little longer to the Voice of Heaven, ſpeaking in his Heart, or conſulted the whole Tenor of his Bible, he would have received a very different An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Queſtion.

ALL the Planters in the Weſt-Indies. If it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to reaſon againſt the Practice of any Thing in itſelf lawful, from its Abuſe; it is not ſo, to reaſon againſt Practices, in themſelves unlawful, from their Abuſe. The rankeſt Weeds, and the moſt delicious Fruits, often grow in the ſame Soil. I honour the Weſt-Indians for their Hoſpitality, Generoſity, and Public Spirit. I have had the Pleaſure of knowing many of them, who were diſtinguiſhed for their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and every other Virtue that could adorn human Nature. There are ſome Metals ſo pure that they receive no Ruſt from being expoſed to the moiſteſt Atmoſphere; ſo there are ſome Diſpoſitions naturally ſo good, that they cannot contract the leaſt ſoile of Vice—even from Slavery.</p>
