            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SO much hath been ≈øaid upon the ≈øubject of Slave-Keeping, that an Apology may be required for this Addre≈øs. The only one I ≈øhall offer is, that the Evil ≈øtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. This may in part be owing to the great attachment we have to our own Intere≈øt, and in part, to the ≈øubject not being fully exhau≈øted. The de≈øign of the following addre≈øs is to ≈øum up the leading arguments again≈øt it, ≈øeveral of which have not been urged by any of tho≈øe Authors who have written upon it.</p>
                  <p>Without entering into the Hi≈øtory of the facts which relate to the Slave Trade, I ≈øhall proceed to combat the principal arguments which are u≈øed to ≈øupport it.</p>
                  <p>I need hardly ≈øay any thing in favour of the Intellects of the Negroes, or of their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for virtue and happine≈øs, although the≈øe have been ≈øuppo≈øed, by ≈øome, to be inferior to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012993_0004_0F90412904BEDBE8"/>
tho≈øe of the inhabitants of Europe. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which travellers give us of their ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, humanity, and ≈øtrong attachment to their parents, relations, friends and country, ≈øhow us that they are equal to the Europeans, when we allow for the diver≈øity of temper and geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us which is occa≈øioned by climate. We have many well-atte≈øted anecdotes of as ≈øublime and di≈øintere≈øted virtue among them as ever adorned a Roman or a Chri≈øtian character. But we are to di≈øtingui≈øh between an Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can in his own country, and an African in a ≈øtate of ≈ølavery in America. Slavery is ≈øo foreign to the human mind, that the moral faculties, as well as tho≈øe of the under≈øtanding are deba≈øed, and rendered torpid by it. All the vices which are charged upon the Negroes in the ≈øouthern colonies and the We≈øt-Indies, ≈øuch as Idlene≈øs, Treachery, Theft, and the like, are the genuine offspring of ≈ølavery, and serve as an argument to prove that they were not intended for it.</p>
                  <p>Nor let it be ≈øaid, in the pre≈øent Age, that their black color (as it is commonly called) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                        <p>Monte≈øquieu, in his Spirit of Laws, treats this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the ridicule it de≈øerves.</p>

                           <p>"WERE I to vindicate our right to make ≈ølaves of the Negroes, the≈øe ≈øhould be my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                           <p>The Europeans having extirpated the Americans, were obliged to make ≈ølaves of the Africans for clearing ≈øuch va≈øt tracts of land.</p>
                           <p>Sugar would be too clear, if the plants which produce it were cultivated by any other than ≈ølaves.</p>
                           <p>The≈øe creatures are all over black, and with ≈øuch a flat no≈øe that they can ≈øcarcely be pitied.</p>
                           <p>It is hardly to be believed that God, who is a wi≈øe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ≈øhould place a ≈øoul, e≈øpecially a good ≈øoul, in ≈øuch a black ugly body.</p>
                           <p>The Negroes prefer a gla≈øs necklace to that gold, which polite nations ≈øo highly value: can there be a greater proof of their wanting common ≈øen≈øe?</p>
                           <p>It is impo≈ø≈øible for us to ≈øuppo≈øe the≈øe creatures to be men, becau≈øe, allowing them to be men, a ≈øu≈øpicion would follow, that we our≈øelves are not Chri≈øtians."</p>

                        <p>A worthy friend of mine has favoured me with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Extract of a letter from GRANDVILLE SHARP, <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> of London.</p>
                        <p>"I AM told of ≈øome Regulations that have taken Place in the Spani≈øh Colonies, which do the Spaniards much Honor, and are certainly worthy our Imitation, in ca≈øe we ≈øhould not be ≈øo happy as to obtain an entire Abolition of Slavery, and probably you wou'd find many American Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that wou'd be willing to promote ≈øuch Regulations, tho' the ≈øame People wou'd ≈øtrenou≈øly oppo≈øe the ≈øcheme of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Abolition of Slavery. I have never ≈øeen an Account of the Spani≈øh Regulations in writing, but I under≈øtand that they are to the following Effect: As ≈øoon as a ≈ølave is landed, his Name, Price, &amp;c. are regi≈øter'd in a public Office, and the Ma≈øter is obliged to allow him One Working Day in every Week to him≈øelf, be≈øides Sundays, ≈øo that if the Slave chu≈øes to work for his Ma≈øter on that Day, he receives the Wages of a Freeman for it, and whatever he gains by his Labor on that Day, is ≈øo ≈øecured to him by Law, that the Ma≈øter cannot deprive him of it. This is certainly a con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Step towards the aboli≈øhing ab≈øolute Slavery. As ≈øoon as the ≈ølave is able to purcha≈øe another working Day, the ma≈øter is obliged to ≈øell it to him at a proportionable price, viz. I-fifth Part of his original Co≈øt: and ≈øo likewi≈øe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining 4 Days at the ≈øame Rate, as ≈øoon as the Slave is able to redeem them, after which he is ab≈øolutely free. This is ≈øuch an Encouragement to Indu≈øtry, that even the mo≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent are tempted to exert them≈øelves. Men who have thus worked out their Freedom are inured to the Labor of the Country and are certainly the mo≈øt u≈øeful Subjects that a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony can acquire. Regulations might be formed upon the ≈øame Plan to encourage the Indu≈øtry of Slaves that are already imported into the colonies, which would teach them how to maintain them≈øelves and be as u≈øeful, as well as le≈øs expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive to the Planter. They would by ≈øuch Means become Members of Society and have an Intere≈øt in the Welfare of the Community, which would add greatly to the Strength and Security of each Colony; whereas, at pre≈øent, many of the Planters are in continual Danger of being cut off by their Slaves.‚Äîa Fate which, they but too ju≈øtly de≈øerve!".</p>

≈øometimes exi≈øts under ≈øuch alleviations as to have little influence upon Population. This was the ca≈øe in Egypt.

Slaves encrea≈øed nearly in the ≈øame proportion as Freemen in the virtuous Ages of the Roman Empire. We read of ≈øome who owned 10,000, and others 20,000 of them.

                  <p>THE Reader will here pardon my ≈øaying a Word or two of my≈øelf. I am called upon by the Author of the Defence to an≈øwer a Que≈øtion.‚ÄîShould I become "an Owner of a We≈øt-India E≈øtate by the Death of a Relation, or ≈øome other unexpected Means," he de≈øires to know "whether I could lay my Hand on my Heart, and ≈øay, with a ≈øafe Con≈øcience, that I would in≈øtantly free all my Slaves, and de≈øtroy my Sugar Works." Suppo≈øe I ≈øhould refu≈øe to do this, the Subject remains where it did,‚ÄîI ≈øhould then commit a Crime for which I ≈øhould <hi>ju≈øtly</hi> "loo≈øe the E≈øteem of Men of Sen≈øe, and of a rational Way of thinking."</p>
                  <p>AND now my We≈øt-India Friend, give me leave in my turn to a≈øk you a few Que≈øtions. Lay your Hand upon <hi>your</hi> Heart, and tell me; would you like to be ≈øold, for no fault, or torn again≈øt your will from your Si≈øters and Brothers, and carried into a, foreign Country, to be ≈øubjected to the ab≈øolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Ma≈øter; to be obliged to labor without intermi≈ø≈øion, to cea≈øe to make any further improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                  <p>PERHAPS ≈øome of my We≈øt-India Readers are waiting to ≈øee an Apology, for the Account I have given in the Addre≈øs of the Puni≈øhments inflicted upon the Negroes in the We≈øt-Indies.

The Authorities upon which I have re≈øted all my Facts, cannot be contradicted. But I am far from applying the Account that is given of the inhuman Practices of <hi>≈øome</hi> Ma≈øters, to

The ranke≈øt Weeds, and the mo≈øt delicious Fruits, often grow in the ≈øame Soil. I honour the We≈øt-Indians for their Ho≈øpitality, Genero≈øity, and Public Spirit. I have had the Plea≈øure of knowing many of them, who were di≈øtingui≈øhed for their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and every other Virtue that could adorn human Nature. There are ≈øome Metals ≈øo pure that they receive no Ru≈øt from being expo≈øed to the moi≈øte≈øt Atmo≈øphere; ≈øo there are ≈øome Di≈øpo≈øitions naturally ≈øo good, that they cannot contract the lea≈øt ≈øoile of Vice‚Äîeven from Slavery.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE avoided as much as po≈ø≈øible every Thing through the whole of this Vindication, that could draw me from my Subject to the Author of the Defence. I ≈øhall not even give him the Pain of repeating here the many unkind In≈øinuations and Reflections he has thrown out again≈øt me. He was perhaps warm when he wrote them‚ÄîWhen he cools, I am per≈øuaded he will be "≈øorry for his ungenerous abu≈øe of a man who never injured him," <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Page 30.</note> or any other <hi>Individual</hi> born in the We≈øt-Indies.</p>
