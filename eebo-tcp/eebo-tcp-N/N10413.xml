            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<date>May 30, 1774.</date>
               </dateline>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> THANK you for your kind letter, wherein you expreſs a tender concern for the people of Boſton, and ſympathize with them, under the hard trial they muſt paſs through, in conſequence of the late parliamentary act, commonly ſpoken of under the name of the Boſton port-bill. It is a general idea only of the ſufferings we muſt endure that has excited in you thoſe motions of grief and pity, of which you have the perceptions; for, being at a diſtance, and not being diſtinctly acquainted with that multiplicity of ways in which this barbarous act will
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013197_0003_0F9045CC4371ED70"/>
operate to diſtreſs us, your conception of our ſufferings, by means of it, muſt fall vaſtly below the greatneſs of them. It will not therefore be diſpleaſing, though it ſhould add ſome degree of impetuoſity to your paſſions, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready give you uneaſineſs, if I am par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in pointing out to you thoſe avenues this horred decree has opened to let in miſery upon us.</p>
            <p>BE pleaſed then to conſider, not the well-being only, but the ſupport of this town is almoſt wholly dependent upon trade, the carrying on of which makes way for imployment, and employment procures daily bread for at leaſt eight tenths of its inhabitants. Extenſive trade, you will be ſenſible, if you only allow yourſelf to think a while, natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gives riſe to a great variety of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, which occupations give a livelihood to hundreds and thouſands. It muſt therefore amazingly ſpread diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs in ſo large a commercial place as this metropolis of the Maſſachuſetts-Province, to have its inhabitants in an
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013197_0004_0F9045CD24C9C150"/>
inſtant, as it were, put out of all capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of employing themſelves in any of thoſe vaſtly various callings, on which alone, under God, they had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence for a ſupply with even the neceſſaries of life. Few, comparatively very few in Boſton, are men of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent fortunes. The people here are almoſt univerſally laborers or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of this or the other denomination, who, by this act which has ſtopped the courſe of trade, are totally deprived of the only means of their ſubſiſtence. This is the caſe of our ſhip-builders, ſhip-joiners, maſt-makers, riggers, caulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, rope and ſail-makers; whoſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations gave them and their depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents a comfortable maintenance: This is the caſe of our houſe-carpenters and maſons, who have now little to do, either in the way of building or repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſes; as timber, boards, ſhingles, brick and lime are not permitted to be brought into the town in any veſſel whatever, from any part of the province or elſewhere: This is the caſe of our diſtillers and ſugar boilers; who are at
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013197_0005_0F9045D352B0BE88"/>
once incapacitated for carrying on that buſineſs which was their ſupport; as neither molaſſes nor ſugar are ſuffered to come into Boſton-harbor: This is the caſe with our coopers; who, if they could procure ſtaves and hoops could make little or no uſe of them, as the work of trimming imported caſks and making others for exportation, has, at preſent, an unhappy period put to it: This is the caſe alſo of our truckmen, porters, and a numerous train of day-laborers, who will now be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to become idlers, and muſt ſuffer hunger, and be cloathed with rags.</p>
            <p>BY this enumeration of our tribes of workmen, you will readily perceive, that vaſt numbers, not leſs, I ſuppoſe (taking in their wives, children and ſervants, who are dependent upon them) than fifteen thouſand at the loweſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, are reduced to a ſtarving condition; none of which, ſo far as is known, had any more an hand in the deſtruction of the Eaſt-India company's tea, then Lord North himſelf; and but
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013197_0006_0F9045D633A8B758"/>
a few of them comparatively were among thoſe who conſtituted the aſſemblies who have been complained of as riotous. Nor are the ſufferings occaſioned by this act confined to the inhabitants of Boſton; but extend to all in our towns on the ſea ſhore, for hundreds of miles, whoſe buſineſs is that of coaſting, as they are forcibly reſtrained from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this port any merchandize from the places where they live, or from carrying any out of it, to the towns to which they belong, though their neceſſity ſhould ever ſo loudly call for it: Yea, ſuch is the cruelty of this act, that none of the people in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land towns can ſo much as croſs the ferry from Charleſtown to Boſton with any of their goods for ſale, but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing both their goods, and the boat that brings them, to a ſeizure by thoſe whoſe tender mercies are cruelties: Yea further, no merchandize of any ſort is permitted to be brought from either Marblehead or Salem, the port ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the room of Boſton, but by land carriage, which, though greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013197_0007_0F9045D6B58AD150"/>
is made almoſt doubly ſo; as inſtead of fifteen miles only, by going over a ferry, the neceſſary carriage is now no leſs than twenty eight; which is as diſtreſſing to the merchants in their towns, as to thoſe in Boſton, and as much complained of. In an addreſs from an hundred and twenty-five mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and freeholders at Salem, to his Excellency Governor Gage, in which they have done themſelves great honor, are theſe words; "In ſhutting up the port of Boſton, ſome imagine that the courſe of trade might be turned hither, and to our benefit. But nature, in the formation of our harbor, forbids our becoming rivals in commerce with that convenient mart. And were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we muſt be dead to every idea of juſtice, and to all feelings of humanity, could we indulge one thought to ſeize on wealth, and raiſe our fortunes on the ruin of our ſuffering neighbors. But ſo far from receiving benefit, we are greatly injured by the ſhutting up the harbor of Boſton, as it deprives us of a market for much the largeſt part of our
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013197_0008_0F9045D775341630"/>
Weſt-India imports; and there is not a town in the province but will feel the ill effects of it. Permit us then, ſir, to apply to your clemency and juſtice to afford us every alleviation in your power, and to procure for us every poſſible relief from this extenſive miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief." To what can this multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of trouble and charge be aſcribed but to the want of knowledge of the country, or a deſign wantonly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our diſtreſs by the exerciſe of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power? Who could have imagined, that a decree thus mixed with contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſeverity, and thus big with diſtreſs and ruin to thouſands of poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, could have had exiſtence given it by an Engliſh parliament! Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible filial affection to the parent-ſtate ſhould hereby be promoted? What, in the natural courſe of things, can be the effect of ſo cruel an edict, but the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up a ſpirit of reſentment? And if multitudes, by being reduced to a ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſperate condition, ſhould act a wild and mad part, who would be ſo much to blame as thoſe who were the occaſional cauſe of it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:013197_0009_0F9045D836E36440"/>BUT it will be ſaid, proviſion is made in the act that ſhuts up the harbor of Boſton, for its being opened again; inſomuch that it will be our own fault, if the difficulties we complain of are not removed. It is a proper queſtion here, why were theſe difficulties brought upon us at all in an abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional way? Had terms of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion been connected with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as threatned only, ſo as that it might have been at our own option, whether we would ſubmit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſuffer; the reaſon for complaint would have been far leſs than it now is. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out previous warning, in the propoſal of any terms that might have prevented the coming of evil on us, it is inflicted with ineſſable vengeance, and under ſuch circumſtances, that ſhould we, in the moſt ſervile manner, ſubmit to all that is required, we muſt notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inevitably ſuffer almoſt total ruin. For the act will be in full force the firſt day of June, and will remain ſo till a certificate from the Governor, ſetting forth our entire ſubmiſſion
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013197_0010_0F9045D900DECB28"/>
and obedience, is tranſmitted to the King, and relief, in conſequence of it, is granted to us by him in privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; which every one knows is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be done, till hundreds are ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death, if not provided for by heaven in ſome unknown way or other.</p>
            <p>AND not only are we laid under a neceſſity of ſuffering by this act to an extreme degree, though we ſhould be ever ſo obedient to its requirements; but (truely melancholy to conſider) the terms ſpecified in it, upon which alone our ſufferings are to be removed, far from being fixed with preciſion, are ſo looſe and indeterminate, that a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or may, ſhould he ſo pleaſe, perpetuate them during his political exiſtence; as, without a certificate from him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring our compliance with the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary demands, the King himſelf in privy council is not enabled to open the port of Boſton; nor is any other way provided for its being done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:013197_0011_0F9045D9B818FA28"/>A FURTHER aggravation of our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and what gives the keeneſt edge to them is, that the wharfs and landing-places in the town of Boſton, which are the property of numerous individuals, and of a much greater value than all the teas the Eaſt-India company have ſent to this whole continent, are, as to the uſe of them, wherein only their value con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, wreſted out of their hands, and put into the King's, to be diſpoſed of at his pleaſure. The city of London, we imagine, however highly and juſtly they may think of the King's wiſdom and benevolence, would, with one united voice complain of tyranny, a bare-faced invaſion of their rights, if they were thus reſtrained from the uſe of this or the other valuable part of their property, unleſs by a granted licence at the pleaſure of his Majeſty. The inhabitants of Boſton are Engliſh ſubjects, as well as the citizens of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and may with equal juſtice utter their cries againſt that arbitrary exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of power, which indiſcriminately makes the uſe of their rightful property
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013197_0012_0F9045DA844F4198"/>
dependent on pleaſure at three thouſand miles diſtance: Nor may it be thought ſtrange, if their groans ſhould be loud and bitter: Eſpecially, as this inſtance of deſpotiſm is added to complete hardſhips in other reſpects cruel in their nature, and extreme in degree, beyond what might have been expected, in like circumſtances, from either France or Spain.</p>
            <p>WHAT now could be the excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this extraordinary vengeance? The preamble to the act of parliament will inform us.</p>
            <p>IT begins with mentioning "Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous commotions and inſurrections fomented and raiſed in the town of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, by diverſe ill-affected perſons." But was Boſton the only place in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, where there had been ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions? Might it not, with equal truth, have been ſaid, that like "com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and inſurrections had been fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and raiſed" in New-York, Philadelphia, and other American co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies? And yet, Boſton only is the ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013197_0013_0F9045DB387527D0"/>
object of reſentment, and to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not eaſily to be paralleled! Does this carry the face of impartial juſtice? Some Boſtonians who have been in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſome who were born there, have aſſured us, and upon their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that "commotions and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections," in the late times of public grievance, have frequently been "fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and raiſed" in the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and to a much greater and more dangerous height than they ever were at Boſton: But that city, as ſuch, we have not been told, was ever puniſhed at all for theſe riotous diſorders, much leſs with a ſeverity portending it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Would Boſton have been thus cruelly dealt with, had not it's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from Great Britain been ſo great, that it's groans, under the weight of oppreſſion, could not be heard there, ſo as to move either indignation or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, in our brethren of the mother country?</p>
            <p>BUT it is ſaid of theſe commotions, that they were "fomented and raiſed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013197_0014_0F9045DBF77AED38"/>
to the ſubverſion of his Majeſty's go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to the utter deſtruction of the public peace and good order of the ſaid town." It may with exact truth be affirmed, that "ill-affected perſons" did not foment theſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the leaſt view to manifeſt diſloyalty to his Majeſty, or to "ſubvert his government" as conſtitutionally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed; but to endeavour, in the only way they had left, to fruſtrate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of thoſe, who, by falſe and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious repreſentations, would deceive his Majeſty, ſo as to be permitted to bring this country into bondage. It is well known, both at home and here, that we have often made our humble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of grievances two great to be eaſy under. And what has been the effect, but a contemptuous deafneſs to our cries for relief? To this it is owing, and this only, that there have been any undeſirable commotions among us. And ſhall we be forcibly reduced to the laſt extremity of miſery, becauſe we cannot any longer patiently bear that which is intolerable? Had we not
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013197_0015_0F9045DCB8FE0AC8"/>
been oppreſſed, and to an high degree, there would not have been the leaſt diſturbance in the town, or province. And ſhould it be true, that oppreſſion has made "diverſe perſons ill-affected," and excited them to raiſe unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able commotions, muſt thouſands of innocents be puniſhed herefor with the utmoſt ſeverity? Is this reaſonable? Can it be made to conſiſt with equity? Could it have been, had the common feelings of humanity operated without obſtructions? The Boſtonians have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been as much diſpoſed to honor and ſupport conſtitutional government, as any of the people in England; and it is one of their greateſt burdens that they ſhould be brought into ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as to be even forced into that which is highly diſagreeable to them; and if "the good order of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton" has in any meaſure, been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, the way to reſtore peace is to hear our cries, and redreſs our griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. This, and this only, will do it effectually, and laſtingly. Force may for a while keep the people under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013197_0016_0F9045DD75D25200"/>
but this very reſtraint may, in time, be the occaſion of the out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their paſſions with the greater violence; and what the conſequence, in that caſe, will be, God only knows.</p>
            <p>A FURTHER reaſon given for the paſſing this act is, that in theſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, "certain valuable cargoes of teas, being the property of the Eaſt-India company, and on board certain veſſels lying within the bay or harbor of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, were ſeized and deſtroyed." Some, even in England, have wrote with great ſtrength and ſpirit in defence of the deſtruction of thoſe teas, under the ſpecial circumſtances in which they were ſent here. But ſhould it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that this deſtruction was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable, both in the view of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and law, will it follow from hence that the town of Boſton ought to be put into a ſtate of ſuffering, which it is impoſſible they ſhould live under, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſupplies are ſent to them from the other towns, in this, or the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colonies? It ſhould always be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013197_0017_0F9045DE39C951D8"/>
the tea-deſtruction was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by perſons in diſguiſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known even to this day. Boſton, as a town, neither adviſed to it, nor did any thing to bring it into event: Nay, even thoſe very people, whoſe aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together two or three times in Boſton, has been called unlawful and riotous, were ſo far from deſigning, or ſo much as deſiring, this deſtruction, that they did all that lay in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to prevent it: Nor would the tea have been deſtroyed, had it not been for Governor Hutchinſon, the collector (under the eye of the commiſſioners) and the conſignees, to whom alone it muſt be aſcribed, that it came to this end: Nor were the people, whoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling together has been ſo bitterly complained of, the inhabitants of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton only, but of many other towns in the province. Theſe are all known, certain truths. And yet, Boſton, as a town, is conſidered as chargeable with this deſtruction, and puniſhed for it in an awfully ſevere manner; and this too, without giving them notice of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013197_0018_0F9045DFB5BE0E80"/>
their crime, or opportunity of ſaying a word in defence of themſelves. If this is not unconſtitutional, arbitrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, mankind in common, will, I am ſure, call it rigorouſly hard and cruel.</p>
            <p>THE laſt thing ſaid, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the giving life to this act, is, that "in the preſent condition of the ſaid town and harbor, the commerce of his Majeſty's ſubjects cannot be ſafely carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, nor the cuſtoms payable to his Majeſty, collected." There is not a more known truth, than that the commerce of his Majeſty's ſubjects has not been by this town, in it's "preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on," or by any "ill-affected perſons" in it, in the leaſt meaſure obſtructed, unleſs in the ſingle article of the Eaſt-India company's teas; nor have his Majeſty's officers been at all hindred from col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the payable cuſtoms, excepting only in this ſame article; nor was there ever any difficulty even as to this, till in a late inſtance or two. And ſo far was "the commerce of his Majeſty's ſubjects" from being obſtructed in other articles by what was done in this, that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013197_0019_0F9045DFDEC1F278"/>
the utmoſt care was taken to prevent it: Nor is there a perſon in Boſton who will ſay, unleſs he knowingly wrongs the truth, that the deſtruction of the teas was the occaſion of his ſuffering as to any other kind of merchandize, tho' ſent in the ſame ſhips that brought the teas. The miniſtry well knew, that not Boſton, or the Maſſachuſetts-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince only, but all the American colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were united as one in thinking it unconſtitutional to be taxed by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as they are not repreſented there, nor can be, by reaſon of their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſtance; and they have been juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in this ſentiment by ſome of the greateſt men at home, who have ſaid that in defence of it, which the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are fully ſatisfied cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted inconſiſtency with the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged right of Engliſh ſubjects. It is ſtrange therefore, that what was done, with reſpect to the article of the teas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould be the occaſion of exciting miniſterial wrath to ſuch an amazing height: Eſpecially, as it was owing, if faulty, to an error in judgment, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013197_0020_0F9045E082C30FD0"/>
of diſpoſition: It is more ſtrange that this conduct ſhould be conſidered as a general obſtruction to commerce, and to the collection of payable cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, when neither the one nor the other, as to other articles, were in the leaſt affected thereby: It is more ſtrange ſtill, that Boſton only ſhould be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of reſentment, when New-York, and Philadelphia, were chargeable with the like, but greater fault, proceeding from one and the ſame principle: It is moſt of all ſtrange, that Boſton, had it been the only faulty town, and deſerving of puniſhment, ſhould have it inflicted with cruelty unmixed with mercy, and ſo as to make no diſtinction between one and another; but involving all in one common ſtate of diſtreſs, greater in degree and extent than Scotland, or any of it's towns, were obliged to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, though commotions were fomented and raiſed there, within the memory of thouſands now living, and with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed deſign to dethrone King George the ſecond, and to place the crown of England on the head of a Popiſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013197_0021_0F9045E142DF9498"/>
Does this look like juſtice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially executed? May it not be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably thought, that other ends might be in view beſides that of puniſhment, upon the foot of juſt deſert? Nor would it exceed the view even of an American underſtanding to conceive what theſe other ends might be.</p>
            <p>I BELIEVE, ſir, a ſufficiency has been ſaid, if not to give you an adequately full idea of the ſufferings of poor Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, yet ſuch a conception of them as will excite your wonder, and heighten your feelings of compaſſion towards us. <note n="*" place="bottom">Since penning the above, there has been bro't into event, of which we had not the leaſt imagination, and which I cannot reſtrain myſelf from mentioning to you. It is this. Our veſſels with wood, which, by the Boſton port-bill, are obliged to put in at Marble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, to be enabled by the cuſtom-houſe at Salem to proceed to Boſton harbor, are denied this privilege, till the wood that is in them has been taken out, and then put in again, which occaſions not only expenſive labor, but tedious delay; as there are few landing pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Marblehead, and conſiderable number of veſſels in the harbor there at the ſame time, which muſt wait till they have opportunity to unload, and then load again. The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of theſe veſſels to Boſton is hereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lengthened, and they are ſometimes detained longer than they need have been, by being expoſed to contrary winds. Beſides all which, theſe ſame veſſels, when they are come to Boſton, are not ſuffered to depart from thence, till the owner's of them, or others in their behalf, have travelled to Plymouth, which is more than forty miles, and have viſited the Boſton cuſtom-houſe, which is now removed there. Theſe obſtructions have increaſed the price of fewel nearly one third part, which muſt be cruelly deſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the people here, in their preſent circumſtances. The ſame may be ſaid of our proviſion-veſſels. They muſt all go to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blehead; and then they are obliged to be unloaded and then loaded, before they can be permitted to come to Boſton; nor can they go out of that harbor, without a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Plymouth, more then forty miles diſtant. Whether this extraordinary bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, upon articles without which we cannot live, is to be aſcribed to the late parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act, or the commiſſioners, who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide at Salem, you may eaſily ſatisfy yourſelf by only reading the act itſelf. It is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral opinion, that theſe commiſſioners, had they the feelings of humanity, would not have put a conſtruction upon the port bill, ſo far exceeding in rigor what it will bear in conſiſtency with common ſenſe. But what may not be expected from men, who, ever ſince they have been in office, have done all in their power to render themſelves odious to the people, and leſs ſerviceable to his Majeſty, than they might otherwiſe have been.</note> But I will not enlarge, leaſt your
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013197_0022_0F9045E204753C40"/>
wrath ſhould be provoked, and ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment enkindled in you, as could not eaſily be kept under due reſtraint.</p>
            <p>INSTEAD, of this, I will endeavor to calm your paſſions, and mitigate your ſenſations of pain on our account, by ſhowing you, wherein this parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary act, however unintended by the contrivers of it, is powerfully adapted to promote the intereſt of all the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican colonies, and of even Boſton it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:013197_0023_0F9045E364548980"/>THE deſign of the Britiſh admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, with reſpect, not only to this town and province, but all the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies on the continent, is ſo obviouſly viſible by this act of parliament, that no one can eaſily be at a loſs to know, that it is to oblige America, by the iron hand of power, to ſubmit to ſovereign pleaſure. This is accordingly the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſentiment of all ranks, orders, and conditions of men from one end of the continent to the other. Even thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013197_0024_0F9045E38B65FFD0"/>
who have been diſtinguiſhed by being called the friends of government, are now fully ſatisfied, that the plan to be carried into execution, and by forcible meaſures, is, intire obedience to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of deſpotiſm, inſtead of thoſe conſtitutional laws we are perfectly willing to be governed by. It may reaſonably be eſteemed an advantage, and a very important one, to be thus indiſputably let into the knowledge of this; as, by knowing that forcing from us our rights and privileges as Engliſh ſubjects, is the grand point in view, we ſhall naturally be urged on to contrive expedients to prevent, if poſſible, our being in this way, brought into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: Or, ſhould no expedients be effectual to this end, power being on the ſide of oppreſſion, we may ſolace ourſelves with the thought, that we acted like men, and will reſolutely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor, under the influence of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, to prepare our minds to bear, in the eaſieſt manner, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all outward evils, ſubjection to arbitrary pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:013197_0025_0F9045E459507418"/>THIS act, though more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relative to Boſton, and the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſett's-province, is an alarm to all the North American colonies; loudly ſounding it in their ears, that they may ſurely expect, each one in their turn, as occaſion offers, like treatment with that we have met with. For the deſign intended to be carried into effect, is not confined to a ſingle town, or province, but extends to the whole American continent. What has been done, with reſpect to Boſton, and the province to which it belongs, is the beginning only of ſorrow, unleſs prevented in one pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent way or another, and an example held out, in terrorem, to the other colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And ſhould Boſton, and the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts's-province, be brought into a ſtate of ſlavery by the hand of power, every other town and colony on the continent would unavoidably, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, be placed in like circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This is the voice of the late par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary proceedure, and as evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo as if promulged in the moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013197_0026_0F9045EA6D081F38"/>
articulated words. And this, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the accounts we have received, is the interpretation the colonies put upon it. They eſteem themſelves as truly, though not ſo immediately, ſtruck at, as either Boſton, or the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſett's-province. For, as they juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve, the cauſe in which we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer is a common one, their's as well as our's; and whatever our fate is, the ſame will be their's alſo. If now the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican colonies ſhould be influenced, by this amazingly cruel act, to unite as one is projecting, and carrying into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, expedients reaſonable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and wiſely adapted to ſecure the enjoyments of their rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and to promote, at the ſame time, harmony and love between Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and America, it would moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be for the common intereſt of all, yea, even of Boſton, that this ſhocking decree has been iſſued forth, though their ſufferings, by reaſon of it, will be awfully ſevere. And it is, I may add here, unqueſtionably true, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013197_0027_0F9045EE02B60BC8"/>
will, by means of this parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary conduct, be more firmly unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than ever; yea, that they will all act in concert, as if they were one, in exerting themſelves in all wiſe and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ways to fruſtrate the deſigns of thoſe who would rule them with a rod of iron, inſtead of the laws of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional government. Many here, as well as at home, would not ſuppoſe it poſſible there ſhould be ſuch an union of the colonies; but this is now made to appear by their choice of deputies to meet in congreſs to conſult meaſures for the common good of them all, and particularly for the relief of Boſton, as it is now ſuffering, not for it's own ſake only, but for their's alſo.</p>
            <p>AS the port of Boſton has been the principal inlet in this part of America, to that inundation of Britiſh goods, which have occaſioned the ſpreading of extravagances, beyond deſcription in every kind, not only through this town, but the whole province, it might
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013197_0028_0F9045EEDCFC9010"/>
be the deſign of Heaven, though not thought of by men, to teſtify againſt the ineffable folly of all ſorts of perſons, whether of higher or lower rank, in parting with the fruits of their labor, or the income of their eſtates, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported articles, which are of no ſervice unleſs to gratify pride, and ſooth a vain mind; and to give, at the ſame time, this folly of their's a ſolemn check. which, if not reſtrained, will be the ruin of the country. It would argue wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in people, and powerfully tend to promote their INTEREST, if they would look upon themſelves as NOW taught in providence, and loudly called upon, to refrain from purchaſing that merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, which ſwallows up their ſubſtance for the paultry conſideration only of appearing in finery of dreſs which ill becomes them. A non-conſumption of Engliſh goods, in thoſe articles wherein they may do as well without, as with them, to every purpoſe excepting that of ornamental vanity, would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controverſy, be highly beneficial,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013197_0029_0F9045F04E5B3B60"/>
not only to this town and province, but to all the towns in all the colonies; and it might happily tend to bring us relief in this day of darkneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. It would be no wonder, if ſome importers from England, whoſe views are ſolely confined to ſelf, ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt ſuch a meaſure, and exert themſelves to the utmoſt to prevent it's taking place; as their gain might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be leſſened. This is no other than may be expected of thoſe in trade; whoſe contracted minds reſtrains them from all public generoſity. But is it not better that theſe individuals ſhould ſuffer, than that this ſhould be the caſe of the whole country, who, by means of what they import, are influenced, by a kind of faſcination, to part with their earnings to their great hurt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of profit. It is readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that trade, wiſely conducted, is the ſureſt method to enrich and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize a people; but it is a great miſtake to imagine, that it will, carried on in any way, be productive of this
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013197_0030_0F9045F1087AB720"/>
effect. And it may be laid down as an indubitable truth, that trade, inſtead of promoting this good, will powerfully tend to do miſchief to a people, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſuch, however it may ſerve ſome individuals, if it is ſo managed, as that, upon the whole, they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed by means of it. This, for a courſe of years, has been the reſult of our trade as carried on with Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Such have been the needleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from thence, and ſuch the folly of people in their extravagant uſe of them, that a very great part of the fruit of our labor and toil, and of our trade to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts, has been remitted home for that which has been rather ruinous, than profitable to us! It may, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggeration, be ſaid, that ſome millions a year ſterling have been ſent from the colonies to England, in return for goods imported from thence, which we did not want, and which could not, in any wiſe view, be conſidered as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motive of benefit to us. Need the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now be told, that it would be for
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013197_0031_0F9045F1B8F0D7E0"/>
their intereſt, unſpeakably ſo, to put theſe millions ſterling into their own pockets which are annually ſent home in payment for what they might as well, yea much better, have done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? They muſt be under a degree of infatuation not to ſee this to be the height of folly, even to madneſs. Let the importers of a monſtrous ſuperfluity of Engliſh goods turn the courſe of their trade, at leaſt ſo manage it as may ſerve the public, and not themſelves only, and they will then merit both honor and encouragement: But they will have no juſt reaſon for complaint, if they are eſteemed poor mercenary wretches, while, for their own private gain, they are vehemently clamorous in oppoſing all reaſonable methods ſo far to put a ſtop to Engliſh imports, as they are certainly hurtful to the country, and in an high degree. Our preſent circumſtances loudly call for this, and that which will naturally follow upon it, a retrenchment of our unparralleled extravagance. And ſhould the colonies
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013197_0032_0F9045F285B4BD38"/>
take occaſion from what has been done to Boſton (a ſtriking ſpecimen of what they may expect will be done to them, at one time or other) to live more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, and to conſume no Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh goods, but what their convenience, I will not ſay neceſſity, calls for, we ſhould probably ſoon find an end put to the grievances we have long complained of, but ſtill lie groaning under. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the people in England would feel it diſadvantageous to them, ſhould the people in America agree upon a non-conſumption of Britiſh goods, within ſuch limits as a due regard to their own intereſt makes neceſſary; but they could not reaſonably find fault with ſuch a meaſure, and, inſtead if doing ſo, they might co-operate with us, in endeavoring the reſtoration, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſecure enjoyment, of thoſe civil rights and privileges we have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of, by the hand of power. And ſhould we, by their interpoſed aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, be placed in theſe happy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſuch would be our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013197_0033_0F9045F354A42A18"/>
towards them, as that we ſhould chearfully forego our own advantage in trade, ſo far as might in reaſon be expected, in order to promote their's. Be this as it may, by ſuch a meaſure, carried into execution, we ſhould na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be put upon greater frugality than we have commonly been uſed to, a more enlarged cultivation of our lands and the ſetting up manufactures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ourſelves in every kind, wherein they may be ſerviceable to us; the effect whereof would be the retaining monies in our own purſes, which would be more than an hundred-fold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for what is unconſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wreſted from us; at leaſt we ſhould have that within ourſelves, which would enable us to wait without ſtrife and contention, till the almighty righteous ruler of the world ſhall work out ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us; which we firmly believe he will, in one way or another, ſooner or later.</p>
