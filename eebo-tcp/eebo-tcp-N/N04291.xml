            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>ERY dear Friends and Brethren! You may remember that the Builders of the Wall of Jeruſalem, after the Babylonian Captivity, were obliged becauſe of Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to carry a Sword in one Hand to protect, as well as a Trowel in the other to build; and thus muſt Zion's Builders do, now in this Time of Oppoſition, and Temptation. We are told in the Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 33. that if the Watchman ſees the Sword coming on a Land, blows the Trumpet, and warns the People, however inſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful his Labours may prove to ſome, he will nevertheleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his own Soul: But that if he does not give ſeaſonable Warning, the Blood of thoſe that periſh will be required at the Watchman's Hand.</p>
                  <p>My dear Friends! to prevent unreaſonable Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Performance, becauſe of my oppoſing ſome Perſons in it, who make a fair Shew in the Fleſh, I may obſerve and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005299_0009_1016F6EA8C0D6B30"/>
aſſure you, that Conſcience inform'd by the Word of God, conſtrain'd me to do what I have done, in detecting and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the erronious Notions, of a pernicious new Sect of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, called <hi>Moravian Brethren,</hi> or <hi>Hezenhouters,</hi> who have lately come from <hi>Germany</hi> into this Country. Love to God, and his dear and precious Truths, which are ſecretly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by the extraordinary ſly concealing Arts of the <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians,</hi> obliges me to ſpeak out expreſly, in order, as far as it ſhall pleaſe the God of Truth to bleſs the ſame, to give Check to the Spread of that Plague of Leproſy.</p>
                  <p>I ſtand here in this Deſk in the Name of the great and dreadful God, and in the Room of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to ſound the Alarm-Trumpet, and give fair Warning to this dear Flock in particular, and to the Inhabitants of the Land in general; by informing and aſſuring them, that a Spirit of Error and Deluſion is gone forth to deceive the World. <hi>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear.</hi> I freely venture my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and am ready, God aſſiſting, to ſacrifice my Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and my Life, in Defence of the bleſſed Truths of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and in detecting the Erronious.</p>
                  <p>If any out of a childiſh Credulity, or peeviſh Obſtinacy, will not take the Warning given; my Soul ſhall weep in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Places for their Pride!</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſtand as an unconcern'd Spectator, to behold the <hi>Moravian</hi> Tragedy; my Heart bleeds within me to ſee the precious Truths of Chriſt oppoſed, ſlighted and trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foot, by our new Reformers; and that under a Pretext of extraordinary Sanctity, Love and Meekneſs! <hi>My Soul, come not into their Secret; unto their Aſſembly, mine Honour, be thou not united!</hi> It is enough to make a Heart of Iron bleed, to ſee <hi>Foxes,</hi> little Foxes, ſlily creeping into God's Vineyard, and ſpoiling the <hi>Vines,</hi> and tender Grapes, i. e. young Chriſtians, with Enthuſiaſm, Pride, Error, and Nonſenſe!</p>
                  <p>But I haſten to conſider the Words of our Text, which is an important Counſel, given by our Lord to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> to reflect upon and call to Mind, the Truths they had formerly heard, as well as the affectionate Diſpoſitions with which they heard them; and that they would uſe all proper Means to preſerve and retain them; a Counſel very
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005299_0010_1016F6EC10DC3538"/>
proper for the perilous Times in which we live. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection our Lord gave in Reſpect of hearing the Word elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ſtrengthens in my Opinion the aforeſaid Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in one Place he ſays, <hi>Take heed what ye hear,</hi> and in another, <hi>Take heed how ye hear;</hi> and indeed in the Nature of Things the Manner of doing a Duty, ſuppoſes the Matter without which it cannot exiſt.</p>
                  <p>In diſcourſing upon this Subject, I ſhall endeavour to ſpeak to the following Heads.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. <hi>Shew what Truths we ſhould more particularly remember and hold faſt.</hi>
                     </item>

                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And then improve the whole.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. One Head of Diſcourſe, is to ſhow, <hi>What Truths we ſhould more particularly remember and hold faſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To what I would offer under this Head more directly, I would beg Leave to premiſe a few Words, concerning the Nature and Kinds of Truth. Here I may obſerve that Truth in it's general Nature, conſiſts in Agreement, and is threefold, viz. metaphiſical, logical, and ethical; the firſt is the Agreement between the Appearance of a Thing, and the Thing itſelf repreſented by it; the ſecond conſiſts in the Agreement, between the Mind and the Thing it conceives of; i. e. when the Mind conceives of any Thing, really as it is; the third conſiſts in an Agreement between our Words and Minds; i. e. when we ſpeak what we think; the firſt Truth is oppoſed to Paint and Varniſh, the ſecond to Error and Falſhood, and the third to Lying; which conſiſts in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Mind.</p>
                  <p>Now my dear Brethren! There are theſe Truths follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more eſpecially, which ye ſhould hold faſt to the Death; namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Doctrine of CONVICTION by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whereby the Sinner is made ſenſible of his <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Miſery,</hi> before he obtain <hi>converting Grace;</hi> if we let this precious Truth go with the <hi>Moravians;</hi> or in Compliance to a noted Perſon among them, (who aſſerted in <hi>New-Brunſwick,</hi> that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005299_0011_1016F6ED95E6AC98"/>
Conviction is not neceſſary to Converſion, but hurtful; and that the Preſbyterian Doctrine, reſpecting preaching of the Law is falſe) I ſay if we drop the Doctrine of Conviction; I ſee no Ground of Hope, that ever a ſecure World will be alarm'd. And truly thoſe ſuppos'd Converſions, which are not preceeded by a Work of the Law, are either in general, ſtrong Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Fancy and Affections, mov'd in a natural Way, as in Tragedies; or the common Workings of the Spirit as in time Believers, and ſtony Ground Hearers, or a Deluſion of Satan!</p>
                  <p>Does not Scripture and Reaſon hold forth the aforeſaid precious Truth; our Lord promis'd the Spirit to convince Men of Sin, of Righteouſneſs and Judgment, <hi>John</hi> 16.8, 9. He invites the Weary and Heavy-laden to come to him, and promiſes them Reſt, upon their ſo doing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. He farther informs us, that he came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance. That the whole need no Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, but the Sick. Was not the Prodigal made to ſee firſt that he was periſhing, before he came to his Father? <hi>Luke</hi> 15. Have we not three thouſand Examples of this at one View? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. I might add the Example of the Jaylor, who ſaid trembling, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Acts 16. and of <hi>Paul,</hi> who being convinced in his Way to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord what would thou have me to do?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the Law is the uſual Mean of Conviction, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from theſe following Places of Scripture, Rom. 8.15. <hi>For ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> Obſerve here, that theſe Gentile Chriſtians of the Roman Nation, had the Spirit of Bondage firſt; and whence had they this, by the Preaching of the Goſpel? no ſurely, but of the Law. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, that by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. and that before the Law came he was alive, (i. e. in his own Apprehenſion) but when the Law came, Sin revived and he died, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. i. e. when the Law was bro't powerfully home to his Heart by the Holy Ghoſt, he ſaw his dead State; this is further confirmed, Gal. 2.19. <hi>For I thro' the Law am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God;</hi> i. e. I thro' the Law, as an Inſtrument apply'd, am dead
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005299_0012_1016F6F05EFD3A40"/>
to the Law conſidered as a Covenant of Works; or dead to all Dependance upon Law-Righteouſneſs for Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle propoſeth this Queſtion, Gal. 3.19. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then ſerveth the Law?</hi> he anſwereth, <hi>that it was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions;</hi> i. e. it was added as an Appendix to the Covenant of Grace, to convince Men of their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. Hence the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 5.20. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Law entered that the Offence might abound;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Caſe is really ſo, the Law as a Sword muſt enter our Conſciences, before Sin will abound in our Apprehenſion ſenſibly: <hi>Is the Law then againſt the Promiſe,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 3.21.) <hi>God forbid.</hi> No the Law is good, if it be uſed lawfully, if it be preached not as a Covenant of Works for Juſtification; but as a Mean to convince Sinners of their Guilt and Miſery, their Inability to fulfil it, and ſo of their abſolute Need of Chriſt, and the Mercies of the New Covenant thro' him. And thus inſtead of oppoſing Chriſt and the Covenant of Grace, it is the moſt effectual Mean of promoting our Eſteem of and Complyance with both. <hi>The Law was our School-Maſter to bring us to Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3.24. And that altho' Believers are now under a milder Diſpenſation, of the Goſpel, than the Jewiſh Church was; being freed from the Yoke of the ceremonial Law entirely, and from the frequent and terrible Inculcations of the moral. Hence is that of the Apoſtle, Heb. 12.18. <hi>We are not come to the Mount that might be touched, and that burned with Fire. — But to Mount Zion the City of the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Goſpel Church being come to her full Age, is treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch, and hath more Knowledge of her Priviledges than the Jewiſh, who was but in an infant State; yet Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are in the ſame Condition now as then. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>John</hi> 3.36.</p>
                  <p>It would be no Priviledge, but a great Loſs to the Goſpel Church, to be depriv'd of this twofold Uſe of the Law; namely, to convince Sinners &amp; direct Saints. <hi>Do we make void the Law by Faith,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle; <hi>nay we eſtabliſh the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reaſon it ſelf will inſtruct us, that until poor Souls be alarmed out of the deep Sleep of Sin, they are not diſpoſed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005299_0013_1016F6F327F510A0"/>
to value Mercy thro' Chriſt much, nor to deſire after it, and labour for it, with due Earneſtneſs and Importunity: And until they feel a Work of the Law diſcovering and humbling of them, they are neither diſpoſed to bow before a ſover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> God, nor to give him the Glory of his Grace, both which are neceſſary Duties. To talk of uſing the Goſpel as the only or principal Mean of the Conviction of Sinners, is very ignorant and fooliſh, and ſhews little Knowledge of divine Things; it's juſt like putting the Plow before the Oxen. To offer a Remedy before the Diſeaſe and Danger is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is but to pleaſe and deceive a wicked World, and make them ſleep the faſter in their dangerous Security! Does not the Experience of good Men, confirm this Truth of Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Methinks dear Brethren! we ſhould be willing to part with the laſt Drop of Blood out of our Veins, before we part with it, <hi>Remember therefore how thou haſt heard and hold faſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ye have heard FAITH explained, as <hi>conſiſting (prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally) in our receiving Chriſt Jeſus, in all his Offices,</hi> and <hi>upon his own Terms;</hi> namely, thoſe of taking up the Croſs, Self-denial, and following of him, and that with Humility, Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, Readineſs, and Reſolution. This the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures expreſly aſſert, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. Hold faſt this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Truth, my dear Brethren! againſt the pernicious Doctrine of the Moravians; who hold that Faith conſiſts in a Perſwaſion that our Sins are pardoned, and that Chriſt died for us; this Notion wants a ſcriptural Foundation, and is contrary to Reaſon. Aſſurance is a Fruit of Faith, and therefore it's diſtinct from its Nature, and ſo ſeparable: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.13. that the Epheſian Chriſtians were ſealed with the Holy Spirit of Promiſe, after they believed. Here you may ſee that they had Faith before they attained to the comfortable Knowledge of it: The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> alſo ſpeaks to the ſame Purpoſe, 1 John 5.13. <hi>Theſe Things have I written unto you, that believe on the Name of the Son of God, that ye may know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ye have eternal Life.</hi> It is alſo evident from the Nature of Things, that a Thing muſt be before it be known to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005299_0014_1016F6F7274B7A90"/>If the Eſſence of Faith conſiſted in the aforeſaid Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then the Loſs thereof would deſtroy the very Being of Faith, and ſo prove a falſe and perverſe Doctrine to be true, namely the falling away of the Saints. For we find according to the holy Scriptures, that the Saints of God are expoſed to long Deſertions, diſtreſſing Doubts and Fears, yea to Deſpair itſelf. Iſa. 50.10. <hi>Who is among you, that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the Voice of his Servant? and walketh in Darkneſs, and ſeeth no Light, let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay himſelf upon his God.</hi> See alſo the diſtreſſing Caſe of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. he refuſed to be comforted, remember'd God and was troubled.— his Spirit was overwhelmed. And of <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88. <hi>I am as a Man that hath no Strength, like the ſlain that lie in the Grave, whom thou remembreſt no more; thou haſt laid me in the loweſt Pit, in Darkneſs, in the Deeps, thy Wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou haſt afflicted me with all thy Waves.</hi> I hope you will not reject theſe Proofs, becauſe they are produced out of the Old Teſtament, after the Example of the Moravians. Truly if the Old Teſtament be rejected, I can ſee no ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the New ſhould be received; for the latter is but a Fulfilment of the former, and a Superſtructure built upon that Foundation; and if the Foundation is overſet, the whole Fabrick is ruined. But to return,</p>
                  <p>If the Nature of Faith conſiſts in the aforeſaid Perſwaſion, then upon the Suppoſition that univerſal Redemption is a falſe Doctrine, (which I ſhall afterwards prove) and that it is every Man's Duty to believe; it will follow according to this Scheme, that ſome are obliged by the Command of God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo, that Chriſt has died for them, when the Caſe is not ſo.</p>
                  <p>If there be ſuch a Thing as Preſumption, namely, a believing that our Sins are forgiven, when they are not forgiven, (which I ſhall afterwards prove) and that this Preſumption is ſinful, then according to the Moravian Notion of Faith, (which is the ſame with the Antinomians) God himſelf has obliged natural Men by his own Precept, to commit Iniquity, which is a monſtrous Blaſphemy! In ſhort this Antinomian Moravian Faith, looks more like a ſtrong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005299_0015_1016F6FB72EF5268"/>
than the Faith of God's Elect. In the Parable of the Sower, our Lord informs us, that ſome Seed fell upon ſtony Places, and forthwith it ſprung up, becauſe it had no Deepneſs of Earth; and in his Explication thereof, he ſaith, but he that received the Seed into ſtony Places, the ſame is he that heareth the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it, yet he hath not Root in himſelf. (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.) but the good Ground is ſaid to bring forth Fruit with Patience. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.15. The poor Man that believ'd in the Goſpel, cry'd with Tears, <hi>Lord I believe, help my Unbelief.</hi> Our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his Diſciples ſharply for the Weakneſs of their Faith, for their Slowneſs to believe, Luk. 24.25. <hi>Then he ſaid unto them, O Fools and ſlow of Heart to believe!</hi> True Faith is certainly oppoſed by our corrupt Nature, and by Satan. Hence we are bid to fight the Fight of Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. and ſaid to wreſtle with Principalities and Powers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. True Faith grows from ſmall Beginnings to greater Strength; hence the Faith of the Theſſalonians is ſaid to grow exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. What then can we reaſonably ſuppoſe that Faith to be, which has no humbling Preparatives, no after Conflicts and Troubles, and conſiſts not in a receiving of Chriſt, or entire reſting upon him for Salvation? What is it but a ſorry Muſhroom of a Night's Growth, unworthy of the Name of Faith.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, I will not pretend to limit Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; the great Lord of the Univerſe may in his abſolute Sovereignty, poſſibly in ſome few Inſtances vouchſafe his Grace in an extraordinary Manner; but the general Courſe of his Proceedings, if we believe the Scriptures is agreable to the aforeſaid Repreſentation. Poſſibly ſome few Perſons have a full Aſſurance at their firſt Cloſure with Chriſt; but that this is not general, is evident from what has been already offered.</p>
                  <p>If it be urged in Favour of the Moravians, That if the aforeſaid Notion of Faith be a Miſtake, it is but what many of great Note, among the firſt Reformers maintain'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Suppoſing it were ſo, it would not alter the Nature of Error, becauſe ſome good Men were guilty of it. We are to follow the beſt of Men, no farther than they follow Chriſt;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005299_0016_1016F6FD0B2E2EC0"/>
will it excuſe the horrible Crimes of Murder and Adultery, becauſe <hi>David</hi> was guilty of them?</p>
                  <p>But the Truth is, I know of none of the Divines properly call'd reformed, who have maintain'd upon the Moravian Plan, that Faith conſiſts in a Perſwaſion that Chriſt died for us. If any of them have profeſſed that Aſſurance was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Nature of Faith, yet it ought to be conſidered that they did not at the ſame Time hold univerſal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which much alters the Caſe, for when a Perſon believes that Chriſt died for every one, it muſt needs be very eaſy and natural to believe, that he died for him; for the Latter is neceſſarily included in the Former: But it is not ſo eaſy to believe that Chriſt died for us upon the Scheme of particular Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Beſides ſome of the reformed Divines who have given into the aforeſaid Notion of Aſſurance, have diſtinguiſh'd it into different Degrees, and thereby ſignify'd that it was not their Opinion, that all who believed had the higheſt Degree of Aſſurance, which ſeems to be the Moravian Notion.</p>
                  <p>Not to ſay that it is more excuſable that ſome in the Dawn of the Reformation, thro' the Heat of Debate with the Papiſts, (who believe that Aſſurance is not attainable) ſhould be drawn into another Extream, than that ſo long after the Light of the Reformation had ſhone, in its meridian Glory, a new Sect who profeſs a ſingular Sanctity ſhould embrace the aforeſaid pernicious Error; which tends ſo much to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs many of the poor Saints of God, without juſt Cauſe, who ought to be comforted, and ſo to embarreſs their Way to their Father's Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>If it be again objected, That to ſay that Aſſurance is not included in the Nature of Faith, or neceſſarily annexed to it, is to encourage Preſumers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, by no Means! For tho' a Perſon may have true Faith, and not know that he hath it, yet he muſt needs know the Actings of his own Soul. Ordinarily he can remember that he has been made ſenſible of his total Want of Faith, <hi>John</hi> 16.8, 9. his Inability to believe, as well as the Oppoſition made againſt his Faith; his affecting Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt's All-ſufficiency and Willin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neſs to ſave; and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005299_0017_1016F6CDDFEB18C8"/>
his Dependance upon Chriſt's Righteouſneſs alone for Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, under a Senſe of the Inſufficiency of his own. He muſt alſo be ſenſible of ſome Change wrought upon his Will, Affections, and Practice; tho' he may queſtion whether they be of a ſaving Kind.</p>
                  <p>Now if a Perſon imagines that he hath Faith, and has not found the aforeſaid Experiences, he deceiveth himſelf. Such Perſons as do reſt ſecurely upon this Ground, viz. That Perſons may have Faith and not know it, and neither preſs after Aſſurance, nor bewail the Want of it, and are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Experience of a Work of the Law and Goſpel upon their Hearts, are miſerable Hypocrites!</p>
                  <p>I think that the Command of God to examine ourſelves, and make our Calling and Election ſure, plainly ſuppoſes the Uncertainty of our Knowledge about them, before the Uſe of theſe Means.</p>
                  <p>My dear Brethren! Let us hold faſt this precious Truth, againſt all Oppoſition whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Ye have heard, that FAITH <hi>is the</hi> MEANS <hi>of</hi> JUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIFICATION, and <hi>of abſolute</hi> NECESSITY <hi>to eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Theſe Things, the Scriptures of Truth fully aſſert, Rom. 3.28. <hi>Therefore we conclude that a Man is juſtified by Faith without the Deeds of the Law;</hi> and Mark 16.16. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Let us hold faſt theſe important Truths, my dear Brethren! againſt the perilous and pernicious Doctrines of the Antinomians and Moravians, namely, That thoſe who are juſtify'd, are juſtify'd from Eternity in the Sight of God, and actually from the Time of Chriſt's Death, and that Faith is not neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe that <hi>eternal</hi> Juſtification, is the <hi>proton pſeudos,</hi> the firſt and fertile Falſhood of all the Antinomian Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the fatal Fountain from which thoſe poiſonous Streams do flow, which diſhonour the Religion of Chriſt, contradict its grand Deſign (which is Holineſs,) and ſap its very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; I think it needful to offer a few Conſiderations, to overſet this Monſter of Impiety. And here let me obſerve, that the Doctrine of eternal Juſtification, contradicts the holy
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005299_0018_1016F70291EB5B48"/>
Scriptures, which inform us that we are juſtify'd by Faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28.</p>
                  <p>Now if we are juſtify'd from Eternity, we are juſtify'd before Faith, (for Faith is wrought in the Elect in Time, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.) and then muſt not thoſe Scriptures, according to this Plan be falſe, which aſſert our Juſtification by Faith? For is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible fairly to reconcile a Juſtification from Eternity, and a Juſtification in Time together, a Juſtification before Faith, and after Faith together? I ſee not how it can be done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Time and Eternity, before and after, be proved the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The ſacred Scriptures inform us, that all the Elect as well as others, are by Nature Children of Wrath, under the Curſe of the Law, under the Condemnation of the Goſpel, and guilty before God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. Now to ſay that thoſe were juſtified from Eternity, is to aſſert the greateſt and moſt irreconcilable Contradictions: it is in Effect to ſay, that the Elect are freed entirely from the Guilt of Sin, but are notwithſtanding under the full Weight of it; that they are curſed and bleſſed at the ſame Time; under Wrath, and Heirs of the Promiſe; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God and of the Devil at the ſame Inſtant; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and juſtified at once. Now can any living Man recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile thoſe contradictory Propoſitions, without overthrowing the Nature of Things, and blending Light with Darkneſs? Suppoſing this impoſſible Chimera to be true, viz. That a Man ſhould be in the aforeſaid contrary States at one Time, and bro't to the Confines of the Grave, where muſt his Soul go at its Exit? not to Heaven, for he is under the Curſe of the Law, the Condemnation of the Goſpel; not to Hell! for he is freed from the Guilt of Sin, and has a Title to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory; where muſt it go then, but to the feign'd Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Papiſts? Do not therefore wonder, that ſome of the Moravians, and Long-Beards, who are their Brethren (in Reſpect of their Spirit and main Principles) ſhould ſtumble into the ridiculous Notion of turning Hell it ſelf into a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, by believing that the Torments of the Damned there, are but for a certain Space of Time: However this Notion is ſo groſs and ſcandalous, that ſome of the Moravians are aſhamed to own it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005299_0019_1016F706F1CA0C48"/>This Fancy of turning Hell into a Purgatory, is worſe than the Notion of the Papiſts, becauſe they believe the Eternity of Hell Torments as to ſome. — It overſets one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Barriers againſt Vice and Incentives to Religion and Vertue, it tends to diſband the World, and open the Flood-Gates to all Immorality and Anarchy.</p>
                  <p>It is vain for the Patrons of the aforeſaid perilous Figment, to urge in Defence thereof, this Plea, that the original Word for Eternity, ſignifies but an Age, or ſome Ages, for the ſame Word is apply'd to God and to the Happineſs of the Bleſſed, and therefore they may from hence as juſtly argue, that the Happineſs of the Bleſſed, yea that the Being of God himſelf, ſhall laſt but for a few Ages, which is damnable Blaſphemy! In the 25th Chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> and laſt Verſe, the Happineſs of the Saved, and the Miſeries of the Damned are ſet in a direct Antitheſis or Oppoſition, and the ſame ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Word is apply'd to both; therefore they may as well conclude, that the Former will be temporary as the Latter.</p>
                  <p>It is notoriouſly derogatory to the Satisfaction of Chriſt, and to the infinite Juſtice of God provoked by Sin, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Creatures can make Atonement for it, and ſo pay the utmoſt F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſacred Scriptures repreſent Juſtification, as an Act, or Sentence paſſed in Time coming, therefore it cannot be from Eternity; ſee Gal. 3.8. <hi>The Scriptures foreſeeing that God would juſtify the Heathen thro' Faith, preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel unto Abraham.</hi> See, Faith muſt be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Heathens Juſtification, how then could they be juſtified from Eternity, was Faith preached from Eternity? Gal. 2.16. <hi>Even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 4.23, 24. <hi>Now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe in him.</hi> Iſa. 53.11. <hi>By his Knowledge ſhall my righteous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant juſtify many.</hi> Iſa. 45.2, 5. <hi>In the Lord all the Seed of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005299_0020_1016F708A4E9FB50"/>
Iſrael ſhall be juſtified.</hi> Rom. 3.30. <hi>Seeing it is one God, who ſhall juſtify the Circumciſion by Faith, and the Uncircumciſion thro' Faith.</hi> The Order in which our Juſtification is plac'd, is ſet in a ſtrong Light, Rom. 8.33. <hi>Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified, and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> obſerves, <q>That it is abſurd to place Vocation before Predeſtination, or Glorification before Juſtification; ſure then (ſays he) it muſt be abſurd alſo, to place Juſtification before Vocation; the one as well as the other, confounds and breaks the Scripture Order; you may as well ſay Men ſhall be glorified that were never juſtified, as ſay they may be juſtified before they believed or exiſted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>How irrational and unaccountable it is, to believe that any ſhould be juſtified from Eternity, will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a little the Nature of Juſtification; which is an actual freeing of Perſons from the Guilt of Sin, and giving them a Right to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Now how can any be freed from the Guilt of Sin from Eternity, unleſs we ſuppoſe them actually guilty of Sin from Eternity. But how can Creatures act, before they are, or exiſt? Every Creature is the Birth of Time, before he is conceiv'd in Time, he is ſubject to no Law; and where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion actual, and where there is no Tranſgreſſion either actual or virtual, there can be no Guilt; for that is an Obligation to endure Puniſhment for Sin, thro' the Force and Virtue of the Threatnings annexed to the Breach of the Law; and where there is neither Guilt, nor Sin, nor Puniſhment, there can be no Juſtification, which is a Freedom therefrom.</p>
                  <p>To ſay that the Elect are juſtify'd from Eternity, is in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ſay, that nothing ſinn'd from all Eternity, and that nothing was juſtify'd, which is abſurd! for the Elect before they exiſt are nothing in Reſpect of actual Sin.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, that what has been ſaid will oppoſe the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Actions paſt. It is a real or actual Change of the State, and reſpects a Sinner as actually ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. But can that which is not, be really and actually changed? Can a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be ungodly before he is at all in Being? Beſides I ſee not how this Difficulty can be removed that lies in the Way of eternal Juſtification, viz. It will ſuppoſe that the Sin of Mankind, and their Juſtification from it, bore an equal Date; both being eternal, for in Eternity there is no before or after. Now this is impoſſible in the Nature of Things, that actual Freedom from Sin, ſhould be parrallel in Duration with Sin itſelf, for the latter in the Order of Nature and Time goes before the former.</p>
                  <p>It is very ſhocking to conſider, what Diſhonour this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of eternal Juſtification, reflects upon our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and how it ſaps the very Foundations of his Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>It is a Branch of the Redeemer's Glory, that he has ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied divine Juſtice for his People's Sins, and paid their Debts by his Blood and Obedience. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18—21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. But according to the Plan of eternal Juſtification, there was no Sin to be ſatisfied for, no Debt to pay; for can it be ſuppoſed, that a Creature can ſin before Eternity, or that after he is juſtified from Sin, he is notwithſtanding in Debt by it to divine Juſtice? this would be a Juſtification, and no Juſtification! Well, if there be no Debt to pay, Chriſt's Satisfaction is deſtroyed; for it is hereby rendered needleſs and uſeleſs. And thus you ſee a Foundation Truth, namely the Satisfaction of Chriſt deſtroyed, by this Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Moravian Doctrine of eternal Juſtification! <hi>Luther</hi> juſtly obſerved reſpecting Juſtification, That it was the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of a ſtanding or falling Church; now when it is judged to be eternal, it is made null and void as has been obſerved.</p>
                  <p>If the Elect are juſtified from Eternity, then how can our Lord be ſaid to be their Saviour? ſeeing that according to this Scheme, they were never liable to Deſtruction. If it be ſaid, that the Elect were not juſtified till the Time of Chriſt's Death, then what became of thoſe that died before it? Could thoſe be ſaved who were not juſtified? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable and uncharitable muſt it be, to condemn to the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005299_0022_1016F70E36F07BD0"/>
Flames in Effect, all thoſe that died before the Coming of our Saviour?</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of eternal Juſtification renders Faith unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, (in an abſolute Senſe) for according to that, the Elect are juſtified before it. And by the ſame Argument it ſtrikes down the Foundations of Repentance, it repreſents Sin as a meer Trifle, not worthy of our Fear or Sorrow, by ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God is at Peace with thoſe that are under its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion! it takes away all Arguments of Terror, by which a ſecure World ſhould be alarmed, and opens deadly Avenues to all Manner of Licenciouſneſs; and thus it tears up by the Roots all natural and reveal'd Religion!</p>
                  <p>If it be objected that Chriſt was a publick Perſon, and therefore that what he did and ſuffered, is to be looked upon as done and ſuffered by thoſe he repreſented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As none are guilty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, tho' he was a publick Head of the Covenant of Works, till united to him by a Participation of the ſame Nature with him, ſo none are juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt the ſecond Adam, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til by Faith they receive it, and are thereby united to him.</p>
                  <p>It will not avail to ſay, that becauſe God's Nature and Love are unchangeable, that therefore the Elect were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from Eternity. <hi>A.</hi> It will not follow, tho' God is not changeable, we are, and there is a manifeſt Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God's Purpoſes and the Execution of them; the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Reaſoning would conclude the World and all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in it to be made from Eternity, becauſe there was a Purpoſe concerning their Production from Eternity. But this is falſe, therefore the other is ſo, which is built upon the ſame Plan of Reaſoning. As to what the Scriptures ſay concerning the everlaſting Love of God to his Elect, I think that uſual Diſtinction which is obſerved by ſound Divines, helps to remove the Difficulty, viz. That there is a Love of Benevolence, and Complacence, the former ſignifies the gracious Purpoſe of God towards his Elect, and the latter the Delight he takes in them when converted, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. it is only in the former Senſe the Lord is ſaid to love his Elect before their Converſion. Beſides it cannot be truly ſaid of God that there is any proper Paſſion in him. If any by the everlaſting
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005299_0023_1016F70FC1E26818"/>
Love of God to his Elect, imagine that the Guilt of Sin is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from them actually, before they exiſt or believe, which is the Point in Queſtion, they expreſly contradict both Scripture and Reaſon. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. Reaſon teaches that (non entis nulla ſunt accidentia) that which is not, cannot be either juſtified or condemned; where there is no Guilt it cannot be removed.</p>
                  <p>Not to add that to ſet forth God's Love, as in every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the ſame to thoſe who are under the Dominion of Sin, and to thoſe who are freed from it; is to croſs the Current of Scripture, which repreſents the bleſſed God as angry with Sinners, and pleaſed with his ſincere Servants thro' his Son. It alſo tends to make us look upon Sin as a very Trifle, which we need not be much concerned about any Way.</p>
                  <p>Behold my dear Brethren! what a diſmal Foundation is here laid for all Manner of Impiety, and that under the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Umb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe Paſſages of Scripture, viz. where Chriſt is ſaid to be the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World; and that God was reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. and that Chriſt has made Peace thro' the Blood of his Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9, 10. and that the Grace of God in Chriſt was given us before the World began; can conſiſtently with the Current of Scripture, the Analogy of Faith, and Dictates of right Reaſon, be ſuppoſed to mean no more than theſe Things following, namely, (1) That there was a gracious Purpoſe in God from Eternity, to vouchſafe Bleſſings on his People in Time. (2) That there was a ſufficient Foundation laid by the Sufferings and Obedience of Chriſt, for the actual Reconciliation of the Elect to God in Time. (3) That there was and is a Sufficiency of Grace treaſured up in Chriſt as Mediator, Head of his Church, and Fountain of Influence, to be communicated to the Elect upon their Cloſure with him. Which in ſome Places of Scripture is repreſented by the Time paſt, to ſhew the Certainty of the Event. For the ſame Reaſon the Coming of our Lord to Judgment is repreſented as preſent tho' it be future. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7.</p>

                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:005299_0024_1016F71418FB9970"/>If this Diſtinction be offered to paliate the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which I am oppoſing, namely that the Elect are juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified from Eternity as conſidered in Chriſt, but not as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves: I anſwer, that it is impoſſible to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile two contradictory Propoſitions, or to blend Light and Darkneſs together: the plain Engliſh of the aforeſaid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction is juſt this, that the Elect in different Reſpects, are in contrary States at one Time, at once they are both juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and condemned, this is in the Nature of Things impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for if they are juſtified they can't at the ſame Time be condemned, becauſe Juſtification is a Freedom from it: we may ſay with as great Reaſon that the Elect (as conſidered in the Decree) were effectually called, ſanctified, and ſaved from Eternity actually, which is falſe and abſurd, or that we our ſelves in the aforeſaid Reſpect, exiſted and acted from all Eternity, which you know is ridiculous!</p>
                  <p>If it be again objected, That Things to come are preſent with God, that one Day is with the Lord as a thouſand Years— therefore the Elect are juſtified from Eternity, in the Sight of God: I deny the Conſequence, for by this Way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning the World would have been actually made from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in the Sight of God; which is falſe. Jehovah who is all Eye, looks not on Things in a falſe Light. If it be reply'd, that the Elect had a Repreſentative from all Eternity, but the World had none, and therefore that the Caſe is different; to anſwer this I offer theſe two Things, (1.) That accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Antinomian Moravian Scheme of eternal Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was no need of a Repreſentative at all, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to pay. And (2.) As to the World, it had all the Repreſentative it was capable of, and there was any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for, namely the Decree of God, that Pattern in the Mount, according to which, this ſpacious and magnificent Structure was exactly form'd.</p>
                  <p>Again may we not ſay, that Things paſt are preſent with God, as well as Things to come. And hence may we not argue after the aforeſaid Manner thus, viz. That the World is ſtill a creating in the Sight of God, that the Flood now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it, that the Cities of the Plain, viz. <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> &amp;c. are now a Fire, that Iſrael is paſſing thro' the Red

Sea, fighting with <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and <hi>Sihon</hi> King of <hi>Heſhbon.</hi> What mad Work would it be to form our Prayers according to this Scheme, namely, to pray for the Protection of <hi>Adam</hi> in the Garden, of <hi>Noah</hi> in the Flood, of <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and of <hi>Iſrael</hi> among their Enemies? May we not conceive of a Debt's being fully paid by a Surety, and yet ſuch a Plan laid previous to it, that the Debtor ſhall have no actual Intereſt therein, or actual Benefit thereby, until he be enabled to come up to ſuch honourable Terms, as ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Senſe of the Benefit, and Gratitude to his Benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Ye have heard, that <hi>unconverted Perſons are under the</hi> LAW, and <hi>that the</hi> LAW <hi>is a Rule of Life to Believers.</hi> And does not the Scripture ſay ſo? Rom. 3.19. <hi>Whatſoever the Law ſays, it ſays to thoſe that are under the Law, that every Mouth might be ſtopped, and the whole World become guilty before God.</hi> Here obſerve, that ſome, yea that all are, while in a State of Nature, under the Law, and guilty before God. Take Notice that the Apoſtle ſpake theſe Words to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Gentiles, who enjoyed the Goſpel Diſpenſation; and does not the ſame Apoſtle tell the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Gal. 3.10. <hi>That every one is curſed, that continueth not in all Things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> But why ſhould the Apoſtle ſpeak of the Law at all to the Galatian Gentiles, if it belong'd to none but the Jews, as the Moravians dream?</p>
                  <p>Does not the Apoſtle pronounce Peace upon thoſe, who walk according to this Rule, and has not our Saviour aſſured us, that he came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it? Let us hold faſt this precious Truth, my dear Brethren! againſt the dangerous and deteſtable Doctrines of the Moravians, one of whom aſſerted in <hi>New-Brunſwick,</hi> that the unconverted Gentiles were not under the Law, and that the Law was not a Rule of Life to Believers. O my dear Brethren, do not theſe Notions tend to dreadful Security, and Licenciouſneſs? for if there be no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Notion the vileſt Wickedneſs would be no Sin, and ſo there would be no Cauſe of Sorrow for it. Seeing the moral Law is grounded upon the unalterable Natures, Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Reaſon of Things, and conſequently invariably

holy, juſt, and good; the Tranſcript of the moral Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the divine Nature; and thus the very Standard and Scale of Goodneſs, which is but a Conformity to the ſupream Being. It cannot therefore be changed. It muſt then be exceeding diſhonourable to the moſt high Jehovah, and wounding to the true Intereſts of his Kingdom, to ſpeak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minitively of his bleſſed Law! <hi>This, this,</hi> overſets the very Foundations of Religion, and rends in Pieces all the Barriers between Virtue and Vice, this leaves us without a Rule of Action, and ſo expoſes us as an eaſy Prey to the Wiles of enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Deluſion. And how can it with Reaſon be ſuppoſed, that natural Men ſhould be freed from the Law, as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, which they have broken, until they be made ſenſible hereof, and comply with the Terms of the new Covenant? Can a Perſon have any Intereſt in the Benefits of a conditional Contract, until he complys with the Terms or Condition, upon which a Right to the Benefits is ſuſpended? Although there be no proper Conditions in the Covenant of Grace, yet there are Terms, or Conditions improperly ſo called, which have a ſuſpending Virtue thus far, viz. that we have no Right to the Bleſſings of the new Covenant, till we are enabled to comply with them. Until Faith be formed in us, we are under Condemnation: it is true we have no Power to believe of our ſelves, neither is there any Merit in any Act of ours, to deſerve a Bleſſing: But God who is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Sovereign of the World, and Lord of his own Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, has been pleaſed to conſtitute this Method, for the Conveyance of his Benefits; which reflects Honour upon his Wiſdom. This repreſents the State of Sinners in ſuch a Dreſs of Terror, as has a Tendency to affect and alarm them, and ſo prepare them for the dear Redeemer. This opens the Aggravations of Sin, and in a Glaſs preſents to our View its malignant Nature and crimſon Aggravations, in a ſtrong and affecting Light; which nobly tends to raiſe our Indignation againſt it: And this points to an unerring Director of our Way, which is worthy of our Eſteem and Reverence, and moſt conſcientious Obſervance!</p>
                  <p>If any ſhould object, That ſome Paſſages of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ſeem to ſpeak ſlightly of the Law, it ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,

Where <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks ſeverely of the Law, it is only in Reſpect of the following Abuſe of it, namely, when Believers under Temptation and inward Diſtreſs, apply it to their Terror and Condemnation.

He died (as I have obſerved) for his Sheep, the Goats being excluded, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.32.— He died for his People, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. For his Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. For his Children, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3, 14, 15. For his Seed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10.

                  <p>To ſuppoſe that Chriſt died for every Man (Head for Head) is attended with many Abſurdities, particularly with theſe following.</p>
                  <p>According to the univerſal Scheme, our Lord muſt have died for thoſe that were actually damned before his Death, which is ridiculous!</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing theſe Univerſaliſts, whether <hi>Jeſuits, Socinians, Remonſtrants, Moravians,</hi> and all the Tribe of <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> who ſincerely hate the Doctrine of particular Redemption; I ſay, ſeeing they own that the greater Part of Mankind will be damned at laſt according to the Scriptures, which inform us, that <hi>ſtrait is the Gate and narrow the Way, which leads to Life, and few there be that find it;</hi> that Chriſt's Flock is a little, little Flock, a few Jewels, a Remnant, a few Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, upon the uppermoſt Bows, (comparatively conſidered) I ſay, ſeeing they own theſe Things, they are unavoidably led to this Dilemma, namely, either to invalidate the Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Chriſt's Satisfaction, or to charge God the Father with Injuſtice, in requiring a double Satisfaction for the ſame Offences; once by Chriſt on the Croſs, as their Surety and Repreſentative, and again of their own Perſons in Hell. I ſee not how it is poſſible, for any Univerſaliſt fairly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Difficulty. Beſides, it appears to me, that Free-will is neceſſarily implied in the Doctrine of univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; without this it cannot be held conſiſtently, as may appear thus;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:005299_0031_1016F727992178C0"/>If the Application of this ſuppoſed univerſal Redemption, be made only to ſome, and that not of Works done by the Creature, but by Way of abſolute Sovereignty and pure Grace, as the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> maintain according to the Scriptures; For <hi>it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy;</hi> Then to what Purpoſe does the Doctrine of univerſal Redemption ſignify, but to amuſe; for it turns to the ſame Iſſue, with particular Redemption upon this Plan; and allows no greater Priviledge to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the leaſt Degree, only it's not conſiſtent with itſelf, for it is a Redemption and no Redemption. If Redemption be ſuppoſed to extend farther than Election, and be of any avail to Mankind, then the turning Point muſt be the Free-will of the Creature, and not the Will or Grace of God. This the Jeſuits and Arminians are ſenſible of, and therefore maintain the Doctrine of Free-will, tho' falſely yet conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with their Scheme. Yet they try to cloak their foul Opinion with fair Language. For my own Part, I can't but ſuſpect the Moravians or ſome of them at leaſt, to be guilty here, viz. of holding the Doctrine of Free-will, tho' they do diſclaim it in Word, becauſe the Doctrine of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Redemption leads ſo directly to it.</p>
                  <p>But in what ſtrong Terms does the Word of God diſclaim all Pretence to a Free-will in Man, by aſſuring us that we are while in a State of Nature, dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. That we can neither do, nor will, nor think Good, as of our ſelves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. That none can come to Chriſt, except the Father draws them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. That <hi>God hath Mercy upon whom he will have Mercy. So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy.</hi> Rom. 9.15, 16.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt died for the whole human Race Head for Head, it may be aſked, whether God the Father and our Lord Redeemer intended, they ſhould be all ſaved yea or not? If he did not intend it, then to what Purpoſe is the Death of Chriſt, to all thoſe who were not deſigned for Salvation? does not this look like Mockery and Illuſion. But if it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that God did intend the Salvation of all the human Race by the Redeemer's Death; altho' but a few of them
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005299_0032_1016F7294E23E750"/>
attain the ſame; then will it not follow, that ſomething like either Ignorance, Weakneſs, and Changeableneſs, muſt be charged upon the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>If he intended the Salvation of all by the Redeemer's Death, and knew not in the mean Time, that the moſt would not attain it; then is not the Knowledge of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty finite and imperfect. Now the Knowledge of God is not like the Knowledge of Creatures, namely, ſomething diſtinct from the Faculty receiving, but his very Being, (for he is as the Schoolmen ſay juſtly, <hi>ſimplex actus,</hi> a ſimple Act) then is his Being finite and imperfect, and ſo by Conſequence he is no God.</p>
                  <p>But if God knew, when he is ſuppoſed to have deſigned the Salvation of all, that the moſt would never attain it, would not this be a great Weakneſs and Vanity, to intend a Thing which he knew would never come to paſs?</p>
                  <p>If the Lord intended the Salvation of all, muſt it not argue great Impotency, and Dependance on Creatures, to fail of compaſſing his Deſigns? Muſt not Jehovah upon this Plan, be almoſt as unhappy as any of his Creatures, becauſe of a continual Succeſſion of Diſappointments? And does it not ſuppoſe a Change in his Being, when he is ſuppoſed to will the Salvation of a Creature at one Time, and it's Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at another. For is not his Will himſelf or his Being? If the Almighty were compounded of different Things, as Creatures are, ſome Agent muſt exiſt before him, to make the Compoſition, and there might be a Diſſolution of it into it's conſtituent Parts. Now both theſe apply'd to the Deity are blaſphemous.</p>
                  <p>But does not the Scripture repreſent him, to be far from the Shadow of Change? And don't Reaſon teach us, that if he changes he muſt change for the better or worſe, or into an equal State to what he was before; but either Way he muſt be ſuppoſed imperfect, before or after the Change; and ſo no God: For the Idea of a God eſſentially includes in it, the higheſt Perfection.</p>
                  <p>How can it be, that Chriſt ſhould die for all, ſeeing the inſeperable Conſequences and Benefits of his Death do not belong to all? our Adverſaries themſelves being Judges.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005299_0033_1016F72C277A2BB0"/>
The Benefits I mean are ſuch as the Freedom from Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. Reconciliation to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. Effectual Calling, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. Remiſſion of Sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. Sanctification, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19. The Love of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, that in many Places of Scripture our Lord is ſaid to die for all. It may be replied,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) That our Lord is ſaid in no Place to die for all, and ſingular, which is the only Thing in Queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) This Note of Univerſality, <hi>all,</hi> frequently in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, excludes Diſtinction, but not Exception.

Others apply this Place to Chriſt, and offer this Gloſs upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt may be ſaid in ſome Senſe to buy even thoſe that periſh; in as much as they enjoy the Forbearance of God, and many other temporal and ſpiritual Benefits by the Death of Chriſt; by an earneſt Endeavour to improve which, they may have much Comfort in this World, much Sin may be prevented here, and their Miſeries leſſened in the next Life. Others put this Senſe upon the Place, that ſome did deny the Lord Chriſt, for whom in a Judgment of Charity he died.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> charges the following Abſurdity upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is inconſiſtent with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to believe to the ſaving of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection is grounded upon a falſe Notion of Faith, as tho' it conſiſted in a Belief, that Chriſt died for us in particular, which has before been confuted. All to whom the Goſpel comes, are obliged to believe in Chriſt, that is, to receive him by a living Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. and this being done, and not before, they are obliged hence, to conclude that Chriſt died for them. Some there be who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Doctrine of particular Redemption, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with preaching the Goſpel; which is called a Door of Hope, a Day of Grace; and that it is a meer mocking of Sinners to offer Salvation to them upon this Plan. I will
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005299_0037_1016F738A408EE08"/>
beg Leave to offer the Sum of Dr. <hi>Ridgeley</hi>'s Anſwer, "Here let it be conſidered, (ſaith he) by a Day of Grace,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p n="1">1. That we don't hereby intend, ſuch a Diſpenſation in which all Men might repent and believe, and ſo obtain Salvation by their own Power; this would be to aſcribe to Man, what is peculiar to God. Nor that God will give ſpecial Grace to all that ſit under the Goſpel. As for the Hope of the Goſpel, we cannot underſtand any Thing elſe thereby, but that all without Diſtinction are commanded and encouraged to wait on God, in his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Means of Grace, with a Peradventure that he will be gracious; this being the ordinary Way in which he works Grace. And if there be any Conviction of Sin, this gives farther Ground of Hope.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to preaching of the Goſpel, the Doctrine of particular Redemption, hinders not Chriſt's being offered to the Chief of Sinners: and the Proclamation of Grace being made publick, to all without Diſtinction. This will appear if we conſider what is done, when Chriſt is offered to Sinners, here let it be obſerved.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God has given us no Warrant to enter into his ſecret Determinations, reſpecting the Event of Things: or to give any Perſon Ground to conclude, that they are redeemed, and have a Warrant to apply to themſelves the Promiſe of Salvation, while in an unconverted Eſtate.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When Chriſt is ſaid to be offered to Sinners, in the Preaching of the Goſpel, that which is intended thereby is his being ſet forth therein, as a moſt deſirable Object, and that he will certainly ſave all whom he effectually calls, inaſmuch as he has purchaſed Salvation for them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It includes in it an informing of Sinners, that it is their indiſpenſible Duty and Intereſt to believe in Chriſt; and in Order thereto, that they are commanded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to wait on him, for that Grace which can ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them thereunto. And as a farther Encouragement to let them know, that there is a certain Connection between Grace and Salvation: So that none who are enabled to come to Chriſt by Faith, ſhall be rejected. This is the Preaching and Hope of the Goſpel, which is not in the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005299_0038_1016F73B67053A30"/>
leaſt inconſiſtent with particular Redemption.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Thus far he.</p>
                  <p>As to that Method of preaching the Goſpel, which ſome modern Enthuſiaſts are guilty of; namely uſing Means to cure and comfort, by ſpeaking much of Chriſt's Sufferings, and his Love, before they try to convince of Sin, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by the Law; it ſerves only to amuſe the Ignorant and Inconſiderate, and to prevent their Converſion to God, by the natural and childiſh Working of their Paſſions, moved by ſoft Expreſſions, which they are apt to depend upon in the Room of it. It is a daubing with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To aſſert univerſal Redemption, and then to tell us, that Faith conſiſts in a Belief that Chriſt died for us in particular, has as dreadful a Tendency to flatter and pleaſe a carnal World, to fix them in a miſerable Security, and to delude them to Damnation in Multitude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as almoſt any Scheme that has ever appeared on the Stage of the World. Every pious Boſom ſhould beat with burning Indignation againſt ſuch a horrid Scene!</p>
                  <p>As to the preceeding Objection, concerning the Day of Grace, the Door of Hope, and Offers of Salvation, as tho' they were inconſiſtent with particular Redemption; I ſhall beg Leave to offer one Particular more by Way of Retorſion, thus,— Is there not as great an apparent Inconſiſtency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the certain Fore-knowledge of God, and thoſe Things now mentioned, as in the Caſe of particular Redemption? If the Jeſuits, Arminians, Remonſtrants, and Moravians, do not acknowledge God's infinite and certain Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, do they not in Effect deny his Being, for is not his Being and Knowledge the ſame? But if they do own it, let them reconcile it with the Day of Grace, Offers of Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that will ſufficiently anſwer the aforeſaid Objection.</p>
                  <p>I may add to what has been before obſerved, this Particular, <hi>viz.</hi> That many of God's Children know the Falſhood of univerſal Redemption, by their own Experience; being at Times made ſenſible thro' the Operations of God's bleſſed

Spirit, of the tranſcendant Sweetneſs of diſtinguiſhing Grace! That which ſtirs up the Spleen and Rancour of many natural Men, (becauſe of their Blindneſs, Pride, and Selfiſhneſs,) <hi>viz.</hi> That God ſhould chuſe ſome and paſs by others, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports their Souls with humble Admiration, Love, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and in this they imitate their deareſt Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. O 'tis a doleful Spectacle to ſee any grow indifferent and lukewarm about this precious, precious Truth, which has been ſealed to their Souls by the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe of the fair Appearances of ſome ſtragling Strangers.</p>
                  <p>To talk of holding particular Election and univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption together, is Nonſenſe and Jargon. To reconcile them is as impoſſible, as to make a Rope of Sand. If this be the Moravian Simplicity, to believe Nonſenſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, may the good God deliver my Soul from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Myſteries. Remember therefore how ye have heard and received, my dear Brethren! and hold faſt this precious and valuable Truth of particular Redemption, againſt all falſe Apoſtles, and ſeducing Spirits, to the Death.</p>
                  <p>It is contrary to my intended Brevity, to ſpeak any longer upon this Head; any that would deſire to ſee this Subject more fully handled, let them read judicious Dr. <hi>Ridgeley</hi>'s Diſcourſe upon it, in his late Body of Divinity.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Sometimes this Word only ſignifies Sincerity; thus it is ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> that he was a perfect and upright Man: Here by the Figure <hi>Hendiadis,</hi> one Thing is expreſſed by two Words. This Kind of Perfection every good Man hath. Sometimes this Word ſignifies a Perfection of Degrees, i. e. when all Corruption is entirely rooted out of the Soul, and a Man is advanced to the higheſt Degree of Goodneſs. This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diſclaims in the 12th Verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Not as tho' I had already attained, or were already perfect, but I follow after.</hi> Sometimes the Word perfect, ſignifies a greater Degree of confirmed Goodneſs than many others have attained to: Hence the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of Babes, young Men, and Fathers in Chriſt. It is in this Senſe that I believe the aforeſaid Text is to be taken; for while the Apoſtle rejects any Pretence to a Perfection of Degrees, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges this comparative Perfection, as in the Text before cited.</p>
                  <p>But are we not commanded to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect? and does not this ſhew that a Perfection of Degrees is attainable in this Life?</p>

                  <p>Our inſiſting upon the Imperfection of the Saints, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſcourſes, inſtead of being an Encouragement to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, is a ſtrong Inducement to Holineſs; for it ſerves to preſerve Hope, which is the Spring of Motion, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Action, in the Boſoms of gracious Perſons, who are deeply ſenſible of their Defects. Thoſe dear Mourners in Zion, are ready to be diſcouraged ſometimes, becauſe of the Sight and Senſe they have of their Corruptions: for this they ſometimes reject their State, and ſay in themſelves, O! can it be poſſible that ſuch Corruption can conſiſt with the Grace of God? O was there ever on the Earth ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous bruitiſh Creature as I am! For this their Hands hang down, and their Knees are feeble, for this (or on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) they are in the utmoſt Agonies, ſometimes can hardly ſwallow their Spittle, and would chuſe Strangling and Death rather than Life. Now to preach up Perfection to ſuch poor humble Souls, who have a View of the ſpiritual Extent of the Law, and eſpecially to ſignify that Converſion conſiſts therein, this adds Affliction to the Afflicted: This makes thoſe ſorrowful whom God would have made glad: This ſtrengthens Satan's Temptations, whereby he labours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them that they have no Grace: This diſpirits them in Obedience. Whereas the contrary Doctrine builds up their Hope, and ſo excites their Admiration, their Love, and their Contrition.

And thus, my dear Brethren, it encourages and excites to walk in the Ways of religious Obedience. Therefore let us hold faſt this precious Truth, againſt the deteſtable Doctrine of the Moravians, and other Enthuſiaſts, who aſſert Perfection.</p>
                  <p>One of principal Note among the Moravians, ſpake to this Purpoſe in <hi>New-Brunſwick,</hi> and two of that Sect, who were in Company with him, aſſerted that they had been without Sin for ſeveral Years; both which Particulars you may ſee in the annexed Appendix. Well then; ſhall we believe the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> or not, that they are Liars, and that the Truth is not in them? We think we may ſafely apply to ourſelves, what is ſaid of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2.2. <hi>that we have tried them which ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and found them to be Liars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my own Part, I muſt declare to the World, that I think the Moravians, at leaſt ſome of them, are not ſo candid as to this Point, and many others, as the Generality of other modern Enthuſiaſts, who own the Doctrine of Perfection expreſly and openly, while ſome of the Moravians labour to hide their Opinion, and tho' they own it in Fact and Reality in other Words, yet ſome of them don't like to own it in ſo many Words expreſly. If they uſe this Art, to prevent the Odium, which would juſtly come upon their Sect, by their falſe Doctrine; and to impoſe upon the Ignorant and Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and ſo to encreaſe their Party, it is exceeding baſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. If this be their Simplicity, may the good Lord deliver us from it!</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Ye have heard that CONVERSION <hi>conſiſts in the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a divine Principle of Life.</hi> And thus ſpeaks the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25.

At this Rate, <hi>Cain, Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> were converted Perſons. And in the mean Time he condemned the State of <hi>David</hi> when he committed Adultery, of <hi>Peter</hi> when he denied his

                     <hi>Dat veniam Corvis, vexat cenſura columbas;</hi> this Cenſure approves the Ravens and condemns the Doves. According to the aforeſaid Notion, Men would be converted firſt, and convinced afterwards; which directly contradicts all that has been ſaid before concerning the Neceſſity of a preparatory Law-Work, and is real Nonſenſe.</p>

Hereby he was freed from the Stain of original Tranſgreſſion, which infects all thoſe, who are propogated by natural Generation.</p>
                  <p>Our Lord not deſcending from <hi>Adam,</hi> in a natural Way, was not numbered in him; and for this Reaſon as well as on the Account of his being God-Man, he did not, and I may ſay could not, break the Covenant of Nature.

                  <p>Our Lord was born, not by Virtue of that primitive Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Gen. 1.28. <hi>Grow and multiply:</hi> But by Virtue of that gracious Promiſe.

3.19. <hi>Whatſoever the Law ſays, it ſays to thoſe that are under the Law, that every Mouth may be ſtopped, and the whole World become guilty before God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if Jews and Gentiles are by Nature Children of Wrath, and if all the World be under the Law, and guilty before God, while in a State of Nature, then Infants are guilty of original Sin, before they be capable to commit actual; for they have the human Nature, and are a Part of the World: and indeed this appears the more evident, from their Liableneſs to Death, which the Apoſtle repreſents to be the Wages of Sin, and brought into the World thereby, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.</p>
                  <p>The Ground of the Imputation of Adam's Guilt to us, is not ſo much in the Nature which we derive from him, (he could not communicate a better than he had, and the ſecond Adam has derived the humane Nature from our firſt Parents) as in the Covenant made with him, and his Poſterity after him, of which we have an Account in the following Places of Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17. In this Covenant, the great God contracts with his Creature as with a Servant, by Way of ſovereign Empire; preſcribing to him what Terms he pleaſed. In the threatning of Death in Caſe of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is doubtleſs imply'd a Promiſe of Life in Caſe of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and hence it is expreſly call'd a Covenant, Hoſ. 6.7. <hi>But they like</hi> Adam, <hi>have tranſgreſſed the Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Adam</hi>'s whole Poſterity was involved in his Guilt, in eating of the forbidden Fruit, and in the Miſeries conſequent thereupon, is written as with a Sun-Beam in that famous Scripture, Rom. 5.12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. there Death is ſaid <hi>to paſs upon all,</hi> and that <hi>becauſe all had ſinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it can't be in Reaſon ſuppoſed, that they could ſin actually and perſonally before they had a Being, therefore it muſt be by Imputation.</p>
                  <p>Does not the univerſal Experience of all <hi>Adam's</hi> Poſterity, loudly proclaim the aforeſaid Truth? If his Tranſgreſſion was not imputed to them, whence ſhould ſpring their early Propenſity or Inclination to Vice, before they have Time to contract it by Practice and Example? Can a Stream flow without a Fountain, a Branch grow without a Tree? Does
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005299_0046_1016F751024417E8"/>
not Mankind by ſome Kind of actual Imitation, approve the original Treſpaſs, and ſo transfer its Guilt upon themſelves? Whence ſhould come that Train of Miſeries, that Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Calamities, that make all the Creation groan, and infeſt the whole humane Race, if the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> be not imputed?</p>
                  <p>How is it that tender Infants, before they become capable of actual Offences, ſhould be expoſed to Death it ſelf, in its moſt hideous Form, and to all thoſe Diſeaſes which are the Uſhers of it? Will not the Judge of all the Earth do right? Will the juſt God inflict capital Puniſhment where there is no Tranſgreſſion, either imputed or inherent? Does the Almighty afflict willingly, or grieve the Children of Men? No ſurely! Shall the Wages of Sin be paid without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Work? Yea the Apoſtle aſſerts, 1 Cor. 15.22. <hi>That in Adam all die.</hi> Now ſeeing that Death is the proper Wages of Sin, by divine Ordination, it muſt be ſuppoſed that all ſinned: but Perſons not exiſting, could not ſin any other Way than by the Imputation of the firſt Tranſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is evident from the Parrallel drawn by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> between the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that the firſt was a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Perſon as well as the ſecond; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. They are ſpoken of, as if there were but theſe two Perſons in the World, becauſe they were Heads of different Covenants, <hi>viz.</hi> of Works, and Grace; and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of different Poſterities, <hi>viz.</hi> natural and ſpiritual. Yea <hi>Adam</hi> is expreſly ſaid to be the Figure of him that was to come.</p>
                  <p>The Hiſtory of the firſt Man gives farther Confirmation to the aforeſaid Truth, where we read that all the Good and Evil that befell him, were aſcrib'd to him, as a publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; who was to be the Example and Pledge of his Poſterity. Before the Fall the original Righteouſneſs he poſſeſs'd, and Empire over the Creatures, as well as his Marriage and Bleſſing, reſpected all; and after the Fall the Miſeries which befel him, reſpected not only himſelf, but all his Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Moſt certainly we ſinned after the ſame Manner in <hi>Adam,</hi> as we are juſtify'd in Chriſt; namely by Imputation: and if the firſt be deny'd, why not the latter? and then the Foundation of the Goſpel is overſet, and nothing left in the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005299_0047_1016F753CB8B0078"/>
Room of it, but a Syſtem of moral Virtue. And it may be obſerved in Confirmation of what has been now offered, that the Denial of original Sin imputed, naturally leads to, and often iſſues in, the Denial of the Saviour's imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſee any Unreaſonableneſs in the Aſſertion, of the firſt Man's repreſenting his whole Race, ſeeing that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his Obedience, if he had ſtood, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to his Poſterity, as really as if they had perſonally kept the Covenant. Now by a Parity of Reaſon, it is but juſt that they ſhould be expoſed to the Diſadvantages of his Fall.</p>
                  <p>The Situation of Mankind in having one common Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, was better than if every Man had ſtood for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Head for Head: which appears thus; <hi>Adam</hi> had not only as great a Capacity to ſtand, conſidered in a private Character, as any other could be ſuppoſed to have, being made upright, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves: He had a perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the divine Mind, ſo far as concerned his Duty and Happineſs; a univerſal Rectitude which ſpread through his whole Soul, and governed all his Powers and Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>But beſides this, he had the Conſideration of thereby ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Happineſs of his whole Offspring, to incite him to ſtand, and the Ruin of his whole Race to deter him from the contrary: And are not theſe important Motives to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Minds? Now if every Man had ſtood for himſelf, without any publick Repreſentative, they could not have had thoſe Incentives to Perſeverance in Goodneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there would not have been ſuch a great Probability of their Standing. Beſides <hi>Adam</hi> being newly form'd, had a freſh Senſe of creating Goodneſs, which muſt needs offer additional Influence to his Love and Obedience. By theſe Conſiderations it appears that Man's Condition in having a federal Head, was better than if it had been otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>God Almighty undoubtedly foreſaw, that all <hi>Adam's</hi> Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, would have yielded to the ſame ſatanical Temptation with him, had they been thereto expoſed; and therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that that was certainly future, it might poſſibly in ſome Senſe, be eſteemed as committed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:005299_0048_1016F755AA9AA590"/>Again, it is certain that the whole World of Mankind then exiſting, did ſin, and that thereby the Friendſhip of God with the whole World periſhed, and conſequently with their Poſterity, ſeeing that Children are but Parts or Pieces of their Parents.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſſed that God is the Sovereign of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, the great Potter, and we but Clay in his Hands; that he has an abſolute Right to do with his own as he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed a marvellous Inſtance of divine Goodneſs &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, that the great Lord of the Univerſe, ſhould ſtoop ſo low, as to enter into any Covenant with his Creatures at all, and much more ſo when in the Manner before related!</p>
                  <p>To have Repreſentatives, is not unuſual in civil Affairs. Do not Embaſſadors repreſent the Prince and Nation that ſends them to a foreign State, and are not their Speeches and Actions interpretatively the Speeches and Actions of all their Conſtituents?</p>
                  <p>Do not Parents perſonate and oblige their Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, by their civil Tranſactions reſpecting them; and when they covenant for their Benefit, who does or who juſtly can blame the Practice?</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing that to have a federal Head, or common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, by Way of Covenant, was as has been obſerved, the beſt Situation that Man could be in, reſpecting the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Covenant Tranſaction, if they had had their own Choice, whom could they have choſen, that was ſo fit to occupy that Place, that important Province, as him who was the Parent and Original of the whole humane Race, and otherwiſe ſo qualified, as has been before hinted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pelagians, Socinians, Jeſuits, Arminians, Remomſtrants, Moravians,</hi> and all other <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> ſo far as I know, do oppoſe the aforeſaid momentuous Truth, which has ſo direct and noble a Tendency to humble the Pride of Man, to make him ſenſible of his Miſery, and ſo to prepare him for the dear Redeemer. Some of the Objections that are bro't by the aforeſaid Adverſaries, are ſuch as theſe following,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ſay, we did not exiſt or conſent, when our firſt Parents ſinned.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p n="2">2. They ſay that it is unreaſonable to imagine, that that Sin which was pardoned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo does not exiſt, ſhould be imputed to his Offspring.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Tho' that firſt Sin does not exiſt phyſically, yet it does ethically, or morally; the Pardon of Sin does not take away its Being, but only its binding Power, from thoſe to whom it is apply'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They object, that it is inconſiſtent with the Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Truth of God, to reckon him to have ſinned, who has not ſinned, and with his Juſtice to puniſh him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's true, it is inconſiſtent with God's Omniſcience, to reckon him to have ſinned actually, who has not ſinned actually; but it is not inconſiſtent with his Omniſcience, to reckon him to have ſinned virtually, or in the Cauſe, who has not ſinned actually, or in his own Perſon: Neither is it unjuſt to puniſh him, who has only ſinned virtually, as we ſee in the Caſe of Infants, who feel the Force of Death. We may reaſonably argue from Fact to Right in Reſpect of God. We are ſure that whatever he does he has a Right to do; for as his Wiſdom is infallible, ſo his Holineſs is invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable: He is a Rock, his Ways are perfect, a God of Truth, and without Iniquity, juſt and right is he.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt denies that the Parents of the blind Man ſinned.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Semi-pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> do after a Sort acknowlege that there is ſuch a Thing as original Sin, but believe that it is wholly taken away by Baptiſm.

                  </p>
                  <p>To ſay that the Guilt of original Sin is removed, and that the Guilt of actual remains; is in Effect to ſay, that a Perſon is at once half juſtify'd and half condemn'd; in Chriſt, and without him; alive, and dead; Children of God, and of the Devil, at the ſame Time: and pray where ſhall ſuch mongrel Monſters go at Death?

                  <p>It is but to little Avail to acknowledge hereditary Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the mean Time to deny the Imputation of its Guilt; for then it is but an Infelicity or Unhappineſs, and no Fault.

                  <p>But pray how can thoſe <hi>Moravians,</hi> and their Arminian Brethren, account for a Conveyance of original Corruption, without any Imputation of Guilt? I know of nothing in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Reaſon to ſupport it; if they do let them produce it.</p>
                  <p>Now is it any Wonder that the Moravian Sect are eaſy, when ſuch ſtupifying damnable Doctrines are advanced among them? When we ſeriouſly conſider the groſs Ignorance of a principal Perſon of their Party, as to many of the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

                  <p n="1">1. I think it naturally and neceſſarily ſuppoſes, our Lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to forget and looſe Truths which we have once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, (and perhaps with ſenſible Complacence) in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Affection and Practice. Thro' our Ignorance, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, Credulity, and the plauſible Arts of Seducers, who lye in wait to deceive, there be ſo many doleful Inſtances of this, in Writings both ſacred and prophane, that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to ſay any Thing farther in Confirmation of it: Only this may be added, that the Command in our Text is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereupon. There would be no Need of enjoining us to remember and hold faſt, if we were not inclined naturally to let the precious Truths of Chriſt ſlip out of our treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Memories, and to turn from them to Error and Vanity, in our corrupt Affections!</p>
                  <p>Since we have fallen from the God of Truth by the Breach of the firſt Covenant, Error is co-natural to us, our Hearts are a fit Soil to hatch and cheriſh that Cockatrice, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many Errors do either more openly or covertly befriend Sin and Security, therefore we are naturally inclin'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and revolt from the Doctrines of Truth to them!</p>
                  <p>Beſides the Devil who is the Father of Lies and Errors, has in our fallen State an unhappy Acceſs to our Souls, and if permitted, can eaſily repreſent Things in ſuch a falſe Light, as to raiſe a Prejudice in our Minds againſt Truth; and ſo endanger our Apoſtacy therefrom. Hence Satan is juſtly call'd a Spirit of Error, a ſeducing Spirit. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Command in our Text ſuppoſes the dangerous Conſequences of forgetting the Truth, and letting it go, otherwiſe the contrary Duty would not be therein, with ſo much Earneſtneſs preſſed.</p>
                  <p>When the Eye of the Body is blinded, one walks in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Danger, and knows not whither he goes; Perſons may be then led any where to their Hurt; they may be conducted
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005299_0054_1016F769080A5980"/>
contrary to their Expectation, to the Camp of their Enemies, inſtead of Friends, as the <hi>Syrians</hi> to <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how much more dreadful is it, when the Eye of the Soul is blinded, I mean that leading Power, the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! When falſe Teachers, by their bewitching Charms, and jugling Arts, do blind Men's Minds, they may then tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over them, as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> over poor <hi>Samſon,</hi> when they had pluck'd out his Eyes.</p>
                  <p>As Truth has great Power to excite to Holineſs, ſo Error to Sin, either open or ſecret, of Heart or Practice. How ſtrangely does it elate the Mind with Pride, in Reſpect of Men's own Attainments, and poſſeſs it with Prejudice againſt the Sons of Truth! Error diſconforms the Mind to the God of Truth, it often turns Zeal into a wrong Channel, and ſeparates chief Friends. Hereby Churches and Families are torn in Pieces, with Breaches wide as the Sea. Some otherwiſe valuable Perſons being poiſoned with Error, have made it their Buſineſs to pull down with great Induſtry, that Good which they once laboured to build up. Error in the Mind is the Fountain from which ſprings Error in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and indeed the former is generally more difficultly cured than the latter, becauſe Perſons have more Excuſes for the one than the other. Miſtakes in Opinion are not ſo eaſy to be diſcern'd, as in Practice. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Command in our Text implies, that there are proper Means to be uſed to prevent the aforeſaid Evil, and Loſs conſequent upon it: Otherwiſe to what valuable Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe would the Command ſerve? Now the Means are ſuch as theſe following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Humility.</hi> The God of Truth dwells with the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; whereas ſpiritual Pride (more eſpecially) is often the Fore-runner of a Fall in Doctrine or Practice; and indeed this Pride is ſometimes much diſguis'd with a Kind of Zeal, and Appearance of Humility, which is perhaps undiſcern'd by the Perſon that has it.</p>
                  <p>But in my Opinion a Diſpoſition to ſeparate from a true Church, becauſe many of her Members are unconverted, and ſome are under Deadneſs, is a Sign of a proud Spirit: Were not the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old proud Separatiſts?</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is alſo exceeding neceſſary to be well acquainted with the <hi>Catechiſms</hi> of the reformed Churches, which give a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary View of the Principles of Religion; and with thoſe approved Books which do explain them. In particular, I would earneſtly recommend to your Peruſal, Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Explication of the Aſſembly's Catechiſm, which is a moſt valuable precious Performance.</p>
                  <p>And here I muſt take Leave to obſerve, that the Practice of <hi>ſtaying at Home,</hi> rather than going to hear ſuch Miniſters, (ſound in Principle and regular in Practice) as are judg'd by ſome to be <hi>unconverted,</hi> is unſcriptural and of dangerous Tendency (in my Opinion,) for it hangs the whole Weight of the publick Worſhip of God, upon the uncertain Judgment of Men. Tho' <hi>unconverted</hi> Miniſters are not likely to do ſo much Good as others, yet ſeeing that many of them, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, do preach the ſame Word of God, which others do; why may not the ſovereign God, who permits them by his Providence to come into the Miniſtry, bleſs his Word deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by them, for the Good of Mankind?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the aforeſaid Practice of <hi>ſtaying at Home,</hi> &amp;c. opens a Door to Deluſion by <hi>falſe Teachers,</hi> as well as to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions</hi>

People are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to <hi>Extreams</hi> about Miniſters, either to make <hi>no</hi> Difference at all, or to make <hi>too much.</hi> Certainly the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Diſeaſe is dangerous, when one ſays, he is of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another of <hi>Apollos.</hi> Surely Miniſters ſhould neither be ſlighted, nor idoliz'd!</p>
                  <p>I muſt declare to the World, that I dread the Tho'ts of <hi>Schiſms</hi> &amp; <hi>Separations</hi> in the Church of God; becauſe of the diſmal Handle that is hereby given to <hi>Seducers,</hi> to promote their erroneous Tenets; and alſo becauſe of the Diſhonour that is hereby caſt on God's Name, Ways and People: hereby wicked Men are ſtrengthned in their Prejudices againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; hereby Profeſſors are diverted from promoting God's Work, to perſonal trifling Controverſies of no Moment. Therefore when the Caſe ſo happens, that People are diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with their Miniſter, and cannot get Edification by his Miniſtrations, after long and impartial Labours to this End; it ſeems moſt adviſeable for them humbly and peaceably (in a regular Manner) to ſeek to get an Aſſiſtant with him, if the Place be able to ſupport two; but if not, to ask Leave of their Paſtor and other Church Officers, to go where they are more edifyed: in the mean Time laying aſide all raſh Cenſures.

                  <p>Foraſmuch as the Church of Chriſt is begirt with nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies, of various Forms; Enemies open and ſecret, who labour almoſt inceſſantly, either by Force or Fraud, to corrupt her in her Principles, it is of the laſt Neceſſity, to be conſtantly upon our Guard, and eſpecially in a Time of publick and epidemical Infection; leſt we be betrayed into the Labyrinths of Error and Miſtake, by the plauſible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Seducers.</p>
                  <p>To this End, it is exceeding needful to uſe thoſe Means, which tend to our common Security. In the laſt Sermon, under the ſecond general Head propoſed, I made mention of three Means, which I judge proper to help us to retain the Truths of Chriſt; to which I would now add, theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, namely, in the</p>

Place, It is alſo exceeding neceſſary, to implore the God of all Grace, that he would pleaſe of his infinite Mercy to give us to <hi>feel the ſpecial and powerful Influence of Truth upon our Minds and Hearts,</hi> that ſo we may be moulded into the Image thereof, and thus transformed from Glory to Glory.</p>
                  <p>Altho' the bare doctrinal Knowlege of a true Syſtem of religious Principles, be a valuable Privilege, in as much as it is a needful Preparative to that which is of a ſaving Kind; yet it is dangerous and deſtructive, to reſt ſatisfied with it, without the Experience of its Power and Influence. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17,—20.</p>
                  <p>A hearty and enduring Endeavour, with all Humility, to conform in Practice to the Truths we know, is a neceſſary Mean to obtain Eſtabliſhment in the Truth, and farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>If any</hi> (ſaith our Lord) <hi>doth the Will of God, he ſhall know of the Truth whither it be of God.</hi> Perſeverance in the Acknowledgement of the Truth, is God's free Gift, without which we cannot ſtand. Now if we are not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in acting according to what we know, God's Spirit will be grieved, and we are in Danger of being given up to a Spirit of Error and Deluſion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If we would hold faſt the Truths of Chriſt, we muſt <hi>avoid unneceſſary Converſation with Perſons groſly and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally erroneous.</hi> Thoſe that bring not the Doctrine of Chriſt with them, we muſt not receive them into our Houſes, or bid them God Speed; for if we do we are Partakers of their evil Deeds. See 2 Epiſt. of Joh. 8.9, 10. <hi>Look to your ſelves therefore, that we loſe not thoſe Things we have wrought.</hi> We are commanded to <hi>mark thoſe that cauſe Diviſions, and to avoid them.</hi> Now Perſons may be ſaid to cauſe Diviſions, when by falſe Doctrine (and eſpecially about important Points) they alienate the Affections of good Men from each other, and break them into different Parties. Rom. 16.17. <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren, mark thoſe which cauſe Diviſions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have received, and avoid them; for they that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus, but their own Belly, and by good Words and fair Speeches, deceive the Hearts of the ſimple.</hi>

Now if we are fond of erroneous Strangers, and needleſly ruſh into their Converſation, do we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict our Prayers by our Practice? There ſeems to be a bewitching Power that ſometimes attends (thro' the juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God) the Converſation and Labours of falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.

without <hi>humane Learning,</hi> is notoriouſly <hi>enthuſiaſtical</hi> and fooliſh.

He who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleges, that the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which are the Rule of our Faith and Practice, were originally written in other <hi>Tongues</hi> than are now <hi>Vulgar,</hi> muſt have a weak Mind, an enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Heart, or a hard Forehead, if he denies the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of humane Learning. In ſhort, either humane Learning is neceſſary, or there muſt be <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> to ſupply the want thereof. Do not therefore wonder at the enthuſiaſtical Talk of the <hi>Moravians,</hi> viz. <q>That Perſons muſt ſpeak no more in religious Matters, then <hi>God has wro't in their Hearts.</hi>
                     </q>
This I take to be <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> in other Words; eſpecially when it is conſider'd in Connection with their Advice againſt <hi>preparatory Studies.</hi> Methinks, it is in a manner Self-evident, that all thoſe who deny the Neceſſity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning, in ordinary Caſes, to prepare Perſons for the Miniſtry, are Enthuſiaſts.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever good Appearance, thruſting out <hi>ignorant</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (how <hi>pious</hi> ſoever) into the Miniſtry may have, yet it is a <hi>dangerous</hi> Practice, tending directly to <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> the Church of God, and bring the Miniſtry thereof into <hi>Contempt.</hi> Beſides, when Perſons intrude into the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Work, without any previous <hi>Trial</hi> and <hi>Licence,</hi> from thoſe who by Virtue of their <hi>Office</hi> are conſtituted <hi>Judges</hi> in ſuch Caſes, it is doubtleſs our Duty to <hi>diſcountenance</hi> them, let them pretend what they will. None ſhould <hi>take this Honour to himſelf;</hi> but wait for God's Call and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If any irregularly aſſume the Poſts of Officers, in the <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Army,</hi> it turns all into Confuſion; and thus it is in the <hi>Church</hi> of God. Therefore all proper Care ſhould be taken to prevent <hi>Intruſions,</hi> which are pregnant with miſchievous Conſequences.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Another Mean to hold faſt Chriſt's precious Truths, is <hi>to confer with our ſpiritual Guides,</hi> about Points that are controverted; to hear patiently, and conſider calmly their Reaſonings; and to take Care, that we <hi>do not entertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Prejudice againſt them.</hi> When the Spouſe inquired
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005299_0062_1016F77E4714D9D8"/>
                     <hi>where her Beloved fed, and made his Flooks to reſt at Noon,</hi> ſhe was bid to go forth by the <hi>Footſteps of the Flock,</hi> and feed her Kids beſide <hi>the Shepherds Tents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, we ſhould frequently and feelingly reflect upon the Truths which we have heard, and remember with what Affection we have heard them.</p>
                  <p>And it is our Duty to hold them faſt, in the following Reſpects; namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Aſſent</hi> of our <hi>Minds.</hi> We ſhould eſteem and approve of them, and judge them worthy of all Acceptance; more valuable than the fineſt Gold, and ſweeter than Honey and the Honey-Comb; right, equal, holy, juſt, and good; worthy of our Labour and Purchaſe; but not to be parted with at any Rate. Hence is that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, Prov. 23.23. <hi>Buy the Truth and ſell it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſhould hold faſt the Truths of Chriſt in our <hi>Affections.</hi> As Truth ſhould be high in our Eſteem, ſo our Affections ſhould be fixed upon it. Hence the Apoſtle pray'd Night and Day for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that they might be filled with the Knowlege of his Will, in all Wiſdom and ſpiritual Underſtanding. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of his loving an honourable Lady <hi>in the Truth,</hi> i. e. becauſe of the Truth; as he himſelf explains the Phraſe in the following Verſe, namely the 2d Verſe of his ſecond Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſhould hold faſt the Truth in our <hi>Profeſſion.</hi> If we will not confeſs Chriſt before Men, he will not confeſs us before his heavenly Father. And indeed if we will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the dear and precious Truths of the Redeemer, we are not worthy to be called his Diſciples. If we are aſhamed of him and of his Truths in the midſt of a froward and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Generation, of us will the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he comes in the Glory of his Father, with the holy Angels.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſhould hold faſt the Truths of Chriſt in our <hi>Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</hi> Hence we are commanded to <hi>adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all Things.</hi> We ſhould walk as Lights in the World, that thoſe who ſeek to accuſe our good Converſation in Chriſt may be aſhamed. We ſhould hold forth the Word of Truth in our Practice, that thereby the Ignorance of fooliſh Men
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005299_0063_1016F781144938D8"/>
may be put to Silence. O it is to be lamented, if poſſible with Tears of Blood! when the Enemies of Truth get ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Occaſion of Reproach and Triumph, by Blunders in the Lives of the Profeſſors of it. O let us be careful that the Intereſts of Truth ſuffer not, thro' our Miſconduct! let us endeavour to remove Occaſion from thoſe who ſeek Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion!</p>
                  <p>By our Practice, we ſhould ſhew to the World our Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of Deceivers, and fundamentally erronious Perſons, as we would do of Perſons that have Plague Sores upon them; unleſs it be to convince, reclaim, oppoſe and confute them. It is an inconſiſtent, unjuſtifiable Weakneſs, to pretend to hate Error, and yet court the Company of Schiſmaticks, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, Seducers, and Hereticks. No Love to Perſons ſhould equal our Love to the dear and precious Truths of Chriſt. Thoſe Perſons who dare preſumptuouſly and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly ruſh into the Company of Erroriſts, ſeem to have either little Love to Truth, or little Senſe of their own Weakneſs. I am apt to think that ſuch Perſons would take more Care of their Bodies in a Time of Infection, than they do of their poor Souls. But I proceed to conſider the laſt Thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, <q>
                        <hi>III. To ſhew</hi> why we ſhould hold faſt the Truths of Chriſt.</q> 
                     <hi>And,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ought to do ſo, becauſe it is the <hi>Command of God,</hi> in the Text, which I am now conſidering: And elſewhere, the Lord enjoins us by his ſovereign Authority, to <hi>hold faſt the Form of ſound Words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.3. To <hi>contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> Jud. 3. To catch the <hi>Foxes, the little Foxes that ſpoil the Vines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Vines have tender Grapes,</hi> Cant. 2.15. To beware of <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Wolves in Sheeps cloathing,</hi> Mat. 7.15. To beware of the <hi>Leaven of the Phariſees,</hi> Math. 16.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Truth</hi> is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>practical Goodneſs.</hi> It is the Mean (1) of our Illumination: the Pſalmiſt obſerved <hi>that God's Word was a Light to his Feet and a Lamp to his Path.</hi> (2) of our Sanctification: <hi>Sanctify them thro' thy Truth, thy Word is Truth.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.22. <hi>Seeing ye have purifyed your Souls in obeying the Truth, thro' the Spirit.</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="unknown:005299_0064_1016F782B7373548"/>
(3) of our Conſolation. Pſal. 119.50. <hi>This is my Comfort in my Affliction, for thy Word hath quickned me.</hi> The ſweet Truths of God's Word are the Fountain of our Comfort, and Foundation of our Hopes. Perſons do grow in Grace juſt as in the Knowlege of Truth; and hence we are bid to <hi>grow in Grace, and in the Knowlege of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whatever Perſons may imagine or pretend, in Reſpect of their Frames and Comforts, if they grow more dark and ignorant as to the Knowlege of Truth, we have no Reaſon to think, if they have any Grace, that they grow in it; but rather that they go backward: and if their Errors be many and fundamental, its probable they are under a Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Devil.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſhould remember and hold faſt the Truths of Chriſt, becauſe of their <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Tendency.</hi> God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the God of Truth: The Son of God is the Way, the Truth and the Life: The holy Spirit is a Spirit of Truth: The Law of God is Truth and Righteouſneſs: The Goſpel is a Goſpel of Truth, it is ſtil'd emphatically <hi>the Truth.</hi> The Children of God are Children of Truth; Children that won't Lie: The Promiſes and Threatnings of the Word are true as Truth it ſelf; they are harmonious, firm and ſtedfaſt. Now the Tendency of Truth is to conform us to the God of Truth, who is its Parent and great Original. And is not this our higheſt Honour, and our greateſt Intereſt?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such as do not <hi>love</hi> the Truth, are in Danger of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion</hi> and <hi>Damnation.</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power and Signs and lying Wonders, and with all deceivableneſs of Unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh; becauſe they received not the Love of the Truth that they might be ſaved; and for this Cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſion, that they ſhould believe a Lie, that they all might be damned, who believed not the Truth, but had Pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Obſerve, my dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that when Satan the Father of Error and Lies, draws People from the Truth, there is a Power attends his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that his Inſtruments carry on the Affairs of his Kingdom with great Deceit.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:005299_0065_1016F78847FC8E40"/>5. We ſhould hold faſt the Truth, becauſe <hi>it is a Fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 5.5. It is mentioned to the Reproach of ſome, that they made Ship-wreck of Faith, and turned from the Truth to Fables, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4, 6.</p>
                  <p>When Perſons fall from the Truths of Chriſt, they ſhew a childiſh Weakneſs and Fickleneſs. Children are fond of new Things, of Things that look bright, tho' they be of little Value; their Tinſels and Toys, are in their Opinion great Riches. Thus young Novices in Chriſtianity, who are juſt beginning the Chriſtian Courſe, ignorant in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as to Chriſtian Principles, but full of Affection and Self-conceit, when a Moravian comes among them, ſets down a while, and looks very harmleſs and innocent and ſober, gives ſome Smiles, and talks about the Blood of Chriſt, in their myſtical Way; and of Love, Love!— O brave! How are they taken with it directly, as a Child with a Rattle! His very ſimple loving Looks, make them think he is almoſt an Angel. O what a fine Man is this! O the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are not fit to be mentioned in the ſame Day with this fine new Sect! They grow weary of the old ſtale Truths of the Reformation, they want to change their Principles almoſt as faſt as their Almanacks; with the <hi>Athenians</hi> they muſt have ſomething new.</p>
                  <p>Such who change their Principles for the worſe, bring great Diſhonour upon God's Name, as well as Grief to his People, and Injury to his Kingdom. O it cauſes the holy Name of God to be blaſphemed, when Perſons who are either really or apparently religious, turn with every Blaſt, and ſoon ſuffer themſelves to be ſmil'd out of their Religion! And thoſe who are enabled of pure Grace to adhere to the dear and precious Truths of Chriſt in a Time of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Apoſtacy, O it covers their Faces with Shame, and fills their Hearts with Grief, to behold thoſe with whom they were won't to take ſweet Counſel, herding with Hereticks and Enthuſiaſticks, and turning Fugitives from the Truths and Camp of Chriſt! Tell it not in <hi>Gath,</hi> publiſh it not in the Streets of <hi>Askelon,</hi> leſt the Daughters of the Philiſtines rejoyce, the Daughters of the Uncircumciſed triumph, and
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:005299_0066_1016F78B151A86E0"/>
ſay, <hi>thus would we have it?</hi> Saints are hereby ſtumbled, and Sinners prejudiced, and the Ways of Zion mourn.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By holding faſt the Truths of Chriſt, we ſhall <hi>prove that we are living Members of the Church militant;</hi> which is called <hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. And elſewhere it is ſaid concerning ſome, who lived in the apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Times, that they <hi>went out from them, becauſe they were not of them.</hi> And hence it is ſaid that <hi>Hereſies muſt needs come, that thoſe that are approved may be made manifeſt.</hi> For indeed it ſhews a weak Head, or a falſe Heart, or violent Temptations of the Devil, to be ſuddenly toſſed about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Slight and Craftineſs of thoſe that lie in wait to deceive. By ſpeaking the Truth from our Hearts, we ſhew our ſelves to be Members of the Church triumphant. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.2. By cleaving to the Truths of God, we ſhew our ſelves to be guided by the Spirit of God; for he is promiſed to lead the People of God into all Truth: And hence he is called the Spirit of Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.17.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Methinks the <hi>Sufferings and Blood af the innumerable Army of Martyrs,</hi> in Teſtimony to Truth, ſhould inſpire us with a holy Magnanimity and unſhaken Stedfaſtneſs of Reſolution, to ſuffer the Loſs of every Thing that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dear to us, rather than forſake the dear and precious Truths of the bleſſed Jeſus. Let us behold the Cloud of Witneſſes, that have gone before us; thoſe heroick brave and gallant Souls, in Defence of precious, precious, precious Truth, have ſwam thro' a Sea of Sorrows, of Sufferings, and of Blood, to their Father's Kingdom. Away, away then with that accurſed Indifferency, and Lukewarmneſs, about Chriſt's precious Truths, which ſome do falſely call Charity and Catholiciſm! Let us riſe up and plead the Cauſe of Truth, and defend it to our dying Breath. The more others do trample upon Truth, the more let us eſteem and value it; the more dear let it be to our very Souls. O let us ſtoop down, and with the humbleſt Reverence, and moſt paſſionate affectionate Affection, let us take this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimably valuable Jewel out of the Dirt, and put it in our inmoſt Boſoms!</p>

                  <head>REFLECTIONS.</head>
                  <p>From what has been ſaid we ſhould be induced to <hi>examine our ſelves,</hi> as to our Reſpect to <hi>Truth,</hi> and the Influence it has upon us. It ſignifies little, my Brethren, to profeſs Regard and Love to Holineſs, while Truth, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truth is ſlighted. It is a childiſh Weakneſs, to call it no worſe; it is a beginning at the wrong End of Religion; it is juſt as if a Man ſhould ſhew great Regard to the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure of a Houſe, and neglect the Foundation. What ſignify fair Shews of Love and Holineſs, without Truth for their Foundation? They are only Blinds to deceive the Simple, Rattles to pleaſe Children.</p>
                  <p>It is a plain Sign of an <hi>enthuſiaſtical</hi> and deluding Spirit, to ſlight that precious <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Truths, which we have laid before us, in a moſt plain conſiſtent and excellent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in our <hi>Weſtminſter-Confeſſion</hi> of Faith, and <hi>Catechiſms;</hi> among which we ſee a ſtrong Connection, and charming Harmony; and in which, if we are not blinded with Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or Prejudice, we may perceive a tranſcendent Beauty, a direct Tendency to exalt all the Honours of the divine Attributes, to humble the Pride of Man, and conform him to the Deity, in univerſal Goodneſs and Holineſs: There Vice, of every Kind &amp; Form, is juſtly repreſented in its own native Dreſs of Horror and Meanneſs: There ſincere Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is fix'd upon it's proper and impregnable Baſis; and open'd in it's vaſt Extent and attractive Magnificence, and encourag'd with all proper pertinent and powerful Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: There the Creatures Crown is caſt at the dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's Feet, and all the Glory of it's Happineſs, aſcrib'd to the Mediation of our great Immanuel: There the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Beauties of the pure, free, ſovereign, rich, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible and glorious Grace of God, are unvail'd, in a conſiſtency with the Creatures Duty; ſo as hereby to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Intereſts of Vertue and Piety, upon the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing and ingenuous Motives! Now I ſay to ſlight ſuch a bleſſed Self-conſiſtent Syſtem of Principles, and in the Room thereof, under a Pretence of Holineſs in a ſuperior Degree, to introduce a Bundle of inconſiſtent Jargon, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:005299_0068_1016F790B12CA750"/>
Nonſenſe, and damnable Errors; Errors that affect the very Foundations of Religion, both in Doctrine and Practice;— is it not vile Enthuſiaſm, and deteſtable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion?</p>
                  <p>Certainly the Caſe of ſuch who have known the Truths of Chriſt, and turn from them to Vanity, Lies, and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, is more inexcuſable, than of thoſe who have been breed up in Ignorance. O what a fooliſh Choice do they make, in bartering away the fineſt Gold for the baſeſt Droſs? What unaccountable Ingratitude do ſuch expreſs to the great and good God, for all the religious Privileges &amp; Means of Improvement they have had? They turn their Backs upon the unſullied Snow, and ſacred Sweets of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and purſue after poiſonous Streams and muddy Waters.</p>
                  <p>To pretend to introduce into <hi>one Communion,</hi> all that have an Appearance of Experience, Affection, and Piety, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſearching into their main <hi>Principles,</hi> without a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in them (as I have Reaſon to think the <hi>Moravians</hi> do) is to build <hi>Babel</hi> over again, and promote the Confuſion of Languages.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be reaſonably expected, that ſuch a confus'd Medley, ſuch a heterogeneous Mixture will ſtand long, for it has no ſolid Foundation to ſtand upon. To pretend to promote Love and Union, by concealing our Principles and leſſening our Regard to Truth, is to do Evil that Good may come. Indeed it is the direct Road to Diviſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and this the Event proves. To love Perſons in a general View as Chriſtians, without due Reſpect had to their main peculiar <hi>Principles,</hi> is an unreaſonable childiſh Paſſion, more ſit for Children and Simpletons, than for Men of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. For, as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, <hi>the ſimple Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves every Word,</hi> Prov. 14.15. A pretended Union with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Syſtem of <hi>Principles</hi> acknowledged, is rather a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, than a ſcriptural Union. It is infinitely more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, to let others freely know our Scheme of Principles, that ſo they may judge of them; and in Things of ſmaller Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to uſe Moderation and Forbearance; and to make no more Terms of Communion, than Chriſt himſelf has
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005299_0069_1016F793759F5350"/>
fixed. Any other Union is neither rational, nor deſirable, and deſerves not the Name of Union.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Moravian</hi> Concealment of their pernicious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſeems to be a Fulfilment of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Propheſy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning falſe Teachers, that they ſhould <hi>privily</hi> (or covertly) <hi>bring in damnable Hereſies. Plutarch</hi>'s Story of a Boy that carried ſomething under his Cloak, may be applied to them. The Boy was asked by a Stranger, What it was he carried ſo cloſely under his Cloak? To whom the Boy anſwered, you may well know, that it is ſomething I don't intend you ſhall know, by ſo carrying it. All Religion that is worth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man's Choice is gone, when Truth is gone. All that is left is childiſh Fancy, enthuſiaſtical Folly, and painted Pageantry.</p>
                  <p>For any Men to pretend to <hi>know</hi> certainly who are <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> as one of the <hi>Moravians</hi> did in my hearing, is to aſſume an incommunicable Prerogative of God: and to run upon this <hi>falſe</hi> Plan in Church-Matters, is to turn all into the wildeſt <hi>Diſorder</hi> and <hi>Confuſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Methinks the Conſideration of the Truths of God, may juſtly <hi>alarm the Secure</hi> and <hi>Impenitent,</hi> and excite them to fly from Sin to God, and humble themſelves before him, and ſeek his Favour; ſeeing that all the Threats of God are pointed at them like ſo many burning Thunderbolts, which the Truth of God will oblige him to diſcharge at them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Repentance intercept the falling Blow. All the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the divine Severity againſt the Impenitent, which are recorded in both the Teſtaments, are ſhocking Momentos to a ſecure World!</p>
                  <p>But let all <hi>devout Souls,</hi> who have felt the proper Influence of Truth upon their own Hearts and Practices, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Regard thereto, <hi>Rejoyce.</hi> Go on, my dear Brethren, in the bleſſed V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Conſideration of the Truths of Chriſt, yields ſweet Support under <hi>Temptation, Deſertion,</hi> and every other Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.

                     </gap> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: You may know them by their Fruits, like Wolves they cruelly ſcatter the poor Sheep of Chriſt, by their damnable Doctrines. Beware, my dear Brethren, of the Leaven, the falſe infectious Doctrine of thoſe <hi>Moravians,</hi> who like the Phariſees of old, are proud <hi>Seperatiſts,</hi> make broad Philacteries, and compaſs Sea and Land to make Proſelytes.

                  <p>Beware of the <hi>Depths of Satan,</hi> Rev. 2.24. Obſerve (ſays Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>) that theſe Seducers, call'd their Doctrines <hi>Depths,</hi> Myſteries, perſwading the People that they had a deeper Inſight into the Myſteries of Religion than others,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005299_0071_1016F797C26B8990"/>
but Chriſt calls them <hi>Depths of Satan,</hi> a Myſtery of Iniquity. To talk of increaſing <hi>Love to Chriſt,</hi> in uncouth Terms, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his Wounds, while <hi>Truth</hi> is abandoned as a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, is ridiculous Giberiſh; for Chriſt is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</hi> To talk of a <hi>Simplicity,</hi> which conſiſts in real Folly, in believing Contradictions, in tamely yielding up Chriſt's precious Truths, becauſe of the ſuperficial Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of ſeducing Strangers, is very unaccountable: What is this Simplicity, but the deteſtable Doctrine of the Roman Catholicks, new vaump'd by the Moravians? who are as ſubtle a Sect of People, and that under a Pretence of Simplicity, as has appeared on the Stage of the World for many Years.</p>
                  <p>I can't but think, and that from ſome particular Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the Conduct of ſome of them, that they fall far ſhort of many other Enthuſiaſts, in <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Honeſty.</hi> Watch therefore, my dear Brethren, ſtand faſt in the Faith, quite you like Men, be ſtrong. O be not as Children toſſed to and fro with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Craftineſs of thoſe who lie in wait to deceive. Away with thoſe <hi>ſorry Shews</hi> of Zeal, Piety and Meekneſs, which have not Truth and Humility for their Foundation. May the God of Truth graciouſly baffle all the crafty Schemes, and coloured Intrigues, of all ſchiſmatical, enthuſiaſtical and deceitful <hi>Babel-builders!</hi> who under the Mask of Humility and Love, declare their Pride and Enmity in <hi>ſeparating</hi> from the Proteſtant reformed Churches, and in deſpiſing and tearing of them in Pieces, as far and as faſt as they can. Who that has got the leaſt Spark of Love to the God of Truth, can be altogether tame and ſilent upon ſo mournful an Occaſion, and patiently ſuffer the carved Work of the Temple to be pull'd down by proud <hi>Seperatiſts?</hi> Was not <hi>Meroz</hi> curſed, becauſe he did not <hi>come up to the Help of the Lord againſt the Mighty?</hi> What, my Brethren, ſhall we thro' baſe Indifferency, let thoſe dear and amiable Truths, which have coſt our Anceſtors Blood, ſlip away by <hi>Moravian</hi> Hands? God forbid! Let us awake, my Brethren, out of ſtupid Indolence, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Lukewarmneſs, and with humble, impregnable Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, contend for the Faith once delivered to the Saints!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="unknown:005299_0072_1016F79A8C110128"/>But pray, <hi>why</hi> do any eſteem this new upſtart <hi>Moravian</hi> Sect? Is it,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For their Shew of <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Harmleſsneſs?</hi> But may not Perſons, under this Guiſe, have cruel Deſigns and Diſpoſitions? Don't our Lord tell us, that Wolves ſhall come in Sheeps Cloathing? And what is this Sheeps Cloathing, but a Covert of Meekneſs and Harmleſsneſs? But what Evidence have we that the Moravians are really meek, when we ſee them not expoſed to Temptations? They generally ſhun Debate, which would try their Meekneſs: but if any of them happen to be try'd a little, they ſhew their Weakneſs as much as other People. Beſides, it ought to be conſidered, that there is a threefold Meekneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Natural; ſpringing from a natural Temper of a milder Mould. 2. Moral; proceeding principally from ſelfiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations; theſe two are of little Moment. And 3. There is a ſinful Meekneſs; that is, when Perſons are Lukewarm about God's Truths, as the Moravians are. But while the Moravians cover themſelves with a Sheep-Skin, like cruel Wolves they ſcatter the poor Sheep of Chriſt. Like Foxes they craftily and ſneakingly creep into the Vineyard, and ſpoil the tender Grapes with their deteſtable Deluſions. How very different are the Fruits of their coming into this Country, from the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD'S? His plain and pungent Preaching of the Truths of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, united generally the Hearts of good Men thro' the Land. But the Moravians where-ever they have any Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, divide the People of God, and ſet them a jangling.</p>
                  <p>How very different are theſe Men from the Spirit of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> whom they pretend a Reſpect to. He was ſo zealous for Truth, that he expreſſed himſelf thus, reſpecting it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Madneſs was better than Mildneſs in the Cauſe of God: Rather, ſaid he, let Heaven and Earth ruſh together, than one <hi>Crumb</hi> of Truth ſhould periſh. <hi>Potius Caelum et Terra ruerent, quam una mica veritatis periret.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Is it becauſe they <hi>ſmile</hi> generally, and appear <hi>loving?</hi> But, Brethren, is not this <hi>Judas</hi>-like, to betray us with a Kiſs? For while they ſhew ſuch Love, they draw pious People into Error, and ſo ſet them a quarelling with one

another. If this be their Love, may the good Lord deliver us from it! Shall we ſuffer them to ſmile us out of our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? Then I'm ſure we are poorly grounded in them. Away, away with ſuch ſordid Complyance!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is it becauſe they profeſs they are <hi>Catholick,</hi> or againſt all Sectarianiſm? This is indeed a moſt ſubtle Deviſe: for while they talk ſo, they are buſily making a new Sect; and thoſe that join with it, how ever ignorant, erroneous, or dark in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they be, they are preſently eſteemed and careſſed, while all others who will not join with them, how knowing and experienced ſoever they be in Chriſtianity, are deſpiſed. Beſides, as I am informed, they will join with no Church but their own. Or,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Is it becauſe of their Shew of <hi>Humility,</hi> while in the mean Time they <hi>undervalue all but themſelves?</hi> Some of the Heads of that Party, have ſpoken moſt reproachfully in <hi>New-Brunſwick</hi> of all the Proteſtant reformed Churches. One of them in my hearing compared them to <hi>Babel.</hi> Is this Humility, to imagine themſelves more advanced in Grace, than all the World beſides? I'm ſure, it's of a different Stamp from that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who look'd upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be leſs than the leaſt of all Saints. And thoſe whom they <hi>proſelyte,</hi> in the midſt of their ignorant Zeal, betray horrible Arrogance, in proudly diſdaining all the Churches of Chriſt when compared with their Sect.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Is it becauſe they have the Appearance of great <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification?</hi> I anſwer, their Mortification is not agreable to the Scriptures; becauſe they are ignorant of a preparatory Work of the Law. If we may believe Count <hi>Zinzendorf,</hi> when they are converted in their Way, they are free from Complaints of Sin and Struggles with it, and ſo get into a Sleep. What is this but the Fruit of Blindneſs &amp; Deluſion? <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony: if they ſpeak not according thereto, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Is it becauſe they <hi>ſay</hi> they have <hi>Communion with God,</hi> and in Conſequence hereof <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs?</hi> I anſwer; When we conſider the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Principles they hold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith and Juſtification, as well as the proud Effects of their pretended good Frames, and that under a Maſk of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:005299_0074_1016F7A3185504E8"/>
Humility; as alſo their denial of a Law-Work; We have great Reaſon to ſuſpect their <hi>Communion</hi> to be but a Deluſion of the grand Enemy, and their <hi>Joys</hi> to be the Joys of Time-Believers, and Stony-Ground Hearers. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. True Communion with God does certainly <hi>humble</hi> the Soul. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Job</hi> 42.5, 6. It's no new Thing for <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> to talk of Joys and Comforts. The old <hi>Antinomians</hi> were won't to commend their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to others by this, that they were an experienced Cure to all Soul-Trouble. And it's true enough, they are a Cure, but a falſe one.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moravians,</hi> with their Brethren the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and other Enthuſiaſts, ſeem to forget both the Doctrine and Practice of <hi>Repentance.</hi> I don't remember to find any thing of it in the <hi>Count's</hi> Sermons, neither can I perceive any thing of it in their Practice. But why ſhould they <hi>repent,</hi> while they pretend to <hi>Perfection?</hi> No, no; they have got above that in their own Conceit. Now ſeeing their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts don't come after the Exerciſe of Repentance for Sin, have we not Reaſon to ſuſpect them?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Is it becauſe they <hi>travel</hi> and <hi>take great Pains?</hi> I anſwer, Did not the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old <hi>compaſs Sea and Land,</hi> to make one Proſelyte; and when he was made, was he not twofold more a <hi>Child of Hell</hi> than themſelves? And do not <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and many other Enthuſiaſts, travel ſtill?

                  <p>But they are <hi>deny'd to the World.</hi> Anſ. So was <hi>Diogenes</hi> in his Time.

                     <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> relate of the <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> a ſuperſtitious Sect among the <hi>Jews,</hi> not much better than the <hi>Pagans,</hi> that they contemned the World; they were not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abſtemious as to ſenſual Pleaſures, but ſo far deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis'd Riches, that none was admitted into their Society till he had parted with all his Poſſeſſions.</p>
                  <p>Yea, many of the <hi>Pagans</hi> contemned Wealth, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly among the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> It is reported of <hi>Phocion,</hi> who was forty five Times choſen Governour of <hi>Athens,</hi> and had thereby the greateſt Opportunity to enrich himſelf, that he lived in a State of voluntary Poverty: when <hi>Alexander</hi> offered him a Donation of nineteen Thouſand Pounds value, and beſides his Choice of one of the four Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for his conſtant Support, he refuſed both. <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> the brave <hi>Theban</hi> General, in the midſt of Opportunities to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich himſelf, liv'd ſo meanly, that he had but one Coat; ſo that when that was ſent to the Fullers, he was oblig'd to keep at Home till it was brought back.

The Count not giving Liberty for two to be preſent with him at one Time, when Queſtions were ask'd about religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Matters, there was no Room left for a joint Teſtimony to all the following Articles.</p>
                  <p>The miſchievous Effects of the Moravian Converſation, in ſome Places in this Part of <hi>America,</hi> in corrupting reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Perſons with falſe Notions of divine Things, and in making unhappy Diviſions among them; together with their extraordinary Method of concealing (generally) their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Principles, is I think a ſufficient Apology for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Eſſay to diſcover them to the World, in the Manner I have now taken. Now the Particulars are theſe following:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is not needful to preach the Law, but hurtful, under the Goſpel Diſpenſation.</p>

                  <p>Here I ſhall beg Leave to ſubjoin the Extract of a Letter from Mr. <hi>John Stockers,</hi> Merchant of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> (a Perſon of good Character) dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1741, to Mr. <hi>George Brinkerhoff</hi> Merchant of <hi>New-York,</hi> relating to the <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi> or <hi>Herenhouters,</hi> tranſlated from the Dutch.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Herenhouters,</hi> much might be ſaid, beyond the Bounds of a Letter. The paſtoral Letter is a lively Repreſentation of them. Mr. <hi>Kulencamp</hi> the Author of that Letter, has wrote two other ſmall Tracts againſt them; and alſo the Reverend Mr. <hi>Knypers;</hi> and three Profeſſors; <hi>viz.</hi> the Reverend Meſſieurs <hi>Honert, Voget,</hi> and <hi>Gelders,</hi> have wrote againſt them.</p>
                     <p>I account them a miſchievous People, worſe than ever the <hi>Labadiſts</hi> appeared to be, who were orthodox in the Point of Juſtification: but theſe People have a Mixture of many Errors, I ſhall mention ſome of the chief.</p>
                     <p>That Man is Part of the divine Being.</p>
                     <p>They hold the Perfection of the Saints in this Life.</p>
                     <p>They believe that Saints may fall away; and likewiſe that one may be ſaved in the Profeſſion of the Pagan and Jewiſh-Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="unknown:005299_0083_1016F7BA2B63DD48"/>They believe that all Men, yea and even the very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ill be ſaved.</p>
                     <p>Who will not be aſtoniſhed at ſuch Propoſitions, from Men who give themſelves out for abſolved Chriſtians, who are bought by the Price of the Blood of the Lamb! and who are ſimple and harmleſs, while they are full of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety, and cheriſh a Complication of Errors.</p>
                     <p>They are alſo inſincere and inconſiſtent with themſelves, propoſing that at one Time, which at another Time they will deny; going about with Untruths; having no Regard for the Truths and the written Word, pretending that they have Chriſt within them, to be a living Bible; and ſuch like Things as theſe.</p>
                     <p>Their Meetings are no more ſuffered amongſt us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither inſtructive nor profitable. They will read a Chapter out of the Bible, particularly out of the new Teſtament; upon which they ſpeak in ſome confuſed Manner; ſing ſome of their Hymns; and it may be they will pray, which has but little in it. See here in brief ſomething of them.</p>
                     <p>They were treated in a mild and in a friendly Manner, but would not ſuffer themſelves to be examined. Its true they don't belong to the reformed Church, but they pretend to go between the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and the reformed Church, and that they are neither of the one nor of the other, but that they come neareſt the <hi>Lutheran.</hi> The Lord be praiſed, they have not triumph'd, for by that Means all Religion would have been in Confuſion, and the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truths taken away; by which the Church muſt either ſtand or fall. Therefore away with ſuch! Or as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>from ſuch turn away.</hi> Thus far with Reſpect to the <hi>Herenhouters.</hi>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Finley,</hi> a Preacher of the Goſpel, informs me, in a Letter from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> bearing Date, <hi>February</hi> 15. 1742.</p>
                  <p>That he had ſome Diſcourſe with Count <hi>Zinzendorf</hi> by an Interpreter, (he refuſing to diſcourſe with him in Latin, becauſe he was a Presbyterian) the Sum of which was as follows:</p>

                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:005299_0084_1016F7BD76DF35F0"/>
                     <p n="1">1. The Count being asked, whether the Apoſtle ſpake of himſelf as unconverted, thro' the whole ſeventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans?</hi> He anſwered in Engliſh; Yes; doubtleſs as unconverted.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Reſpecting Perfection. The Count would ſeem to grant that true Chriſtians had Sin; and yet when I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to prove this, he would again ſet up againſt me: this was juſt the Caſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I inquired whether <hi>David</hi> was graceleſs when he committed Adultery? He anſwered, Yes. And all the Diſtinction he uſed reſpecting this, was that there was Grace in Store for <hi>David,</hi> but that he had not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I inquired about Juſtification, whether it was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? He anſwered yes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I ask'd of what Uſe Faith was in <hi>Juſtification?</hi> He anſwered, that it was a Manifeſtation of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I inquired, Whether one that had Juſtification mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted clearly to his Conſcience, could ever doubt of it? He anſwered, that he might afterwards doubt of it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, I inquired, whether the Saints would have need of Faith to all Eternity? He anſwered, Yes; and inſiſted on it: But by this Time it was nine of the Clock at Night, and our Converſation ended.</p>

                  <p>He likewiſe call'd the Proteſtant Churches a <hi>Babel</hi> (their's excepted) or compared them thereto.

Indeed the laſt Time that I ſaw him, he ſeemed to be of a different Opinion as to the laſt Particular: but I have ſeen and heard of ſo much incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent Conduct in him and others of that Sect, that I can hardly avoid a Jealouſy of his Sincerity in that Matter: and ſeeing the Count materially aſſerts it in his Sermons, as I have ſhewn before, there is the more Reaſon to believe him and others of that Party to be guilty.</p>

                  <p>He run down human Reaſon, as if it were uſeleſs in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and in the Room thereof inculcated the Doctrine of Simplicity, which in their Senſe of it, upon mature and frequent Deliberation, I cannot but take to be real Folly and implicit Faith, a believing of Nonſenſe, Contradictions, and myſterious Gibberiſh. When they aſſert groſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, they tell us that we muſt believe ſimply; that is, we muſt quit our Reaſon, and turn real Fools: we muſt believe thro' thick and thin, Abſurdities and Nonſenſe, and ſo turn Papiſts. Let Simpletons, who ſeem willing to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any Thing, conſider ſeriouſly and ſeaſonably the Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God himſelf by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 1.22. <hi>How long ye ſimple ones will ye love Simplicity? and the Scorners delight in
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:005299_0107_1016F801B176A0D0"/>
their Scorning, and Fools hate Knowledge? Turn you at my Reproof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is exceeding artful in the Moravians to inculcate this popiſh Doctrine, at their firſt coming among a People eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; for when once they have drunk in that, their Work is done; they may turn them into any Shape they will: Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Argument are rendred uſeleſs; a Shadow of Plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is enough. Thus the Moravians endeavour to uſe us, as the Philiſtines did <hi>Samſon,</hi> firſt pull out our Eyes, and lead us where they will in Triumph.</p>
                  <p>I might have taken Notice of more exceptionable Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in the Count's Sermons; but what I have taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, are ſufficient to convince all, that are not blinded with Prejudice, or given up to ſatanical Deluſion, that their Principles are moſt deteſtable!</p>
                  <p>I expect that the Moravians will uſe Fox-like Shifts, to evade the Diſcovery of their heretical and horrible Principles, by the preceeding Letters and Extracts, as they have done reſpecting what the Count ſaid in <hi>New-Brunſwick.</hi> But Truth is great, and will prevail at laſt over Error and Artifice, and baffle all the ſly Tricks of Seducers, who lie in wait to deceive ignorant, ſimple, and unſtable Souls.</p>
                  <p>If any Perſon queſtion my Candor, I adviſe them to get the Count's Book, and read it themſelves deliberately and impartially, and ask for Light from Heaven to help them to diſtinguiſh between Truth and Error.</p>
                  <p>It is contrary to my intended Brevity, to enter upon a particular Confutation of all the Errors contained in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; that would ſwell this Volumn to too great a Bulk: and indeed many of the Errors are ſo abſurd, that the bare mentioning of them is Confutation enough, to Perſons of Judgment that are freed from a partial Byaſs.</p>
                  <p>What are the Count's Sermons but a bundle of Contradictions and Nonſenſe, damnable Errors &amp; Hereſies, interſperſed with Paſſages of Truth and Senſe? In them a preparatory Work by the Law of God is denied, Repentance excluded, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection aſſerted eighteen Times, and denied twice; a new Purgatory invented, as well as a new Election from the Time of Chriſt's Death! In them the great Articles of
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:005299_0108_1016F806216FAD58"/>
Faith and Juſtification are dreadfully corrupted; hiſtorical Faith is aſſerted to be ſaving; and all Perſons are ſaid to be juſtified from the Time of Chriſt's Death; the active O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Chriſt is excluded from bearing any Part in our Juſtification and Salvation! In them Enthuſiaſm is aſſerted, and recommended in diverſe Inſtances; as well as all Uſe of Means with Sinners, to inſtruct &amp; alarm them, denied! In them all Manner of Wickedneſs is encouraged, as the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Way to Converſion; all Virtue and religious Duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing'd and diſcouraged: according to them, no Means muſt be uſed by poor Sinners to obtain Converſion! In them Sin is repreſented as a meer Triffle, unworthy of our Fear or Grief! In them the Happineſs of Heaven is deſtroyed, by making the Saints to be poor and needy there! In them the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt are condemned for uſing Means with poor Sinners, to convince them of their Miſery, and bring them to Jeſus! In them the preaching of Terror to the unregerate is deny'd, which is ſo frequently inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Word of God, and which was practis'd by Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles! In them Chriſt's Propitiation for Sins in Eternity, is aſſerted! In them univerſal Redemption, and univerſal Salvation, are aſſerted; as well as Inſpiration after the apoſtolical Times! In them our Lord is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as paying a Ranſom after his Death for Perſons under Conviction! which is not only contrary to expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26, 28.) but notoriouſly dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the Sufficiency of the Atonement of our Lord Jeſus in his Life, and at his Death for his Elect. In them the deteſtable Arminian Doctrines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Free-Will, and the final Apoſtacy of the Saints are inculcated; and thus the Pride of Sinners is flattered, and the Foundation of the Saints Comforts ſhut up and ſeal'd! In them the Count urges the univerſal Neceſſity of Aſſurance on Pain of Death eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal! And in the mean Time informs us, that Perſons are ſpiritually alive and dead at the ſame Time! He tells us that when the Spirit convinces Perſons they are loſt, and have no Intereſt in the Kingdom of God, then they are found, they are Brethren, they are Children of God! Now either two contradictory Propoſitions can be both true at once, which
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:005299_0109_1016F807A6679E88"/>
is impoſſible in the Nature of Things, or elſe the Count charges a Falſhood upon the Spirit of God. In them the Doctrine of original Sin imputed is denied, and the popiſh Doctrine of the Sacraments aſſerted! In them a good Tho't at Death is repreſented a ſufficient to obtain Happineſs! In them Sin is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed to be ſomething mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial; and if ſo, God muſt needs be the Author of it, for he has made all Subſtances! In them God's holy Law is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as the Cauſe of Sin: if ſo, then God himſelf is the Cauſe of Sin, for he is the Author of the Law, and indeed it is but the Image of his moral Excellencies! It is a vile Abuſe of that Paſſage of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> (1 Cor. 15.56. <hi>The Strength of Sin is the Law,</hi>) to conclude from hence that the Law is the Cauſe of Sin: The Meaning of the aforeſaid Place is elſewhere explained by the ſame Apoſtle, viz. Rom. 7.1. <hi>For Sin taking Occaſion by the Commandment deceived me, and by it ſlew me.</hi> The obſtinate Corruption of our Nature, may unreaſonably take Occaſion, from the juſt Reſtraints of the Commandment to rage the more; but that is not the Fault of the Law, but of our corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Was then that which is good Death to me?</hi> ſays the Apoſtle! <hi>God forbid!</hi> The Apoſtle rejects the Notion of the Law's being the Cauſe of his Sin, with great Indignation; he ſhews that this cannot be, Verſes 12, 13, 14. Becauſe <hi>the Law is holy, juſt and good:</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, that which is holy cannot be the Cauſe of it's contrary; for like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces like: <hi>But Sin that it might appear Sin, working Death in me by that which is Good, that Sin by the Commandment might appear exceeding ſinful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Knowledge of Sin,</hi> and that it <hi>works Wrath:</hi> how therefore can it be the Cauſe of Sin? No; it is the Corruption of Nature, which is the Cauſe of actual Tranſgreſſion: <hi>But I am carnal, ſold under Sin.</hi> To turn from the moral Law as a Rule of Life, is not the Way to Freedom from Sin, but to Death in Sin.</p>
                  <p>The Moravian Notion about the Law, is a Myſtery of deteſtable Iniquity! And indeed this ſeems to me to be
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:005299_0110_1016F8092C24A4D8"/>
the main Spring of their unreaſonable, anti-evangelical, and licentious Religion!</p>
                  <p>But I have not Time at preſent, to mention all the other Abominations of the Count's Sermons!</p>
                  <p>And now having had a Taſte of their Principles, let us proceed to a brief Reflection, upon their Experience and Practice.</p>
                  <p>As to their Converſion, and after Experiences; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the moſt of them (if we credit the Count's Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that he knows pretty well the State of his own Sect,) is very ſlighty, it's without any preparatory Law Work, done in a Moment. If they have received the aforeſaid Doctrines, have we not Reaſon to fear that their Converſion is but a ſtrong Flight of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, or a ſatanical Deluſion. And we have the more Reaſon for the Fear aforeſaid, when we conſider how eaſy they are generally after their ſuppoſed Converſion, without Fears, without Complaints of Sin, Strangers to the ſpiritual War, Strangers to the Knowledge of their own Hearts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in one ſort of Frame, or as it were put to ſleep and happy, as the Count expreſſes it. Did not the Seed ſown on the ſtony Ground ſpring up quickly; but on the contrary, did not the good Ground bring forth Fruit with Patience? Did not the poor Man in the Goſpel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vail his Unbelief? And are we not commanded to fight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Fight of Faith? If we will believe the Scriptures, does not their Converſion and Experiences look like Preſumption and Deluſion? Their groſs Ignorance about the Nature of a true and ſaving Faith, adds awful Weight to what has been now obſerved!</p>
                  <p>I wonder not at their Eaſe, when I conſider what Sort of Faith paſſes for ſaving among them; and ſeeing they lay ſo much Streſs upon an hiſtorical or temporary Faith, and reject the Law of God, by which is the Knowledge of Sin; how can they be otherwiſe than eaſy? for without the Law Sin is dead, as to our Apprehenſion and Feeling; i.e. we have no true Sight and Senſe of the Evil and Danger of Sin without the Law.</p>
                  <p>As to the Spirit of the Moravians; Do not a Number of them ſeem to be proud under a Mask of Humility; while
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005299_0111_1016F80C010F87B8"/>
they look upon themſelves and their Party, to be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in Grace, than Perſons of any other Denomination? How will ſuch a Spirit accord with the Example of <hi>Paul,</hi> who look'd upon himſelf to be far leſs than the leaſt of all Saints? and with the Command of God, that every Man ſhould eſteem another better than himſelf?</p>
                  <p>Are not the Moravians many of them uncharitable and diviſive in their Speech and Practice, and that under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Charity &amp; Catholiciſm? Witneſs Mr. <hi>Spangenberg</hi>'s comparing the Proteſtant Churches to a Babel, and the Count's calling their Converſion by the Law a Deluſion? (before mentioned;) Witneſs their not being willing to join with any Proteſtant Body of Men, and yet their receiving Perſons of diverſe Societies to their Fellowſhip, with little Examination as to their Principles.</p>
                  <p>Do not thoſe Things, together with their ſending of their ignorant Miſſionaries to gather ſeparate Societies in Places, where there is a ſound Miniſtry, ſignify that their Deſign is not Catholick, whatever their Pretences be not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding?</p>
                  <p>The Count's bitter and contemptuous Speeches in <hi>New-Brunſwick,</hi> againſt the Body of the reformed Churches, gives additional Evidence, to what I have now obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>And is there no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> much Enthuſiaſm in the Moravian Method of Management, in theſe Inſtances following; viz. in neglecting Family Prayer; in ſending out Miſſionaries, without human Learning; and in their Preaching (ordinarily) without Study, and without Prayer before or after, or both?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there is much cunning in their Practice, cloak'd with an Appearance of Simplicity, as is evident from the following Particulars, in their Method of propagating their Sect, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. They labour to be acquainted with others Principles, and accommodate themſelves ſo far to them in Diſcourſe, as will not conſiſt with Truth. A late Inſtance of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in one of the Moravian Party called Mr. <hi>Betener,</hi> who in my hearing, expreſsly contradicted himſelf in the ſpace of two or three Minutes; a Perſon of Diſtinction being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. At firſt be aſſerted that pious People could know
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005299_0112_1016F80F3090C128"/>
others certainly, and offered ſomewhat in Confirmation of that deteſtable Notion, in Anſwer to what was objected againſt it: but being aſked by another Perſon after this Manner; You don't think that a good Man can know ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infallibly? No, ſaid he!</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I have been inform'd by ſome Perſons of Credit, that B. <hi>Witſman</hi>'s Wife has denied ſince what ſhe aſſerted at <hi>New-Brunſwick:</hi> for this, if ſhe will ſuffer the Matter to be examined, ſhe may be proved a Liar.</p>
                  <p>Farther, I am credibly informed, that the Count has in the hearing of ſeveral Perſons, denied the Articles offered againſt him in the beginning of this Appendix, which he expreſſed in <hi>New-Brunſwick,</hi> as they now ſtand; and ſome of them abſolutely and intirely. I leave it to the impartial Reader to judge, whether thoſe Articles be not proved by the Extracts of his Sermons; and hence to form what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he thinks reaſonable, of the Count's Veracity. The Count's denying of them as they ſtand, ſeems to be an artful, but ungenerous Evaſion. What if it was ſo, that his Aſſertions were not put in the ſame Order in which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them? if his Expreſſions are not altered, or his Senſe wronged, and the Articles be put in a more natural Order, where is the Injury?</p>
                  <p>I might mention more Inſtances of other Moravians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere and inconſiſtent Conduct; but theſe at preſent may ſuffice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They hide any of their Principles, that they think will diſguſt. I tho't it ſomething ſtrange, in the Count's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding any Perſon to come into the Room with me, the ſecond Time I attempted to ſee him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They ſpeak ſlightly of the Uſe of good Books. This ſeems to be a crafty Stratagem, to increaſe their Sect; for they may know, that all Books but their own are againſt them, conſidering their Principles complexly. Now their ſlighting the Uſe of good Books, has a Tendency to rob God's People, ſo far as their Influence reaches, of a precious Mean of Inſtruction and Defence, and ſo leaves them more expoſed to the Stratagems of Seducers.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="106" facs="unknown:005299_0113_1016F813568A2828"/>4. Do not ſome Moravians, ſlight human Reaſon and Learning? which (if uſed in their proper Place) are good Bulwarks againſt their inconſiſtent Doctrine: and in the Room thereof commend a Simplicity of dangerous Tendency, as has been before obſerved? I know of no commendable Simplicity, but humility and ſincerity in the Uſe of proper Means; but to believe Contradictions is a deteſtible Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and to expect in ordinary Caſes Bleſſings from God, without the Uſe of proper Means, inſtead of truſting in him, is to tempt him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Do not the Moravians ſpeak ſlightly of Confeſſions of Faith, and ſuch like regular and harmonious Syſtems of Chriſtian Principles? and is not this Political? for has it not a plain Tendency to prepare Perſons to receive their inconſiſtent Medley of Doctrines, which no human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding can harmonize.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Don't the Moravians begin with the Affections firſt? and is this fair Dealing? Do they not endeavour to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate themſelves into People's Affections firſt, by Smiles and ſoft Diſcourſes about the Love of Chriſt, and by a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly innocent ſimple and loving Behaviour? while in the mean Time they carefully hide their Principles, until the Affections are catched, and then let them out by Degrees. Should not they ſhow their Principles firſt, before the Affections are fir'd, that ſo People might judge of them with Calmneſs and Impartiality?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Do not they take ſpecial Care to apply to young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Females, and ignorant People, who are full of Affection? And if any Perſons of Diſtinction are under any good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, thoſe ſhall be taken ſpecial Notice of be ſure: for poor ignorant young Creatures under their firſt Love, are eaſily led aſide by fair Shews. And there muſt be if they can, ſome Perſons of Note and Figure in every Place to grace their Sect, and gain Proſelytes to it. Who do they imitate in attacking the weaker Part of Man, viz. the Paſſions; and the weaker Sex firſt; but the Devil the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lies and Errors? Did not he deal thus with our firſt Parents, and by the weaker Sex ſeduc'd <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="unknown:005299_0114_1016F817AAB27F08"/>And don't they refuſe generally to Reaſon upon Points in Religion, whereby one might convince another, and leave People to be proſelyted by Sight only. It is politick in them indeed to wave Reaſoning and ſhun Diſcovery, for their Principles will bear neither. Let them but appear in their native Deformity, and they will be abhorred? My Soul is grieved to ſee the childiſh Fickleneſs of the Sons &amp; Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Generation! who are toſſed about with every Wind of Doctrine; who are juſt ſmil'd out of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without being able to offer one ſolid Reaſon for their Change.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They endeavour to unhinge People as to their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principles, with their confuſed Invectives againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs to be as zealous in Degree, for ſmaller Points in Religion as for greater, is a criminal Bigotry; for Zeal ſhould ſurely be proportioned to the Weight of Things. Likewiſe to entertain uncharitable Thoughts of thoſe who differ from us, only in Circumſtantials; or ſome few leſſer Points of Faith: and no doubt to made Circumſtantials, Terms of Communion, is Bigotry with a Witneſs. Alſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour rather principally to propagate a Sect by our Zeal, than to promote the general Intereſts of Religion. But it is no Bigotry to hold faſt Chriſt's precious Truths in Affection and Practice, and to defend them againſt all Oppoſers; for this is but the Command of God. And without this a pretended Zeal for Holineſs is of no Moment. And we find our Lord and his Apoſtles uſed Sharpneſs in dealing with falſe Teachers, calling them Wolves, Dogs, Serpents, Vipers!</p>
                  <p>Indeed to eſſay to impoſe our Opinion upon others, by Force and Violence, is doubtleſs a deteſtable Bigotry; for every one has an equal Right to think for himſelf, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Argument can only convince the Mind.</p>
                  <p>Certainly we ſhould adhere inviolably to the Principles we have been inſtructed in, until we find better, which we ſhould be always ready to receive upon proper Conviction; which is not to be attained by the Sight of the Grimaces of Strangers, or by immediate Revelations or Enthuſiaſms, but
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005299_0115_1016F81965E77208"/>
by Scripture, Reaſon and Argument. No doubt we ſhould be always open to Light and rational Conviction; but there is a vaſt Difference between this and a childiſh Fickleneſs. Do not thoſe act like Children and Fools, who part with good Principles for bad?</p>
                  <p>I think it looks exceeding black in the Moravians to ſlight ſpeculative Knowledge, ſo as they do, which they call Head-Knowledge. It's true, it is a Sin to reſt ſatisfied with it, without feeling its Power and Influence; but it is not an appointed Mean to obtain what is ſaving; why elſe are the Unconverted enjoined to ſearch the Scriptures? Without Knowledge <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves that the Mind cannot be good; and he ſays that they are Fools who hate it. Is not ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Knowledge the ſame for Subſtance with that which is ſaving, only deſtitute of its Influence upon Heart &amp; Practice? The Moravians by this Method of proceeding, are propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating another damnable Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> namely, that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion.</p>
                  <p>The Moravians ſeem to be aware of this, <hi>viz.</hi> that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Learning, ſound Confeſſions of Faith, and ſpeculative Knowledge, do all of them oppoſe the Spread of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe inconſiſtent Principles, and therefore they labour to pull them down.</p>
                  <p>It is exceeding weak in the Moravians to bring in that Paſſage of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2. <hi>For I determined to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucifyed;</hi> as an Objection againſt ſeeking after Knowledge. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtle means any more by that Paſſage, than that he made Chriſt the Center and Scope of his Knowledge. i. e. that all he knew ſhould have a Reference to Chriſt, either more direct or remote. And have not all the Scriptures this Tendency to exalt Chriſt, to bring Sinners to Chriſt, and to build them up in him? But to imagine that the Apoſtle ſhould confine all his Knowledge to the Paſſion of Chriſt, in any other Senſe, is contrary to Scripture and Reaſon. If ſo, why did he inculcate ſo many other Things in his preaching, and that by immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration? If the aforeſaid Notion were true, a great Part of the Bible would be uſeleſs. But were not theſe Things
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:005299_0116_1016F7E907CA81C0"/>
written for our Learning? Why are we bid to ſearch the Scriptures, if we muſt not labour to underſtand them. The following Place of Scripture, Act. 20.20, 21. and <hi>how I have kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have ſhewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from Houſe to Houſe; teſtifying to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks, Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> may be a Help to explain the other. We can have no juſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Paſſion of Chriſt, without the other Doctrines of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Does it look like the Spirit of Chriſt, that the Moravians in their Practice are ſo careleſs of the ſecure World? What avail their Pretences to Love, while they weaken the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it, viz. Truth? What ſignifies a childiſh Affection, that is not grounded upon Truth and Reaſon?</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, give me Leave to mention one Inſtance more, of the ſtrange unaccountable Doctrine of this new Moravian Sect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtopher Parleus,</hi> one of that Party, declared the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Particulars, at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Samuel Hazard</hi> in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in Preſence of himſelf and Spouſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he did not doubt, but that many who were not given to Chriſt or elected, would in Time be brought to accept of the Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there were others who were charitable, and who did not get the Pardon of their Sins in this World, would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding get their Pardon in the next World: to prove which, he brought this Text; viz. <hi>Make to your ſelves Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteouſneſs, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlaſting Habitatio</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He alſo ſaid, that God was or might be diſappointed, in what he intended; and when this was objected againſt, he explained himſelf thus, viz. that God would not be finally diſappointed of anſwering the End he intended, tho' he might be diſappointed of anſwering that End by the firſt or ſecond Means, &amp;c. which he intended to anſwer it by.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He alſo ſaid, that the Moravians did not look upon Family Prayer to be a Duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="unknown:005299_0117_1016F820677E84F8"/>Here I may add, that Mr. <hi>Theodorus Frelinghauſa,</hi> heard the Count aſſert, the ſecond Article aboveſaid. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over adds, that the Count aſſerted, that many would be ſaved at the Day of Judgment, by the Interceſſion of the Saints, and that he himſelf expected to ſave Thouſands.</p>
                  <p>But I am tir'd with relating their Abominations. I muſt conclude by obſerving, that their Principles tend to deceive Mankind, and fix the World in a fatal Security: they are directly contrary to Scripture, Reaſon, Experience, Antiquity, the Writings of the ableſt and beſt Divines of the Proteſtant Churches, to the Harmony of their Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith, and to the Work of God. O may the GOD of Truth ſave his People from all ſuch Deceivers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Deluſions! <hi>Amen, Amen!</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle having in the preceeding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, diſcours'd upon the prieſtly Office of Chriſt, doth in the beginning of this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the believing Hebrews to a due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the Words before us, two Things require our Notice; namely, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter given to the believing Hebrews, and the Duty to which they are exhorted.</p>
                  <p>The Character is threefold, or contains three Encomiums. (1) The Apoſtle calls them Brethren, partly to ſhew his Condeſcenſion and Love to them; as alſo to ſignify their Duty to each other, namely Love. Then, and never till then, do Chriſtians live like Brethren, when they exerciſe that Love to each other, which <hi>hopes all Things, which ſuffers long and is kind, and is not eaſily provoked, and ſeeketh not her own Things.</hi> It is an aſtoniſhing Stoop of Condeſcenſion,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005299_0120_1016F8279A611CE0"/>
that Jeſus Chriſt is not aſhamed, to call his poor People Brethren. (2) The Apoſtle calls the Hebrews holy; which they were not only by Profeſſion and Dedication, but by Principle and Practice. (3) They are ſaid to be Partakers of the heavenly Calling, i.e. they were effectually reclaimed from Sin to Piety, by the ſpecial Call of God. Which is termed heavenly, becauſe of its Original, Tendency and Iſſue. The Original and Principle thereof, is the Spirit of God from Heaven; the Mean whereby we are called, the Word of God, is ſpiritual and heavenly; the Tendency and Iſſue of the Call is Heaven. The general Courſe of the Affections of thoſe who are called, is towards Heaven, and there is their dwelling Place for ever.</p>
                  <p>In the Duty exhorted to, two Things may be obſerved, namely the Act and Object, (1) The Act, <hi>conſider:</hi> the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Word ſignifies to animadvert, weigh, behold, obſerve, and that with Care &amp; Diligence. (2) The Object, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the anointed Saviour, repreſented by a twofold Character, namely that of an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> and <hi>high Prieſt.</hi> The Word <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſignifies one ſent: the Word <hi>high Prieſt</hi> ſignifies the Prince or Chief of thoſe, whoſe proper Buſineſs it is to manage Things ſacred. <hi>Moſes</hi> was properly an Apoſtle, or Embaſſador, and <hi>Aaron</hi> the chief Prieſt; but one JESUS has fulfilled the Part of both, and that to Perfection. The Word Profeſſion in this Text, (as I conceive) by a Metonimy of the Adjunct, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Religion we profeſs.</p>
                  <p>From the Words I obſerve the following Propoſition, namely <q>That it is the Duty of all true Chriſtians, to conſider <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> as the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſpeaking to the aforeſaid Propoſition, I would obſerve the following Order; namely, 1. Diſcourſe upon the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and Prieſthood of Chriſt. 2. Shew how we ſhould conſider them. 3. Why. And then proceed to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:005299_0121_1016F82A74131DA0"/>The firſt General Head, is the Apoſtolate of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>An Apoſtle as was before obſerved, ſignifies One ſent, a Meſſenger or Ambaſſador. Here therefore let us tranſiently obſerve, in ſome Inſtances, the Analogy between our Lord and ſuch.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles were immediately ſent by Chriſt, inſpir'd with Wiſdom to unvail the Myſteries of Peace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had been long conceal'd, as well as endowed with Power to perform miraculous Works in Confirmation of them.</p>
                  <p>Thus our Saviour, who is the Wiſdom and Power of God, came not of himſelf, but the Father ſent him, to declare glad Tydings to the Poor; —and this Meſſage he confirmed not only by his Life, and Miracles, but by his Blood.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles were to take Care of the Churches; and in Purſuance hereof they travelled unweariedly from Place to Place, preaching the Goſpel, thro' good Report and bad Report, till they had finiſhed their Courſe, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to him that judgeth righteouſly.</p>
                  <p>Thus our Lord the great Apoſtle, bore upon his bleſſed Boſom, the Weight of the whole Church: in his humbled State, he travelled from Place to Place, indefatigably preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, and doing Good; in the Face of all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, Contempt and Danger, 'till he had compleated his Mediatorial Work, and could ſay, <hi>Father it is finiſhed, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Embaſſador or Meſſenger of Peace from a Prince, is not only a Perſon of Honour, Integrity, and Skill; who is concerned to negociate in Matters of greateſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to the Weal or Wo of Nations, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned by the Prince that ſends him, whom in his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy he repreſents.</p>
                  <p>And is not our Lord a Perſon of the higheſt Renown and Dignity, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, poſſeſſed of a Retinue of innumerable Angels? The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true Witneſs, the wonderful Counſeller? Has not this Apoſtle, this Meſſenger of the Covenant, come from Heaven to Earth, with an Embaſſy of Peace and Salvation, which unſpeakably concerns our everlaſting Weal? Him
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005299_0122_1016F82D4B9AB018"/>
hath God the Father ſealed, and by him is the Perſon of the Father repreſented. So that he who <hi>honoureth the Son, honoureth the Father alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Meſſenger or Ambaſſador, is ſometimes ſent to put an End to War, that hereby the diſmal Conſequences thereof, may be prevented: To this Purpoſe, he is to make Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Peace, on certain Terms, which he is veſted with a Power to ratify.</p>
                  <p>Has not our Lord by his Goſpel, made Propoſals of Peace and Pardon, to the vileſt Rebels, upon equal and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Terms, viz. of Faith and Repentance, that hereby the unjuſt and unequal War, commenc'd againſt God by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Apoſtacy may be iſſued, and ſo the damning Conſequences of Rebellion prevented; and are not the aforeſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals ratified by the Mediator's Blood?</p>
                  <p>A Meſſenger is apt to be grieved, when his Meſſage is ſlighted, upon the Foreſight of the Calamities conſequent hereupon, for when the Treaty of Peace expires, a Scene of Deſolation and Blood opens!</p>
                  <p>Thus when our compaſſionate Apoſtle, drew near to the City of Jeruſalem, he wept over it, ſaying, <hi>If thou hadſt known in this thy Day, the Things that concerned thy Peace, but now they are hid from thine Eyes!</hi> O will it not be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of the Lord, than for thoſe, who ungratefully ſlight the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Offers of this Meſſenger of the Covenant, this A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtle of our Profeſſion!</p>
                  <p>When Ambaſſadors have faithfully delivered their Embaſſy, are they not at their Return, received with Honour? Thus with what inexpreſſible Honours and Acclamations of Joy, was our dear Lord received by the heavenly Hoſts, when he aſcended up on high, and led Captivity Captive! Did not all the proſtrate Ranks of Saints and Seraphims, caſt their Crowns at the Feet of our Immanuel on this Occaſion? who was ſet at the right Hand of the Majeſty on high, cloathed with all the Enſigns of Power, Greatneſs and Glory!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:005299_0123_1016F82EDA5977D8"/>But I proceed to Diſcourſe upon the Prieſthood of Chriſt, That our Lord is a Prieſt, is evident from the Oath of God the Father, Pſal. 110.4. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the Order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck.</hi> Hence he is called our Ranſom, Propitiation, Paſſover, and Advocate with the Father.</p>
                  <p>And hence have we ſo many Types of his prieſtly Office. The common <hi>Levitical Prieſts,</hi> were Figures of him; in their teaching of the People the Knowledge of the Law, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. In their ſounding of the Trumpets, either as an Alarm to War, or to aſſemble the People.</p>
                  <p>Thus our Lord ſounds the Goſpel Trumpet as an Alarm to ſpiritual War here, and will make the Arch-Angel's Trumpet ſnake the Creation hereafter, to form the laſt Grand Aſſize.</p>
                  <p>But the Prieſts were eſpecially Figures of him, in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices for the Sins of the People, and in judging of the Plague of Leproſy, and ſo pronouncing them clean and unclean. If it had reach'd the Head, the Perſon was to be pronounced unclean. So truly it is an awful Sign of a bad State, when Errors about important Points of Doctrine corrupt the Judgment. As our Lord gave himſelf a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Sin, ſo he is the final Judge of the Plague of every Man's Heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was doubtleſs a Type of our Lord, in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called the King of Righteouſneſs and Peace. Theſe repreſented the everlaſting Righteouſneſs and Peace, which the Redeemer introduced, and procured by his Blood and Obedience. <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abram,</hi> and received Tyths of him, by which was doubtleſs ſignified, the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Excellency of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, to the Levitical. <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> had no Predeceſſor or Succeſſor in his Office, and his Age and Genealogy was deſignedly concealed, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the ineffable Generation and eternal Duration of Chriſt, as alſo that he had no Rivals or Succeſſors in his prieſtly Office.</p>
                  <p>But the high Prieſt was an illuſtrious Type of Chriſt, in the following Inſtances.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005299_0124_1016F83314930F30"/>1. In Reſpect of his Call to his Office: He took not this Honour to himſelf, but was call'd of God and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by Impoſition of Hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.10. Thus our Lord glorified not himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. but was ſealed or commiſſioned by his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In his Unction for his Office: <hi>Lev.</hi> 8.12. and was not our Lord anointed with the Oyl of Gladneſs, above his Fellows?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In his peculiar Ornaments, namely his holy Crown, his Mitre, Girdle, and Breaſt-Plate: All which typified the tranſcendent Excellency of Chriſt's Prieſthood!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The high Prieſt's bearing the Names of the twelve Tribes on his Breaſt-Plate, when he appeared before God, ſeems to repreſent the affectionate Remembrance our Lord hath of his whole Church, when he intercedes for them with his Father. The <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> on the Breaſt-Plate, ſignifying Light and Integrity, was doubtleſs a Figure of the Sufficiency of Chriſt's Prophetical Office, to anſwer all the Difficulties of his People.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The high Prieſt's yearly entrance into the Holy of Holies, and that not without Blood, to make Atonement, doubtleſs prefigured our Lord's Entrance into Heaven, as Mediator for us, in Vertue of his meritorious Blood, to make Atonement for all his Elect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The high Prieſt's being without Blemiſh, and the Cleanneſs of his Robes, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. ſhadowed forth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Purity of our high Prieſt Chriſt Jeſus, who was holy, harmleſs, undefiled.—</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As the high Prieſt only made Perfume, for burnt Offerings, ſo it is Chriſt alone who by the Incenſe of his Merits, can perfume our Devotions, and render them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The high Prieſt's Death, ſet the Man-ſlayer free, who had fled to the City of Refuge: and does not the Death of our great high Prieſt ſet all thoſe guilty Creatures free, who fly to him for Shelter? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 32.1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Now the Neceſſity of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, will appear by conſidering,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005299_0125_1016F835E2684210"/>1. The Wrong that by Sin is offered to the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: it being a Contempt of his Authority, an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of his Mercy, and a Contrariety to all the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Nature, as well as Precepts of his Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a Neceſſity of making Satisfaction for the Wrong done by Sin, becauſe of the governing Juſtice, Wiſdom, and Truth of God. Sin becauſe of its vile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, deſerves Puniſhment; and it is contrary to the divine Wiſdom to diſpenſe with it, without Satisfaction made; becauſe this tends to deſtroy all Government.</p>
                  <p>In order to Government there muſt be Laws, and that enforced by proper Sanctions; but unleſs the Sanctions or Penalties be executed upon Tranſgreſſors, they are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant Scare-crows. But the Almighty is obliged by his Truth, to inflict the Penalty of Death annexed to the Breach of the firſt Covenant, either upon the Sinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or a Surety in his Room and Place. I add,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That there is an utter Inability in Man, to make Satisfaction to divine Juſtice, either by doing or ſuffering. His Performances, thro' an inherent and univerſal Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Nature, are imperfect and due to God, on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Creation, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6. Now what is ſinful it ſelf can never make Satisfaction for Sin. The Payment of Debt we owe as Creatures, can never pay another Debt, which we owe as Tranſgreſſors. And if Man ſatisfies by Suffering, it muſt be by ſuch as is infinite, in Weight or Continuance, for leſs is not equal to the Demerit of Sin, which is objectively infinite, and what is leſs than its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, a juſt God will not accept of. Now a Puniſhment infinite in Weight, would cruſh a finite Creature to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and if it be infinite in Continuance, it will make it for ever miſerable.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſthood of Chriſt, is that Mediatorial Office of our Lord, whereby he offers himſelf, as a propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Sin, interceeds for his People, and bleſſeth them.</p>
                  <p>The</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Act of Chriſt's Prieſtly Office, is to <hi>offer Sacrifice for Sin</hi> (Heb. 5.3.10.14.) namely, ſuch in which God might reſt, and for which, he might be reconciled to the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005299_0126_1016F838B1651C70"/>
Sinner. Here let it be conſidered, that the Perſon offering, was the Mediator God-Man, according to both Natures. (2) The Sacrifice offered, was himſelf, properly as to his human Nature; hence it is aſcrib'd to his Body, his Blood, his Soul. (3) The Altar was himſelf, conſidered as to his divine Nature: for as from the Altar, ſprings the Value and Efficacy of the Sacrifice, ſo on the Deity of Chriſt, the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity &amp; Influence of his Death depends. (4) The End of the Offering is Satisfaction; that by transferring the Guilt upon the Sacrifice, the Sinner may be freed and thus reconcil'd to the divine Majeſty. This Offering our high Prieſt has at once finiſhed by his Crucifixion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. The</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Act of Chriſt's Prieſthood, is his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> with the Father for his People. To intercede in general ſignifies to plead with one for another; and this is twofold, either out of Charity as Brethren, or by Virtue of Office. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is peculiar to our Lord, who by Virtue of his Office, pleads for his People againſt all their Enemies, as well as for the Acceptance of their Perſons and Services, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their Peace, and Satisfaction of their Deſires.</p>
                  <p>Of the Interceſſion of Chriſt, there are two Periods, the firſt of which was when he was on Earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. then did he with the greateſt Humility and Fervour, deſire Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings for his People; the ſecond is in Heaven, which he performs with the greateſt Majeſty.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) By appearing before his Father for us, as the high Prieſt in the Holy of Holies, with the Names of the twelve Tribes upon his Breaſt-Plate.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) By repreſenting his Satisfaction and Merits, that on the Account thereof, his People and their ſpiritual Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be accepted in his Father's Sight. Hence he is ſaid to appear <hi>as the Lamb ſlain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Interceſſion of Chriſt is gracious, general, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, perpetual. He pleads without any Reward from us. He pleads for all his without Exception, and him the Father always heareth: Hence his Blood is ſaid <hi>to ſpeak better Things than that of Abel;</hi> and that <hi>he lives for ever to make Interceſſion for his People.</hi> The Holy Spirit does indeed interceed by his Operations in us, thereby ſtirring up unutterable Groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005299_0127_1016F83A38746098"/>
but Chriſt without us by his Blood and Obedience.</p>
                  <p>The</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Act of Chriſt's prieſtly Office, is <hi>Benediction.</hi> Hence the Prieſts of old, by divine Preſcription, bleſſed their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abram:</hi> and hence we are inform'd, that in his Seed (which is our high Prieſt) all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be bleſſed, and thus the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to come upon the Gentiles thro' <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (Gal. 3.14.) i. e. the ſame Bleſſing which God confer'd on <hi>Abraham,</hi> in Kind, on the Account of the bleſſed Seed, which did deſcend lineally from him. Hence our Lord after his Reſurrection, bleſſed his Diſciples, ſpeaking Peace to them. And hence God the Father is ſaid to bleſs his People with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes to bleſs ſignifies to Praiſe, and give Thanks; and thus we bleſs God: ſometimes to wiſh Proſperity; and thus Parents bleſs their Children, Paſtors their People, and each the other: Sometimes to ſeparate to a religious Uſe; and thus God bleſſed the Sabbath; and ſo the ſacramental Elements, after Conſecration, may be ſaid to be bleſſed. Once more, it ſignifies to confer every Kind of Benefit which we need; in this Senſe the Gentiles are ſaid to be bleſſed in Chriſt. And in this laſt Senſe of the Word it is that our Lord as a Prieſt bleſſes his People.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With all ſpiritual Bleſſings, namely Redemption, Juſtification, Sanctification, Adoption, Covenant-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him here, and eternal Glory hereafter. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With all ſuch temporal Mercies as are for their beſt Good. Even theſe are included in the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which thro' Chriſt is derived on the Gentiles. Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of this Life, as well as that to come.</p>
                  <p>The</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second</hi> general Head of Diſcourſe, is to ſhew how we ſhould conſider Chriſt, as our Apoſtle and high Prieſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ought to conſider him as ſuch attentively, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, frequently; often weighing in our Minds with Care, the abſolute Neceſſity, the tranſcendent Excellency, and unſpeakable Uſe and Benefit, of his Apoſtleſhip and Prieſthood.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:005299_0128_1016F83D52157888"/>2. We ſhould conſider our Lord as an Apoſtle and Prieſt affectionately, with Wonder and Gratitude. O how amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was the concordant Diſcord, the friendly Conteſt, among the divine Attributes, about the Salvation of fallen Man! Avenging Juſtice required of the Sinner eternal Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his Offence; the Demands of Juſtice the Truth of God engaged to iſſue, and urg'd the Execution of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Threatning, Death of every Kind. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Grace and Mercy contended for the Sinner's Safety and Happineſs, the Plea of which was ſtrengthned by the Glory that would redound to the divine Goodneſs and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency hereby; which delights not in the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he may turn and live. Here unſearchable and divine Wiſdom interpoſed, and offered to give Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to both the contending Parties thus; namely, in ordering that Sin ſhould be puniſhed according to Juſtice, and yet the Sinner be ſaved according to Mercy.</p>
                  <p>To this End divine Wiſdom pointed to our high Prieſt, who by his Death and Obedience ſhould ſatisfy Juſtice, and ſave the Sinner; who is hence called the Wiſdom and Power of God, for in him divine Wiſdom and Power have had a moſt glorious Diſplay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In him Grace and Truth have met together, and Righteouſneſs and Peace have kiſſed each other. O ſhould not theſe Things fill us with Amazment, when the Angels ſtoop down to behold this wondrous Scene! And ſhould not our Souls be inſpir'd with the moſt paſſionate Gratitude, when we conſider the awful Majeſty, unſtained Purity, glorious Sovereignty, and inexhauſted All-ſufficiency of that Jehovah, who gave ſuch a high Prieſt to the World! —As alſo the Character and Quality of the Perſon he gave: Not a Levitical, Aaronical Prieſt, but One according to the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck:</hi> Not a Stranger but a Son, an only begotten and eternal Son; who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to the Father by him. Add to this, the Manner of the Gift; the eternal Father gave his only Son, with the Solemnity of an Oath, to ſignify the Immutability of his Counſel, as well as the ſuperiour Excellency of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, that hereby his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have ſtrong Conſolation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005299_0129_1016F84173B5C718"/>But if we conſider for whom, and for what, the Son of God was given to be a Prieſt by his Father, it may increaſe our Admiration. Was it not for Worms, Sinners, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as unworthy of his Love, as unable to requite it? And was not this the Deſign of his Prieſthood, that he might reconcile ſuch, even ſuch to God, and vouchſafe all Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings on them? O the amazing Heights and Depths of the Love of God in Chriſt, which paſſes all Knowledge; herein is Love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us, and gave his only begotten Son to be a Propitiation for us.</p>
                  <p>And what Gratitude ſhould fire our Boſoms, when we conſider the Condeſcention and Love of Chriſt, as an Apoſtle? When this Apoſtle trod our duſky Globe, then was the legal Vail rent in twain, the Day-Spring from on high did viſit us, and the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhone upon us. The Jewiſh Shades vaniſhed and expired, at the opening of the Goſpel-Day, in the Charms of its meridian Beauty and brighteſt Radiancy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We ſhould conſider Chriſt as our Apoſtle and high Prieſt effectually, ſo as to diſclaim all Dependance upon our own Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, and with Readineſs and Reverence embrace him for Direction and Forgiveneſs; we ſhould continually depend upon him, and reſign all our Affairs to his Conduct and Diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p>The</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third</hi> general Head is to ſhew, why we ſhould conſider Chriſt as an Apoſtle and high Prieſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The commanding Authority of God obliges us, which it is ungrateful rebellious and exceeding perilous for us to diſpute or diſobey: <hi>Wherefore holy Brethren, Partakers of the heavenly Calling, conſider the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our Profeſſion Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Comfort and Intereſt ſhould invite us: Chriſt is the Spring of Sweetneſs, and Conſolation; but without an attentive believing Conſideration upon him, how can we expect Comfort from him, which we ſo much need in our preſent Pilgrimage? Chriſt is the Fountain and Treaſury of all Fulneſs, not only eſſentially as God, but by divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as Mediator, without Communications from which,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005299_0130_1016F8444544C910"/>
we can make no religious Progreſs. And can ſuch be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, without conſidering him from whom they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our Uſefulneſs in the World does much depend upon our conſidering of Chriſt. <hi>This, this</hi> is a proper Mean, to increaſe our Love to, and excite our Joy in him; and theſe will doubtleſs incline to proportionable Labours for him. But when Chriſt is neglected, our Joy faints, our Love lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes; and then no wonder if our religious Labours are leſſened.</p>
                  <div type="improvement">
                     <head>The IMPROVEMENT of this Subject remains.</head>
                     <p>And</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Hence we may learn the great, the groſs Ignorance, which Sin brought Mankind to, who needed an Apoſtle, ſuch an Apoſtle, to inſtruct them; this was ſo great, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Sinners are call'd Darkneſs it ſelf, in the very Abſtract, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence we may learn the Love of God the Father in ſending ſuch an Apoſtle, to teach poor Sinners the Way to Bleſſedneſs; and to govern and eſtabliſh the Church.</p>
                     <p>And does not the Love of the Son of God appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in this, that he left the Glories of Paradiſe, and willingly became an Apoſtle, a Fellow-Servant, in order to inſtruct the Poor and Ignorant! <hi>Ye know the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that tho' he was rich, yet for our ſakes he became poor, that we thro' his Poverty, might be made Rich.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the Prieſthood of Chriſt we may learn the ſinfulneſs of Sin, which has ſo alienated us from God, that a Prieſt, a Reconciler for us with him, became abſolutely neceſſary, and that not of the common Order. Such was the Guilt which our Sins contracted, that neither the Blood of Bulls nor of Goats could expiate it, nothing leſs than the Blood of the immaculate Lamb of God. Such was the Stain which Sin bro't on all our ſacred Services, that they became odious to God; and thus an Interceſſor was neceſſary, to perfume them with his meritorious Righteouſneſs; without which they cannot be accepted. Sin has robbed us of every Bleſſing, of every Kind; ſo that a high Prieſt was neceſſary
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005299_0131_1016F84715639DD0"/>
to bleſs us, and to derive the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> on us. Sin has ſo armed the Law, the Juſtice, and Power of God againſt us, that nothing leſs than the accurſed Death and the Obedience of the Son of God, can reconcile us to him, and ſcreen us from deſerved Vengeance. Is it not Sin that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſt the Angels out of Heaven, &amp; <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe? Was it not this, that burnt the Cities of the Plain by a fiery Shower, and buried the whole Earth by a Deluge of Water? Is not this the bitter Source of the ſable but numerous Train of Sorrows and Calamities, which do inviron, infeſt and perplex us, in this thorny Maze? Well, if Sin be ſo great an Evil, let us hate, bewail and ſhun it, and ſeek Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation by the Blood and Obedience of our high Prieſt.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean Time, it is highly neceſſary that we inquire, whether Chriſt Jeſus be <hi>our</hi> Apoſtle, <hi>our</hi> high Prieſt. To this Purpoſe let me ask you, in the Preſence of God, whether ever you have had the Law and Goſpel opened to your Minds with clearneſs, and ſet home on your Hearts with Power by this Apoſtle?</p>
                     <p>Has the Law diſcovered to you God's Majeſty, Juſtice, Almightineſs, as well as your own Unbelief, Enmity againſt God, and other Iniquities in Heart and Life, in their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Aggravations? Has the Law applied, diſcovered to you your condemned loſt State, and your utter want of Wiſdom and Power to get out of it? And has a near View of theſe Things, together with their dreadful Conſequences in another World, ſo diſtreſſed you that you could not reſt; until the Goſpel opened a Door of Hope in Chriſt, until ye heard and felt the glad Tydings thereof, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſurprizing Light, efficacious Energy, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Sweetneſs, ſo that ye were made willing under a Senſe of your Sin and Nothingneſs, to venture your ſick Souls by believing upon the Almighty Saviour, and him alone, having diſclaimed all other Refuges?</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle ſuggeſts ſome Things in our Text, which may help us to know, whether Jeſus Chriſt be our high Prieſt. Namely (1) That ſuch Perſons are holy, i. e. the general Courſe of their Deſires and Endeavours bends that Way from love to God and his Law. (2) They are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005299_0132_1016F84A14FF36B0"/>
they love each other, with that Love which ſuffers long, and is kind. They love chiefly becauſe of the Image of God, and in Proportion thereto, and this Love is not confined to their own Party. (3) They are Partakers of the heavenly Calling; i. e. they have heard the Voice of God, by his Law and Goſpel, ſo as to be raiſed hereby from a Death in Sin, to a divine Life, to a Conformity to the Image of the Son of God, that he might be the firſt born among many Brethren, and particularly ſuch ſet their Affections on Things above, (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.1.) and are habitually in the prevailing Temper of their Minds, Pilgrims and Strangers on this Earth. (4) They are of the Chriſtian Profeſſion, and that not in Name only but Thing. Such are not aſhamed to confeſs Chriſt, and profeſs his Religion at all Times, and in all Places.</p>
                     <p>Now to thoſe who have experienced the aforeſaid Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the Subject I have been diſcourſing on, offers great Conſolation and Support. The Apoſtleſhip of Chriſt opens a Spring of Sweetneſs to ſuch as are oppreſſed with a Senſe of their Ignorance; who apprehend themſelves to be as brute-Beaſts, upon that Account. Such may conſider, that Chriſt as an Apoſtle, is a condeſcending powerful Inſtructor, who makes the Heart of the raſh to underſtand Judgment, and the Tongue of the Stammerer to ſpeak plain. He makes the Simple underſtand Wiſdom, and writes his Laws upon their Hearts, with indelible Characters, ſo that they become his Epiſtle.</p>
                     <p>And does not the Prieſthood of Chriſt open a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scene to poor Believers, under all the Variety of their Diſtreſſes, and that in it's ſeveral Acts? As may appear thus.</p>
                     <p>When Sin urges, when the Law, Conſcience, and Satan accuſe; when we walk in Darkneſs, and ſee no Light; when we are diſtreſſed with the Fears of private or publick Judgments here, and eternal Condemnation hereafter: In theſe, and in all other Calamities, how ſweet and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting is it, to conſider that we have a high Prieſt, who has offered not the Blood of Bulls or of Goats, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Soul, his Body, his Blood, to reconcile us to God;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005299_0133_1016F84E2B12FE28"/>
a Prieſt after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> the King of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and of Peace; the Son of God, God-Man, yea God himſelf! A high Prieſt who has made full Satisfaction, in whom his Father is well pleaſed; a high Prieſt who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come to the Father by him: on him therefore let us lay the Burden of our Guilt, as the Iſraelites did on the Scape-Goat, and in him let us joy and triumph, having no Confidence in the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>When we are almoſt diſcouraged, becauſe of the Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Wandrings, and other Impurities of our Devotions; likewiſe when we are diſtreſſed with Fears of falling away, it yields a great Support to conſider upon the Interceſſion of our high Prieſt with his Father for us, which is authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, continual, prevailing, Joh. 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>Seeing he ever lives, to make Interceſſion for them.</hi> Joh. 11.42. <hi>And I knew that thou heareſt me always.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us offer our Prayers believingly in his Name, and ſeek to have them perfumed with the Incenſe of his Merit and Interceſſion: let us with humble Confidence, commit our whole Caſe to be intirely manag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Let us be exhorted to hear the great Apoſtle of our Profeſſion, ſeeing that his Father hath ſent him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to hear him, Matth. 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him.</hi> Surely never Man ſpake like him;

how then ſhall we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore ſpeedily accept of the Terms of Grace, which this Meſſenger of the Covenant propoſes to us; for ſurely we cannot maintain a War againſt him. Shall Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contend with the devouring Flames? Have we an Arm like God; or can we Thunder with a Voice like him Who can ſtand before his Indignation? Who knows the Power of his Anger? He is wiſe in Heart, and mighty in Strength. Who has hardened himſelf againſt him and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered? He but touches the Hills, and they ſmoke; yea the Mountains melt at his Preſence! When he ſpeaks, the pureſt Seraph vails his Face, the Pillars of Heaven trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Earth's Foundations ſhake, the Devils roar, and all Nature faints!</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>OVE is certainly the brighteſt Emblem of the divine Nature, for God is Love; and the greateſt Ornament of the human. Love is the Sinew of civil Society, and religious alſo, without which the Comforts and Profits of both, are either much impair'd or intirely loſt. Love is the Subſtance of the Law, and the great Scope of the glorious Goſpel. All the pure Precepts of the one, and condeſcending Directions of the other, tend to Love, and end in it. This is the royal Law, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8. <hi>If ye fulfil the royal Law according to the Scripture, thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, ye do well.</hi> The Bond of Perfection and Badge of Chriſtianity. By this our Lord obſerves, that his true Diſciples may be diſtinguiſh'd from vain Pretenders. Joh. 13.35. <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have Love one to another.</hi> Love is the nobleſt Image of the heavenly State: There all angry Debates &amp; unhappy Contentions are for ever baniſhed:
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005299_0138_1016F85CD4006068"/>
There the ſtrongeſt Affection, and the ſweeteſt Concord, do for ever triumph: What unfailing Vigour and unfading Glory!</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle plainly points out the vaſt Importance of this noble Grace, in the Words immediately preceeding our Text; where he obſerves, that the nobleſt Attainments of Knowledge and Eloquence, yea even of the Gift of Propheſying, and miraculous Faith, without Charity or Love, as the Word may be well rendered, would be no Evidences of his being a true Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>In diſcourſing upon this important Subject, I ſhall ſpeak of the Nature, Kinds, Ingredients, and Effects of Charity; and then proceed to the Improvement. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Charity may be more generally deſcribed thus, viz. that it is the Propenſion or Inclination of the Heart or Will toward our Neighbour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be thus diſtinguiſh'd, namely that it is either carnal, natural, civil, or chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) Carnal is that ſordid, ſhameful, and ſinful Paſſion after forbidden Embraces, which ſprings from lawleſs Luſt. This, without Repentance intervene, will plunge the Nocent in perpetual Ruin. This diſhonours our Nature, reproaches our Religion, and will damn our Souls. 1 Cor. 6.9. <hi>Know ye not that the Unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Natural, is a Regard which reſpects Children and Parents, which even the Beaſts have ſomething of; for the want o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which the Gentiles are reproved, Rom. 1.31. <hi>Without Underſtanding, Covenant-breakers; without natural Affection, implacable, unmerciful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Civil, is that Affection which is only grounded upon civil Cauſes; when Men reſpect one another as Men, or as cloathed with civil Offices, or for Kindneſſes received.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) Chriſtian, is that whereby Chriſtians are reſpected for their Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>It is the two laſt Kinds of Charity that I intend to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:005299_0139_1016F85E5B82A5F8"/>In the Deſcription which I gave of Charity, I obſerved, that it was the Inclination of the Heart towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Now by Neighbour is to be underſtood every Man upon whom we can confer any Good. Luk. 10.29, 37. <hi>But he, willing to juſtify himſelf, ſaid unto Jeſus. And who is my Neighbour? And he ſaid, he that ſhewed Mercy on him. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Go, and do thou likewiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Order of this Charity is ſuch, that ſeeing God is the primary and principal Object of Love, he is therefore the formal Reaſon of that Charity which we owe to our Neighbour. Next therefore after God we are to love our Selves, with that Charity which reſpects true Bleſſedneſs. By loving God with a Love of Union, we immediately love our ſelves, with that Charity which intends ſpiritual Bleſſedneſs; and others as it were ſecondarily, whom we would have partake with us of that ſupreme Good. Now albeit none are to be excluded from our Charity, yet it is not to be extended in a like Degree to all. It is true indeed in Regard of the Good, which we ſhould wiſh to our Neighbour, there is no Imparity; becauſe we ſhould deſire that the chief Good may be conferred on all, as upon our ſelves; and that with the ſame Seriouſneſs and Sincerity; yet there ſhould be a Difference in the Meaſure and Fruits of our Charity, according to the Difference of Perſons, and Occaſions it is to be exerciſed upon. Thoſe that fear God are to be loved above others. Gal. 6.10. <hi>As we have therefore Opportunity, let us do Good unto all Men, eſpecially unto them who are of the Houſhold of Faith.</hi> A peculiar Regard is due to our Relations, above Strangers; and that in Proportion to the Nearneſs of the Relation; which ſhould manifeſt it ſelf according to the Nature of the Relation: If the Relation be corporal, principally in outward Things; if ſpiritual, principally in ſpiritual Things. The</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third</hi> general Head, is to ſpeak of the Ingredients of Charity; which I think are theſe four, <hi>viz.</hi> Eſteem, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Delight, Sorrow. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Charity includes <hi>Eſteem.</hi> A rational Affection follows our eſteeming or valuing any Perſon or Thing, for ſome real or ſuppoſed Excellency or Good we conceive to be
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005299_0140_1016F85FE98F8E90"/>
in them. That which hath neither phyſical nor moral Good in it or annexed to it, cannot be the Object of Eſteem; and that which we have no Eſteem of, we can have no Charity for. Now tho' there be various Kinds &amp; Degrees of Excellency in our Fellow-Creatures, for which a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Reſpect is due from us; yet there is none but who hath ſuch a Meaſure of Good either natural or moral, as deſerves our Eſteem. The very worſt of Men have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, endowed with the noble Powers of Reaſon and Reflection, by which they reſemble the infinite Knowlege, and ſpiritual Nature of the ſupreme Being: for <hi>there is a Spirit in Man, and the Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth them Underſtanding;</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> obſerves. By this they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, thro' the Aſſiſtance of divine Grace, to know and enjoy God. They are alſo our Brethren by Nature, for God hath made of one Blood all Nations. Upon theſe Accounts we ought to eſteem and value the very meaneſt of the rational Creation, becauſe they are the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and bear his Similitude: There are alſo additional Excellencies, to excite our Eſteem for ſome, in whoſe Lives ſhine many moral Virtues. Why therefore ſhould we ſet at nought our Brethren? And as to the People of God, they claim our Charity upon other Accounts: By Regeneration they are adorn'd with the moral Image of God; by Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are admitted to the moſt valuable Priviledges; hereby they become the Children of God, and our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by Grace, as well as Heirs of an inexpreſſibly rich and everlaſting Inheritance. Should we then have a light Eſteem of any of thoſe Sons of God, becauſe of accidental Differences? O no! What if ſome have not ſo much natural Abilities or acquired Learning as ſome others? yet the meaneſt of them has Wiſdom to Salvation; and ſurely this is infinitely better than all the Knowlege of the World. Oh! the compaſſionate Prophet of the Church of God, makes the Simple to underſtand Wiſdom; He cauſes the Heart of the raſh to underſtand Judgment! What if they are poor in this World, this alſo flows from a Father's Love, and ſhall be made by the Power of God to increaſe their ſpiritual and eternal Riches: Their moral Blemiſhes
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005299_0141_1016F8640CBE3118"/>
ſhould excite our Pity &amp; Compaſſion. We are commanded to prefer others before our ſelves: and to this End we ſhould be careful to obſerve their Excellencies, while blind to our own.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Charity includes an unfeigned and earneſt Deſire, after our Neighbour's Good, temporal, ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> deſired the preſent Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of his beloved <hi>Gaius,</hi> 3 Epiſt. 2 ver. <hi>Beloved, I wiſh above all Things that thou mayſt proſper and be in Health, even as thy Soul proſpereth.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately thirſted after the temporal and eternal Weal, of the <hi>Philippians</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Phil. 1.8, 9. <hi>For God is my Record, how greatly I long after you all, in the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt. And this I pray, that your Love may abound yet more &amp; more, in Knowledge, and in all Judgment.</hi> See alſo Rom. 10.1. <hi>Brethren, my Heart's Deſire and Prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they may be ſaved.</hi> Now, tho' we ſhould wiſh without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, that all the aforeſaid Kinds of Good ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon our Brethren, yet it ought to be with different Degrees of Intenſeneſs, according to their different Degrees of Neceſſity and Excellency. We ſhould undoubtedly be tender of their Characters and bodily Welfare; yet we ſhould with greater Vehemence deſire for them more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and valuable Enjoyments, namely thoſe that are ſpiritual and eternal. The aforeſaid Deſire after our Brethren's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, is by ſome call'd a Love of Benevolence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Charity includes a Delight or Satisfaction in our Neighbour's Good, which by ſome is call'd a Love of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence. Joy and Complacence naturally follow the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of our Deſires, and that in Proportion to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Intenſeneſs. The charitable Perſon (in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Courſe of his Life) is ſo far from envying his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's honourable Character, ſhining Gifts, proſperous Succeſſes, and increaſing Graces, that he is really pleas'd therewith according to their different Degrees of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As one Member of the Body ſenſibly feels the Pleaſure another more immediately enjoys, and is therewith delighted. But the Converſion of Sinners to the bleſſed God and their progreſs in Goodneſs, is peculiarly pleaſing
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005299_0142_1016F866DBA652C8"/>
to charitable and generous Souls! O this makes them exult with joyous Triumphs, reſembling the angelic Hoſts; who alſo rejoyce upon the like Occaſion! Luk. 15.7, 10. <hi>I ſay unto you, that likewiſe Joy ſhall be in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety &amp; nine juſt Perſons that need no Repentance. Likewiſe I ſay unto you, there is Joy in the Preſence of the Angels of God, over one Sinner that repenteth.</hi> Of this noble Temper was the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> O how did the Tho'ts of the <hi>Philippians</hi> Converſion, gladden his Heart with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during Pleaſure! Phil. 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>I thank my God upon every Remembrance of you, always in every Prayer of mine for you all, making Requeſt with Joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Charity includes a Sorrow for our Neighbour's Miſery, Which ſome call a Love of Condolence. Now this Sorrow is in ſome Meaſure ſuited or proportioned to the Kind of Miſeries, we behold them labouring under, as well as to the Degrees of our Deſire after their Welfare. It is the Duty, the Temper and Practice of charitable Perſons, not only to rejoyce with thoſe that rejoyce, but alſo to weep with thoſe that weep, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15. As one pained Member of the Body afflicts the reſt, ſo charitable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are paſſionately affected with beholding others Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. The Sufferings of Perſons in their Names, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Eſtates, open the Springs of their Sorrow. This was the Practice of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 30. 25. <hi>Did not I weep for him that was in Trouble? was not my Soul grieved for the Poor?</hi> Of this Temper of Mind was the Pſalmiſt alſo, and that even towards his Enemies, Pſal. 35.12, 13, 14. <hi>They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded me Evil for Good, to the ſpoiling of my Soul; but as for me, when they were ſick, my cloathing was Sackcloth: I humbled my Soul with Faſting.—I behaved my ſelf as tho' he had been my Friend; I bowed down heavily, as one that mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his Mother.</hi> Hereto we may add the noble Example of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s univerſal and unwearied Sympathy, mentioned, 2 Cor. 11.29. <hi>Who is weak, and I am not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>? who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> As well as that of our Lord, Mat. 14.14. where it is ſaid, <hi>And Jeſus went forth, and ſaw a great Multitude, and was moved with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards them, and he healed their Sick.</hi> The original
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005299_0143_1016F869A89DB480"/>
Word ſignifies the tendereſt and moſt compaſſionate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, even in his very Bowels, upon their Account. But that which eſpecially excites the ſaddeſt Sorrows of charitable Perſons, is the Conſideration of their Neighbour's ſpiritual Miſeries, and the Proſpect of the eternal Pains, which are like to follow upon them. O! it breaks their Hearts and makes their Bowels bleed, to behold their poor Fellow-Creatures in a State of Wrath and Courſe of Sin! Rivers of Waters ran down the Pſalmiſt's Eyes upon this Account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136. He <hi>beheld Tranſgreſſors and was grieved, becauſe they kept not God's Word,</hi> Ver. 158. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us in the moſt ſolemn Manner, that he had great Heavineſs and continual Sorrow in his Heart, on the Account of his unhappy obſtinate and ungrateful Countrymen, for whoſe Salvation he could be willing himſelf to be accurſed from Chriſt, if that could ſecure it, Rom. 9.1, 2, 3. <hi>I ſay the Truth in Chriſt, I lie not; my Conſcience bearing me Witneſs in the holy Ghoſt, that I have Heavineſs and continual Sorrow in my Heart; for I could wiſh that my ſelf were accurſed from Chriſt, for my Brethren, my Kinſmen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh.</hi> The Love of our dear Redeemer was ſuch as to incline him to be a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief, that he might atone for the Offences of his People: and in particular how afflicting are thoſe Inſtances of our Saviour's compaſſionate Charity to the Souls of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which we find mentioned, Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> wept over it.</hi> And how endearing is the Love of the bleſſed God himſelf, whoſe Mercies are ſaid to be above all his other Works! The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> obſerves concerning the bleſſed God, that he is very pitiful and of tender Mercy, <hi>James</hi> 5.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> full of Bowels. Hence we read of the <hi>ſounding of his Bowels,</hi> and the <hi>turning of his Heart,</hi> when his People provoke him to inflict Judgments, Iſai. 63.15. <hi>Where is thy Zeal, and thy Strength, the ſounding of thy

Bowels and of thy Mercies towards me?</hi> Hoſ. 11.8. <hi>Mine Heart is turned within me, &amp;c.</hi> And hence in Imitation of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the great God, we are bid to be merciful, as our heavenly Father is merciful; and to put on Bowels of Mercy, and to be tender hearted. Eph. 4.32. <hi>And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I proceed to the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourth</hi> General Head, which was to diſcourſe of the Effects of Charity. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Charity inclines to kind candid and favourable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of our Neighbour's Perſon and Actions, ſo far as their Nature and Circumſtances can in Reaſon admit. It thinketh no Evil; but on the contrary, hopeth all Things, and believeth all Things that are Good: It baniſhes all ill-natur'd Inſinuations of our Neighbour's Speeches, Actions, and Deſigns; and puts the faireſt and moſt favourable Senſe upon them that can conſiſt with Reaſon: inſtead of expoſing and aggravating real Weakneſſes, without urgent Neceſſity; it rather hides and extenuates them, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily offers any Excuſe or Apology that can be thought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to that generous and truly noble Purpoſe. O how generous and precious is this Effect! and how ſubſervient to the Peace, Weal and Comfort of Society! But Lord, how contrary is the Practice of a great Part of this ill-natur'd and unhappy World, who can hardly invent any Thing cruel enough (to their Mind) under the Umbrage of their Neighbours real or ſuppoſed Miſcarriages, to blacken and ruin their Reputation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Charity inclines to Mildneſs, Candor and Courteſy in Speech and Behaviour. It <hi>behaveth not it ſelf unſeemly;</hi> as the Apoſtle obſerves in this Chapter: 'It's Language is not cruel and clowniſh, but candid and courteous.' And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the ſame Apoſtle obſerves, <hi>it is not eaſily provoked, but ſuffereth long, and endureth all Things:</hi> It inclines us to poſſeſs our Souls in Patience under injurious Treatment, and to reſtrain and bury our angry Reſentments. Hence we are inform'd, that <hi>many Waters cannot quench Love, nor the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005299_0145_1016F86E6D570288"/>
Floods drown it,</hi> Cant. 8.7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> And hence we are entreated, Eph. 4.2. to <hi>walk with all Lowlineſs and Meekneſs, with Long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Charity makes it's Poſſeſſor ready upon all Occaſions, to do his Neighbour Good. Hence we are commanded, <hi>not to love in Word and Tongue</hi> (only) <hi>but in Deed and Truth.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle obſerves in the 6th Verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>Charity is kind;</hi> and truly ſo it is, to the Souls and Bodies of Men. And</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) The charitable Perſon labours to do Good to his Neighbour's Soul, morally, by propoſing of Good to be performed by him with ſuitable Motives and Directions, by which he may be brought to it, either by teaching if he is ignorant, or comforting if afflicted, or by Reaſoning and Reproof if he errs in Principle or Practice, or by examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if he is ignorant of his ſpiritual State, or by exhorting if he is ſlothful in doing Good, and eſpecially by a good Example exciting to do the like.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) The charitable Perſon endeavours to do Good to his Neighbour's Body, phyſically, by ſuch Acts of Kindneſs and Beneficence, as have a Tendency thereto. Heb. 13.16. <hi>To do Good and communicate forget not, for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> 
                     <q>The charitable Perſon is liberal in his Kindneſs, as the Sun of his Light and Influence; and when his outward Ability fails, it is more than made up by the generous Sentiments and Wiſhes of his Soul, as well as Endeavours of his Life, in preſſing others to Beneficence.</q>
True Charity will incline us to <hi>looſe the Bands of Wickedneſs, undo the heavy Burdens, and let the oppreſſed go free;</hi> to <hi>draw out our Soul to the hungry, and ſatisfy the afflicted Soul,</hi> Iſai. 58.6, 10.</p>
                  <p>Here let me mention for Illuſtration-ſake a few Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) That of <hi>Job</hi> is memorable, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.11,—17. (2) That of our Saviour who went about doing Good to the Souls and Bodies of Men. He inſtructed the ignorant, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the ſorrowful, healed the diſeaſed, and fed the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; and that ſometimes at the Expence of Miracles. The Apoſtles alſo endeavoured to ſuccour Men under out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005299_0146_1016F8714180A0D8"/>
Miſeries; which appears by the Collection for the poor Saints at Jeruſalem, which they forwarded: But their Charity was eſpecially fixed upon Men's precious Souls; in which Reſpects tho' they themſelves were poor in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, yet they made many rich in Spirituals, by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Labours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Charity prefers the publick Good to a private Intereſt. Hence the Apoſtle obſerves in the 5th Verſe of this Chapter, that <hi>Charity ſeeks not her own Things.</hi> i. e. neither only nor principally. <q>Charity enlarges and ennobles the Mind of Man, and reduces the whole World within the Compaſs of its Care, in Compariſon of which any Perſon's private Intereſt is as inconſiderable, as one Man compared with the whole World. And as it is ſo in it ſelf, thus it is alſo in the Eſteem of the truly charitable Perſon, whoſe noble Soul is ſublimated by generous Love, above the ſordid Sphere of ſelfiſh Conſiderations, to deſire and ſeek with Sincerity, ſo far as he hath Opportunity, and Capacity, the Good of his whole Species.</q>
And this indeed is no more than what the great God requires of us, 1 Cor. 10.24. <hi>Let no Man ſeek his own: but every Man another's Wealth.</hi> And Phil. 2.4. <hi>Look not every Man on his own Things, but every Man alſo on the Things of others.</hi> And eſpecially the publick and valuable Intereſts of the Church of God are very dear to charitable Perſons. The Pſalmiſt expreſſes his Concern that Way, to the following Effect; <hi>If I forget thee O Jeruſalem, let my right Hand forget her Cunning, if Jeruſalem be not my chief Joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to promote our Neighbours Good, Charity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to Self-denial and Condeſcenſion. To compaſs the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal Good of Mankind, the charitable Apoſtles freely laid down their Honours and Intereſts, their Liberties and Lives: They paſs'd thro' Diſhonour and evil Report, being generally accounted the Filth of the World, and the Off-ſcouring of all Things; they were ſtrip'd of all the Eaſe and Emoluments of human Life; expoſed to Hunger and Nakedneſs, Scourging, Bonds and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and in the mean Time cover'd with a Cloud of Reproach and Ignominy; in Perils, Travels, Labours and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005299_0147_1016F87422C13F50"/>
Watchings, often; and at laſt expoſed to cruel Deaths. And yet all this they couragiouſly undertook, and patiently endured, in order to ſpread the Redeemer's Goſpel, and ſave the Souls of Men from eternal Ruin. It is juſtly obſerved concerning them, even under their many Troubles, that tho' they were ſorrowing, yet they were always rejoycing, and tho' they were poor, yet they made many rich. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews the Greatneſs of his Condeſcenſion in the following Places of Scripture, 1 Cor. 9.19. <hi>For tho' I be free from all Men, yet have I made my ſelf Servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</hi> To the ſame noble Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he further obſerves in the ſame Chapter, <hi>That to the Jews he became a Jew;</hi> and <hi>to thoſe that were without Law, as without Law.</hi> And in the laſt Verſe of the aforeſaid Chapter, he ſays, <hi>Even as I pleaſe all. Men in all Things, not ſeeking mine own Profit, but the Profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi> And this the Apoſtle preſcribes as a Rule to others, Rom. 15.1, 2. <hi>We then that are ſtrong ought to bear the Infirmities of the Weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves. Let every one of us pleaſe his Neighbour for his Good to Edification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Charity inclines thoſe that poſſeſs it to Humility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hence it's ſaid in the 4th Verſe of this Chapter, <hi>that Charity vaunteth not itſelf, is not puff'd up.</hi> No! it's ſo far from this, that charitable Perſons are willing to do the meaneſt Offices, that may ſerve the Intereſts of their Friends. Charity inclines the greateſt Souls and nobleſt Beings, freely to ſerve their Inferiours. It was this that inclined the Apoſtles to becomes the Slaves of Men, as it were, in order to ſecure their everlaſting Intereſts. It is this that inclines the holy Angels, thoſe Principalities and Powers, to miniſter to the Saints of God, in this Wilderneſs, that they may guide and guard them to Glory. 'Twas this that inclin'd the innocent honourable and eternal Son of God, to leave his Father's Boſom, and ſtoop as low as Earth, by uniting it to his Deity; hereby his divine Glory was for a Time obſcured, and the Son of God aſſum'd the Form of a Servant, was made a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief; hereby he who was rich in all his Father's eſſential Excellencies, became poor, that we thro' his Poverty might
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005299_0148_1016F878707019C8"/>
be rich. 'Twas Charity inclin'd him to waſh his Diſciples Feet for our Example; and to lay down his precious Life to purchaſe their Salvation. It's Charity that inclines the great God himſelf, who inhabiteth Eternity, to dwell in the humble Heart, (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.15.) to humble himſelf to behold the Things that are done in Heaven and Earth; to take ſuch gracious and continual Care in preſerving of, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for, and bearing with, ſuch mean Duſt as we!</p>
                  <p>Why therefore having ſuch noble Examples, ſhould we not ſerve one another by Love? (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13.) and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to Men of low Degree, in performing the humbleſt Offices that may ſerve their Intereſt, or ſupply their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity!</p>
                  <p>Hence we may learn, 1. The Excellency of the Chriſtian Religion; the Scope of which is to inculcate that Virtue of Charity, which is as conſonant to the moral Perfections of the divine Nature, as it is conducive to promote the Good of Society.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Seeing Charity is the great Character of true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without which we can have no reaſonable Claim thereto, 1 Joh. 3.14, 15. <hi>He that hateth his Brother is a Murderer</hi>—. And Ver. 17. <hi>But whoſo hath this World's Goods, and ſeeth his Brother have Need, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of Compaſſion from him; how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</hi> 1 Joh. 4.20. <hi>If a Man ſay, I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Lyar</hi>—: We ſhould be therefore invited to examine our ſelves, whether we have the aforeſaid Ingredients and Effects of Love, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch Eſteem, Deſire, Delight, Sorrow; ſuch favourable Sentiments of Mind, Courteſy in Speech and Carriage, Beneficence and Kindneſs in Action; a preferring of the publick Good to our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſts, Self-Denial and Condeſcention in promoting it; and Humility. To theſe, for a further Diſcovery of our State, I ſhall add a few more Characters of Chriſtian Charity, by which let us try our ſelves. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. True Charity to Man ſprings from the Love of God, and is exerciſed with a Regard to his commanding Authority. Love to God, where it is ſpecial and tranſcendent, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily conſtrain us to love our Brethren.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:005299_0149_1016F87B89C2F660"/>2. It eſpecially eyes the moral Image of God in Man, and is proportioned to the Degrees it perceives thereof to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in them. Tho' the charitable Perſon loves the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> rational Creation with a Love of Benevolence, and as Occaſion ſerves with a Love of Beneficence; yet he alſo reſpects pious Souls with a Love of ſpecial Complacence. Theſe are the excellent Ones of the Earth, in whom is all his Delight: and as he loves all that are truly Good, whatever Denomination they bear, peculiarly and ſincerely; ſo according to the Degrees of their Goodneſs, is his Eſteem and Love increaſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. True Charity will not only diſpoſe to do our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Good in Temporals and Spirituals, but alſo to bear with his Weakneſſes.—Thoſe who can juſtly apply to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves theſe Signs of Chriſtian Charity, may be comforted in this, that their Love is an Evidence of their gracious State, and Communion with the divine Majeſty. 1 Joh. 2.10. <hi>He that loveth his Brother, abideth in the Light,</hi>— And Chap. 4. 16. <hi>God is Love; and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God.</hi> In the mean Time, it ought to be obſerved, that we have no ſufficient Reaſon to think Perſons to be ſpiritually Good, unleſs they be ſound in the main doctrinal Principles of Religion: for ſurely Truth is the Foundation of real Holineſs, without which all Appearances of Piety, how great ſoever, may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuſpected. But alas, is there not Reaſon to lament it, if it were poſſible with Tears of Blood, that the very contrary to what has been now expreſs'd, too generally prevails among ſome, who profeſs the ſame bleſſed Truths of God.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to a Uſe of EXHORTATION.</p>
                  <p>O let us all be intreated to ſeek after the Truth, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and Exerciſe of this noble Grace of Love and Charity, in it's whole Extent and utmoſt Latitude; and that for the following Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe this Commandment we have from God, <hi>that he who loveth him, ſhould love his Brother alſo.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.21. Should not this have ſome Influence upon us, who are his Creatures; who have deriv'd our Beings from his
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005299_0150_1016F87E618D4B60"/>
Almighty Power, and all our Bleſſings from his gracious Providence, and whoſe Lives and Happineſs depend on his Favour!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such is the Excellency of Charity, that it is the very Sum and Fulfilment of the Law of God, the very Soul and Spring of all the Duties we owe to our Neighbour. So that not one of them can be genuine and acceptable, unleſs it proceed from Charity. Gal. 5.14. <hi>For all the Law is fulfilled in one Word, even in this, Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf.</hi> 
                     <q>Charity (ſaith a learned Writer) gives Worth Form and Life to all Vertues; ſo that without it no Action is valuable in it ſelf, or acceptable to God. Sever it from Courage, and what is that but the Boldneſs and Fierceneſs of a Beaſt? from Meekneſs, and what is that but the Softneſs of a Woman, or Weakneſs of a Child? from Courteſy, and what is that but Affectation or Artifice? from Juſtice, and what is that, but Humour or Policy? from Wiſdom, and what is that but Craft and Subtilty? what meaneth Faith without it, but dry Opinion? what Hope, but blind Preſumption? what Alms-Doing, but ambitious Oſtentation? what under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Martyrdom, but Stiffneſs and Sturdineſs of Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What is Devotion, but gloſſing and mocking with God? What is any Practice, how ſpecious ſoever, in Appearance, or materially Good, but an Iſſue of Self-conceit, or Self-will, of ſervile Fear, or mercenary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign?</q>
Thus far he. But</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Charity is of ſuch abſolute Neceſſity, that without it we muſt expect to periſh to all Eternity. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Charity is juſt and reaſonable; as may appear by the following Particulars,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) There is ſome Propenſity to it ariſing from the very Frame of our Nature; which appears from the Power that Tragedies have over our ſofter Paſſions: Our Grief is ſomewhat mov'd whether we will or not, when we hear of awful Accidents, that have befallen others, in which we our ſelves are not at all concern'd; and much more when we behold them conflicting with uncommon Calamities! And no doubt the natural Deſire we have after Society, is partly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005299_0151_1016F87FE8209928"/>
owing to a Diſpoſition, that is in all Mankind, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Good to others. Hence ariſeth a Complacency of Mind upon our doing of Good to others, and an Uneaſineſs from the contrary. The Apoſtle confirms what has been obſerv'd under this Head, Rom. 12.10. <hi>Be kindly affectioned</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) which ſuppoſeth that there is a natural Affection in Men, which it is our Duty to exerciſe and increaſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Every one is inclin'd to deſire and expect Love from others, as a Debt due to them; and if it is not paid, they are apt to be offended. When we are under Reproach, Miſery and Want, we take it hard if Sympathy &amp; Succour is refus'd. This ſhews plainly that according to our own Judgment, we owe the like to others in Extremity: for it is an unjuſtifiable Weakneſs to expect or deſire for our ſelves, what we deny to others, who have as good a Right to Kindneſs as we. And this our bleſſed Lord himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms by that golden Rule of Love, which he has given for our Direction, Mat. 7.12. <hi>Therefore all Things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye would that Men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Than which nothing can be more equal and rational.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) <q>All Men are Brethren and Repreſentatives, Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame Nature, Poſſeſſors of the ſame Powers and Faculties, liable to the ſame Accidents, and ſubject to the ſame Laws. And is it not reaſonable to ſhew Kindneſs to our Brethren, and to regard our own Pictures? and on the contrary moſt unnatural and cruel to wrong either? But if we are true Chriſtians, there are additional Engagements upon us to exerciſe Charity to the People of God, ſeeing they are with us Children of one Father, Poſſeſſors of the ſame divine Nature, Pilgrims to the ſame Paradiſe, and Heirs to the ſame Inheritance, and thereby our Brethren in the nobleſt Senſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4) Charity is an eaſy Duty, conſiſting chiefly in Good-Will. <q>Whence the pooreſt Beggar is as able to perform it as the mightieſt Monarch: Tho' his Hand be not ſo full of Alms, his Heart may be as full of Love.</q> This is what God principally Reſpects, and what he will accept of when there is no Ability to ſhew other Succour.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005299_0152_1016F8833A347788"/>
                     <q>'Twas on this Account the Widow's Mites were ſo highly valued and honourably mention'd in ſacred Writ. Love made them far outweigh all the golden Donations of the great, rich and honourable.</q>
And we are aſſur'd b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the true and faithful Witneſs, that even a Cup of cold Water flowing from this noble Principle, will not be buried in Oblivion, or miſs a gracious Reward. Mat. 10.42. <hi>And whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little Ones a Cup of cold Water only, in the Name of a Diſciple, Verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his Reward.</hi> And indeed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the ſureſt and eaſieſt Way of performing all thoſe Duties we owe to our Fellow-Creatures. <q>If we would haſten through the Circle of Duty, let us Love, and all is done: Do we want to ſerve God with Delight and Conſtancy, then let us Love.</q>
For that is the only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during Source of voluntary, ſpiritual and ſteady Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, other Motives are mean and mercenary, and do but produce an unwilling ignoble and inſtable Service. Effects muſt needs vary with their Cauſe: Now external ſlaviſh and mercenary Motives to religious Action, are as inconſtant as the Wind; and therefore nothing that is ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble can be expected from them. Do we want to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Suffering? O! then let us Love, and we ſhall be willing to endure any Thing for Chriſt; for <hi>many Waters cannot quench Love.</hi> Do we want to make Progreſs in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? O! then let us Love. That is the Sum of the Law, and Bond of Perfection.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) Charity is pleaſing to God, not only in that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us to his moral Excellency, but alſo becauſe it is an Expreſſion of our Love to him, when for his Sake we ſhew Kindneſs to his Friends and Servants; and this he informs us he accepts of as done to himſelf, Mat. 25.34, 40.— <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World. And the King ſhall anſwer and ſay unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, in as much as ye have done it to one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> And certainly the contrary Practice is a ſlighting of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="35" facs="unknown:005299_0153_1016F8852AA586B8"/>6. Charity ennobles and perfects our Nature; <q>adorns and beautifies our Souls, it inlarges the Mind of Man, and fills it with great and generous Projects, worthy of its Dignity and Deſign of being; it graſps the whole Univerſe in its kind Embraces, and aims at a univerſal and immortal Good.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Charity likens us to the nobleſt Creatures the Angels of God, thoſe glorious Nobles of the Court of Heaven, who with inceſſant Delight labour to promote our Good, and that without any Hopes of Recompence from us; yea, Charity likens thoſe that are poſſeſſed of it to the glorious God himſelf, who is the great Original of all Good and Excellency; who tho' he be infinite in Purity and Self-Sufficiency, and ſo uncapable to receive any Benefit from his Creatures, who are unworthy of his Notice, and whoſe Goodneſs extends not to him; does notwithſtanding freely vouchſafe innumerable and unwearied Benefits upon them, and bear with their Affronts and Offences. <q>What is Charity but Goodneſs extending its kind Influence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Objects without low and ſneaking Deſigns? Such is its amiable and venerable Majeſty, that it can't be beheld without Admiration. Wit, Power and Grandeur, without this are mean and ignoble, and what ſordid Creatures, namely Pagans, Turks, and Devils poſſeſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the contrary, Uncharitableneſs debaſes, degrades, and defiles the noble Soul of Man, by making Self the Center of all his Purſuits; the Compaſs of all his Cares and Projects is meanly contracted to that pitiful Point: the whole Buſineſs of his Soul is to make Proviſions for his Body, for this he acts like the crafty Fox, or cruel Wolf, uſing either Fraud or Force to catch his Prey. Again,</p>
                  <p>Charity is exceeding advantageous, in as much as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents Strife and Contention, which flow from the contrary Diſpoſition: and are not Peace and Quiet deſirable Things? It alſo hath a natural Tendency to procure Friendſhip. Love is a Kind of Loadſtone, which draws Perſons by a gentle Violence to love us again; for who can withſtand the Charms of a generous Charity, that have the leaſt Remains of Humanity left in them? Again,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="unknown:005299_0154_1016F88D41D521A8"/>Charity will ſweeten every State of Life, and make them ſafe and profitable: It will incline us to anſwer the Deſign of Proſperity by ſuccouring the Indigent, and yield Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſo doing; but temper'd with a View of our Neighbour's Calamity. It alſo helps in Adverſity, not only by the Sweets of the divine Preſence, and inclining us to ſubmit to his ſovereign Will, but by a Complacency in others Succeſſes. But Uncharitableneſs is the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Charity is indeed a ſure, eaſy and ſafe Way, to the Poſſeſſion of all good Things.</q>
2 Cor. 6.10. <hi>As ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, yet always rejoycing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all Things.</hi> Does not your Neighbour's Wealth enrich you, if you feel Content in his poſſeſſing it; and his Honour advance you, if you feel a Complacence in it? Neither is this Property only imaginary, but real; for how is Property in Things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſiderable, but for the Content it brings? Again,</p>
                  <p>Charity frees our Souls from thoſe gloomy Paſſions of Anger and Revenge, which eclipſe their Beauty, and diſturb their Peace, and ſettles the Mind in a ſerene Calm, and keeps the lower Paſſions in a pleaſing Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Gal. 5.22. <hi>The Fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace.</hi> If therefore we love our Selves, we muſt love others, and do them Good. By Complacency we partake of their Pleaſures and Profits, whether they will or not; and by our Courteſy and Kindneſs, they will be inclin'd, unleſs they be Monſters of Ingratitude, to help us in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; and to live in Peace and Amity with us. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, our Kindneſs to them is like to engage their Prayers in our Favour; which if they are pious, are of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; for the fervent Prayers of the Righteous avail much. If the Curſes and Complaints of the oppreſſed do reach the Ears of God, Jam. 5.4. <hi>Behold the Hire of the Labourers, which have reaped down your Fields, which is of you kept back by Fraud, crieth; and the Cries of them which have reaped, are enter'd into the Ears of the Lord of Sabaoth,</hi> and pull down Vengeance upon Oppreſſors: How much more will the Interceſſions of the pious Poor, pierce the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005299_0155_1016F88F14E0F0B0"/>
Heavens, and bring down Bleſſings on the Charitable? But were no ſuch profitable Fruits following upon the Exerciſe of Charity, it's indeed eligible for it's own ſake: for it carries a Reward, a Heaven in it's Boſom, even that Calm which in ſome Meaſure conſtitutes the Happineſs of the glorified Saints and Angels, and even of God himſelf! O then, let us endeavour to obtain and increaſe this noble Grace! To this End, let us ſeriouſly conſider the Advantages that follow upon it, and the Diſadvantages which attend the Neglect thereof. Let us therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Love to God and Chriſt, and earneſtly beg this Grace of Love to our Brethren, and endeavour after it as far as we can.</p>
                  <p>But my very dear Brethren! Do not imagine that I have been by this Diſcourſe, inciting you to an unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Charity; i. e. to look upon Perſons to be truly gracious, when they are unſound in the main Principles of Religion; and ſo to reſpect them as ſuch, becauſe of their fair Shew in the Fleſh! No! no! This would prove a great Snare to your Souls: For when the Affections are inflamed, the Judgment is apt to be ſecretly byaſſed in Favour of the Objects of our Love. Tho' Charity hopes all Things, yet it is not ſtone-blind: We muſt examine well Men's Principles, before we give a looſe to our religious Paſſions towards them. To be ſuſpicious when we have Reaſon for it, is a godly Jealouſy, and very neceſſary for our own Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; eſpecially in theſe perilous Times in which we live. The Charity I have been inciting to, is ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts with our Regard to Truth, and to our own Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is a common ſaying, and a very juſt one, That Charity ſhould begin at Home. Love to our ſelves is made by our Lord, the Rule of our Love to our Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with the Exhortation of <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> (Eph. 5.1, 2.) <hi>Be ye therefore Followers of God as dear Children, and walk in Love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God, for a ſweet-ſmelling Savour.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not enough, for one to bring Things into a good State, or Condition at firſt, but we ſhould alſo endeavour afterwards carefully to preſerve them therein: Let a Man in temporal Matters, or civil Affairs, erect ever ſuch famous Edifices, plant ever ſuch fine Gardens, and make other Things of curious Workmanſhip, which with much Art, and great Pains are brought to admirable Perfection, we ſhall obſerve, that the Eſteem, that was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Projector's Wiſdom and Contrivance, will be much leſſened, when theſe Things are preſently neglected, and no more Care or Pains are taken by him to preſerve them, againſt thoſe Things that might annoy or ſpoil them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit God the all wiſe Architect of the Univerſe takes no leſs Care to maintain, and preſerve the Works of his Hands, than he did in their firſt Formation: of which he gives us daily Inſtances, by his watchful and providential Care, over the Works of Nature, and in his Church he gives us no leſs Proofs of this; if ever he brings his Church into a flouriſhing State,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005299_0158_1016F8937B8657A0"/>
and makes her appear like a delightful Garden, he takes Care and gives Orders concerning every Thing, that might cauſe her Beauty to fade, or rob her of her Ornaments: Which makes the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to ſpeak of the Church as a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard on a fruitful Hill, and planted with the choiceſt Vine. It is very remarkable that the firſt Thing here mentioned of it, is, <hi>And he fenced it,</hi> Iſai. 5.1.2. and to what End the ſame was thus fenced appears from the 5th Verſe, becauſe that Vineyard ſo beautifully planted might not go to decay, or be trodden under Foot, eaten up or deſtroy'd by wild Beaſts. Thus God takes Care to turn out of his Church whatever may prove pernicious or hurtful, as well as to cheriſh and preſerve whatever may perfect and beautify her Form. This appears very emphatically in the Words of the Text: The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom was before buſy, in inviting his Bride, as it were into the Country, in order to let her participate of all thoſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Delights, which the Seaſon afforded; for it was told her before, that every Thing had a goodly Appearance, and had put on a beautiful Form, and that every Thing now was flouriſhing and adorned with all the Beauties, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Spring-Seaſon, ſhadowing forth the ſpiritual State of the Church, in a high Degree of Perfection; in all Reſpects like a beautiful Paradiſe of Delight and Happineſs. But behold the Lord Jeſus in the Words of the Text, is buſy and full of Care, that this beautiful Form and Appearance of Things in his Vineyard ſhould not be marr'd or hurt, but that great Diligence ſhould be uſed to have them preſerved, and therefore he commands his Servants, to take theſe deſtructive Foxes, and eſpecially the young or little Foxes (which according to the Account that Naturaliſts give us of them, are propagated in the Spring, and if not catched, greatly multiply, and prove very pernicious) that they might not hurt, or deſtroy the Beauties of this Vineyard, as before deſcribed; and at the ſame Time, that the Bride might not be frightned, and diſturbed in her ſweet Communion and Fellowſhip with the Bridegroom, and that what was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful in this Vineyard, might not be leſſened by the ſpoiling of the Vines, and the Deſtruction of the tender Grapes. Thus the Words in more than one Reſpect
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005299_0159_1016F8979E21DA18"/>
have a ſweet Connection with what went before. <hi>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, that ſpoil the Vines, for our Vines have tender Grapes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Text then contains a tender Care which the Lord Jeſus has for his Church, and more eſpecially for ſuch Members of it, as are the weakeſt, that they may not by wicked and pernicious Inſtruments, loſe their Comelineſs, but that they ſhould be duly watched over, and taken Care of.</p>
                  <p>Two Heads of Doctrine do naturally flow from theſe Words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Command, <hi>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, that ſpoil the Vines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> An Argument, <hi>For our Vines have tender Grapes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who it is that ſpeaks here is ſomewhat obſcure, but as to the Matter ſpoken of, there is but little Difficulty. Some are of Opinion, that the Bride ſpeaks to the Bridegroom, and at the ſame time to his Bridemen and Fellows, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered together; or together with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt; which ſhould be brought in and included by the Word (<hi>us</hi>—) But the moſt take them to be the Words of the Bridegroom, and I ſee no Reaſon to diſſent from them. It is not unlikely that what contains a Narrative of her Beloved's Anſwer as ſpoken by her, ends at the 13th Verſe, and that the Bridegroom begins his Speech to her at the 14th Verſe, and ſo is continued in this: And if it be taken that the 14th Verſe ſhould belong to ſaid Narrative, or Chriſt's Call upon his Spouſe, as ſhe relates it, yet this 15th Verſe may properly be connected with it; and then it will ſtill appear to be the Words of the Bridegroom, related or ſpoken by the Bride; and tho' ſhe ends her Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative at the 14th Verſe, yet he may very properly be taken and underſtood to ſpeak here, for theſe following Reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To relieve the Bride from new Fears, or Doubts, by giving Command to his Servants, in her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to take the Foxes, which might appear frightful, and offenſive, that ſo ſhe might without any Scruple, or Doubt, follow him towards the Country. 2dly, Becauſe the Matter which is here given in Charge, is peculiar to that tender Care,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005299_0160_1016F89923D6AAD8"/>
which the Lord Jeſus exerciſes towards his Church. 3dly, Becauſe he has the greateſt Prerogative, over thoſe to whom this Charge or Command is given. 4thly, As he is the Lord of the Vineyard, he can do it with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and therefore moſt eminently belongs to him. 5ly. This further appears, becauſe the Word <hi>(us)</hi> moſt certainly includes him, and it is more fitting, that he ſhould give Orders, than the Bride.</p>
                  <p>The Evil which the Bridegroom is here concerned about, he expreſſes by the Name of <hi>Foxes, little Foxes, that ſpoil the Vines:</hi> The original Word is never otherwiſe tranſlated by our Interpreters than by the Word <hi>Fox</hi> or <hi>Foxes, Judges</hi> 15.4. <hi>Neh.</hi> 4 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.11. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.4. From what this Word hath ariſen, is very difficult to know: the learned <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves, that by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and the <hi>Arabians,</hi> a Cough is expreſſed by a Word, that agrees with this; and hence he concludes that the Foxes derive their Name, becauſe it is peculiar to them to cough; or becauſe their Barking reſembles a harſh or hoarſe Cough. He lays the whole ſtreſs of his Opinion, in this Reſpect, upon a French Proverb, and on a certain Author, that has made ſome Remarks upon it, and inaſmuch as in the ſame Remarks, it is ſaid, that the Foxes are poſſeſſed with a great internal Heat of Body (and I add, that they are exceeding Greedy, and of a rapacious Swiftneſs) I might with as much Ground of Probability, ſuppoſe, the Word to be derived from an <hi>Arabian</hi> Word, ſignifying in that Language (burning) — However I leave that Matter as it is.</p>
                  <p>It is a Creature that was known, and very common in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> which ſeems plain from the Story of <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> at leaſt they were numerous towards the Borders of the Philliſtines Country, <hi>Judges</hi> 13.4. It is a wild Creature, and therefore chiefly reſorting in deſert Places, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.4. and that they are Creatures that feed upon Fleſh or Dead Corps is plain from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.10. and <hi>Bochart</hi> obſerves the ſame: that they alſo fed and prey'd upon Fruits, and deſtroy'd them, appears plain from the Words of the Text. It is beyond all doubt, that by the Foxes here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005299_0161_1016F89BF5F18260"/>
is emblematically ſignified, and underſtood, a certain Sort of Men. R. <hi>Solomon</hi> a Jew, underſtood by theſe greater and leſſer Foxes, the Egyptians, and their Children whom God cauſed to be taken and ſwallow'd up by the Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the <hi>Red Sea:</hi> And hence according to his Notion they have derived their Name; I think but a very ſlender reaſon, <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> ſuppoſes by them is meant, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the golden Calf in the Wilderneſs, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him, did a great deal of Damage to the young Vineyards of the Children of Iſrael. The Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe makes them, to ſignify <hi>Amaleck,</hi> who was contriving to deſtroy <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs. Others underſtand by theſe Foxes, thoſe Adverſaries of the Jews, who after their Return from the Babylonian Captivity, endeavoured by Force, and all Manner of Artifice, and by their Complaints to the Perſian Monarchs, to hinder and obſtruct the rebuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple, and the re-eſtabliſhing of the Jeweſh State <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.6. Some have underſtood them as intending <hi>Herod,</hi> and his Miniſtry, who deſtroy'd the innocent Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in that horrid Murther at Bethlehem: Others again in a larger Senſe, will make them to ſignify all Manner of Sin; ſinful Thoughts, and Affections, which lurk in the hidden Corners, and Receſſes of the deceitful Hearts of Men, and which prove very troubleſom to the tender Bloſſoms, and firſt Fruits of Grace in the Children of God; this by Way of Alluſion is ſomething nearer to the Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But in Order to anſwer the Deſign of the Spirit of God, and the uſual Way of explaining ſuch Kind of Emblems, it will be much better to conceive, and underſtand by the Word Foxes, Men who are deſtructive Inſtruments of the Church; that prove to be to the Church what Foxes are ſaid to be to the Vineyards. It is plain, that ſuch Sort of Men are emblematically repreſented in the Scriptures, and deſcribed by different Kinds of wild and brute Beaſts. When by them are ſignified ſuch Men as prove deſtructive to the Church, thro' Barbarities and bloody Perſcutions, then they are generally called Lyons, Leopards, Bears, and wild Swine, and ſuch like voracious Animals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005299_0162_1016F89ECD50B4E8"/>Some indeed have alſo thought that by Foxes, ſuch kind of Perſecutors are intended, becauſe that Tyrant <hi>Herod,</hi> was by our Lord compared to a Fox, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.32. But I think it is well obſerved by the famous <hi>Bochart,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did not call him ſo, ſo much for his Cruelty as for his Subtilty and Deceitfulneſs, of which he had given ſome Specimens. I therefore believe with moſt Interpreters, that by Foxes is not ſo much intended, or to be underſtood open and bloody Perſecutors, as more cloſe and hidden Injurers of the Church. 1ſt. Becauſe ſuch moſt frequently appear, in the beſt and moſt peaceable State of the Church, as I before hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 2dly, Becauſe ſuch are not ſo apt totally to waſte and deſtroy the Vineyards (which ſeems more peculiar to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and more voracious Creatures) but only in Part, which is plainly intimated by theſe Foxes; who we ſee are moſtly bent upon the Deſtruction of the young and tender Grapes, while the Vineyard may ſtill remain. 3dly, Becauſe theſe are more properly the Subjects, here to be catched and taken, by the Servants and Miniſters of the Bridegroom, and the Bride, which is not ſo much the Caſe in reſpect of cruel and powerful Perſecutors. 4thly, Becauſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Denomination of Foxes, in reſpect of their Quality, more properly belongs to them. Hence it is that in all Ages, ſuch Men are more to be found within the Church, who by their Artifice and Craft, have more ſecret Ways and Means, to do Injury to Truth and Piety, and have proved dangerous, and hurtful to the Children of God. Such were the falſe Prophets, and deceitful Teachers under the old Teſtament Times, who were alſo compared to Foxes, Ezek. 13.3, 4. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, Wo unto the fooliſh Prophets, that follow their own Spirit, and have ſeen nothing. O Iſrael, thy Prophets are like the Foxes in the Deſarts.</hi> And afterwards, all thoſe falſe Scribes and Seducers of the People, all thoſe Sects of Phariſees, Sadducees, Eſſeens, and others, who after the return of the Jewiſh Nation from the Babylonian Captivity, by Degrees grew up and multiplied, and who by their falſe Doctrines and perverſe Deportments had wofully perverted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ruth, true Piety, and the Service of God, together with all thoſe falſe Apoſtles
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005299_0163_1016F8A19A04CC10"/>
and falſe Brethren of the Jews, thoſe vain and miſtaken Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of the Heathens, who either by their Jewiſh, or heatheniſh Principles and Doctrines, had perverted the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Chriſtian Liberty, and the Simplicity of the Goſpel, and all that Train of Hereticks, Seducers, and Schiſmaticks, who from Time to Time have appeared in the Goſpel Church; a Catalogue of which in every Age we have recorded by the learned <hi>Spanheim</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory. Certain it is that all ſuch Kind of noxious, and deſtructive Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Church, may very emphatically be compared to Foxes.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhould be ſo inquiſitive, as to deſire a more or leſs certain Deſcription, of the Nature and Quality of Foxes, they may ſee what Naturaliſts have ſaid concerning them, as ſet forth at large by <hi>Geſnerus, Bochart,</hi> and others. I ſhall but briefly mention a few of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Foxes are famous among the Herds of Animals for their great Cunning, and Craft: for which Reaſon we before obſerved, the Lord Jeſus called <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Many Proverbs are taken and borrowed by the Antients, from their Subtilty. Many Inſtances of their Craft, and the common Compariſon of crafty Men to Foxes, are mentioned and recorded by the ſaid Hiſtorians. It is alſo noted by them that the Names of Foxes, are taken from their ſubtilneſs, eſpecially among the Grecians. Hereticks, and ſuch like Diſturbers of the Church, are generally Men of Wit and Ingenuity. It's true, there have been ſome among them, Men of weak Minds, and little Parts, and have been Broachers of very blunt Errors; but then ſuch have had but little Influence; but others were keen and cunning Wits, ingenious Philoſophers, who did oppoſe themſelves to the myſterious and ſimple Doctrines of the Goſpel, with all the Force of Wit, and Eloquence which they were Maſters of; upon which account <hi>Tertullian</hi> often ſaith <hi>De ingenio profeſſorum Sapientiae omnem haereſin anamari: Haereſis Philoſophos et Haereticorum Patriarchas eſſe:</hi> that all Hereſie was animated by the Wit of the Profeſſors of Philoſophy, that through an eager Deſire after Wiſdom Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005299_0164_1016F8A479E73248"/>
were broached, that Philoſophers were the Patriarchs of all Hereticks.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, Foxes becauſe of their Cunning and Sagacity, are of a treacherous, and deceitful Practice, full of Devices, and of a ſeducing Behaviour. Now not a more natural, or proper Character, can be given of Hereticks and falſe Teachers; they are generally well furniſhed with cunning, evaſive, and diſſimulating Tricks: St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore calls them vain Talkers, and Deceivers, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.10. who as it were juggle and bewitch the People, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. who <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert whole Families Tit,</hi> 1.11. <hi>ſeducing Spirits,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>deceitful Workers,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. who by their <hi>ſleight and cunning Craftineſs eaſily deceive,</hi> Eph. 4.14. And if it pleaſe you I ſhall deſcend into further Particulars, to ſhew you the Analogy between the Foxes, and Seducers and falſe Teachers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Foxes, that they may the better conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſubſiſt not ſo much above Ground, as in Holes and Caverns, under the Earth, and often theſe are very deep. Luk. 9.58. <hi>The Foxes have Holes</hi> &amp;c. Hereticks, and Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, always endeavour to hide their Doctrines and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and keep them as ſecret as they can. Certain it is, that they do not preſently, and openly appear to the World, but know how to hide themſelves, under ſly Shifts, and cunning Evaſions. We find therefore the Lord Jeſus uſed it as an Argument, that no One might ſuſpect his Doctrine, John 18.20. <hi>I ſpake openly to the World, I ever taught in the Synagogues, and in the Temple whither the Jews always reſort, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, Their Holes have but a very ſtraight and narrow Entrance; and it is ſurprizing how they can ſqueſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and ſtretch themſelves out, to get into thoſe narrow Paſſages. <hi>Horace</hi> therefore makes mention of a certain Fox, that crept through an exceeding narrow Crack; <hi>Forte per anguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam tenuis Vulpecula rimam &amp;c.</hi> It is alſo peculiar to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and falſe Teachers, not to ſuffer their ſecret Wiles to be ſearched into and diſcovered; they hide and beſet themſelves and their Opinions, as artfully as they can; they ſpeak of them, in ſuch equivocating and doubtful
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005299_0165_1016F8A7AB48B428"/>
Terms, that one muſt ſearch well, and make a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Inſpection, if he ſhall diſcover their Fox-Holes; and little would he think (if he penetrates ſo far) to find ſo much Deceit lurking behind the Scene. St. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore ſpeaks of them, as falſe Teachers, who ſhall privily bring in damnable Hereſies, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, Foxes, at Places where they chiefly reſort, have moſt commonly, many Ways, and Paſſages, to come out at; becauſe if one ſhould be ſtopped or cloſed up they may have another to creep out at. Hereticks, and falſe Teachers, alſo have their Trenches, and here and there a back Door, that when they come to be ſo cloſe ſet, and have as it were their Mouths ſtopped, they may have ſome mean Shift or Equivocation to help themſelves withal.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, It will appear from what has been already ſaid, that Foxes are very hard to be catched. Falſe Teachers, thoſe of them that are any thing crafty, are hard to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and yet more difficult to be convinced.</p>
                  <p n="5">5thly, Foxes that they may not be ſo eaſily enſnared ſeldom run right forward, but run to one Side, and to the other Side, and croſs Ways; from which ſome of the Latins have derived the Name, <hi>Vulpes quaſi Volipes.</hi> Hereticks and Seducers in like Manner, have forſaken the right Ways, and run into perverſe and crooked By-Roads; and thus the further they go on, the further they go a ſtray from the right Ways of Truth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6thly They have a ſly Way of creeping into other Holes, and of turning other Animals (it may be ſaid) out of their rightful Poſſeſſions. So it is with reſpect to falſe Teachers and Seducers, of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks: <hi>For of this Sort are thoſe which creep into Houſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. And it may be generally ſaid of them, that they creep into ſettled Miniſtries and Congregations, and turn out thoſe that are orthodox amongſt them, by their poiſonous and infectious Errors, and ſome Times (if ſuch Means will not do, when they get the upper Hand) by uſing Force and Violence.</p>
                  <p n="7">7thly, Foxes know how to diſſemble, and often ſhow what they are not, in order to cheat and decoy leſs harmleſs Creatures, and to make a Prey of them. If we may give
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005299_0166_1016F8ABC5FBDC40"/>
Credit to what <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſayeth, they are wont to ſtretch themſelves out on the Earth, and lay as if they had no Life in them, that when the Fowls of the Air perceiving them, may by lighting upon them, become their Prey; and alſo as they in outward Appearance are not much unlike Dogs; ſome times they venture to mingle themſelves with thoſe Dogs that are ſet to watch the Flock, <hi>Job.</hi> 30.1. And that they know how to imitate the Barkings of thoſe Watch-Dogs; and by that Means decoy and enſnare the innocent Flock, which thoſe Dogs are ſet over. Falſe Teachers and Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are wonderfully ſkilled in ſuch Kind of Tricks; they know how to appear outwardly very kind, friendly, and courteous, as if they meant or intended no Harm; they appear to be very tender, candid, and patient, full of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love; and are mightely for Chriſtian Liberty; and by this Means intice the Simple, and ſteal into their Hearts and Affections; and alſo they know how to imitate the good Watch-Dogs; to which faithful Paſtors may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in Contradiſtinction of what we read, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56.10, 11. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of the falſe Apoſtles and deceitful Workers, that they are <hi>even as Satan transforming themſelves into Angels of Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes in the Church they bear the ſame Offices with the Faithful, and are outwardly join'd with them, and are very ſtrict in all their Behaviour; they make a ſpecious Shew in the Performance of all the Duties of Morality and Piety, equal to, and often beyond any others: As we may ſee in the Phariſees of old, and more lately in the <hi>Novatians, Donatiſts, Pelageans, Jeſuits, Socinians, Quakers;</hi> and many others. Theſe are the <hi>falſe Prophets in Sheeps Clothing, but within are ravening Wolves,</hi> Mat. 7.15. They are very artful in putting a fine Gloſs upon their erronious Principles and Doctrines, to make them agreable to natural Reaſon, and know how to cook and dreſs them up to the particular Taſtes of Men; They can not only varniſh them with a Shew of great Wiſdom, but alſo (as if they were ſound) cloke them with holy Scripture, and under the Umbrage of ſome Truths, which they ſtill retain, mix and mingle their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Errors: They alſo ſpeak like the true Watchmen,

often not only with much Eloquence, but under a Pretence of extraordinary Revelations; yea they can ſpeak the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of true Divines. You ſhall hardly meet with a Heretick without a good Stock of Literature, by Means whereof under ambiguous Expreſſions, and mental Evaſions, they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even as <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſpeaks of them; "They (ſays he) ſpeak the ſame Things, but believe otherways". Such were the Subtilties of the <hi>Arians,</hi> which they ſhewed after their Errors were detected, and condemned at <hi>Bithany,</hi> when in a City in <hi>Thrace,</hi> of the ſame Name, they drew up a falſe Creed, and put it into the Hands of the ſimpler Sort, under the Name of the <hi>Nicene.</hi> Church Hiſtory informs us, that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for that Arch-Heretick <hi>Arius,</hi> to ſpeak in the ſame Strain, and with the ſame Language of the Faithful, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had ſome mental Reſerve, and couched under a quite different Meaning. And at laſt, when by the Inſtigation of the Emperor he was preſſed upon to ſubſcribe to the true <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, it's obſerved that he underwrote thus, <hi>As I have underwritten, ſo I do believe:</hi> Meaning at the ſame time a certain Writing, which he then had under his Arm, and had prepared before Hand and ſubſcribed unto. Such are truly thoſe <hi>Lyars</hi> who by their Hypocriſy do ſeduce, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. Who <hi>cauſe Diviſions and Offences, contrary to ſound Doctrine; and by good Words and fair Speeches, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Hearts of the Simple,</hi> Rom. 16.17, 18. Who give themſelves out for <hi>Apoſtles and are not, but are found Liars,</hi> Rev. 2.2. All the aforeſaid Particulars, may be brought to prove the cunning of Foxes, and their Analogy with ſuch Hereticks and Seducers, and are the chief Things aim'd at, in theſe emblematical Characters contain'd in the Text: However we may add this further, that Foxes as they are wild Creatures, have an inherent Savageneſs and Cruelty joined with their Cunning, which appears plain from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.10. Hereticks and Seducers if they can't make their Deluſions take as they like, and they get the upper Hand, by getting the Authority on their Side, they generally become cruel; then they cannot bear thoſe that are faithful; then they will fall upon them with all Kinds of Aſperſions, and falſe Accuſations, and become their cruel

Perſecutors; then they change their Shape, and become ravening Wolves, to whom in this Reſpect they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Grievous Wolves,</hi> Matth. 20.29. <hi>Evil Beaſts,</hi> Tit. 1.12. What Miſchiefs did not the falſe Prophets hatch againſt the true Prophets, and thoſe that held with them, under the Reigns of the Kings of Judah? What Babarities &amp; Cruelties were exerciſed againſt the Faithful, by thoſe Apoſtates among the <hi>Maccabees</hi> after their Return out of Captivity? How bloody was the Rage of the Scribes, and Heads of the Jewiſh Church againſt the bleſſed Jeſus, againſt his Apoſtles, and the whole Body of the primitive Chriſtians? How many bitter Trials and Sufferings have the faithful Chriſtians undergone by Reaſon of the ſuperiour Strength of Hereticks and Seducers, and the Influence they have had with thoſe in civil or regal Authority? All which abundantly appears from the Teſtimonies of Scripture, both of the old and new Teſtament, from the Books of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and Church Chronicles; and above all, from the moſt terrible &amp; barbarous Cruelties committed by the <hi>Arians</hi> in divers Perſecutions under the Favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Emperors and Empreſſes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Text further ſpeaks of <hi>little Foxes:</hi> Theſe ſeem to be more particularly mentioned, not ſo much becauſe eaſier catched than the older and more cunning, as ſome have obſerved; neither becauſe they are more ſwift and greedy, and conſequently more miſchievous than the old, as others would have it, (of both which I much doubt) but chiefly inaſmuch as they are ſmaller, are not ſo eaſily ſeen and diſcovered, and have every where an eaſier Acceſs, and for that Reaſon are more dangerous in doing Miſchief, and therefore not to be neglected or thought too little of: And more particularly it ſerves to inſtruct us, to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful againſt all Manner of Evil in it's ſmalleſt Beginnings. Should we paſs by the little Foxes, they will become big ones in a little Time, and by their Growth and Increaſe, will be able ſoon to over-run every Thing.</p>
                  <p>Now to anſwer the Deſign of the Text, when the Lord Jeſus commands his Servants to watch againſt the evil Workers and Corrupters of his Church, under the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005299_0169_1016F8B29BE6F1C0"/>
Characters of <hi>little Foxes;</hi> it is not intended or ſpoken ſo much by Way of Diminution, nor becauſe by an affected Humility, they appear ſmall (as ſome do take it) but the Lord intends by it a ſecond Sort of Injurers of his Church, ſuch whoſe Errors comparatively are not ſo great, and alſo ſuch perhaps who have not the greateſt Party, and are not in moſt Eſteem, or ſuch who are yet as it were hidden; and in this Reſpect much reſemble little Foxes, who are low and ſquat, and apt to ſneak away; and are thus more apt to paſs unobſerved: Such there have been in the primitive Churches, beſides thoſe Arch-Hereticks, and ſuch there have been in after Ages, even until now. Theſe do not altogether ſubvert the Exiſtence of the Church, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert her in all the Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Faith, but nevertheleſs, can do a great deal of Miſchief, both as to the Truths and the Peace of the Church, and frequently prove Forerunners of larger Foxes, which in Time wax ſtrong; and therefore the Lord Jeſus will not have them excuſed, and by Conſequence is not at all for Toleration in this Point. He intends by it all Injurers of the Church in their firſt Appearance, while they are yet young and ſmall, for then they are not ſo cunning, and altogether ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, as they may be in proceſs of Time; neither are their Errors ſo groſs, which generally in Time do increaſe, their Party not ſo ſtrong, and their Credit and Reſpect is leſs, and therefore never eaſier ſtopped than while they are ſmall.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord here ſuppoſes (and it is alſo evident from all Experience) that ſuch Foxes both great and ſmall have been, and will be in all Ages of the Church. And with reſpect to their Miſcheivouſneſs he further adds, <hi>which</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſpoil the Vines.</hi> It is natural and peculiar to Foxes, to ſpoil the Vines (whether we conſider them as reſpecting whole Vineyards, or particular Vines, is little to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for the one includes the other, and it is true in both Reſpects) by rooting at the Roots, taring down the Leaves, the Branches; and particularly by deſtroying the Fruits. Hence perhaps it was that <hi>Samſon</hi>'s Foxes, among other Things, fell foul of the Philiſtines Vineyards, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15.5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="unknown:005299_0170_1016F8B6C7985218"/>Thus we have ſeen that Foxes, as before deſcribed, are naturally bent upon, and actually do deſtroy the <hi>Vineyards,</hi> and <hi>ſpoil the Vines.</hi> The Church and the People of God in Scripture are frequently compared to a <hi>Vineyard, Cant.</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>Iſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.11.2. and in many other Places. When the Lord Jeſus here makes mention of Vines in the plural Number, particular Churches ſeem plainly to be intimated, or Congregations which are as ſo many <hi>Vineyards,</hi> and Believers as ſo many <hi>Vines</hi> ſcattered up and down within the Compaſs of certain Cities or Countries, which are planted, and grow up together, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fruit under the ſpecial and peculiar Care of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, fenced about by his Power, ſhone upon by the bright Beams of his Countenance, watered by his Word and Spirit, and made fruitful by his peculiar Benediction. But theſe are Things not at preſent to be inlarged upon.</p>
                  <p>But here take Notice, that Foxes both great and ſmall are ſaid to ſpoil the Vines, which in the Original ſignifies as much as all Manner of Injury more or leſs, or even to the utter Deſtruction of any Thing. See <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 13.5. And here we may take it in its full Latitude for all <hi>falſe Teachers,</hi> and Seducers, Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks &amp;c. who ſpoil theſe ſpiritual Vineyards in all the following Particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt in the Truth: By the ſpreading of Lyes, and propagated of falſe Doctrines, which cannot be ſupported by the Word of God, whatever ſpecious Pretences they may have notwithſtanding; who turn People about by the Wind of their Doctrine, and by their Cunning eaſily ſeduce, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Reſpect compares their Doctrine to a mortal Diſeaſe, which, ſays he, <hi>will eat a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th a Canker,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.17. This was manifeſt in the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy, which like a Flood over-run the Earth; and it ſeem'd as if the whole World was tinctured with <hi>Arianiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in Piety: When the Truths which are from God, and which are our Directory and true Guide, be taken away, it will follow that Godlineſs and true Piety muſt totally decay; by Contentions and Diviſions, they may be led to Diſregard inward Frames and Experiences,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005299_0171_1016F8BAE60EE3B0"/>
and carried away from the moſt eſſential and practical Things in the Chriſtian Religion, and inſtead of getting their Hearts ſtrengthned by Grace, they will be carried about with diverſe and ſtrange Doctrines, and take up with ſuch Things which have not profited them that have been occupied therein, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. We ſee that <hi>Paul</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders theſe Things as Oppoſites that cannot be join'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Refuſe profane and old Wives Fables, and exerciſe thy ſelf rather unto Godlineſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.7. This will yet further appear, when ſuch Seducers lay ſuch a Foundation which has a natural Tendency to Sin, and opens a Door for carnal Security, and Self-deceiving, or when they by their Lives and Examples ſeduce into Sin. This St. <hi>Peter</hi> makes mention of, 2 Pet. 2.18, 19. <hi>For when they ſpeak great ſwelling Words of Vanity, they allure through the Luſts of the Fleſh, through much Wantonneſs, thoſe that were clean eſcaped from them who live in Error; while they promiſe them Liberty, they themſelves are the Servants of Corruption.</hi> Of theſe Sort were all thoſe which in the primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were reckoned among the impure Gnoſticks, the Followers of <hi>Simon, Meander, Saturniás, Baſilides, Carpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Valentius,</hi> and many others; every one of which opened a Door to all Manner of Ungodlineſs. Thus God ſaid of the hypocritical Prophets in <hi>Judah,</hi> Jer. 23.14. <hi>I have ſeen alſo in the Prophets of Jeruſalem an horrible Thing, they commit Adultery and walk in Lies, they ſtrengthen alſo the Hands of the evil Doers, that none doth return from his Wickedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the Worſhip of God: For when Truth and Piety decay, it generally follows that the very Eſſence of Worſhip will be corrupted, the Spirit and Purity of it will fail, Superſtition and Will-Worſhip will prevail: This may be ſeen of the falſe Prophets of Iſrael, who ſeduced the People into Idolatry. And in thoſe Apoſtates among the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>accabees,</hi> who brought the Grecian <hi>Ethicks</hi> into God's Worſhip, and in the Sects of the Samaritans, Herodians, Phariſees, Sadducees, and Eſſeens, who took the very <hi>Soul</hi> out of the inſtituted Worſhip of God, which made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in every Reſpect like a meer Image without Life a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005299_0172_1016F8BC6A0A4C70"/>
Web interwoven with Hypocriſy and human Inventions. This we have alſo ſeen in Antichriſt, who changed the whole Worſhip of God into Superſtition, Will-Worſhip and Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in Order, Unity, and Peace. We ſhall ſee that, that ſweet Comelineſs and Beauty, will preſently depart from the Lord's Vineyard: Even as Foxes do turn every Thing upſide down, mar and ſpoil the Order and Beauty of Vineyards; ſo every Thing in the Church will be turned upſide down, and brought into a ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Whenever theſe <hi>Church Foxes</hi> make their Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, all Manner of Contentions, Diſquietudes, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, Quarrels and Schiſms, break out; that mutual Love that ſubſiſted before, is turned into Hatred. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore deſcribes them as ſuch, which <hi>cauſe Diviſions and Offences contrary to the Doctrine which they have learned,</hi> Rom. 16.17. St. <hi>James</hi> obſerves it as a Conſequence of ſuch a Wiſdom which is not from above, but is (ſaith he) <hi>earthly, ſenſual, and deviliſh: for where Envying and Strife is, there is Confuſion, and every evil Work,</hi> Jam. 3.15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in Growth: For as Foxes by rooting up and taring off the Buds and Branches of Vineyards, do vaſtly obſtruct and hinder their Growth; ſo we may obſerve, that as ſoon as ever falſe Doctrine and Hereſy appear, the Growth and Progreſs of the Church will ſoon meet with an uncommon Shock; the Growth of young Converts will be exceedingly check'd: Theſe do not know by Reaſon of theſe Contentions and Diviſions that happen, what Courſe either to ſteer, or on which Side to turn themſelves; and on the other Hand many Branches that did belong to her, will be quite torn off.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, in her Fruit bearing. Whereas Foxes in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards do Injury to the Fruits in more than one Reſpect, they mar them in the Bud, as well as deſtroy them when come to Maturity; even ſo by theſe Means in the Church, ſpiritual Fruitfulneſs preſently decays and withers away in ſuch Congregations; the goodly Fruits of Faith, Love, and Holineſs, drop off, and they are ſwallowed up with Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs and Diſquietudes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:005299_0173_1016F8BE41DECA50"/>Seventhly, in her Bloom and Ornaments: For as Foxes in Vineyards do deſtroy every Thing that is ornamental, by tearing down the Branches, Leaves, and Fruits; even ſo it is with the moſt blooming and flouriſhing Church, when theſe ſpiritual <hi>Foxes</hi> come into it; her Appearance and Aſpect is often times ſo much changed from what it was, that ſhe hardly in any Reſpect looks like the ſame; all her Splendor is departed, her Bloom and Beauty decay'd, and all her Robes are ſo rent and torn, that every Thing hangs as it were in Rags about her. Do we not even behold this in the Times paſt, in ſo many beautiful Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the eaſtern Churches; which by Reaſon of Hereſies among them, had almoſt loſt the very Eſſence and ſmalleſt Remains of true Chriſtianity? And what became of the Church when Antichriſt overſpread the ſame, is too well known to need a Recital.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, in her Strength and Security: Even as Foxes are wont to root at the Roots of Vineyards, and cauſe them to totter and ſhake, ſo do theſe Hereſies cauſe every Thing to ſhake, by rooting up the Foundations upon which this ſpiritual Vineyard is built, the Plants thereof are made looſe, and begin to ſhake; they begin to lean and incline to Lies; and ſome do totally fall down. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> warns us againſt Men that ſhould ariſe; as he ſays Act. 20.30. <hi>Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall Men ariſe, ſpeaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Things, to draw away Diſciples after them:</hi> And as ſuch that ſhould be the Cauſe of <hi>ſome to depart from the Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.5. Some that ſhould <hi>depart from the Faith, giving Heed to ſeducing Spirits.</hi> Yea, they will even tear up the Incloſure of the Lord's Vineyard, and leave it deſtitute of all Security and Defence, by breaking through all Church-Diſcipline, or by getting in Favour with the ſecular Powers, and drawing them over to their Party; which otherwiſe are a Defence and Security to the Church. This has been ſeen in the falſe Prophets of old, in the apoſtate Jews among the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> who were in Colluſion with the Syrian Monarchs; and in ſeveral other Hereticks in the primitive Churches; and more lately in the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005299_0174_1016F8C074B37098"/>Ninthly and laſtly. As a Conſequence of what has been ſaid, it brings endleſs Ruin upon the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men that are ſeduced by them; no leſs than the Loſs of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation. This is certainly alſo an Evil or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that they bring upon the Lord's Vineyard. It's not only a Hereſy in Morals, but a Hereſy in Doctrines, which ruins the Souls of Men, and ſinks them into eternal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Even as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us of an eternal Deſtruction, that follows and flows from Hereſies, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. throughout that whole Chapter. Well may the Lord therefore call them, <hi>Paſtors that deſtroy and ſcatter the Sheep of his Paſture,</hi> Jer. 23.1.</p>
                  <p>We ſee from what has been ſaid, in how many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in Truth, that ſuch Foxes do <hi>ſpoil the Vines.</hi> And if we ſhould let them go on in their Way without controul, we ſhould quickly find the Truth of what was ſaid of other Paſtors, Jer. 12.10. <hi>Many Paſtors have deſtroy'd my Vineyard, they have trodden my Portion under Foot; they have made my pleaſant Portion a deſolate Wilderneſs.</hi> Yea, we ſhould quickly ſee that neither Vineyard nor Branch would be found. This is therefore the Reaſon why the Lord Jeſus will have his Vineyard carefully watched over, and is the Reaſon why he commands his Servants, as in the Words of the Text, <hi>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes that ſpoil the Vines, for our Vines have tender Grapes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a Diverſity of Opinions, concerning the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom this Command ſhould be given: Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it to be the Angels; others, the civil Powers; but the moſt, Paſtors and Teachers: I incline rather to take the Command in a larger Senſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> to concern all thoſe why ſtand in any near Relation to the Bridegroom, over whom he exerciſes his peculiar Authority, and who are in any Reſpect capable or qualified to take theſe Foxes.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, All <hi>Overſeers</hi> of the Church in all Ages, and of all Stations and Degrees; <hi>i. e.</hi> Prophets, Prieſts, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Teachers; to whom in Reſpect of their Offices, this Duty of taking the Foxes, moſt eminently and peculiarly belongs.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005299_0175_1016F8C755A7F5E8"/>2. This Duty includes and enjoins all particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, when a fit Opportunity preſents, ſo far as they have Talents and Capacities to detect thoſe that are in Error, to oppoſe and endeavour to convince them: <hi>Looking diligently, leſt any Man fail of the Grace of God; leſt any Root of Bitterneſs ſpringing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled,</hi> Heb. 12.15.</p>
                  <p>Now of all theſe it is required to <hi>take</hi> theſe <hi>Foxes,</hi> theſe <hi>young Foxes:</hi> It might as well be tranſlated, to apprehend, to hold. Naturaliſts do obſerve, that tho' Foxes can be taken, yet it is very difficult. Here in a ſpiritual Senſe, it alſo requires great Pains and Induſtry to take theſe Foxes. Jeſus Chriſt here gives Power and Command to do it; <hi>Take us the Foxes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now wherein the Matter of this Duty conſiſts, is not very difficult to conceive; generally, it conſiſts in uſing all poſſible and neceſſary Means, to prevent theſe Foxes from doing any Kind of Miſchief to the Lord's Vineyard.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To purſue them into their intricate Wiles and Mazes, to detect and apprehend them in their Subterfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; to warn the Ignorant againſt them, and to keep a careful Watch and Look-out againſt them. This is what St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts unto, Phil. 3.2. <hi>Beware of Dogs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of evil Workers, beware of the Conciſion.</hi> The Lord Jeſus commends the <hi>Epheſians</hi> for this, Rev. 2.2. <hi>And thou haſt tried them which ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found them Lyars.</hi> And this he alſo injoins when he ſays, <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets, which come to you in Sheeps Cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves,</hi> Matth. 7.15. And to the ſame Purpoſe are all thoſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Exhortations which we find, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28, 29. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. <hi>and</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To attack them where-ever we meet with them; fall upon them and oppoſe them: much in ſuch a Manner as we find <hi>Peter</hi> fell upon <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon <hi>Bar-Jeſus</hi> on the Iſland of <hi>Salamis,</hi> Act. 13. Where-ever he found falſe Brethren, he preſently faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and earneſtly oppoſed them; which plainly appears from the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and from his Epiſtles. And

Thus did the Fathers in all Ages of the Church in which they lived, enter into laudable and earneſt Diſputes, and with much Bravery confuted thoſe that were in Error; which may be ſeen in the Writings and Diſputes of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> againſt the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and <hi>Valentinians;</hi> and of <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Marcion, Hermogenes, Praxias,</hi> and <hi>Sabellianus;</hi> the ſame againſt the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> and <hi>Gnoſticks;</hi> of <hi>Origen</hi> againſt <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Marcion;</hi> of <hi>Athanaſius, Hillary, Baſil, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> againſt the <hi>Arians;</hi> of <hi>Optatus, Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitanus,</hi> againſt the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> of <hi>Jerom</hi> againſt <hi>Jovinian, Vigilantius,</hi> the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians;</hi> of <hi>Serapio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005299_0177_1016F8CBAEEABA18"/>
return from the Paths of Deluſion, into the Boſom of the Church Such was the happy taking of a cunning Fox, a very learned Philoſopher (according to what <hi>Sozomen</hi> tells of him) who in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> did vehemently and impudently oppoſe the Doctrines of Faith; but the ſame was by a Member of that Council (tho' otherwiſe not the moſt ingenious, yet honourable for his Age) convinced, and immediately taken in the Net of the Goſpel, and drawn by the Cords of irreſiſtable Grace into an effectual and ſincere Repentance. Not much unlike unto this, was what the ſame Author relates of another Philoſopher, who was choſen out of many others, as the ableſt to enter into a Debate with <hi>Alexander,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that he was ſo ſtruck with the firſt Word ſpoken by the Biſhop, that he could not utter one Word.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ſhould, when all other Means fail, by eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Methods (without any Force or Reſtraint upon the Conſcience, or Perſecution) ſet Bounds to, and hinder them from propagating their pernicious and deſtructive Errors.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 and laſtly, To caſt them out of the Lord's Vineyard; namely, by Excommunication. By this we declare them to be no more Brothers; and by it they are cut off from Communion with the People of God. This is demanded by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in Reſpect of thoſe which cauſe <hi>Diviſions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned; And avoid them,</hi> ſays he Rom. 16.17.—<hi>I would they were even cut off, which trouble you,</hi> Gal. 5.12.—<hi>A Man that is an Heretick, after the firſt and ſecond Admonition reject,</hi> Tit. 3.10. Even as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf did to <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom he had <hi>delivered unto Satan,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.20. This was the Practice of the Fathers in the primitive Times: Hence it was that ſo many Councils and Synods were ſummoned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, in which all Kinds of Errors and falſe Doctrines were condemned, and thoſe that were the Broachers and Promoters of them caſt out. The Truth of this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Inſtances, of <hi>Samoſatenus,</hi> by two Councils at <hi>Antioch</hi> held in the Years 262, and 270; of the <hi>Arians,</hi> by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council 325; of <hi>Macedonius</hi> by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> 381; of <hi>Neſtor</hi> by the Council at

                  <p>Behold, thus we have ſeen the Duty the Lord Jeſus requires of his Servants, and how he commands theſe <hi>Foxes,</hi> to be taken, not only for himſelf, but alſo for his Bride; imply'd in the Words, <hi>Take us:</hi> It ſerves to inform us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is a mutual <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> ſubſiſting between Jeſus Chriſt and his Church; that their Intereſt is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as betwixt Husband and Wife, Bridegroom and Bride.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That what Service is done for the one, is alſo done for the other. Whoever ſerves Jeſus Chriſt, does at the ſame Time ſerve his Church and People.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That an Injury done to the one, is an Injury done to the other; and that theſe Foxes are in both their Way, and therefore ſhould be taken for the one as well as for the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Jeſus Chriſt makes the Intereſt and Concern of the Church his own, and reckons whatever is done to her, as if the ſame was done to himſelf. Matth. 10.40. <hi>Whoever receiveth you, receiveth me.</hi> Zech. 2.8. <hi>For he that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of his Eye.</hi> Act. 9.4. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> And ſee <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.41. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.35, 45.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That Chriſt and the Spouſe mutually take Delight and have a Complacency in this; and ſo the Words, <hi>Take us the Foxes,</hi> will ſignify as much as take them for Our Pleaſure and Delight; even as great Perſonages ſometimes make chaſing or hunting Matches for their Diverſion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This would be of great Service, and in a particular Manner conduce to promote the Eaſe of the Bridegroom and of the Bride, that in as much as ſhe was to accompany him towards the Country, it would be neceſſary that theſe Foxes ſhould be firſt taken, and removed out of the Way. Now who would refuſe to promote the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of this honourable Couple, by preventing the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that would accrue to their Vineyard? This methinks is a ſufficient Motive to take theſe Foxes; however if
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005299_0179_1016F8D0421C9A88"/>
that ſhould not be enough, the Lord Jeſus urges this further, and ſaith (which often in the Hebrew is giving a Reaſon, and is therefore with us well tranſlated by the Word <hi>For) For our Vines,</hi> (by which he alſo further ſhews and aſcertains the mutual Property they had in this Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard) <hi>have tender Grapes.</hi> The ſame original Words we find in the 13th Verſe of this Chapter: We may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by it weak or tender Chriſtians, ſuch either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not been long on the Way, or being but ſmall in Knowledge, weak in Faith, and other Chriſtian Graces, like young Children, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.12.) or rather becauſe of the Weakneſs or Tenderneſs of the Habit of Grace in the Converted, which may be taken for the Vines. Only here take Notice, that the Lord Jeſus uſes this as an Excitement to take the Foxes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We may take it generally, as if he ſhould ſay; Our Vines are as tender as temporal Vineyard, having tender Grapes; and then we might take it as if the Tranſlation run thus, <hi>For our Vines are as Vineyards hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tender Grapes:</hi> That is to ſay, the Fruits and Work of Grace in Believers, are as tender, can bear as little, and are as eaſily marr'd, as the tender Grapes are in the Vineyards; for which Reaſon it is the more neceſſary to take theſe Foxes, here repreſented to be in theſe ſpiritual Vineyards; becauſe they are always as noxious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in the Church, as Foxes are in the temporal Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards having young and tender Grapes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We might alſo take it with Reſtriction to ſome weak Chriſtians with tender Diſpoſitions, which are always to be found in the Church, and that Jeſus Chriſt conſiders his Vineyard in this View; or more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſively for new erected Congregations, Vineyards as it were in their Bloom, and juſt beginning to Bud, fill'd with young Converts, or young Chriſtians; emblemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally repreſented by the Spring-Seaſon, every Thing being young and tender, and then above all other Times, theſe Foxes would prove moſt deſtructive, and would ſpoil and take away all the Hopes of Fruit. This is even the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005299_0180_1016F8D1D319D4E0"/>
Caſe with Reſpect to the Work of Grace in the People of God; for falſe Teachers and Seducers, have not, nor cannot take ſo much hold of, and have ſo much Influence upon the more experienced and eſtabliſhed, as they can have upon the young unexperienced and leſs eſtabliſhed Believers, who by Reaſon of their Weakneſs cannot oppoſe them, and want Capacity to diſtinguiſh theſe Foxes; hence it will follow, that they are very eaſily ſeduced. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the laſt Neceſſity, in as much as the Lord's Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard was full of theſe ſmall ones, to have theſe pernicious Foxes taken, that their intended Miſchief and Deſtruction to theſe Vines may be prevented.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Furthermore, we may take it in this Senſe, <hi>Take us the Foxes &amp;c. for our Vines have tender Grapes:</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, We have a beautiful Proſpect of much Fruit, and Hopes of a plentiful Harveſt; the young Grapes which appear, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Beginnings of Grace, give reaſonable Expectation of a further Growth to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Take therefore theſe Foxes, which may diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point our Hopes, and fruſtrate our Expectations, without any Delay; and by this Means you will anticipate the Danger that threatens us in the Diſappointment of our Hope, and the Ruine of our Harveſt. This is therefore a ſufficient Motive for you to haſten in the Work.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We may take it in Point of Time, that as in the Spring of the Year, the Vineyards bud forth, and have tender Grapes, ſo the Foxes then alſo bring forth their Young. So it is with the Church when ſhe flouriſhes, and is in her Bloom and Proſperity; then alſo Hereticks, and Seducers, generally make their Appearance; and therefore it is as much as if the Lord ſhould ſay, <hi>Vigila!</hi> Take Care! Now is the Seaſon that Foxes bring forth their Young; and if ever there be a Time to anticipate their Growth, and hinder their Increaſe, it is now when they make their firſt Appearance: <hi>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, that ſpoil the Vines, for our Vines have tender Grapes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold the Neceſſity of this Charge which Jeſus has given concerning his Vineyard; and it is a plain Evidence
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005299_0181_1016F8D639920980"/>
of that tender Care which he has for his Church, and more eſpecially for thoſe that are the weakeſt of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; a Charge very neceſſary to be put in Execution at all Times; but if ever there was a Time, that loudly called for this Duty, we may ſay it is NOW. Certainly there have been in all Ages of the Church ſuch miſchievous FOXES to the Vines. In the early Times of Chriſtianity they were very numerous; they firſt ſprang from both Jews and Gentiles, when the Vineyard was full of tender Grapes, <hi>i. e.</hi> full of young Converts, and many ſimple Ones: Then the Devil was exceeding buſy every where to raiſe up, and animate Foxes of all Sorts and Sizes; and tho' one might obſerve ſome Difference in their Heads, yet it ſeems they could join their wicked Tails together, and by the Fire-Brands of Contention, Hereſy and Schiſm, ſet Fire to the ſtanding Corn of the Church of Chriſt. The erroneous Opinions, and Relicks of Knowledge, falſly ſo called, of the Jewiſh Rabbies, and of the many Sects among the Heathen Philoſophers, were carried over by Proſelytes into the Church; and theſe proved to be the Neſts and Holes which ingendred many Foxes, and which ſpread over all the ſpiritual Vineyards from Eaſt to Weſt, till at laſt Antichriſt gathered up theſe Fox-Skins, and tacked them together, to make himſelf a Garment; and moreover, put on an Out-Coat of a fierce Lyon-Skin, whereby he brought Deſolation upon the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>And when at the Time of the Reformation, the pure Church had wrenched her ſelf again out of his Clutches, and the bright Day of Truth ſhone forth, we preſently beheld again in another Spring-Time, new Fox-Holes breaking out; and it is hardly expreſſible what Number of Foxes, both great and ſmall, have appeared to ſpoil the <hi>New Vineyards</hi> of the Reformation: the Wounds the ſame has received, by the numerous Sects, and Schiſms, are not yet healed. What do I ſay, healed! if ever there was a Time ſince the Creation, in which it might be ſaid the Church <hi>crawls</hi> with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Kinds of Foxes, we muſt confeſs it is even in our Day. There ſcarce ever
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005299_0182_1016F8DA59C9BEE0"/>
was an Error in ancient Times, but what is now raked up again, and with the Addition of many new ones; no Opinions, tho' ever ſo abſurd, but what are broached, and ſome are influenced by them, and appear for their Defence; ſo that without mentioning old Errors, we have new ones turned out, Time after Time.</p>
                  <p>The Abuſe, or ill Uſe, that was made of Philoſophy, and natural Reaſon, was that accurſed Hole which the moſt of the Foxes crept out at, in the primitive Church, and who waſted and trampled it under Foot; the ſame is now opened afreſh, and wider than ever, and out of it come a Swarm of Atheiſts, of Libertines, and of Men whoſe Mouths ſpeak Blaſphemy, and teach Doctrines againſt the Divinity and Authority of the holy Scriptures, againſt God himſelf and many of his excellent Perfections, againſt his eternal Decrees, againſt the deep Myſteries of the Goſpel, and againſt almoſt an endleſs Number of the fundamental Doctrines of Truth. The Books which daily fill the World with Error, the hidden Holes and Corners, which hatch and breed Impoſtors the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers of them, and by which Means their erronious Opinions are ſpread, are almoſt endleſs; great and little Foxes do ſpring out of it, both without and within the Church. And if they are ſuffered to go on without Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Truth is not only threatned to be born down, but even with a total Subverſion. And have we not ſuffered Encroachment enough already? Firſt, By what is paſt Truth has received ſuch a Wound, that in many Reſpects it's almoſt incurable; many have embraced Lyes inſtead of Truth, at leaſt there is ſuch a general Lukewarmneſs, Coldneſs, and Indifferency, and in many Reſpects ſuch a Want of Love to Truth, which cannot be deſcribed. Secondly, True Piety in a great Meaſure has loſt her Luſtre and Tenderneſs; the inward Work of Grace in the Soul, and the eſſential Power of true Godlineſs, is ridiculed, and by ſome denied. Thirdly, The Worſhip of God is become like a mere Skeleton without a Spirit, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005299_0183_1016F8DE80B1D758"/>
Man, but the Life and Truth of it decays. Fourthly, Unity and brotherly Love, that grand Mark of true Chriſtianity, is ſadly depreſſed; Bitterneſs, Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, Parties, and Schiſms, have as it were rent the Body of the Church to Pieces. Fifthly, By theſe Means the Growth and farther Propagation of the Church, both within and without, is wonderfully check'd. Sixthly, Spiritual Fruitfulneſs is much retarded. Seventhly, The Bloom and ſhining Beauties of the Church decay. Eighthly, She looſes her Security and Strength. Ninthly, Yea how many Souls may be loſt by theſe Means, may be gueſſed at, from the natural Conſequences of Things, and the lamentable Condition the Church is now fallen into.</p>
                  <p>And O! if there were but a <hi>Zeal</hi> to take theſe Foxes; but alas in this too great a Slackneſs prevails.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Eccleſiaſticks are in many Reſpects too ſlack-handed in this; or perhaps their Hearts are not enough united to the Truth. Church-Diſcipline, by which ſuch Foxes ſhould be taken, is often ſadly neglected. It were to be wiſhed, that Preſbyteries and Synods, made it more their principal and grand Concern, to inquire into thoſe Things, while they waſte their Time about Things of much leſſer Moment; certainly we are often too careleſs and unwatchful againſt pernicious Foxes: thoſe who have a true Heart for Zion, are often obliged to ſit down and mourn in Silence becauſe of this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Particular Profeſſors have little or no Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or they have no Courage to oppoſe Foxes. What fine Diſputants had we in former Congregations, who dar'd to appear againſt Oppoſers, and cloſely to attack them; who were not afraid to thruſt forth their Hands into theſe Cockatrice-Holes; and who could divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over the Neſts of thoſe Vipers without Danger; and who dar'd to approach and enter into their Aſſemblies, and Meetings, and publickly lay hold of them in Debates! But this Zeal, and even ſuch a Capacity, is moſtly gone, or rarely to be found: The old antiquated Meekneſs &amp; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance towards the Remonſtrants is now again revived; a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005299_0184_1016F8E0076061C8"/>
Spirit of Lukewarmneſs and Indifference begins to prevail in our Day; every one enjoys his Opinion freely, without being ſo much as ſpoken againſt; and by this Means we ſuffer the Foxes to gain Ground, to the apparent Ruin of the Lord's Vineyard. O! what a miſtaken, as well as ſinful Practice is this? Firſt, This is running counter to the <hi>Command of Chriſt,</hi> who will have all Foxes to be taken, none excuſed, even to the ſmalleſt. Indeed where we our ſelves are miſ-uſed, in Charity we ought to be condeſcending and bear much; but in no wiſe when God and his ſacred Truths are abuſed; in this Caſe we muſt not let one Claw of them eſcape. Secondly, It is a moſt barbarous Kind of Clemency, as it is the Concern of immortal Souls, and our Vineyards have ſo many tender Grapes. Surely one of thoſe will weigh down a thouſand Foxes. Would you then ſpare the Foxes, and let ſo many precious Souls be deſtroyed? O! wo, wo unto ſuch a perverſe Pity. Thirdly, What will become of Truth? If you ſuffer them to go on at this Rate, they will ſpoil the whole Vineyard, they will tear every Thing up by the Roots in ſuch a Manner that no Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Truth will remain; and it may be the Lord himſelf will come, and make her a Deſolation by taking away her Fences, and leaving her to be trampled under Foot, and ruined by wild Beaſts; even as it befell the Eaſtern Church, when from one Degree to another, they fell from Truth, the Lord ſuffered her at laſt ſo to fall away, that there are no Remains of her to be found.</p>
                  <p>O! that the whole Body of the Chriſtian World were rouſed to look into this. Men are in a deep <hi>Lethargy,</hi> a profound Sleep of Indifferency hath ſeized upon the Church: In the mean Time, the Enemy is buſy, and is ſowing of <hi>Tares</hi> among the <hi>Wheat,</hi> Matth. 13.25. And it is high Time to awake, before theſe Tares choak the Wheat, and quite overcome it. Well then, in the firſt Place, don't think it a ſtrange Thing when you hear and ſee that there are Foxes in the Vineyard; it has always been ſo, the Lord Jeſus and his Apoſtles, have foretold this, 1 Cor. 11.10. <hi>For there muſt be alſo Hereſies among
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005299_0185_1016F8E336A1AFF0"/>
you, that they which are approved, may be made manifeſt among you.</hi> Secondly, Be always upon your Guard, that you may not be injured by Foxes; beware of their <hi>Perſons,</hi> beware of their <hi>Doctrines:</hi> This is the Leſſon &amp; Precept of Jeſus Chriſt, Mark 13.22, 23. <hi>For falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall ſhew Signs, and Wonders, to ſeduce if it were poſſible, even the Elect: But take ye Heed, behold I have foretold you all theſe Things.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Let no Man deceive you with vain Words,</hi> Eph. 5.6. Thirdly, To this End, don't content your ſelves to remain tender Grapes, like weak and young Children; ſuch as ſtand thus looſe are in great Danger, and more expoſed to be ſeduced and ruined. This St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> before all others, beguile <hi>unſtable Souls,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.14. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch in the Church, which are but Children, that they are <hi>toſt to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Sleight of Men, and cunning Craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> And further ſhews, that the only Mean againſt this is, to follow after Truth, that we may <hi>grow up into him in all Things which is the Head:</hi> And ſo come unto <hi>a perfect Man, unto the Meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.13, 14, 15. Well, follow ye this Advice then, that you may become Men and Fathers in Chriſt, that you may have your Senſes exerciſed, to diſcern <hi>both Good and Evil,</hi> Heb. 5.14. that you may not <hi>believe every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God: becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.1. Fourthly, Take heed that you do not by a ſluggiſh Patience, a ſinful Careleſneſs, and a lukewarm Indifferency, give Opportunity for Foxes to propagate and multiply in the Vineyard; but be always juſtly apprehenſive that Foxes are more miſchievous to the Church than Lions, and Hereticks more deſtructive than Perſecutors; for under Perſecutions the Church grows purer, and often flouriſhes and increaſes the more: <hi>Sanguis Martyrum eſt ſemen Eccleſiae;</hi> the Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church; but through Hereſy ſhe always grows worſe: they kill but the Body, but theſe murder
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005299_0186_1016F8E75AD9FE30"/>
the Soul: therefore never condeſcend in the leaſt in this Matter. This was the Sin of the Church of <hi>Thyatira;</hi> and this was that which Jeſus had againſt her, that they <hi>ſuffered the Woman</hi> Jezebel, <hi>which called herſelf a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs, to teach and ſeduce his Servants,</hi> Rev. 2.20. Therefore be ye not like unto them. Fifthly, On the contrary be diligent in your Duty; take theſe Foxes which are in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Firſt to this End, Overſeers of the Church, Elders and Deacons, Preſbyteries and Synods, ſhould all go Hand in Hand, above all Things to watch againſt the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Error. No Jarrings or Animoſities concerning other Things, ſhould ever be in the Way of ſo great and neceſſary a Work. Tho' there were ſome Difference in Judgment about leſſer Matters, yet if they agreed in the main and fundamental Points, then they ſhould alſo agree in this grand Article, with one Accord to watch againſt Foxes that creep in: It is for this End they are ſet, as Overſeers of the Vineyard; and for this End, the Care and watching over Souls, is commended to them by Jeſus Chriſt. O! be careful then, that you do not betray this great Truſt of your Maſter, in proving unfaithful to his Vineyard; for if but one Fox ſhould carry away a Soul as a Prey, the ſame he will require at your Hands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Yea every Profeſſor of the Church ſhould ſeek to be faithful in this Behalf. You are alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Take us the Foxes.</hi> Endeavour therefore after Ability for the Work: that you may diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſhood; and to diſcover thoſe that are in Error; and that you may be able to confute them and ſtop their Mouths, endeavour after Courage and Confidence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Duty. You ſhould not only have a Will to do, but Boldneſs to execute. Remember that you have a high Commiſſion, therefore fear no Man: He who hath commanded you, will ſtand by you. <hi>Be ye ſtrong, and the Lord</hi> of the Vineyard <hi>ſhall be with you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold, if after thou haſt done thy Duty, and there ſhould be ſtill Foxes remaining, the Lord however will preſerve his Vineyard; eſpecially he will watch over you
