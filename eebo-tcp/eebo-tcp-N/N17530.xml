            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE following ſmall collection was made, and is now produced, with a view to excite ſerious reflections on the unſatisfying and tranſitory na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of temporal enjoyments; and to promote a fervent concern for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of that felicity which will be ſure, complete, and permanent.</p>
            <p>Piety and virtue, even when ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly conſidered, are truly amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and appear worthy of our earneſt purſuit; but, when recommended by the lives and teſtimonies of eminent perſons, who have known the world, and experienced the emptineſs of its honors, wealth, and pleaſures, they derive additional weight, and conſtrain us to acknowledge, that indeed it is our greateſt happineſs to be religious.</p>
            <p>It is one of the many favors which a wiſe and gracious Providence hath conferred upon mankind, that in every country, and perhaps in almoſt every diſtrict throughout the earth, he has
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:022686_0003_0FB9F9656A55E400"/>
ſtationed ſome of his faithful ſervants, or returning prodigals, as witneſſes of his power and goodneſs, and as encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers to a life of true purity, piety, and beneficence.</p>
            <p>The following pages exhibit a few of thoſe ſtriking examples, which, in the quiet hour of reflection, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to arreſt the careleſs and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, to animate the ſincere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and to convince or diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thoſe who have been unhappily led to oppoſe the higheſt truths, and to forſake the fountain of all their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
            <p>May the conſideration of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances lead us to ſerious and timely reflections on our own condition, and to a profitable communion with the greateſt and beſt of Beings, our divine and unerring Monitor; by which we ſhall experience a growing concern, that the end of our exiſtence may be fully anſwered, and the favour of an Almighty Friend ſecured. May his gracious protection be witneſſed at the cloſe of our day, when the ſhadows of
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:022686_0004_0FB9F96D5860C8A0"/>
the evening ſhall approach, the glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities of the world be obſcured, and all its friendſhips and reſources be found unavailing.</p>
            <p>In that awful hour, this great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port will not only preſerve us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtreſſed with mournful retroſpects on the paſt, or with gloomy apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of what is to come, but will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the trueſt conſolation of mind, and enable us to look forward, with animating hope, toward thoſe happy regions of peace and joy, which ſhall then be allotted for our perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</p>

               <p>THE wiſe KING SOLOMON, who, at one ſeaſon of his life, had flattered himſelf with great enjoyments from the world; and who, better than moſt men, could compute their amount, gives us the reſult of his experience in theſe memorable lines: <q>I ſaid in my heart, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleaſure: and behold, this alſo is vanity. I ſaid of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is mad; and of mirth, what doth it? I made me great works, builded houſes, planted vineyards, made gardens and orchards, planted trees in them of all kind of fruit; I got me ſervants and maidens, alſo great poſſeſſions: I gathered me ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold, and the peculiar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of kings and provinces; alſo

men and women ſingers, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the ſons of men, as muſical inſtruments, and that of all ſorts. So I was great, and increaſed more than all that were before me in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and whatſoever mine eyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, I kept not from them: I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held not mine heart from any joy. Then I looked on the works which my hands had wrought, and behold, all was vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</q> After this repreſentation, he concludes all with, <q>Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man: for God ſhall bring every work into judgment, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</q>

Firſt, I ſend you all the thanks which my heart can conceive, or my words expreſs, for your many travails and cares for me; which, though they have not taken effect, as you wiſhed, yet my debt to you is not the leſs; but pay it I never ſhall in this world.

Remember your poor child, for his father's ſake, who loved you in his happieſt ſtate. I ſued for my life, but God knows, it was for you and your's that I deſired it: for know it, my dear wife, your child is the child of a true man, who in his own reſpect deſpiſeth death, and his miſhapen and ugly forms.

remitting her forfeitures, where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was poor, or otherwiſe meritorious. And, which was excellent, tho' unuſual, ſhe would temper her diſcourſes with religion, and ſtrangely draw concerned parties to ſubmiſſion and agreement; exerciſing not ſo much the rigor of her power, as the power of her perſuaſion. Her meekneſs and humility appeared to me extraordinary; ſhe did not conſider the quality, but the merit, of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhe entertained.

I muſt needs ſay, that her mind had a noble proſpect: her eye was to a better and more laſting inheritance than can be found below; which made her often deſpiſe the greatneſs of courts, and learning of the ſchools, of which ſhe was an extraordinary judge. Being once at Hamburgh, a religious perſon, whom ſhe went to ſee for religion's ſake, telling her, <q>It was too great an honor for him to have a viſitant of her quality come under his roof, that was allied to ſo many great kings and princes of this world:</q> ſhe humbly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q>If they were godly, as well as great, it would be an honor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but if you knew what that greatneſs was, as well as I, you would value leſs that honor.</q> Being in ſome agony of ſpirit, after a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meeting we had in her chamber, ſhe ſaid, <q>It is a hard thing to be faithful to what one knows: O, the

               <p>An illuſtrious and inſtructive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the power of religion upon the mind, in the time of ſickneſs and death, is JOHN, Earl of Rocheſter;
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:022686_0061_0FB9FA603375DFB8"/>
deſcendant of a great family, of a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral education, and great perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments; who, by his ſincere repentance, and happy death, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be (as it is judiciouſly expreſſed of him) <q>a very great man every way; a great wit, a great ſcholar, a great poet, a great ſinner, and a great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such he is deſcribed to be by two eminent men, who perſonally knew him, and attended him in his laſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And herein God has ſhown the freeneſs of his mercy, to ſave one who ſeemed to have made a covenant with death, and to be at an agreement with hell. Somewhat ſimilar to the apoſtle Paul, tho' before a blaſphemer, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, and injurious; yet obtained mercy, that in him Chriſt Jeſus might ſhow forth all long-ſuffering, for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to them that ſhould hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him to everlaſting life, 1 Tim. 1. ver. 13.16. ſo he was, as it were, ſtruck to the ground, by a light from heaven, and a voice of thunder round about him; inſomuch, that now the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:022686_0062_0FB9FA639D48BC10"/>
ſcales fell from his eyes, as they did from Paul's; his ſtony heart was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtreams of tears guſhed out, the bitter, but wholeſome, tears of true repentance.</p>
               <p>He had advanced to an uncommon height of impiety, having been an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate in the black cauſe of Atheiſm. He had raked too in the very bottom of the jakes of debauchery, and had been a ſatyriſt againſt virtue. But when, like the prodigal in the goſpel, he came to himſelf, great horror filled his mind, and forced ſharp and bitter invectives from him, againſt himſelf; terming himſelf the vileſt wretch that ever the ſun ſhined upon; wiſhing he had been a beggar, a link-boy, or a crawling leper in a ditch, or had lived in a dungeon, rather than have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord as he had done.</p>
               <p>Being at one time under great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mind, and his conſcience full of terror, he told the perſon who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that, <q>When, on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he had been arguing with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vigor againſt God and religion,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:022686_0063_0FB9FA6CDC377ED8"/>
than he had ever done in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before, and that he reſolved to run them down, with all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſpite in the world; but, like the great convert, Paul, he found it hard to kick againſt God:</q> for his heart was at that time ſtruck ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, that he argued as much for God and virtue, as ever he had done againſt them.</p>
               <p>He had ſuch tremendous apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Divine Majeſty, mingled with ſuch delightful contemplations of his nature and perfections, and of the amiableneſs of religion, that he ſaid, <q>I never was advanced thus far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards happineſs, in my life before, tho', upon the commiſſion of ſome ſins extraordinary, I have had ſome checks and warnings conſiderable from within; but ſtill ſtruggled with them, and ſo wore them off again. One day at an Atheiſtical meeting at the houſe of a perſon of quality, I undertook to manage the cauſe, and was the principal diſputant againſt God and piety; and, for my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:022686_0064_0FB9FA6EDBE10DF0"/>
received the applauſe of the whole company. Upon which my mind was terribly ſtruck, and I immediately replied thus to myſelf, <q>Good God! that a man who walks upright, who ſees the wonderful works of God, and has the uſe of his ſenſes and reaſon, ſhould uſe them to the defying of his Creator!</q> But tho' this was a good beginning towards my converſion, to find my conſcience touched for my ſins, yet it went off again; nay, all my life long, I had a ſecret value and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for an honeſt man, and loved morality in others. But I had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to myſelf an odd ſcheme of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which would ſolve all that God, or conſcience, might force upon me; yet I was not ever well reconciled to the buſineſs of Chriſtianity, nor had that reverence for the goſpel of Chriſt, which I ought to have had.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſtate of mind continued till the 53d chapter of Iſaiah was read to him, together with ſome other parts of the ſacred ſcriptures; when it
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:022686_0065_0FB9FA705BCF5E98"/>
pleaſed God to fill his mind with ſuch peace and joy, in believing, that it was remarkable to all about him.</p>
               <p>And he frequently deſired thoſe who were with him, to read the 53d of Iſaiah to him, upon which he uſed to deſcant in a very affectionate para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, applying the weighty ſentences thereof to his own humiliation and comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Oh! bleſſed God! can ſuch an horrid creature as I am, be accepted by thee, who have denied thy being, and contemned thy power? Can there be mercy and pardon for me? will God own ſuch a wretch as I?</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in the middle of his ſickneſs he ſaid, <q>Shall the unſpeakable joys of heaven be conferred on me? Oh! mighty Saviour! never, but thro' thine infinite love and ſatisfaction! O, never, but by the purchaſe of thy blood!</q> adding, <q>That with all abhorrence he did reflect upon his former life; that ſincerely, and from his heart, he repented of all that
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022686_0066_0FB9FA77B4046030"/>
folly and madneſs which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His faith was very remarkable in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Chriſtian religion; and he juſtly condemned <q>That fooliſh and abſurd philoſophy, which the world ſo much admired, propagated by the late Hobbes, and others, which had undone him, and many more of the beſt parts of the nation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His faith reſted alone on Chriſt for ſalvation, and therefore appeared to be of the right kind. He would often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat 'God to ſtrengthen his faith,' crying out, <q>Lord, I believe; help mine unbelief.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had a growing eſteem for the holy ſcriptures, and evidently ſaw their divine uſefulneſs and excellency: <q>For, having ſpoken to his heart, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that all the ſeeming ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities and contradictions, fancied by men of corrupt and reprobate judgments, were vaniſhed; and the excellency and beauty appeared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to receive the truth in the love of it.</q>

One night eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Tempter did make no little uſe of his fiery darts, by caſting upon him lewd and wicked imaginations: but, <q>I thank God,' ſaid he, 'I abhor them all, and by the power of his grace, which I am ſure is ſufficient for me, I have overcome them. 'Tis the malice of the Devil, becauſe I am reſcued from him, and it is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God that frees me from all my ſpiritual enemies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There are many proofs of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his faith, and the ſoundneſs of his repentance; among others, I ſhall ſingle out thoſe that follow.</p>
               <p>His hearty concern for the pious education of his children; <q>wiſhing his ſon might never be a wit, as he explained it, one of thoſe wretched creatures, who pride themſelves in ridiculing God and religion, denying

his being or his providence: but that he might become an honeſt man, and of a truly religious character, which only could be the ſupport and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his family.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He left a ſtrict charge to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in whoſe cuſtody his papers were, <q>to burn all his profane and lewd wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings (as being only ſit to promote vice and immorality, by which he had ſo highly offended, and ſhamed, and blaſphemed that holy religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he had been baptized) and all his obſcene and filthy pictures, which were ſo notoriouſly ſcandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He proteſted, <q>he would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a known ſin to gain a kingdom:</q> and ſent awful meſſages to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in iniquity.</p>
               <p>He adviſed a gentleman of character, who came to ſee him on his death-bed, <q>O! remember that you contemn God no more. He is an avenging God, and will viſit you for your ſins; and will, I hope, in mercy touch your conſcience, ſooner or later, as he has
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:022686_0069_0FB9FA8021BFF808"/>
done mine. You and I have been friends and ſinners together a great while, therefore I am the more free with you. We have been all miſtaken in our conceits and opinions; our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions have been falſe and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; therefore God grant you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And ſeeing the gentleman the next day, he ſaid, <q>Perhaps you were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged by my plainneſs with you yeſterday; I ſpake the words of truth and ſoberneſs.</q> And ſtriking his hand upon his breaſt, ſaid, <q>I hope God will touch your heart.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He laid his commands on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who attended him, <q>To ſpread abroad, and let all men know, if they knew it not already, how God had diſciplined him for his ſins, by his afflicting hand; that his ſufferings were moſt juſt, tho' he had laid ten thouſand times more upon him. That he had laid one ſtripe upon another, becauſe of his grievous provocations, until he had brought him home to himſelf. That his former viſitations
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:022686_0070_0FB9FA891AF57570"/>
had not had that bleſſed effect he was now ſenſible of. That he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſome looſe thoughts and ſlight reſolutions of reforming, and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be better; becauſe even the preſent conſequences of ſin were ſtill peſtering him, and were ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and inconvenient to him.

eminent for his knowledge in the work of his ſalvation.</p>
               <p>He manifeſted a principle of true life in his heart, by his love to all who were truly godly. And ſuch were his bowels of compaſſion, that he gave the tenth part of his yearly income to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable uſes.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I ALWAYS looked upon you to be a perſon of true virtue, and know you to have a ſound underſtanding; for, however I may have acted in oppoſition to the principles of religion, or the dictates of reaſon, I can honeſtly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, I have always had the higheſt veneration for both. The world and I ſhake hands; for I dare affirm, we are heartily weary of each other. O, what a prodigal have I been of that moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable of all poſſeſſions, Time! I have ſquandered it away with a profuſion unparalleled; and now, when the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a few days would be worth
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:022686_0077_0FB9FAA41F48D5B8"/>
the world, I cannot flatter myſelf with the proſpect of half a dozen of hours. How deſpicable, my dear friend, is that man who never prays to his God, but in the time of diſtreſs? In what manner can he ſupplicate that omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Being, in his afflictions, whom, in the time of his proſperity, he never remembered with reverence?</p>
               <p>Don't brand me with infidelity, when I tell you, that I am almoſt aſhamed to offer up my petitions at the throne of Grace, or to implore that divine mercy in the next world, which I have ſcandalouſly abuſed in this.</p>
               <p>Shall ingratitude to man be looked upon as the blackeſt of crimes, and not ingratitude to God?</p>
               <p>Shall an inſult offered to the king be looked upon in the moſt offenſive light, and yet no notice taken when the King of kings is treated with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity and diſreſpect?</p>
               <p>The companions of my former liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm would ſcarcely believe their eyes, were you to ſhow them this epiſtle.

They would laugh at me as a dreaming enthuſiaſt, or pity me as a timorous wretch, who was ſhocked at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of futurity; but whoever laughs at me for being right, or pities me for being ſenſible of my errors, is more entitled to my compaſſion, than reſentment. A future ſtate may well enough ſtrike terror into any man, who has not acted well in this life; and he muſt have an uncommon ſhare of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage indeed, who does not ſhrink at the preſence of God. The apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of death will ſoon bring the moſt profligate to a proper uſe of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. To what a ſituation am I now reduced? Is this odious little hut a ſuitable lodging for a prince? Is this anxiety of mind becoming the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Chriſtian? From my rank, I might have expected affluence to wait upon my life; from religion and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, peace to ſmile upon my end: inſtead of which I am afflicted with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and haunted with remorſe; deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by my country, and, I fear, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by my God.</p>

                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:022686_0079_0FB9FAA8E2D319A0"/>There is nothing ſo dangerous as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary abilities: I cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of vanity now, by being ſenſible that I was once poſſeſſed of uncommon qualifications, eſpecially as I ſincerely regret that I ever had them. My rank in life made theſe accompliſhments ſtill more conſpicuous; and, faſcinated by the general applauſe which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, I never conſidered the proper means by which they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played. Hence, to procure a ſmile from a blockhead whom I deſpiſed, I have frequently treated the virtuous with diſreſpect; and ſported with the holy name of heaven, to obtain a laugh from a parcel of fools, who were entitled to nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>Your men of wit generally look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves as diſcharged from the duties of religion, and confine the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the goſpel to people of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er underſtandings.

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:022686_0080_0FB9FAB1C2CA6E88"/>
they reckon that man poſſeſſed of a narrow genius, who ſtudies to be good.</p>
               <p>What a pity that the holy writings are not made the criterion of true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or that any perſon ſhould paſs for a fine gentleman in this world, but he that appears ſolicitous about his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the next.</p>
               <p>I am forſaken by all my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, utterly neglected by the friends of my boſom, and the dependants on my bounty: but no matter!

               <p>Col. JAMES GARDINER, a perſon of diſtinguiſhed character, was for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years of his life greatly addicted to ſenſual pleaſures. With a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of body, great flow of animal ſpirits, fine perſonal accompliſhments, and a large circle of polite connexions, he ſeemed as amply qualified as moſt men, to range in the field of animal enjoyments, and to extract from them all they were capable of yielding. Yet this complete ſenſualiſt, in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of his joys, bitterly experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <q>That even in laughter their hearts are ſorrowful, and the end of their mirth is heavineſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Being at one time congratulated, by ſome of his diſſolute companions, on his diſtinguiſhed felicity, and a dog happening at that time to come into the room, he could not forbear groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly, and ſaying to himſelf, 'Oh! that I were that dog!' Such was then his happineſs; and ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is that of hundreds more, who bear themſelves higheſt in the contempt of religion, and glory in that infamous
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:022686_0082_0FB9FAB57AF0D248"/>
ſervitude which they affect to call li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>His continual neglect of the great Author of his being, of whoſe perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he could not doubt, and to whom he knew himſelf to be under daily and perpetual obligations, gave him, in ſome moments of involuntary reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inexpreſſible remorſe; and this, at times, wrought upon him to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he reſolved he would attempt to pay him ſome acknowledgments. Accordingly, for a time, he did it; repeating, in retirement, ſome paſſages out of the Pſalms, and perhaps other ſcriptures, which he ſtill retained in his memory; and owning, in a few words, the many mercies and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances he had received, and the ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns he had made for them. But theſe ſtrains were too devout to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long in a heart as yet quite unſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified: for how readily ſoever he could repeat acknowledgments of the divine power, preſence, and goodneſs, and own his follies and faults; he was ſtopt ſhort by the remonſtrances of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:022686_0083_0FB9FABFD02E1ED0"/>
as to the flagrant abſurdity of confeſſing ſins he did not deſire to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, and of pretending to praiſe God for his mercies, when he did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to live in his ſervice, and to behave in ſuch a manner as gratitude, if ſincere, would plainly dictate.</p>
               <p>At length it pleaſed the Author of all good, ſo to viſit his ſoul, that hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joining therewith, he became a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere penitent, and continued the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his days, a bright and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy example of virtue and goodneſs. His gratitude to God for his ſingular deliverance, his continued ſenſe of the friendſhip of ſo gracious a Being, and his unſhaken hope of eternal happineſs, filled his heart with unutterable peace and joy; and cauſed abundant compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for thoſe unhappy perſons who prefer the tranſient amuſements of a day, to the higheſt of all enjoyments, the perpetual love and favor of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty friend. Many of his letters, and particularly the following ones to his wife and to an intimate acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, teſtify his favored ſtate of mind,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:022686_0084_0FB9FAC14F804AD0"/>
and how great was his enjoyment in communion with the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I bleſs God, I was never better in my life; and I wiſh I could be ſo happy as to hear the ſame of you; or rather (in other words) to hear that you had obtained an entire truſt in God. That would infallibly keep you in perfect peace; for the God of truth hath promiſed it. Oh! how ought we to be longing to be with Chriſt, which is infinitely better than any thing we can propoſe here! To be there, where all complaints ſhall be for ever baniſhed: where no moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhall ſeparate between God and our ſouls. And I hope it will be ſome addition to our happineſs, that you and I ſhall be ſeparated no more; but that, as we have joined in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the praiſes of our glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer here, we ſhall ſing them in a much higher ſtrain thro' an endleſs eternity.</q>—Speaking of one of his children, who, he had heard, made a commendable progreſs in learning, he

expreſſed his ſatisfaction in it, and adds, <q>But how much greater joy would it give me, to hear that he was greatly advanced in the ſchool of Chriſt! Oh! that our children may be but wiſe to ſalvation; and may grow in grace, as they do in ſtature!</q>

                  <q>What would I have given this day, upon the road, for paper, pen, and ink, when the Spirit of the Moſt High reſted upon me! Oh! for the pen of a ready writer, and the tongue of an angel, to declare what God hath done this day for my ſoul! But, in ſhort, it is in vain to attempt it: all that I am able to ſay, is only this, that my ſoul has been for ſome hours joining with the bleſſed ſpirits above, in giving glory, and honor, and praiſe, <q>unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</q> My praiſes began from a renewed view of him, whom I ſaw pierced for my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.

echoed back praiſe to the Moſt High.</q>

               <p>Such were the elevations of his mind; yet, there are many who will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to cenſure them as the flights of enthuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>But when we conſider the ſcriptural phraſes <q>of walking with God; of having communion with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt; of Chriſt's coming to them that open the door of their hearts to him, and ſupping with them; of God's ſhedding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his love in the heart by his Spirit; of his coming with Jeſus Chriſt, and making his abode with any one that loves him; of making us glad by the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</q> and a variety of other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent expreſſions, we ſhall ſee reaſon to judge very favorably of the declarations contained in theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>If habitual love to God; firm faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; a ſteady de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the divine promiſes; a full perſuaſion of the wiſdom and

goodneſs of all the diſpenſations of Providence; a high eſteem for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the heavenly world; and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere contempt for the vanities of this, can properly be called enthuſiaſm, then was Colonel Gardiner indeed one of the greateſt enthuſiaſts our age has produced; and in proportion to the degree in which he was ſo, he muſt be eſteemed one of the happieſt of mankind!</p>
               <p>
                  <q>How often (ſays the ingenious and pious Grove) are good thoughts ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, heavenly affections kindled and inflamed!

ſenſe of God; of his authority over us; of the laws he hath ſet us; of his eye over us; of his hearing our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; aſſiſting our endeavours; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over our concerns; of his being to judge, and reward or puniſh us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate, according to what we do in this. Nothing will give a man ſuch a deteſtation of ſin, and ſuch a ſenſe of the goodneſs of God, and of our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to holineſs, as a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and firm belief of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion. Nothing can give a man ſo calm a peace within, and ſuch a firm ſecurity againſt all fears and dangers without, as the belief of a kind, wiſe Providence, and of a future ſtate. Integrity of heart gives a man courage and confidence that cannot be ſhaken. A man is ſure that by living according to the rules of religion, he becomes the wiſeſt, the beſt, and the happieſt creature that he is capable of being. Honeſt induſtry, the employing of time well, a conſtant ſobriety, an undefiled purity and chaſtity, with a quiet ſerenity, are the beſt preſervatives
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:022686_0090_0FB9FADBF41BD800"/>
of life and health; ſo that take a man as an individual, religion is his guard, his perfection, his beauty, and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This will make him a light in the world, ſhining brightly, and enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many round about him.</p>
               <p>Thus religion, if truly received and ſincerely adhered to, would prove the greateſt of all bleſſings to a nation. But, by religion, I underſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the receiving of ſome doctrines, tho' ever ſo true, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of them, and engaging to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, not without zeal and eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. What ſignify the beſt doctrines, if men do not live ſuitably to them; if they have not a due influence upon their thoughts and their lives? Men of bad lives, with ſound opinions, are ſelf-condemned, and lie under a highly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated guilt.</p>
               <p>By religion, I do not mean an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward compliance with forms and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, in going to church, to prayers, to ſermons, and to ſacraments, with an external ſhow of devotion; or, which is more, with ſome inward forced good
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:022686_0091_0FB9FADD1D4DADB0"/>
thoughts, in which many ſatisfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while theſe have no viſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on their lives, nor any inward force to ſubdue and rectify their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, paſſions, and ſecret deſigns. Thoſe cuſtomary performances, how good and uſeful ſoever, when underſtood and rightly directed, are of little value when men reſt on them, and think becauſe they do them, they have acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves of their duty; tho' they continue ſtill proud, covetous, full of deceit, envy, and malice. Even ſecret prayers, the moſt effectual means, are deſigned for a higher end; which is to poſſeſs our minds with ſuch a conſtant and preſent ſenſe of divine truths, as may make theſe live in us, and govern us, and draw down ſuch aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as to exalt and ſanctify our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>So that, by religion, I mean ſuch a ſenſe of divine truth as enters into a man, and becomes a ſpring of a new nature within him; reforming his thoughts and deſigns; purifying his heart; ſanctifying and governing his
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:022686_0092_0FB9FAE020BB97C8"/>
whole deportment, his words as well as his actions; convincing him that it is not enough, not to be ſcandalouſly vicious, or to be innocent in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, but that he muſt be intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, uniformly, and conſtantly, pure and virtuous, animated with zeal to be ſtill better and better, more eminently good and exemplary.</p>
               <p>This is true religion, which is the perfection of human nature, and the joy and delight of every one that feels it active and ſtrong within him. It is true, this is not arrived at all at once, and it will have an unhappy alloy, hanging long even about a good man; but, as thoſe ill mixtures are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual grief of his ſoul, ſo that it is his chief care to watch over, and to mortify them, he will be in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al progreſs, ſtill gaining ground upon himſelf; and as he attains to a degree of purity, he will find a flame of life and joy growing up in him. Of this I write with a greater concern and emotion, becauſe I have felt this the true, and indeed, the only joy which

                  <p>Thoſe who truly fear God have a ſecret guidance from a higher wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than what is barely human, namely, the Spirit of Truth and Wiſdom, that doth really and truly, but ſecretly, prevent and direct them. Any man that ſincerely and truly fears Almighty God, and relies, and calls upon him for his guidance and direction, hath it as really as a ſon hath the counſel and direction of his father; and tho' the voice be not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, nor the direction always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, or diſcernible, to ſenſe, yet
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:022686_0096_0FB9FAF6B034C260"/>
it is equally as real as if a man heard the voice ſaying, <q>This is the way, walk in it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this ſecret direction of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is principally ſeen in matters relating to the good of the ſoul; yet it may alſo be found in the concerns of this life, which a good man, that fears God, and begs his direction, ſhall very often, if not at all times, find.</p>
                  <p>I can call my own experience to witneſs that, even in the external actions of my whole life, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſappointed of the beſt guidance and direction, when I have, in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſincerity, implored the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret direction and guidance of the Divine Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>The obſervation of the ſecret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Spirit of God in the heart, is an effectual means to cleanſe and ſanctify thy heart, and the more it is attended to, the more it will be converſant with thy ſoul, for thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.—In the midſt of thy diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties it will be thy counſellor; in
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:022686_0097_0FB9FAF81F4CF080"/>
the midſt of thy temptations it will be thy ſtrength, and grace ſufficient for thee; in the midſt of thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles it will be thy light and thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter: only beware thou neglect not the voice of this Spirit; it may be, thy neglect may quench it, and thou mayeſt never hear that voice more.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible for thee to enjoy that which muſt make thee happy, till thou art deeply ſenſible of thy own emptineſs and nothingneſs, and thy ſpirit thereby brought down and laid in the duſt.—The Spirit of Chriſt is an humbling ſpirit, the more thou haſt of it, the more it will humble thee; and it is a ſign that either thou haſt it not, or that it is yet over-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by thy corruptions, if thy heart be ſtill haughty.</p>
                  <p>Watch, therefore, the ſecret per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, and diſſuaſions of the Spirit of God, and beware thou quench it not, nor grieve it; be ſure thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this voice—this wind that blows where it liſts, if ſhut out, reſiſted,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:022686_0098_0FB9F7735D2F5040"/>
or grieved, may haply never breathe upon thee again, but leave thee to be hardened in thy ſins; but if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and obeyed, thou ſhalt be ſure to have it thy monitor and director, upon all occaſions; when thou goeſt out, it will lead thee, when thou ſleepeſt, it will keep thee, and when thou awakeſt, it will talk with thee.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Of the viciſſitude of temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of his own experience thereof, he gives a ſtriking teſtimony in the following lines.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I HAVE, in the courſe of my life, had as many ſtations and places as moſt men. I have been in almoſt continual motion; and altho', of all earthly things, I have the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired reſt, and retiredneſs, and fixed, private ſtation, yet the various chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that I have ſeen and found, the public employments, that, without my ſeeking, and againſt my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have been put upon me, and many other interventions, as well private as public, have made a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:022686_0099_0FB9F774DB0FB818"/>
my experience, that I have had no continuing city, or place of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. When I had deſigned unto myſelf a ſettled manſion in one place, and had fitted it to my convenience and repoſe, I have been preſently conſtrained by my neceſſary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to leave it, and repair to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: and when again I had thoughts to find repoſe there, and had again fitted it to my conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet ſome other neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences have diverted me from it; and thus, by ſeveral viciſſitudes, my dwellings have been like ſo many inns to a traveller, tho' of ſome longer continuance, yet almoſt of equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability and viciſſitude. This unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledneſs of ſtation, tho' troubleſome, yet hath given me a good and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moral; namely, that I muſt not expect my reſt in this lower world, but muſt make it as the place of my journey and pilgrimage, not of my repoſe and reſt, but muſt look fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that happineſs. And truly, when I conſider, that it hath been
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:022686_0100_0FB9F77D1C3D4F20"/>
the wiſdom of God Almighty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thoſe worthies, which he left us patterns to the reſt of mankind, with this kind of diſcipline in the world, I have reaſon not to complain of it, as a difficulty or an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but to be thankful to him for it as an inſtruction and document, to put me in remembrance of a better home, and to incite me to make a due proviſion for it; even that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reſt which he hath provided for them that love him; and by pouring me thus from veſſel to veſſel, to keep me from fixing myſelf too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this world below. But the truth is, did we conſider this world as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us, even as wiſe men, we may eaſily find, without the help of any ſuch particular diſcipline of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that this world below neither was intended for, nor indeed can be, a place of reſt, but only a laboratory to fit and prepare the ſouls of the children of men, for a better and more abiding ſtate; a ſchool, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and train us up in habits of
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:022686_0101_0FB9F77E17BCD3F8"/>
patience and obedience, till we are fitted for another ſtation; a little narrow nurſery, wherein we may be dreſſed and pruned, till tranſplanted into a better paradiſe. The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al troubles and diſcompoſures, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and calamities, that attend our lives; the ſhortneſs and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vexations occurring in them; and finally, the common examples of death and mortality of all ages, ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and conditions of mankind, are a ſufficient inſtruction to convince reaſonable men, who have the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and patience to conſider and obſerve, that we have no abiding ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here. And on the other ſide, if we will give ourſelves but the leiſure to conſider the great wiſdom of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who orders every thing in the world to ends ſuitable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable; the excellence of the ſoul and mind of man; the great advances and improvements his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of; the admirable means, which the merciful and wiſe God hath afforded mankind, by his
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:022686_0102_0FB9F77F6CDBAC50"/>
works of nature and providence, by his word and inſtruments, to qualify him for a nobler life than this world below can yield, we ſhall readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that there is another ſtate, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther city to come, which it becomes every good, and wiſe, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, to look after, and fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for. And yet, if man look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the generality of mankind, with a due conſideration, they will appear to be like a company of diſtempered people. The greateſt part of them make it their whole buſineſs, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for a reſt and happineſs in this world, they make theſe vain acqueſts of wealth and honor, and the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and pleaſures of this world, their great, if not their only, buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and happineſs; and, which is yet a higher degree of frenzy, they eſteem this the only wiſdom, and judge the careful proviſion for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the folly of a few weak, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, fanciful men: whereas it is truth, and in due time it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, that thoſe men, who
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:022686_0103_0FB9F780DD118F10"/>
are moſt ſolicitous for their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their everlaſting reſt, are the only true wiſe men, and ſo ſhall be acknowledged by thoſe that now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them.</q> Wiſ. 5.4. <q>We fools accounted his life madneſs, and his end to be without honor. How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the ſaints!</q>

               <p>I BELIEVE the goodneſs of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the friendſhip you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways borne me, will receive with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the laſt office of your friend. I am in health enough of body, and, thro' the mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt, well diſpoſed in mind. This I premiſe, that you may be ſatisfied, that what I write proceeds not from any fantaſtic
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:022686_0104_0FB9F78BE0918E10"/>
terror of mind, but from a ſober reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of what concerns myſelf, and an earneſt deſire to do you more good after my death, than my example (God of his mercy pardon the badneſs of it!) in my life-time may do you harm. I will not ſpeak aught of the vanity of this world: your own age and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will ſave that labor; but there is a certain thing that goeth up and down the world, called religion, dreſſed, and pretended fantaſtically, and to purpoſes bad enough, which yet, by ſuch evil dealing, loſeth not its being. The great good God hath not left it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a witneſs, more or leſs, ſooner or later, in every man's boſom, to direct us in the purſuit of it, and for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of thoſe inextricable diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and entanglements with which our own frail reaſon would perplex us. God, in his infinite mercy, hath given us his holy word, in which, as there are many things hard to be underſtood, ſo there is enough plain and eaſy, to quiet our minds, and to direct us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our future being. I confeſs to

God and you, I have been a great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecter, and, I fear, deſpiſer of it; God, of his infinite mercy, pardon me the dreadful fault! But, when I retired myſelf from the noiſe and deceitful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the world, I found no true comfort in any other reſolution, than what I had from thence; I commend, from the bottom of my heart, the ſame to your, I hope, happy uſe. Dear Hugh, let us be more generous than to believe we die as the beaſts that periſh; but with a Chriſtian, manly, brave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, look to what is eternal. The only great and holy God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, direct you to an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py end of your life, and ſend us a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſurrection. So prays your true friend,</p>

               <head>The following Account of an affecting, mournful exit, is related by Dr. YOUNG, who was preſent at the melancholy ſcene.</head>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:022686_0106_0FB9F78F33D702E8"/>THE ſad evening before the death of that noble youth, whoſe laſt hours ſuggeſted theſe thoughts, I was with him. No one was there but his phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and an intimate whom he loved, and whom he had ruined. At my coming in, he ſaid, <q>You and the phyſician are come too late.—I have neither life nor hope. You both aim at miracles. You would raiſe the dead.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Heaven, I ſaid, was merciful, or I could not have been thus guilty. What has it not done to bleſs, and to ſave me? I have been too ſtrong for Omnipotence! I have plucked down ruin.</q> I ſaid, the bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer—<q>Hold! hold! you wound me!—That is the rock on which I ſplit—I denied his name.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Refuſing to hear any thing from me, or take any thing from the phyſician, he lay ſilent, as far as ſudden darts of pain would permit, till the clock ſtruck. Then with vehemence; <q>Oh, time! time! It is fit thou ſhouldſt thus ſtrike thy murderer to the heart.—
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:022686_0107_0FB9F79342FBDEC8"/>
How art thou fled for ever!—A month!—Oh, for a ſingle week! I aſk not for years. Tho' an age were too little for the much I have to do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On my ſaying, We could not do too much: that heaven was a bleſſed place —<q>So much the worſe. 'Tis loſt! 'tis loſt!—Heaven is to me the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt part of hell!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after I propoſed prayer. <q>Pray you that can. I never prayed. I cannot pray—Nor need I. Is not heaven on my ſide already? It cloſes with my conſcience. Its ſevereſt ſtrokes but ſecond my own.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His friend being much touched, even to tears, at this (who could forbear? I could not) with a moſt affectionate look, he ſaid;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Keep thoſe tears for thyſelf. I have undone thee.—Doſt weep for me? that's cruel. What can pain me more?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here his friend, too much affected, would have left him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:022686_0108_0FB9F79CF3F0C4A8"/>
                  <q>No, ſtay, thou ſtill may'ſt hope; —therefore hear me. How madly have I talk'd! How madly haſt thou liſtened, and believed! but look on my preſent ſtate, as a full anſwer to thee, and to myſelf. This body is all weakneſs and pain; but my ſoul, as if ſtung up by torment to greater ſtrength and ſpirit, is full powerful to reaſon; full mighty to ſuffer. And that, which thus triumphs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the jaws of immortality, is, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, immortal.—And, as for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, nothing leſs than an Almighty could inflict what I feel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I was about to congratulate this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, involuntary confeſſor, on his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature; when he thus, very paſſionately:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>No, no! let me ſpeak on. I have not long to ſpeak.—My much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured friend! my ſoul, as my body, lies in ruins; in ſcattered fragments of broken thought. Remorſe for the paſt throws my thought on the future. Worſe dread of the future
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:022686_0109_0FB9F7A28F563560"/>
ſtrikes it back on the paſt. I turn, and turn, and find no ray. Didſt thou feel half the mountain that is on me, thou wouldſt ſtruggle with the martyr for his ſtake; and bleſs heaven for the flames;—that is not an everlaſting flame; that is not an unquenchable fire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How were we ſtruck! yet, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſtill more. With what an eye of diſtraction, what a face of deſpair! he cried out:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My principles have poiſoned my friend; my extravagance has beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gared my boy; my unkindneſs has murdered my wife!—And is there another hell?—Oh! Thou blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet indulgent, LORD GOD! Hell itſelf is a refuge, if it hides me from thy frown.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after, his underſtanding failed. His terrified imagination uttered hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors not to be repeated, or ever forgot. And ere the Sun (which I hope has ſeen few like him) aroſe, the gay, young, noble, ingenious, accompliſhed, and moſt wretched Altamont expired.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:022686_0110_0FB9F7A36F96F008"/>If this is a man of pleaſure, what is a man of pain? How quick, how total is the tranſit of theſe Phaetontia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des! in what a diſmal gloom they ſet for ever! how ſhort, alas! the day of their rejoicing! For a moment they glitter, they dazzle. In a moment, where are they? Oblivion covers their memories. Ah! would it did! Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſnatches them from oblivion. In the long-living annals of infamy their triumphs are recorded. Thy ſufferings ſtill bleed in the boſom (poor Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont!) of the heart-ſtricken friend: for Altamont had a friend. He might have had many. His tranſient morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might have been the dawn of an immortal day. His name might have been gloriouſly enrolled in the records of eternity. His memory might have left a ſweet fragrance behind it, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the ſurviving friend, ſalutary to the ſucceeding generation. With what capacities was he endowed, with what advantages, for being greatly good. But with the talents of an angel, a man may be a fool. If he judges amiſs in
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:022686_0111_0FB9F7A4DBC0B898"/>
the ſupreme point, judging right in all elſe, but aggravates his folly; as it ſhows him wrong, tho' bleſſed with the beſt capacity of being right.</p>
               <p>Such, ſo fatal, when abuſed, are the greateſt bleſſings of heaven. Heaven grant his agonies were an expiation of the paſt; not a preſage and ſad ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the future. That his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving companions and admirers may never ſuffer the ſame, give me leave to ſpeak to them, while this affecting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is (or might be) in their ſight.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Ye ſtaunch purſuers of pleaſure, opening in full cry on its burning ſcent! who run yourſelves out of breath, health, credit, eſtate, and often life, after that you cannot catch! for a moment ſlacken your ſpeed, and cool the fervor of your chaſe. It is a friend that calls, and he is his own, that hears.</p>
                  <p>If there is a ſcene on earth, in which you can find greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, than in that to which you have been invited, do not come; if there is not, indulge me in a few words,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:022686_0112_0FB9F7AE80181028"/>
which may not be ſoon forgot: at leaſt, they will recur to your thoughts, they will recur to your feeling hearts, when your preſent jovial chaſe is over; when pleaſure is no more.</p>
                  <p>It will be grateful to your friend deceaſed, whom you were always willing to oblige, if, with his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, you remember his faults; for then you will not forget your own; but read, in his deep diſtreſs, a ſtrong caution againſt them. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords not the rock on which he ſplit, a ſolid baſis for your ſafety? Has he not well remarked where miſchief lies? See you not the wreck of that gallant firſt-rate? or rather, is he not a beacon, lighted up by kind Providence, to guide you ſafe thro' the dangerous voyage of human life?</p>
                  <p>He once, as you now, imagined himſelf, in this life, immortal. Was he not miſtaken? He has taken his final flight; whither, who can tell? If you continue yours in the ſame fatal track, who is he that cannot
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:022686_0113_0FB9F7B0201E55F8"/>
tell where the folly muſt end? Smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, transfixed, when moſt ſecure, from the moſt towering heights, he dropped at once into depths of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, not to be fathomed by man. In gaiety of heart defy not the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Are there not more arrows in the ſame quiver? and are not you as fair and tempting a mark? more tempting, if unadmoniſhed, and mounting ſtill over his forgotten tomb. And whom dare you tempt? an Archer that never miſſed his mark.</p>
                  <p>But you, from your gay pavilion, embowered in roſes, ſee no threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening proſpects; no dangers of death.—Oh, Sirs! Death delights to lie hid in thickets of roſes! How often the gayeſt fall firſt in his ſnare! yet even this is too gentle, too mild, to anſwer the good will of Heaven; it cannot keep the world in awe.</p>
                  <p>What uncommon fortitude is needful to bear proſperities unhurt? It is now ſunſhine with you; and
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:022686_0114_0FB9F7B19F52E008"/>
you think all is well. It is the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of indulgence—but ſeaſons will change. You that are now all ſocial comfort, gathered cloſe in glad clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and (like embodied birds of paſſage, bound for new climes) on your impatient wing for new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights! what will you do, when each of you, ſevered from the reſt, an unexperienced, unexpected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe, lies ſorely pained; dreading worſe; none to converſe with, but the two greateſt ſtrangers, his own heart, and Him who made it; and neither at peace with him? Say, ye ſtrangers to care, and abounders in mirth! what will he do, when he finds himſelf ſtill ſubſiſting in a ſtate, where none of thoſe pleaſures, for which alone he wiſhed to ſubſiſt, can poſſibly any longer ſubſiſt with him? when the dark matter at the centre will not be more foreign to him, than that which now beats high in his pulſe, and fluſhes in his cheek; and ſtings him on to ſchemes, that laugh at ſuch lectures as theſe?
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:022686_0115_0FB9F7B31DC51030"/>
when he finds himſelf led by the ſoft hand of pleaſure, to thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal gates, which ſhe herſelf will never, never, never enter?</p>

               <p>'IT is impoſſible to conſider the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of a player, and to compare it with the Chriſtian profeſſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſenſible that there is nothing more unworthy of a child of God, and of a member of Jeſus Chriſt than this employment. I do not ſpeak of the groſs irregularities only, and the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute manner in which the women ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the ſtage, becauſe thoſe who juſtify plays, always ſeparate thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders from them in their imagination, tho' they are never ſeparated in effect. I ſpeak only of that which is abſolutely
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:022686_0118_0FB9F7C0E5C8D618"/>
inſeparable from them. 'Tis an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, the end of which is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of others; where men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men appear on a theatre, to repreſent the paſſions of hatred, anger, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, revenge, and chiefly that of love. They muſt expreſs them as lively, and as naturally, as is poſſible for them; and they cannot do ſo, if they do not, in ſome manner, excite them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and if their ſouls do not take all the changes which we ſee in their faces. Thoſe then who repreſent a paſſion, muſt be, in ſome meaſure, touched with it whilſt they repreſent it; and it is not to be imagined, that they can preſently efface from their minds that impreſſion, which they have voluntarily excited in it, and that it does not leave a great diſpoſition to that ſame paſſion which they have been ſo willingly ſenſible of. Thus, plays are, even in their nature, a ſchool, and an exerciſe of vice, ſince it is an art in which one muſt neceſſarily excite in himſelf vicious paſſions. And if we conſider that the lives of players are
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:022686_0119_0FB9F7C3EEEEE868"/>
employed in this exerciſe, that they paſs it entirely, either in learning by themſelves, or rehearſing among one another, or in repreſenting to ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors the image of ſome vice; and that they have ſcarce any thing in their minds but theſe follies; we ſhall eaſily ſee, that it is impoſſible to join this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment with the purity of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus, it muſt be owned, it is a profane employment, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Chriſtian; and that, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, it is not allowable for others to contribute to maintain them in a profeſſion contrary to Chriſtianity, or to authorize it by their preſence.'</p>
               <p>—'Thoſe deceive themſelves extremely, who think that plays make no ill impreſſion on them, becauſe they do not find them excite any formed evil deſire.—There are many degrees before one comes to an entire corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind, and it is always extremely hurtful to the ſoul, to deſtroy the ramparts which ſecured it from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="unknown:022686_0120_0FB9F7C96A1160F0"/>One does not begin to fall when the fall becomes ſenſible; the failings of the ſoul are ſlow, they have progreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and preparations; and it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that we are overcome by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations only by our having weakened ourſelves in occaſions, which ſeemed of no importance; it being certain that he who deſpiſes little things, ſhall fall by little and little.'</p>
               <p>—'It muſt not be imagined that theſe wicked maxims, of which plays are full, are not hurtful, becauſe people do not go there to form their ſentiments, but to divert themſelves; for they do not fail of making impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, notwithſtanding, without being perceived.—The opinion that the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera of honor is ſo great a good, that it muſt be preſerved, even at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of life, is what produces the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal rage of the gentlemen of France. If thoſe who fight a duel were never ſpoken of but as fools and madmen, as indeed they are; if that phantom of honor, which is their idol, was never repreſented but as a chimera and a
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:022686_0121_0FB9F7CA727B0CC8"/>
folly; if care was taken never to form any image of revenge, but as of a mean and cowardly action; the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which men feel upon an affront would be infinitely weaker; but that which exaſperates and renders it the more lively, is the falſe impreſſion, that there is cowardice in bearing an affront. Now, it cannot be denied, that plays, which are full of theſe evil maxims, do greatly contribute to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify that impreſſion, becauſe the mind being by them tranſported, and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of itſelf, inſtead of correcting thoſe ſentiments, abandons itſelf to them without reſiſtance, and delights to feel the motions they inſpire, which diſpoſe it to produce the like upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.'</p>
               <p>—'Plays and romances not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indiſpoſe the ſoul for all acts of religion and piety; but they give it a diſguſt, in ſome meaſure, to all ſerious and ordinary actions. As nothing is repreſented in them but gallantries, or extraordinary adventures, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are far diſtant from ſuch as are
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:022686_0122_0FB9F7CBF6592D70"/>
uſed in ſerious affairs, one inſenſibly takes from them a romantic diſpoſition of mind: the head is filled with heroes and heroines, and women ſeeing the adorations which in them are given to their ſex (of which they find the image and practice in companies of diverſion, where young men talk to them what they have learned in romances, treating them as nymphs and goddeſſes) have that ſort of life ſo much impreſſed on their minds, that the little affairs of their family and houſewifery become inſupportable to them; and when they return to their houſes, with minds thus evaporated and filled with theſe follies, they find every thing there diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and eſpecially their huſbands, who, being taken up with their affairs, are not always in the humor of paying them thoſe ridiculous complaiſances which are given to women in plays, in romances, and in the romantic life.'</p>
               <p>—'The need which men have of diverſion, is not by far ſo great as is thought, and it conſiſts more in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:022686_0123_0FB9F7CF2174C608"/>
or in cuſtom, than in a real neceſſity. Thoſe who are employed in bodily labor, have only need of a bare ceſſation from it. Thoſe who are employed in affairs toilſome to the mind, and but little laborious to the body, have need to recollect themſelves from that diſpoſition which thoſe ſort of employments naturally cauſe, and not to diſſipate themſelves yet more, by diverſions which extremely engage the mind. It is a jeſt to fancy that one has need to paſs three hours in filling the mind with follies at a play. Thoſe who find in themſelves this need, ought to look on it, not as a natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but as a vice of cuſtom, which they muſt cure by ſerious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.'</p>
               <p>—'If the ſoul abandons itſelf to theſe falſe pleaſures, it loſes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of ſpiritual ones, and finds nothing but diſguſt for the word of God. Theſe are thoſe ſour grapes, of which the prophet ſays, <q>They benumb, and ſet on edge, the teeth of whoſe who eat them.</q>—That is to ſay, when
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:022686_0124_0FB9F7D8B8E231E0"/>
one feeds himſelf with the vain plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, the ſpiritual ſenſes become ſtupified, and incapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, or underſtanding, the things of God. Now, among the pleaſures of the world, which extinguiſh the love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the word of God, it may be ſaid, that plays and romances hold the firſt rank; becauſe there is nothing more oppoſed to truth, and that the Spirit of God, being a ſpirit of truth, can have no part with the vanities of the world.'</p>
               <p>—'There will be many perſons ready to aſſert, that they have never received any ill impreſſion from come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but I maintain, either that they are very few in number, or that they are not ſincere, or that they have not reflected enough on themſelves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, or elſe, that the only reaſon why comedy has not corrupted their manners, is, becauſe it found them already corrupted, and that they had left it nothing to do in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:022686_0125_0FB9F7DA216437C0"/>—'God does not impute to us the coldneſs which proceeds from the withdrawing of his light, or merely from the heavineſs of this body; but, no doubt, he imputes to us that, to which we have contributed, by our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence and our vain diverſions. It is his will that we ſhould eſteem nothing ſo much as the gracious gift, which he has made us of his love, and that we ſhould be careful to preſerve it by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it nouriſhment. This command he has intimated to us in the perſons of the prieſts in the ancient law, whom he ordains always to maintain the fire on the altar, and to take care to put wood upon it, every day in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This altar is the heart of man, and every Chriſtian is the prieſt, who ought to be careful to nouriſh the fire of charity on the altar of his heart, by putting wood every day upon it; that is to ſay, maintaining it by the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine things, and by exerciſes of piety. Now, if thoſe who go to plays have yet any ſenſe of piety, they cannot diſown that plays deaden, and
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:022686_0126_0FB9F7DCF19AC2D0"/>
entirely extinguiſh devotion; ſo that, they ſhould not doubt, God judges them extremely guilty, for having made ſo little account of his love, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of nouriſhing and endeavouring to augment it, they have not feared to extinguiſh it by their vain diverſions; and that he will impute to them as a great ſin, the abatement or the loſs of their love to him. For if a diſſipation of the goods of the world, and of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riches, by luxury and gaming, is no little ſin, what muſt be judged of a diſſipation of the goods of grace, and of that precious treaſure the ſcripture ſpeaks of, which we ought to purchaſe, by the loſs of all the goods, and all the pleaſures of this life?</p>

               <head>The following are taken from the Works of WILLIAM LAW.</head>
               <p>CAN any one think that he has a true Chriſtian ſpirit, that his heart is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it ought to be, whilſt he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting himſelf with the poliſhed lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, profaneneſs, and impure diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſtage? Can he think that he is endeavouring to be holy, as Chriſt is holy, to live by his wiſdom, and be full of his ſpirit, ſo long as he allows himſelf in ſuch entertainments? For there is nothing in the nature of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian holineſs, but what is contrary to the ſpirit and temper of theſe diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.'</p>
               <p>—'You own that God has called you to great purity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; that you are forbid all <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh talking</hi> and <hi>filthy jeſtings,</hi> as expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you are forbid ſwearing; and that you are told to <hi>let no corrupt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation proceed out of your mouth;</hi> and yet you go to a houſe of corrupt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; you hire perſons to entertain you with ribaldry, profaneneſs, rant,

and impurity of diſcourſe, who are to preſent you with poiſonous ſentiments, and lewd imaginations, dreſſed up in elegant language, and to make wicked, vain, and impure diſcourſe more lively and delightful, than you could poſſibly have it in any ill company. Is not this ſinning with a high hand, and groſsly offending againſt the plaineſt doctrines of ſcripture?'</p>
               <p>—'As prejudices, the force of education, the authority of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the way of the world, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of great names, may make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe, ſo the ſame cauſes may make people act, againſt all ſenſe and reaſon, and be guilty of practices which are utterly inconſiſtent with the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their religion.'</p>
               <p>—'The pleaſures and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of people are certain means for judging of the ſtate of their minds: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can pleaſe or affect us, but what is according to our nature, and which finds ſomething within us that is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to itſelf.

If impure ſpeeches, if wanton amours, if wild paſſions, and immoral rant, can give us any delight, is it not paſt all doubt, that we have ſomething of all theſe diſorders in our nature?'</p>
               <p>—'There is no doctrine of our bleſſed Saviour that more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all Chriſtians, or is more eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to their ſalvation, than this:' <q>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</q> 'Now take the ſtage in its beſt ſtate, when ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired tragedy is upon it; are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant paſſions of diſtracted lovers, the impure ravings of inflamed heroes, the joys and torments of love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined

               <p>—'All people who enter into theſe houſes of entertainment, or contribute the ſmalleſt mite towards them, muſt look on themſelves, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been, ſo far, friends to the moſt powerful inſtruments of ſenſuality, and to be guilty of contributing to an open and public exerciſe of ſplendid impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and profaneneſs. When we encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage any good deſign, either with our conſent, our money, or preſence, we are apt to take a great deal of merit to ourſelves; we preſently conclude that we are partakers of all that is good and praiſe-worthy in it, of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that ariſes from it, becauſe we are contributors towards it. A man does not think that he has no ſhare in ſome public charity, becauſe he is but one in
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:022686_0132_0FB9F7F7747FD1C0"/>
ten thouſand that contributes towards it; but if it be a religious charity, and attended with great and happy effects, his conſcience tells him that he is a ſharer of all that great good to which he contributed. Now, let this teach us, how we ought to judge of the guilt of encouraging any thing that is bad, either with our conſent, our money, or our preſence. We muſt not conſider how much our ſingle part contributes towards it, how much leſs we contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute than ſeveral thouſands of other people; but we muſt look at the whole thing in itſelf; and whatever there is of evil in it, or whatever evil ariſes from it, we muſt charge ourſelves with a ſhare of the whole guilt of ſo great an evil.</p>
               <p>—'People of faſhion and quality have great advantage above the vulgar; their condition and education give them a livelineſs and brightneſs of parts, from whence one might juſtly expect a more exalted virtue. How comes it then, that we ſee as ill morals,

It is becauſe <hi>the politeneſs of their lives, their courſe of diverſions and amuſements, and their ways of ſpending their time</hi> as much extinguiſh the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and light of religion, as the groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ignorance of the dulleſt part of the world.—Any way of life <hi>that darkens our minds, that miſemploys our underſtanding, that fills us with a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling ſpirit, that diſorders our paſſions, that ſeparates us from the ſpirit of God,</hi> is the ſame certain road to deſtruction, whether it ariſes from ſtupid ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rude ignorance, or polite pleaſures. Had any one, therefore, the power of an apoſtle, or the tongue of an angel, it would be well employed, in expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſſuading from, thoſe ways of life, which wealth, corruption, and politeneſs, have brought among us.
